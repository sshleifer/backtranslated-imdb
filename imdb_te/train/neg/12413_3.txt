I do not say this movie is terrible, because I looked worse, but not half good. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I did not really understand where I was going and what I was going to do. When the film ended, I missed my head. I will look at the credits and eventually see if they have something else, but after the credits are over, it's there. I felt like I was moving away from a weak plot point to another or with no transformation. <br /> <br /> The development of the alphabet is very poor. I could not figure out when someone was angry or someone retaliated against it. Half of the characters should just be drunk, rocks, mentally challenged or I can not say if they have a bad actor to portray them. Since most other films have since been portrayed, this role makes it easier to develop, when it portrays a singer on a rock band, which is periodically trying to come out of the effort of a child suffering abuse, or a heroin addict. Stereotypes are easy to describe, and why most bad movies describe more of the stereotypical roles. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>? <br /> <br /> I have never really missed any of them really, because I really had little time to guess that I really did not have the opportunity to know any of them. <br /> And the last but Sadie's singing. It is painful. The music she supports is not a prize winner, but it usually sinks through the screenings released from Sadie's vocal strings. I promise that there is a point in the film that I am singing for at least 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The whole film is confusing. Characters are ill-developed, Georgia's acting is wood and tight, where Sadie's character is in a bad position and pose to another, no story behind or behind. The music is unbearable, and you can think of any good reasons to watch this movie unless you have thirst for movie pain.
