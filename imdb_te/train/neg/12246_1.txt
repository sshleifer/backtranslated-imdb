*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** If reviewed based on a film based on a lonely soul, you might think that you are watching an animal's horror movie. The following is the plot. A documentary filmmakers go to an island to paint a documentary about surfing with surfing or surfing. (I live in South Africa, it is released as "Blood Surf"). It has some interesting idea behind it, if it is explored, the picture gets slightly better. Nevertheless, the film's blood surfing episode is low, because their documentary is interrupted by a large salt water crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of the film is that if the food is eaten by the crocodile, it feels no one is eating. Many people in the movie have only shot the victim, which is considered sharp, but the dialogue in the film is ridiculous because of the most suspicious nature. Another factor that is really boring about the film is that they introduce roles that are completely inappropriate for the movie. Some people introduce pirates, they are added to a 10-minute merciless short film. <br /> Acting is said to be normal. It probably would have been nice if they did not have a terrible script to work from. Not all of them have a terrible effect. Every single person appears to be a watery sarcastic and thus, one of these actors did not have any effect on me. <br /> The crocodile is more than 31 feet. And this quantitative sense is well illustrated by the crocodile's clear duplicate provided in the film. The crocodile death at the end of the film is quite ridiculous and it turns a stomach. With a huge bold image, the protagonist declares that the protagonist falls on a hill and is planning a crocodile to pull himself on a lucky-spaced spike on the bottom of the crocodile. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> For all this, this is a picture that I'll tell you how bad it is. Perhaps a terrible script and seemed to be a good idea during the worst time of the lowest budget, which has come to create a really awful film.
