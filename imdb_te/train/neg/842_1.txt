This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, he is rare. This film is just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not explain how idiotic. Sorry michael. Cinematography is dark. All other actors are unknown. When it looks, it's like a soft romance, but does not have nudity or hot scenes. The film has sexual allegations, because it's about an underground S & M killer. This performance is very bad except for parts of Michael Madsen. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he paid well for this secular film. This is not something I should be proud of. It's not even a B image for cable, it's like a f and never shown.
