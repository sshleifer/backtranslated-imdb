The author directs the "innovation travel" of his "origins" in the South Tobacco industry because he believes that the "bright leaf" of his (entirely and necessarily forgotten) film is his ancestor. It is not, and in reality he realizes nothing but a little bit interest in this completely silly and self-indulgent glorified home film that is suitable for performance at the drunken family reunion (director's) not for commercially - non-commercial release. A good reminder of why mainstream films are not so many independent films - they are boring, abusive and not interested in anyone, but the director and his / her immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
