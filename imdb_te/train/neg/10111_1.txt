Terrible acting, bad story line, cheesy makeup, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen an even worse picture in my life, I decided fast forward to see if anything happening in 5 minutes is happening ... it's not. (Apart from a nice breast shot) the film is clearly depicted in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse is used at least 90% sets. You'll see this red chair in many "locations". If you want to rent at least one office building and an apartment, it's not a warehouse that resonates with your actor's dialogue. (Note to the producers) Small office space and monthly apartment is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite versatile and reliable) If you spend your money on renting these people I hope you back again ... you will need your money back. I only cost $ 2.99 to rent this night and I feel ripped off.
