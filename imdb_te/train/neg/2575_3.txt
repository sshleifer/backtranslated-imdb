It does not really match up to the Castle of Castle. Lupine is not funny or incomplete or hyperactive. The scenery and music is uninspired and the plot is not just interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this 'un' is the nudity provided by Fuji (only in the uncensored version). It helped to make some of the scenes in the thick of the masala. CoC set up the image for a formidable villain and some imaginable set-pieces. Places in TSoTG are not very clear or attractive. <br /> <br /> Genealogy, Goimman and Jigen have also given the entertainment that looks good on this occasion. They just look like the filling of contractual responsibility by appearing. <br /> The dolby stereo sound is on DVD full frame. This is a very small amount of extra trucks. But that's a very interesting thing. No chapter is selected on the disc or timecode displayed in the embedded player. Even if you still skip the next scene number using the remote.
