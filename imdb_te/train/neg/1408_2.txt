I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have a feeling that I'm just joking with the director / writer audience: "Let's see how much vacuity (viewers) can survive ... Dialogues are empty, ... There is a minimum of scenarios, in a few moments, photography is really cool." Some satire lines are semi-funny, but this "comedy" I laughed for myself to see the movie until the end If you could lift yourself over this director's defeat ... you will find some of the legends (Mickey Manojlovic, Alexander Berkek), and Emir's son Stairl Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: such a great director is very bad! Emir Kusturcaa still needs to make young and top-rated movies.Instead, this low-budget is for me-my-private theay He chose the tune of the movie, with a contemptuous attitude towards the global trends and the neglect of his older fans.
