I do not even know where to start. "It's about family." It should be the worst of the conversation that was heard in a "horror" movie, although it was not a horror movie! Hog !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a good actor. He has to stop the dead token person in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, man co-authored "Battle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He has some talent. Also, Lilly Taylor should adhere to Indie films. She's not here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a sexy star. There is no room for legitimate acting for her. I'm serious. One of the worst films I've ever seen, Ever.
