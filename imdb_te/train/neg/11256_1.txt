What time wasted! Within 3 minutes, I tried to sit through the "Sky Captain" every six times, and every time, "Sky Captain" - this is a clear boring movie, it's terrible, acting for the first time, I wanted to love the science fiction, I love the Cliff Hangers and the fairy tale of Flash Gordon and Metropolis I have written about Sherry Lansing about how I would appreciate or not, and my name was Sherlock Lynching about the use of the Blue Screen for screening in 1993. 10 years later, , But when she painted this dog her green The Blue Blue screen effect was not forgotten, but it was not a full film. Judea or Jolie was not a wonderful actor but it reminded me of Pelthro's performance high school effort. Very bad - it can be Ed, but only a talented director. Funny thing, the captain of the ski captain will also get to work, after this killing. It is not art to trade!
