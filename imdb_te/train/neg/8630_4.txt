I'm going to discuss this episode, which has some virtues about it. For example, after giving Jim's negative view of the Sun's past clocks in "House of the Sun", we will see Jean's contents and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> There is an element in this story, which is very uncomfortable for me. Earlier, in the scene where Jen appeared on his hands and shirt, Sun's father was a wealthy man of wealthy and illegal practices. I thought he was also a mob boss, perhaps even; Kobs work in Korea as in almost every other country in the world, so this is a reasonable opportunity. However, in this episode, Sun's father is actually a boss of the Korean automotive company (or a top executive agency), and Jin is physically a government official (which is actually going to be murdered). <br /> <br /> I'm very much upset about this because I work in the automotive industry m. But I would say that this kind of thing is spectacularly dangerous and racist to indicate that it is in Korea. ; These large-scale, large companies such as Hyundai or Kia (which are actually similar to the company of the fictitious car) actually operate with these mafia-like methods, rather than any ordinary automotive company West. I do not believe that the writer will have colonial writing to write the story and there are no conflicts in Korea. It's exceptional "American Purchase!" Campaign, foreign car companies, criminalizing, betrayal, and third-world outfits.
