Pet Seemary, is a nice 80's horror movie, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King copied almost all the ideas from the director (the king was jedged before the book was written). <br /> <br /> The cat, the ground, everything was copied, plagiary but, as Stephen Kind was a famous American writer, He can be completely out of the matter, making this budget clear due to the huge difference between the Italian films (and Hosted in part, it is also the worst ...), but the original idea was, I repeat, it is the Italian director AVATI Tell the world <br /> <br />
