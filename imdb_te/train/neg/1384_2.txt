Jet Li is one of the best handmade handlers of the world. He has been over 20 years old and he is humiliated in the film for others. While he's big in Asia, he's almost unknown here in America. <br /> <br /> Black mask needs a breakout image for him, but it is frighteningly failing. First of all, it has been dubbed. It may have the value of camp (dubbing is not even close and it is flat in the tone), which appears to be inappropriate for a simple movie viewer. Secondly, director Daniel Lee makes an awful work. He cuts the scenes very fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans watch Jet Li's movies for exciting martial arts. However, the director modifies the scene that you do not even know who's half the time! At other times, a scene was executed (ie, a hole in the floor of the Lee jeep began to cut, the two of the lights and the love interest in the car after the Badguis captured their pistols!), So they were completely ridiculous (Killer CD ROMs?) Give false stars! Li, machine gun cutting and more, the movie is less likely to create a movie-one-shot movie. Well, since the included rap / techno music is inappropriate. The plot has the possibilities but the film is abused by cartoon characters away from any credibility in the film. And are you really confident that Simon does not recognize, because he is really half-mask? <br /> <br /> If you want to see the image of Jet Lee, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple. This confused chaos time is totally waste ... 2/10
