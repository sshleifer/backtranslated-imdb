I caught "Lost Lost" in New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I have some high hopes for this movie. Sadly, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is very lame. Bad lighting and camera work, the film is less than great editing and music. <br /> <br /> The FX shorts have good stories and technical production is equal to FX! You can no longer get away with the cool FX in the shorts, "405" is 5 years after a big splash. At least that's a little quick, cool and even a little funny! You can not say anything about it "source lost."
