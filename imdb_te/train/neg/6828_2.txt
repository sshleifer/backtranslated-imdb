In a film following a struggling actor, by a struggling actor, it did not provide any help to Chris Klein. He fights for the character and the mentors to be memorable by managing the shallow script to perform. The story is there, but it's all in the beginning, and the basic failing to show the middle and end of the opening, and the director remains eating his shoulders while the last hour and three quarters are really feeling while nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this, a bright light manages to stand on top of his seemingly averagely talented co-stars Fred Durst and semi-good job of bringing the backward character of the legend of life. Fredd may see how Fred can recreate it when working with a large number of cast, but in the future I'll be looking for him.
