<br /> <br /> In this film, two attractive women have no need to fight for Luke Wilson or even a 'villain' equal. The female actresses are very beautiful, and the only reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I think she is 'funny', and Luke is also around uglier / dorkier / stupid friend, but well, we get it. <br /> Women's leadership has never been more than 5 minutes. What we want to do is they are sobbing and crying and fighting over and on 2 boys who described on Friday 13th Friday. Dead * @ $ #
