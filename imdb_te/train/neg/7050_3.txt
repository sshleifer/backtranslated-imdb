A movie overseas, unclear and stars Catherine Zeta-Jones is not as good as it is because of the self-reference. Such as 'Blue Juice', a surprise enthusiast in a 1995 Brit, is more likely to find surfers (for dumb American, anyway) Cornwall, England. This may be you thinking if you are built for an amusing, agility less comedy. If only. The film is a bit smaller than ninety minutes, but it is inexorable. A sort of 90s British version of 'Grease' without dancing is the easiest way to explain it, but it improves the sound than it is. No, the best way to take it is to be a slightly slice-of-life set in a small town. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the role of Chloe, a Surfing Instructor, JC (Sean Pertwei; remembering him). Pertvi is actually the star of the film, and his character is a small group of devotees devoted to a surfing legend, inevitably the oddball group that needs the free spirits who live in movies like this. In this case, a journalist, a former nightclub DJ who is a record producer and in a helplessly scene scene, drug dealer who wants a fat man who has spent a rocking course is always the best thing to do for him. To be honest, everything that's happening in 'Blue Juice' is imaginable because it is set in one place and reflects customs and practices, I'm not well known, but it's surprising or interesting, or with characters. Comedy is, however, very speculative and tired. A mile can absorb set-ups and tell almost the conversation (in the American form of course) before actors. The relationship between JC and Chloe is every bit Hackney. She wants to grow up; He wants them to stay as childless young people they started. He feared he would lose face with his gang; She thinks she likes her. You got the idea. If I worked hard to focus on 'blue juice', I felt that it was not an hour and a half in my life.
