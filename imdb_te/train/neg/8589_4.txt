First I would like to post this post by saying I'm a fan of Star Wars movies ... I do not read books, play games, wear lingerie or eat cereals (if one). I'm a fan of movies. </ P> <p> In the film, let us see how much the film gives. If you take the film itself, it does not compare to the terrible ancestors (EP1, 2), you can not say how wonderful it is. Horrible acting, contrived landscapes (such as R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI serious chase sequences have little human touch), horrible acting, and well-known plot holes - how good for all of the terrible errors in the script? Anakin has no internal disarray; It seemed like a switch flipped and he suddenly was all bad. I have not been interested in the film until the last 20 minutes (destroyed the Frankenstein scene by "New!"). When you screen the screen with amazing CGI effects and when you fill in the gaps with a liners accurately and worse, it may be more rare and should not be a great movie. For a film with such a "dark" tone, there is plenty of flexibility in the speech of all characters. <br /> When I get to a question: From the beginning of the film to the end, what is the reality of the importance of urgency and importance?
