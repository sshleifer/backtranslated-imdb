This is not a movie. This is a collection of bad-thinking and poorly constructed scenes that do not appear to be unedited results of a 10-year-old Deed with a small DV camera. In fact, I was the hardest girl in the train corridor - with a hairstyle, dead pane stroke, a theory with the iPad and nardy torque - perhaps it burned her in the creative phase. <Br /> If you do more than ten minutes of doing it, I've made an effort to match what you have seen in the context of the European Artist Psychology. This is the true and complete waste of time, money and film made by William One-Shot Beedine Crunch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is now a representative of what most goes for humanity. <br /> What's next? Six directors fired in a social contact in the Wal-Mart Snack counterpart?
