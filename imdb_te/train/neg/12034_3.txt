The story of the film is simple-minded as its morality: go find a girl, marry her, she lives with her happy after her. Though the film has some good moments and turns, it remains on the surface of what is shown in the picture with the same storyline. <br /> <br /> The Baptist / Mormon fight is probably just caked about touching only on the surface. A very interesting story was a mixed couple. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a film that does not require much attention, you can teach your child a modest and conservative. Values ​​(along with advanced tolerance stuff ;-)), you will be fine with this image. May be shown at a family-home evening ...
