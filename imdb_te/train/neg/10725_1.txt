In response to other comments, I think 'I'm very fond' - and the first 30 minutes of this film are nothing but endless villains of the 90s. There is a ban on somewhere and a film will not be viewable. It's not reliable, even if it does not adapt to Hollywood production. <br /> Furthermore, the intelligent plot (in Russia, the majority of the people, the older women and our vodka drinking) are so many visuals that I am unnecessarily for the second package of Roilides. <br /> <br /> For spoilers - <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money, do not worry with good Russian cinema.
