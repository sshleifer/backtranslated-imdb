I know no one cares, but I do. The film is historic. It is the unity of the two heroes from two great seventy science fiction films. Well, a great, and one too bad. One of the greatest is really great, in fact it is the best. The bad one is really bad, actually it's the worst. Great's "Star Wars" and its star Mark Hamill, Ake "Luke Skywalker", goes to "Voltes" (Weiss) and Vegas (Lead). A whole lot of adventures will eventually get back to it. (I guess you can call him if he's into cars fixing "Lube Skywalker"). Also he meets a hooker with a golden heart, and I end up playing Kim Milford, the role of the hero from the seventy sci-fi cult film "Laserblast", which I've made in reference to earlier, the worst science fiction film ever made. Milford Heel is heading to steal his cars. I realize no one cares about this conference with great science fiction heroes, but I do. And I should say that it is one of the best / worst films ever. Mark Hamill's performance requires power, and the hooker role played by All Pots in the plot requires a wide range of jedi training and any role that I have never seen, may be the most annoying character ever. But it's a fun movie to watch late at night, weekend day, or weekend too late. While it is looking for something, it is not yet visible, yet at the same time, it's utterly advantageous, like free form jazz. And it does. And it's not great, but you can not say it's not fun, for an hour and a half you may feel ripped off, but you will not feel cheated. So off your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations, and the power will be with you, as always.
