A woman who turns into a stolen car in Central Park is a very low budget policing policy film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder, and their only clue is on the tattoo on her hand. Although RKO is released, it has an independent product adopted by Studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with some exceptions - include young and unnamed Jack Lord, director Edward Montgene and cameraman William Steiner - completely unknown, and it shows. Performances do not pass all over the sub-par and high school training film, there is no chemistry between the hard and the choppy and the main actors in the direction. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it has some good points. Shooting in New York City, and the ultra-low budget of the film, it has been decently carried out in a shootout at a very high "Naked City", a dark dungeon, and some are intelligent, which gives a sand valuation like research methods. Otherwise, it's not a lot of writing home. For a glimpse at the semicolor sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and the old car buffs '30s and' 40s cars will be ecstatic to see the streets. > <br />
