I'm Frosty Returns and this one dislikes. Both films are incomprehensible with poorly written characters and bad voices. This was worse because the voice was not complete but Frost returned they unraveled snowman. Frosty Winter Wonder Land is great and original hearty drama. The only good thing about this film is the snowman classic 60s and the funny line and firststream window walked through humming when he talked about the things that were untrue, what he was doing was bad but the rest was badly written and badly animated and I got the plot. I saw the DVD cover in the library 2 or 3 years ago and did not paint up to this year, because I saw the pictures in the film a little touching but I played this movie. It's just a hassle like DVD poorly art characters and just horrible about what's going on. I have seen tonight and I fell asleep on the whole thing (I'll always see when I see something while sleeping) but this film is total boring <br /> Total rating: Grade -C <br /> <br /> It's frosty returns and the other one A unique rip-off. The 4th sequel is like a home alone, I thought it was a very good movie but it was great at home alone 3. But it's like a bad home 3 and 4 people hate this way. When my sister came into my room to see 2 minutes and a half of it because she did not see it, she walked away like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her as the 3rd frosty returns. Plain terrible!
