I agree that I am a fan of the original theatrical production. I have never seen a film version of the film until late in the cab and I have brought my memories back and looked at me because I worship the original presentation. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst translation of a Broadway show that has never been made. They changed the story, they changed their songs, and they lost their soul. I was expecting the trip down the memory lane, singing amazing extraordinary touching music and mirror, at Ballet, and Hello Twelve, hello thirteen. Not at all! The songs and the external storyline (Hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) did not exist and "injected" the play "inexpensive", they confused the story. The original had its own enough paths. If you're a fan of the original Broadway show, do not panic. Sorry I wasted my time, and my memories melted and looked at this trip.
