R. R. Kalikis is trying to tell you the story of Ram Gopal Verma Nizabd in a delicate way. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and an Indian cook in London. He is very dominant and proud and respect his job as any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. <br /> <br /> The Hyderabadi biryani, who made her Hyderabadi, send her the Bianne, and they immediately begin to meet and eventually fall in love with each other? Amitabh 65 and Tabu 35? No probes! But a hitch! Tabu's father Paresh Rawal! Couples decide to meet the father for their marriage approval. However, Amitabh learns that Tabu is too young to his father. And the problems start ?? Three actors are performing the performance-wise. The script's script is very tight and interesting. The image's conversations are impressive. But you feel that your stomach is not filled properly. Comedy is sometimes not understood properly. <br /> <br /> There is nothing musical to sing except the title track. Camera work is fine. Director R Bally was better off from this script. But in the second half he will be confused. Father's "Satyagraha" scene was frustrating. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan in that scene are appropriate. <br /> <br /> All in all, the cheese cub must have more sugar!
