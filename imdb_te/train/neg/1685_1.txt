These children, aged 14-16, want to see the film (you are allowed only 18 people). They have heard that this is a horror film and they look good when they see it. I feel very sad kids can not see what a good picture is, and what a bad movie. This is one of the worst films I have seen in months. Every scene you've seen in this movie is copied from another movie. And the end? It's the open end ... why? Because it's impossible to come up with a good en for such a stupid story. The film is designed to scare you, and if you're a bit brisk and learn about music, you'll know when you're scared. <br /> When I finished my film, when I turned to my friend (bit to bit) I said the money was in vain, and some stupid kid looked me bizarre. Today I'll make an Oscar with my goldfish's home-video, only if I use the right marketing.
