I would not normally say that it is not worth watching an image, but it is definitely an exposed situation. The only real upside down of the film is Cornelius Sharp, appealing, and the fact that this film is really short. <br /> <br /> The storyline is unreliable in this movie and is almost out of the movie somewhere. None of the characters are distant interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why Sean Connery agrees to do this movie, but he definitely needs to issue it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see this movie is if you're a hard-sees Canary fan and want to see everything he did. <br /> <br /> Despite my review (or other reviews on this site), if some miracle is to see this, I hope you enjoy more than I do. Did. Thank you for reading.
