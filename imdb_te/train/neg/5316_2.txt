This thick dog throw a bone. Very bad ... can be seen anyway. Cole (Ross Hagen) is a galactic bad guy, invented by a vibrant space ship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol handles the crash lands on the ground to steal a shuttle. An unstoppable android killer will be sent to bring dead or alive back to the villain. John Phillip Law plays a wild / park ranger, alerting these two visitors from far away. Costumes are bad and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent essentially took the money. The act of the law shows only sign. So bad it is almost funny. Cast also: Diana Ortelli, PJ Souls and Don Wild Smith.
