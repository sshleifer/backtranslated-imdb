Most people think this is a good movie but I do not agree with them. At the start of the film, some people died from a space ship and aliens crashed on the ground, but for no reason. Moreover, it's in the dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can not hear the sound. <br /> <br /> A few days later, the hunter came to the earth but no one had sent him signals, he did not know what had happened on earth, so there was a contradiction. Finally, the hunter finds the headmaster of the aliens and died for no reason. He did not live on earth, there was nothing in his business about the things that happen here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is very small and it is not clear to the critics about the story. <br /> <br /> At the end, this is a good film.
