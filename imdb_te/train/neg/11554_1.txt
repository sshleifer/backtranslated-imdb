The film is embarrassing to film making. I can not believe I'm not listed as a comedy - it's not funny. The script is worse, but casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... pretty much everyone ... Wow even harder ... Wow. The number one rule of comedy is here "try to be fun". Canada has a lot of talented actors in drama and comedy - none of which is used in the film. Canadian nepotism and casting directors can permanently help bad filmmaking in Canada. I realized that this technologically is a "US" movie, but look at the director, actors, location etc. I saw this thing in Bravo - they should be shocked that they bought the rights to show the film. Again, there are so many great films, they're not aired and they show this trash.
