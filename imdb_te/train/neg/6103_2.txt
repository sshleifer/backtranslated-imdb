To be honest, I am amazed by the positive votes obtained by the film. The film is busy with its 81-minute lifetime, and the audience will suffer the whole way. In fact there are some positive moments in the film; Charlie Spradling gives a good performance. She has been given a beautifully enthusiastic dialogue and she's pretty cool. Scott Valentine (boyfriend in Mary's family ties), on the other hand, is a pretty tough watch. I highlighted the performance of his performance by killing a Chinese woman lying on the beach ... Give me a break. Also, Valentine plays us with an unpleasant and enthusiastic role of a vampire who suffers from sadness (to see Denis Duff's more convincing in the suffered vampire "Bloodstorm: Subdivisions 4"). The film moves very slowly and just poses positively and honestly, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This film can be honestly recommended only for Charlie Spradling's die hard fans (which is I, and I still have a tough time watching it!).
