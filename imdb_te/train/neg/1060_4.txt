OK, so it's written in 1996 before 9/11, so you might be giving some credit to the terrorists and thinking that the CIA Director will do a plot to launch this destructive plane from the sky. World, the top. That's it. Good thing. Acting ... is fair. Plots ... crazy. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM No one thought what to do when a plane was contaminated. Do you have a manual "pests" for the officers and how to have them? As Katrina has later seen, the proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem. But they have a plan. It should not be sent to Iceland and then sent to Mauritania. If the virus is in the air, the plane door opens, where "shooters" stand without any protection? In fact, did anyone ever try to shoot his legs? I was a sucker, I started watching a movie that I had just finished watching, but it was a waste of time and a lot of imaginative. To see all the ads, this is a plus.Why it is a good example of watching a very small network TV.
