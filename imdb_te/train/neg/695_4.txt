I'm a very big hero of this film and one of the earliest 80s of the early films has seen the dark fans of dark movies die. Well, I rented it and my attention to "dark fumes day", "Friday 13" and "Prom Night" kept my attention until the darkest of the darkest films ever went, but the film was correct, with the above mentioned, as well as the real enthusiasm and characters Not in the story. The characters I found were unfortunate in the film, and the storm sprinkled around and in the course of his real climate, the Weirddo Guy with his face cutting him. Another film was a dirty scandal with Jean Jacket, in which he played more roles in the character, so this guy acted as another loser when he was not asleep when he was sleeping with his girlfriend and later dumped in part and cut off a waste of time until then, I was finally disappointed with her. When real recognition of the killer became recognizable as he had gone, I became laughed, but it was clear, and he revealed himself a real coincidence, as well as his real intentions. The film should look at at least one at least, but some hard hard to find a list of collectors should not spend your hard earned money.
