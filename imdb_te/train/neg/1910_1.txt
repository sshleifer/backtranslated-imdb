I tried to see this so-called comedy, but it's very hard to endure. It's a bad, narrow-minded, cliche-ridden movie. Definitively not funny, but very boring and annoying, indeed. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time - and I'm not saying, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> From 10 points to 1.
