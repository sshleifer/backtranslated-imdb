Average movie with poor music to take into consideration the music related to music ??? Ordinary script & Direction with full blenders. Salman Khan is in his regular acting. The time that Ajay played was his scene, particularly his styles as rock star. Asin is just a performance. Overall, I thought I would waste my money in the film. Salman Khan did not come to maturity compared to Aamir Khan 10 years ago. With the exception of "Mon Ko Koi", the film has many songs in all boring. The most important song to impress the UK music sponsor is quite unpredictable. "Khanabash" can be easily understood by an English music sponsor. The other film that I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", which was a good slow-moving love story and average music in good direction
