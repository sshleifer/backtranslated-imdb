The box for me for "die for" breathes me - a shirtless handy guy and some smile and promise of sex. <br /> <br /> Thomas Arklie (Simon), is easy on the eyes, but laughs and has less sexiness - the pair, Mark and Simon allegations have been together for many years, but the character is not interesting. It is difficult to imagine how they care about each other. Error is in script, but not shows; Both actors can do their best with what they have given. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an interesting movie about gay relationships and AIDS, "Parsing Glines" is very good.
