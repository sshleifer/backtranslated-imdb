I'm Brazilian, but all of those items are too much. The music, too many parties, is very contrary to the good lives of the main characters (which is not too sad) and the subject of the city shown by the director. Everything is very fake for me: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It just sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. I have to be honest: I've got a little bit of fun, but do not be attracted by good music, sexy and fake lives with parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world do people suffer from diarrhea, deep sorrow, and ADs? I liked Carid's mother's phone call and talk about music with the musicians and the Spanish people.
