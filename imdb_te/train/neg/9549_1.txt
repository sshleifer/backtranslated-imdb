I was surprised when I was playing John Wad Dr. Falken. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall bad image. Please do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Take the "war games" with the intention of breaking a terrorist-threatening thought. The first film was produced by W.OrR because wars were waged in Russia at the USSR. The idea behind the computer is to kill a terrorist in training before they are under threat. The next thing about politics is that the first thing about a stupid computer is to understand the meaningless meaning of the war. Such an insight is not given in the film.
