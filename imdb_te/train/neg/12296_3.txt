<br /> <br /> It starts with Garn Linda Blair, who runs a hallway to escape from people with monsters or pitchforks. Not sure. She jumped through and jumped through a window, and she was very pregnant. <br /> <br /> She is an annoying and perhaps retarded little kid who thinks that she and her son will travel to an abandoned hotel. Italian horror directors will find very frustrating young children in their movies! On the island already David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (Do you know how the Germans love Hasselhoff ...). <br /> <br /> This is an old couple traveling to the island, and a real estate agent, and a woman I feel, taking photos, and translating a secret German book about her witches. Their daughter. Apparently she is an architect, Linda Blair and the boy are old twin babies. <br /> They thought they went to the island together, but it really looked like linda and the boy was separate from the rest (perhaps they were shot separately). External, but no great effect is used. An old age in bad decoration and black clock is sometimes appearing to the boy, and he eventually records his Sesame Street tape recorder. <br /> People suck into their dreams, or hell or something. These gorgeous scenes are okay, but it is not enough to recommend the movie. Even though I see that the copybox that I see is not cut in the cover of the box, the death of a character, whose veins are really exploding. Many in the scene show the reaction shots of another character, because we can not see anything. Creepy scene A man or a ghost is raped by a devastating wounded man. He looked especially nasty. Linda Blair has a ridiculous and painful bad scene taken over. <br /> <br /> I would like to see if she is going to act in a horror film, she will do the original with her role and leave her an exorcist behind her (excluding annual horrors). Italian and tradition claimed to be a sequel to unrelated, also known as AKA La Casa 4 and GotterHouse 2. It is said to be a continuation of Casa 3 - Gomeshouse, Law (1988) - even better than this one). La Casa 1 and the two The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - are again not related to Witcheri and La Casa 3 (and better than them). House II: The Second Story (1987), Horror Show (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How is the horror show there fitting? This is not true, it's a sequel, thereby causing a real series entry (or more?) Confusing. Unusually, the horror show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 also AKA Horror House 2. Your head is still worse?
