I saw it. It's not "good" but interesting in a poor way. The boys are very natural but the ............... Graphic / Thankful Final gang rape scenario is discouraging and yes - the unilateral insertion of the Second World War footage which seeks to match the real horror with this fanciful expression. The real brutality is real - this movie is just worse. However, there is a look that looks like in this movie, but it seems to me that "the new dress of the Emperor", but actually in reverse. This movie is good, but directing, storytelling, content and ultimate feel to you being away from this movie. If a concept is inconsequential - this is the same.
