The film has a good story kernel. The Coast Guard's men and women's work, especially in the Pacific, are leaders and legends. The film incorporates a good story with three conclusions (none satisfying), good and nonsense bar combat and two allegations of "sparkling" relationships that have a large spark like dead cold. Rescue scenes are great - though computer generation hokey and scenes are pretty real - but the evidence is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (looking for it). Ashton Kutcher flat but not terrible. The main female characters are a dimensional. The best female rescue center is one of the Coast Guard sailors and she has two minutes camera in the entire movie. It could be a fantastic movie - and a need for Costner!
