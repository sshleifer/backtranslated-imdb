I have seen that in this film I was in the cast of Kari Wuherer. I've had a theory about her, she's talented actress, but never seems to get to prove, because this kind of low-budget B movie is always there. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to work on unfortunate issues, and I always see her. It's not different. This film is often ugly and upset, but this is not good. George played against the kind of Vend, and was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wauhrer. Since I see her last, her breasts are dull. Perhaps the reduction surgery, or (excess) removal of implants. This is not a bad thing. She's still pretty cool. I want to see her in a good film.
