Kid has been identified as a baby in the trash and raised at the Marshall Arts Academy, with a naked with sunk baskets. With the help of the person who finds him, he gets to college and promotes the championship as he searches for his real parents. The pieces are the best of comedy action comedy overall. It looks like a hipper basketball version of Shapin Soccer seems to be fighting for the basketball version, but the comedy is scattered and its focus is more than a Chihuahua with ADD at Epsomos four times. I was asked "I'm looking". I watched it from start to finish and I still do not know what hell is. There are some great action scenes, some fun jokes and occasional moments, but nothing is there, nothing of it ever comes together, I'll pass.
