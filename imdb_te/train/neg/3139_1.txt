For a long time as a member of the Titanic disaster and a lot of Titanic clubs, I feel like commenting on the film. I do not really care how many awards and awards won the film, but it is still an absolutely awful movie. Cameron has resources to make the 'right' semi-documentary film of the disaster, but unfortunately it chooses to turn it into a po-faced romantic giant. Many people around the world have fallen, showing it to my mind, taste and general discernment for film critics and audiences these days. Who says that everyone is a hero and heroine in love? In fact, what are the most realistic events but not the romantic and the Titanic disaster. I feel that a good script and director with a semi-documentary approach and a good artistic license is required. I almost threw in the last row that met other lost passengers and crews who killed dead lovers. Is this a brilliant film? Ask yourself.
