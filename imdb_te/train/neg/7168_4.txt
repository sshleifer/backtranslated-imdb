The author has come up with a nice idea for a story, but it is almost undesirable because many flaws in the plot run away from the film. Basic Elements have glossed over, better as the character development. Inequalities also raised their ugly heads. A huge building in the rural Irish village? Can a storm be "not visible" in the gardens during the night (can I add more time)? Overall, this is not "bad". I rated it as a 4, based on Alison Elliott's story and talent.
