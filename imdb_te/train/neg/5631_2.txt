The photography on the DVD is dark, and I think the screen is dead. When I saw half of the film, I missed it. However, it is not properly designed and not interesting. I did not find a story about the "Black Widow" title. I am hoping for a mystery or thriller but did not adequately participate in the first few frames. Especially for Willem Dafoe, the film was rented and his talent was sad to be wasted. I do not believe that I have studied the geographical calculus for a long time to develop a big motion picture. She is attractive and can be an actor but she has done many things in the film. Although they are married in real life, they do not have chemistry on the screen. Their relationships are not reliable. I do not understand why other characters were introduced into the plots.
