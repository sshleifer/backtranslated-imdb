It's really bad of a movie. My friend was renting it because he was, well, an idiot. But again, I should have a lot of theme because I saw the whole thing that was damn! The actors are in line with the high school drama geeks and think that the places are going. The only place they are going is waiting for the tables at Lubby. I saw this "gemstone", how it really was made. I mean, some of the "storytelling" actually thought the campus was fresh, original and profitable. With that money some Maran trusted in the script and decided to get some money with innocent misconception that he was coming back. Actors, actors scouted, makeup artists were employed, and brought new computer animators from Al Collins's graphic design school and started the form of this stiff form. <br /> <br /> I hate this move, but one thing I like is the overdose of music. This film made every minute. There is no break in music. <br /> It's not like missing some important plot points or anything, it's more than just a conversation. <br /> When it was over, we decided to visit the Mystic River. It was like turning the 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit into a BMW 740il. You can not get two opposite films in terms of quality.
