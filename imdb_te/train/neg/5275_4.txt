The disappearance was about a couple who found themselves in deep trouble after taking their family members in New Mexico and leaving the main road to visit a town that had been unintended for 1948 for anonymous reasons. Weaver town was initially uninfected, and the family had a tourist appeal until the nightly stroll and others began to have a good reason to suspect that they were suffering from malignant consequences. Henley will leave Blair-Witch-Project-Esquire video diary with the town's last victim and perform the best show for anyone in the film. Although the performances of Hollywood and Day are much better than supporting actors, their emotional impact seems to be "flat" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Many people have been disappeared because of the suspense and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and unsustainable turns and makes sense no sense. Loose yet it has absolutely no understanding what is going on in the film, which makes the bizarre less reasonable end. The filmmakers were focused on building exciting scenes that broke up all of the good stories: a plot explanation, a cohesive plot of themes and symbols that led to a cohesive solution / outcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> What is the significance of Indian symbolism on the walls? What happened to our people? What is the relationship with people at dinner? What does Sheriff know? <br /> What did the missing boy find? I have a lot of brain power to offer some of the intuitive explanations for these plot turns and strange events, ending the filmmakers without answering one of these films. This is another nice cliffhanger for the end of a short series about pickup again next week, but a disappointing film is totally frustrating and inappropriate.
