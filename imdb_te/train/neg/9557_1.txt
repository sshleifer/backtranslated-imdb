I do not really have high expectations and I must admit that I'm not disappointed. The film is terrible, I have warned others not to waste their time with the responsibility of registering an account at IMDb. The storyline is terrible and you ask yourself throughout the movie, "Is it worse?" Yes it may be! Somehow they manage to make the worst through every minute and you end up thinking "I want my 1 hour and 35 minutes back!". Someone got to pay! <br /> <br /> "This film is terrible, I do not want to waste their time with the responsibility of enrolling an account at IMDB The storyline is terrible and you ask yourself throughout the movie, "Is it worse?"
