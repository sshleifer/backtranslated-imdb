Writer-director Tony adopted directly about his own play in the PCC, a recent widow, who has learned in the last three weeks that he is HIV-positive; He always tracks a homosexual partner, brings him to an apartment and meets him, bloody revenge on a person who is forced to blood test and recover the results. The witty idea is better than the paper it plays than it does. James Marsden's captive reality is boring and aggressive, but the actor's own artificial techniques are obscure - it looks like Tom Cruise's Roadshow version. Scott Speetman worked harder with a more difficult role, but his personality-kidnappers-on-the-edge revolves around the coward, and there are no two men's conversations. Marsden's homosexual boy is, of course, not indifferent - he is suspicious of Speedman's plight - but he responds or behaves homosexual in any situation. The film is not exactly copped out, but it's fraudulent, bad editing, poorly-fiction past, low-budget production and big cinematic film that needs crazy acting and good play. **** from * 1/2
