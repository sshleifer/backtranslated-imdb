It can also mean silly for people who remember this program ... but I remember this live action. I do not think I've ever seen the cartoon. But the picture? May be. I remember it very clearly. The man is very much a building like a museum. He also had a red jacket. It became dark and he was a red car and this guy was the second level looking down to him. The car / person was rotating around and crashed into the street with a large showroom type window. And then continued to drive off. That is all I can remember. I really hope someone will remember where this is. Otherwise, I'm still silly. But I'm not hoping.
