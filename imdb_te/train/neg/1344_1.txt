No film was funneled by the name "The Baghman" which attracted the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is much different than what was expected after seeing the DVD cover. BaÄŸman is not a good film. It comes in a home video camera (and possibly) in the images section. Acting was terrible. I did not hear and saw such woodwork from Troll 2. There are plenty of nudity and sex scenes, but they are clearly very fast. The characters are morons and are completely forgettable. The end (which I did not spoil) can be easily seen after seeing the very first scene. Due to the cheesy nature of the film, nothing is really feared (awful attempts at realistic gore, car in the driving sequence clearly established, etc.) from the terrible production values. Recommended for bad cinema fans only.
