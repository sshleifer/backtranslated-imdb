"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" As you call it ... not just hit the mark. Maybe it's just me, I do not like gangster comics (Oscar, Joni Dangerously and Mafia), it's probably more "witty words" than all comedy, or other critics). <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vick Thing began to watch a running joke. <br /> You do not have enough space or feel for a long time. The majority of the film is placed in "Dreamfus Club" or in various offices / dams. <br /> <br /> The cast that supports the character ... The paper is great (Silva & Drogo is great to watch) but the characters have died before the time they develop. And Richard Pierce Camo is a joke! <br /> <br /> The romance and love element of the film was also demolished. <br /> <br /> Whenever I'm back, I'll be back soon.
