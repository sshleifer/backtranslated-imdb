This film is more efficient in convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy than Muslims. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever gone to school in journalism? Read the editor? Freshman rhetoric? These scary ads can be displayed and convincingly in a lavish manner. <br /> <br /> However, there is no recognition of every argument that can not be ruled out, or practical (or nobody) solutions, some sources and dubious source. <br /> I do not want anyone to leave the theater believing in this racist scrappot. <br /> <br /> I have a good lesson - and you hopefully a warning story -.
