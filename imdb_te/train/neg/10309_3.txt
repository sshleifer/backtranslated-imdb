"CIA Codename: Alexa" is the definitive horoscope of Las Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is mainly inspired by a CIA and trained woman and a secret mission to them. (The same story style of La Femme Nikita is very good) Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. The performance of the combo movie history is probably the worst of Simpson. Lamas "acting" is just bad Steven Seagull Deception. <br /> <br /> The writing and performance of the film is very weak, sometimes it's ridiculous. Many action movie "sessions" in this film are absurd: unwanted car explosions, people thrown glass windows, terrorists, and bad ponytoys. David Michael's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990) is similar to a musical score. , Which is the theme of Steven Segal of this film. The film has plenty of martial arts, and this is a low budget American product. Mindless acting and acting above will never allow, and I have to admit that I've got a little fun. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamais reappears at the beginning of the 90s but he is not exactly an action star, he is soap opera and action blockbusters is not why. My recommendation is to get rid of "CIA CodeName: Alexa" and see "La Femme Nikita".
