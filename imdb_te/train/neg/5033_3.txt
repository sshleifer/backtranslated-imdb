Murders are taking place in the Texas Desert town. Who is responsible? There are quite a few novelties of mystery and racial tensions (but not really fit), but for lovely fledgling fans, these films appreciate both the traditional elements of gore and nudity. <br /> <br /> DAMA <br /> <br /> MPAA: Violence and gore for rated R, nudity and some language.
