I can say better about this film, it's great to see many Asian faces. What I do not like about the film is that it is common for ordinary races to do its role. The Asian girl who is unfaithful to play with anyone coming forward, White Guy tired of Asian culture, chose to take back his white world for the yellow land, and "keeping the black driver" true ". Plus all the coke, Shanghai Tang and Dunkin Donuts product placement is a bit too clear. The story plot is also fun, but the story is very special. Then you expect a lot of romantic comedies again but again I would have wanted to at least once surprise. Parents are the best part of the film.
