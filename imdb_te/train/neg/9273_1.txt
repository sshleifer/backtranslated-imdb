Who has given the Idiots the right to use the name of the film in this film? It is a sampling, awkward and curious to continue the women's franchise. Background film was lifted directly from the bugs bunny cartoon when the film began and since then the movie has been further downgraded! I wrote the script but they took back to show their mentor I know they wager they got an E! It's hard to say whether this is comedy because it's great fun for Beggers to the original Omen. Acting is ridiculous, especially from the famous woman Faye Grant. Does she keep pulling her crazy faces or is not she laughing hard? It's hard to say. The bad sequel I have always been unlucky to witness. 10 to 1.
