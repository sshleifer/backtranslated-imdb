<br /> <br /> If you want a surprising finish of "The Crater Lake Monster" do not read this review to be total curiosity. . The call "The Crater Lake Monster" is an overstate clear of the amateur. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you can not see it here in the first place. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with the movie. , It really sucks and goes somewhere. The script is quite ed-ish, which is completely contrived in such a way that it sets the main action sequences. Nothing is too extreme for "The Crater Lake Monster". It explains its dinosaur by absorbing volcanic trees, which calls water 'superheating', which makes a dinosaur egg resting at the bottom of the lake about a thousand. If we can approve the egg for a long time lying and the extraction and existence, can not lower the temperature of the water, and the vast majority of the lake will evaporate? Unlike some token fogs in one or two scenes, other sources of the script are not wasted, other than water. </ P> <br /> The script is padded in some scenes and makes anything near the lake close to the characters, so they are courtesy by Clemation Dino. While just a couple of experiences pass through difficulties, when offering their automobile services, they decide to go for a boat and go to the crater lake. Oops ... do you think these strangers might be in this story, so why do they enter our title manifestos? In an order that is just plain bizarre, drunken strongholds a liquor shop and decides to kill the cashier and a spectator instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of powder. A car chase is good, and it does not know ... they end up right through the lake. Snack time for Cratey! <br /> <br /> When you take another ten minutes to divide these scenes you will be bored. Lovely, and I really would like to like "Crater Lake Monster". I can not do that. There is not enough time to go here, it's more of an image to keep it at a party because you can talk on it and it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs found in all three forms of the film are also very important: the shadow puppet, the large model head pulled by the water, and a fully absorbed claymatism insert is actually very good. There are lovely dresses, and they take a large part of deliberate humor in the film. A downbeat conclusion leaves us mourning death of one of the monster and our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this film is that it is dead at the end. Why have I been influenced by this resolution? Is the tragedy played on the end credits? Or is it inwardly weeping for wasting time watching movies like this?
