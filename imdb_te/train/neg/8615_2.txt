I have tough times to see this movie very bad, dead and stupid. In Natural Bourne Killers I saw this Rodney and I thought it was funny as hell, but this film was even worse. "Jokes" are not funny, the actors are not funny and anything about it is not remotely funny. Do not waste your time for this! The positive things about this are pretty wives :) and Molly Shannon I definitely tried her best, but the script was very awful. So I rated it as "2" instead of "1", but this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen.
