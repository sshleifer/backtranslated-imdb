The film had a beautiful opening, I really believed I was for one of the best romantic comedies I have seen for a while ... There is something special about the way of setting up the film "Something" is realistic, somewhat abstract and spiritual. But the story style is more unrealistic. The conclusion is to say that the connie and PREDICTABLE is almost an understatement ... The most common romantic endure where everything goes great for the 'preferred' character. The main character is a scene where he realizes that he made a mistake and chases "a woman of his dreams", only to confess her love to acknowledge her love. Come on. And finally, 'good guys' win, 'bad guys' loose ... you get the picture. Potential interest is the momentum of the film.
