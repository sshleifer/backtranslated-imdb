My Name Is Modesty is based around the episode, which takes about a page in Night of the Morningstar in the novel Blaze novel in the 10th. It describes an incident in which young modesty (in the book 17, in the film twenty-five) clarified her leadership in a war on a casino. Her loyal next-door Willy Garwin is not in the film as set before the original Blaze adventure. The relationship between Blaze and the Graffins is always one of the most attractive elements of the novels and one of the main issues between long-term comic strips. The other problem is that the film is very simplistic because it just flies into the screen as a small protagonist. The cast is ok but Alexandra Stouden really persuades the heroine and is too old to play the young modest. I thought this film was a quick and dirty solution to lose the rights to Blaze franchise.
