In 1914 Charlie Chaplin started making films. These were made for MacCennett (also known as "Keystone Studios") and were literally a much faster success. Small comics have a very small structure and are fully advertised. As a result, popular movies in their day are just awful by the standards of today. Many of them have a strong similarity to the camera's bad relatives. Many others roam the front of the camera and do pretty much nothing. And, regardless, Keystone was sent directly to the theaters. Keystone movies with Chaplin were very successful, so all the movies were pretty bad at this time. <br /> <br /> Today, the only thing we know and develops only in Charlie Chaplin's career. Keystone. By 1915, he signed a new lucrative deal with Esseni Studios and dramatically improved the films as a director. However, these films are still very hard and are not particularly memorable. No, Chaplin is still a beautiful little tramp. In 1916, when he moved to Mutual Studios, his films were once again improved and he became a more recognizable figure - in many previous films he had a jerk (a lot of drunk, beating women, innocent people, etc.). His Little Tramp's final evolution was the result of his full-length movies in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This movie is called for twenty minutes of love, minutes! Oh! Good. The plot, what little is, will be a little tramp in the park. One couple wants neck but inexplicably, Charlie practically seated on the lap of the couple and emphasized the really annoying ones. I do not understand why and little Charlie will be spilling about this film and others annoying park in the next movie. Maybe he is looking for a threesome, I do not know. But the film is incompatible and not particularly funny - people start hitting each other and pushing each other in the lake. Chaplin is a simple poor effort before starting to give his character a plot and personality.
