After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some translations, which was translated in Late. <br /> <br /> This is the thriller of this movie. Interestingly, the image design is almost identical, but PACING is very different. <br /> <br /> The "10 items" leaves the viewer through the 1-day time series of the film, but the good-planning "Lost In ..." has expanded in some long days. Some people can see it and be disappointed because it contains Morgan Freeman. Its best characters now support roles in big blockbusters than the popular characters in sub-$ 10mil limited release movies and indie films.
