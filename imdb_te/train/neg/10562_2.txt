This low budget comedy film will only suit a low budget. The dialogue is boldly stupid, the chase sequences are uniformly boring and the movie's highest-grossing film has been saved for the last five minutes (in the horizontal port-a-palitie in a parking lot for a series of crashes and explosions.) In the scene, the movie first saw the worst on the main villain And stuttering It is - to practice without a purpose does not). The whole film is depressingly remembered that the director came from the studio of Rogger Korman occasionally when the director wants to give some bucks and a camera - but impose discipline without Kormon.
