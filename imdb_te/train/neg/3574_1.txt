I could not finish this film. I tuned after saying that I was nominated for the most wretched endeavor at the Sexual Advice Award: a scene in the pianic, pianic, is between the two boys she wants. She asks her (a good boy) to see the error in her ways. She asks if the other (bad boy) wants her hot dog. Cage level. I hope it does not spoiling anything to say she turns, and with a smile, take the hot dog. Just curiosity.
