I'm generous to give this film 2 stars. About the line "You've also seen Oz's Wizard" is the best part for me! The awful writing and acting as it is displayed in this film is no wonder it's taken by the most worthless TV reality shows. Make yourself a favor and get out of the house, beat a royal baseball game and make your happy joy!
