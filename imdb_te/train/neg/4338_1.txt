Really terrific ... the main actor did okay ... the film, the plots etc might be the worst and inaccurate as well as the sequel as well ... it's something like Carlitos Way to have a little or no relevance ... and any Carlito's ways to be like a plague Should not be used ... in fact he does not mention Gail, he will end with some other birds, mention Kainfeld Incaledu, with its mention of how he was caught, he ended up in prison, did not say how. They tried to make the original with the flash spine initially ... but it was the rating I was looking for for the zero mark to be honest with it ... Unfortunately I had to rate more ... <br /> <br /> 90 years It's a deadly attempt to earn money in one of the best movies ... Overall it's ruined Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life ... it's all for "action", it's really boring Watling was slow and predictable ... again ... in order to avoid the failure of the fans in any way Carltio
