When "The Dukes of Hazzard" reached about $ 75 million, it was very sad about our society situation. <br /> <br /> I can not fully understand that we are too stupid to stay away from this kind of worst, or do not appeal to any kind of effort in this type of scam. <br /> <br /> Hollywood does not have any incentive for good movies If people keep it out of the trash then people will see it anyway since there is nothing on the screen. The same. I walked out even though I was getting a free picture pass. There is no conversation in the conversation. These stunts are not over-the-top and worse. Perhaps this "bigger" film appeals to the Texans but I do not appeal to myself or anyone in my theater. No "big names" are in this career-end film, except for Burt Reynolds, you need to hear what you say. Jessica Simpson - do not laugh at me. <br /> <br /> If you are disappointed, I can not recommend this video for a video. It is all about people getting crazy, making it better than the start of the day or making it better than marketing through marketing. They warned people beforehand. There is plenty of stupidity.
