The Russian film, "4," follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. A musician, a frozen meat seller and a call girl. <br /> "4," I intend to display the discouragement and frustration of life in Soviet Soviet Russia in Russia, to make stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the picture I sit all the way through it very badly The suspicion can be so absurd and boring. The shadow is running a suggestion through the film that the shadow of the Russian government is working on some shadows behind the scenes - the mysterious cloning facilities behind the scene, the seventeen-old frozen meat are running - but the film is so formless and incomprehensible that I'm dismayed <br /> <br /> Good acting and some Despite the scorching scenes, "4" is a two-hour long oar Hosted the competition. This must be avoided at all costs.
