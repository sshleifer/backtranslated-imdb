I'm glad to see that I've never made a film in my favorite book. I did not realize that it was Disney until it was too late. I'm scared of many exceptions to the key parts of the story. Anyone in the novel is a film from the 4th grade book report. Mug did well at school and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) has not been portrayed as many scientists; They left her kitchen experiment and replaced it with the internet. And just start. By the half of the film I found shouting on the screen, and most of the people who were watching the movie reading the book were disturbing. I have four thumbs so I have more thumbs. The movie is good for the person who reads this book.
