This film is terrible. Okay, my favorite movie 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I'm always a bit biased. <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot rambles, the word key reminiscent of the original key elements to make the word the most dubious. (He's not a virgin, but allergic to bees!) Many things happen to be meaningless and unexplained which I thought was not, Mr Lubert did not make a horrific film. (How are two people who are clearly visible in a car at the end of the picture and at the beginning of the film?) Cage is blurry and confusing, and his character "Rowan!" At slight noise. When they become foolish, they are annoyed by the 'jealous' ones. For instance, some events are original (come out of a cupboard that pretends to look for Woodward / Cage Island) and many dialogues are directly from Anthony Schaffer's original screenplay and shoehorned. <br /> I'm sure you will provide better and more detailed analysis than others, and I can not really afford to write anything about this film. It does not have any substance. Throw on the scrap pile with all other rebuilds that they are 'dependent' (the simplest in this case) are the good names in these films.
