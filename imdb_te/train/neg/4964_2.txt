This film is a farce! The names are fraudulent and distorted by any literary entrepreneur, the plot is distorted and obscene. And they will have Beowulf giving Gaill the artillery / crossbow weapon. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In verse, he falls on the shoulder of Grendel with his bare hands! And I can not believe that written writers did such a thing. However, the way Ghentel painted is impressive. Only positive points of that and cast feature. If I see this disgrace, my English teacher is mad. Unless you have the hard hard die of the legendary poem "Beowulf", "Avoid this movie at all costs." And also, I do not recommend it.
