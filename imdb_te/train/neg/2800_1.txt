One of my best friends brought this film one night. I always enjoy a good laugh in a bad horror film and say yes. I dreamed your distinctive cheesy b-slasher but outside of this b. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest the lowest. The movie is actually a little less bad budget, very bad acting, bad lightning, plot, so-so-so-called 'special effects', moving cameras and a terrible soundtrack that makes films like Oscar-winning masterpieces like House of Wax. With only a good thing about it there is no 15 seconds than one without characters - she has some good tits. The most part of what I said in this movie is 'Wow this is really cool', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not eating enough'. So at the end: do not waste your time (or money!).
