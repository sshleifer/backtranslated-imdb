Seriously, the fact that this program is very popular is the mind of Bujiggles. This performance is not funny, it's not wise, it's not original, it's just a steam pile of bull's worst. Let me start with the letters. All-three-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like fingernails on a blackboard. Voice acting is not good. Then there is animation. My God, it hurts to see my eyes. Everything is very flat, very straightforward, very bright, and a lot of candy coating. Then there is no humor or lack. It's totally idiotic! They do not even have these B-grade jokes in the first place and then repeat them until death. They also came in some nonsense entertaining comedy that caused me ill. In the end, the last and least, the music. It's a little hurt. It sounds on the child's computer and it sounds like there is no emotion. I have a score of less than 1, and I really do. This presentation must be canceled seriously. I try to avoid as a plague. I turn off the TV immediately when I hear the theme song. If you do not see this presentation then you will not do it. See quality shows like The Simpsons or Futurama.
