Summary made the most ignorant comment you just heard in an RPG. Did you think that homosexuals are gay? Did you refuse? When you go to save your best friend, and someone decides to help you out of the goodness of his heart, you are in a serious debt. Lavitz is a good person and every time they help each other, it makes them closer to friends. They are not gay lovers like your rebellion. And you know that the game is set in medieval times. By then, women had prepared meals while men fought. Do you also know your history? Do you know how much time has been taken to accept women in the army today? This game has a lot of realism, but it holds a lot more slowly than you can, and you need to take some of the worst proofs rather than understand the story with your wrong intentions.
