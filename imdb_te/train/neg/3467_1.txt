The film's cover of the film is named Kyle Minogue, but Drew Barrymore has the same task as "Scream". The first thing that makes this film dull; They are trying to sell a movie with someone over 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film features young hip college children. To top it all off, 80's teen film reputation is Molly Ringwald's star of this beautifully written movie. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the mood is about some mute horror films in the film. This mute creature kills every one of it because it's never finished. In the movie, we want to imagine who the killer is. <br /> <br /> This move is just plain bad, like torture or rent if you see it on the shelf of your local video store. Do not spread horror.
