First, get out of the way. . . Yes, the film is stealing a lot from 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The theme of 'Darkness Falls' is as follows: Tooth Fairy, a murderer who hides her face due to her unpleasant murder murders people who see the vengeance. "Tooth Fairy" (2006), bizarre tooth fairy (who, yes, hides her face) just unalashes her angry revenge about someone. <br /> <br /> But the film is: If you're going to steal the exact story from a movie directly, 'Darkness Falls'? It has produced a few bucks at the box office, but it is perfectly for the theater distribution experience. The low-budget, simplified video image does not have the same effect. <br /> When I see the movie at the start of 15-20 minutes, my expectations have actually increased. At least some product worth. This story is not horrific, just blatantly emerged. The first scene was a cast of characters, including a former doctor (played by a guy who looks like a bassie) and some hot veterinary student (from the 'Horror Masters of Horner: Jennifer'). After a few minutes, the film flows just slowly. It works in all the basic horrible clich√©s, including but not limited to: a silly warning, a bloody dumb joke, supernatural, and some silly old man with heart-of-gold. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the biggest problems in the lack of adherence to the target audience. It's like to change the tonemer for any role on the screen at any time. When adults are on the screen, it has a more mature feel. When the star (The Stripper) and Watsheysface (The Joke) were on the screen, the conversation fell to a more stupid, immaculate, level. When the kid is on the screen, 'Are You Ordered the Dark?' It is thought to be an episode of the episode. . . <br /> Technically, the image is more than anything. Visuals are very good from simple to boring. Most of the writing is subpar, as acting. On the plus side, some of the lowest gore episodes (a lot better (yet painful speculative) and a woodcutter scene and a beautiful vulgar naughan scene.Also, if you're looking for a bit of sexy stuff, there's a scene without a little (but if you want to see this chic, <br /> <br /> If you're a huge fan of 'Darkness Falls' (Do so <br /> <br /> This is the final verdict:
