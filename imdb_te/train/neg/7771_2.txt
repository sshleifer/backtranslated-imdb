It's a strange heck film, I'm not surprised that Bond company wants you to get the feeling of coming up with this movie. All of the involved is terribly stilted and the jumps around all over the plot, which makes all too little sense. As I said, as I had to come to the Bond company, it seems that it does not require unnecessary shoot footage, and all the music is very unpleasant library music (I do not expect). Very, very odd. I actually bought it a DVD, if it let me in what is going on hell, and what happened to this film.
