The Little Mermaid is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies. However, sorry to say that Disney is absolutely confusing when this sequel is made. I'll have some good points for it. The songs are not bad, and the animation is clean and clear. There is some humor, I'm sure - I do not remember, after seeing it I was immediately banned from appearing before my eyes. The worst place story of this film. In this film, Ariel becomes her father. She banned her daughter from going to the sea (yes, with fear), she was forbidden to travel to the ground. <br /> <br /> Without this fact, Ursula was replaced with frightening and enthusiastic replacement. The sea witch (Underford, the forgotten sister) frightened the sort. She, too, has done little to make her bidder - but she's not worse or worse than Ursula. Ursula has badly exploited us with her confidence. This sea witch is a joke. <br /> <br /> For the dubbing, I'm not a fat, deeply praised father (we all know and love) and Eric's voice did not even make the same actor (I'm always angry at some reconstruction / sequel). (His voice difference is very clear to me, by the way!) That's because I've made this film only so that Disney can catch some fast dollars, something I hate to think about a company I actually enjoy. I thought I did not make this plot. I know this act (after the child in a parent's footstep), but I know Ariel is different. It's so romantic about her. She had a dream, she fell in love, and that dream came true. Until she plays in the film, it is. Then she became like other elders. This is not Ariel I know. <br /> <br /> I know some kids who have enjoyed this movie, and I do not care for some people. But for me, and you have all the love for Ariel there for all, please do not look at this film. As we know, Ariel dies, only resurrecting one song or both, and one last scene (in fact she accepts back water) - she is ultimately relatively less part of it.
