Never see this film ... It's all over my life I've seen it all the time. And to say something. Acting, storyline and filming are absolutely terrible in this world WORTH! Do not seriously give it a hit which also spends my 99p from sinsburys and was it only held in 2005? hahaha This movie is like a cheap college picture you can even see in the corner of the screen .... If you really want to see this you should see "scary shark scene" ... perhaps the best part of acting I have seen in my life ... ha ha. I mean this seriously for 2 1/2 hours and the biggest waste !!
