Most episodes of Season 1 are awful. They have similarities with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits because they have good stories in the show. Amazing Stories are not very dull .. At least I do not rent or buy the twilight zone series ... I hear Season 2 of this series is much better. For some of the DVD's they cut out the Ray Wallton episodes that further reduce this compilation. A cool thing to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... While most storytellers are very imaginable, this range would be better for you with better turns and twists ...
