I rented this film to see what the bloody, nonstop action movie was and this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that looks like a kickboxer die hard. Lou and Reebe are in Vietnam and saving the rub from the Lou Gokhs, and he is easily headed into one of the worst influences ever. Vietnam scenes were shot in the pyramid, I swear! Lou is now hit by the brain and lives with Reb and with him and owns a bar. Super Homeric. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes, punches are two inches from the person. Personality changes in seconds. A person is a bad man and good in the next scene. Acting is awful and music is the song of Frank Stallone's sound of excessive sentiment. I hate this movie.
