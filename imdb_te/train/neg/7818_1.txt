I usually do not get out of a movie but half done. I promised the film was different, but did I not think about it beforehand? Spoiler warning! Back in 1, the space ships and land on the ground, well, after a few years, a big large number on the board is low, this thing will still burn up and crash! What, does not this modern civilization seem to develop landing gear? So for an industry that is modern, we want to see another Woody Allen film, please any blacks! Superman runs around saving people, making sure he does not go to the dark areas of sticks to Europe and the US. I was in this stomach 30 years ago.
