Sometimes I relax my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still getting these days. The cops from the 70s - 70s they made this lame "Jaws", is not like what they're most fond of. The idea is exactly the same. So we are the animal that started killing people. First it removes some of the secondary characters, then attacks the main characters, except for those who use a particular character who usually plays a particular role, only two people play. One of the main characters is usually dying before others kill the animals with an explosion. Then we usually get the last shot about the animal being alive or the eggs. "Crocodylus" basically uses the same overly thoughtful ideas and does nothing to create a tad bit of diversity. Unless you are a "specialist" captain in this variation, your standards are very low. It is funny that he will act by Duncan Reiger, and he is willing to be a complete jerk.Hell I give it a bonus point.
