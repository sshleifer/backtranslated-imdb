"Shadrach" is not my favorite type. I have found extraordinary sentiments and are under acting. Harvey Keitel and Andy McDowell are good, but some of the other actors are not believable. I also do not believe that Paul's parents go away and leave him in the dabby family, especially if they are home keeper living at home. Their social classes are far apart to consider these beliefs. This was Dbane's lifestyle seemed exaggerated. There is a scene in the film that shows Andy MacDoule has come out of the car after having sex with each other. Who is this Her son? What is the scene that shows us? Why was the scene included? It did nothing with the rest of the movie and was never told elsewhere. It's not grateful and fitting in the story. I have so many disparities in the film. The story related to Shadrach was pretty cool but was not convinced that Dubness was kind and generous as they were filmed.
