The film is one of the most wildly distorted films in history. Not scary, the film does not have to honor hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous slave laborers. The bridge was to build "the bodies of a white man" as a Japanese engineer said. Such an unpredictable horror committed by Japanese captors is a film source, it is also disgusting, which is not close to the exact bridge of the bridge. The original bridge is made of steel and concrete, but not mixed. Who are the survivors of today? They hate the image and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were hungry, tortured, and murdered by the brutal evils. Those who do not die of dysentery, placenta, or illness are seriously injured in their darkest time.
