If you want to see a clever, philosophical discussion of the man and the probability, it is good to see "Waking Life". "Any $ # *! We know" everything in its eyes, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acting, totally in no art direction and totally annoying. It's not short-term stimulating or entertaining. The film is enough to escape the rolling freak "Ramta". Is not it strange how filmmakers like to look at the fact that this woman is about 2,000 years old, an Atlantean god or something of worship? What is a layer of old chick, and this picture is what is the total waste of my time and money. People who are responsible for the film should never repeat another film.
