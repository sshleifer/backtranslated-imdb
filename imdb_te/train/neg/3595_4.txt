Some of the others commented on this film were not "lucky": I have never seen ... Sarno's mind is "mind". I agree with many: most of the actresses do not have time and (go-go) dance is not really attractive. I liked a lot of freelyin crank (?) ... she was so brave, she was beautiful! This acting is very beautiful, and if the lines in the second language are distributed, it will be a lot of trouble. Trying to follow the plot is a major function: is there really one? I sincerely agree with another comment: for a bloodthirsty image, there is not much blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to check Hummer Classics like "Horror of Dracula" and ("My Favorite Personal") "Brides of Dracula", a very good (unexpected) comic piece Lady Doctor A cloud of bats gets torn off ... which you can not see ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, if you happen to catch a time-the Great White North as Cable but here, for heaven's sake, it does not rent!
