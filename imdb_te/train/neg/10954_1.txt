If I have a 0 stars rating I'll gladly waste it with this absolutely horrific pile of waste. The fact that the original summary is perfectly done and if it is different, it may be awesome, it will deteriorate further. The primary task of locking up a group of people in an experiment is to work, but where is the researcher? I do not know what I'm watching or a group of surfers and blondes who do not have the knowledge of chatting about music and culture ... challenges curiosity and crazy. The real point of reality TV is showing REALITY. If you set a 'challenge', 'Friday night games' will not play with the exaggerated foundations of food and stereotypical cultural aspects. Make them a real challenge. And for gift 'earning' money, if it's really deaf, it's fine! These people are nuts. If you can do the performance well, the idea is fantastic. But it should not happen!
