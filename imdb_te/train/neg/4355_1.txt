Horrible. I see many users comments on how great this show is. It's really a Wanna-Be-Friends - made in Taiwan Macaw. Jokes are dull ... and the plot is ridiculous. Actors are struggling to be apparently funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines (if you can call them). Most of the other users who commented are clearly visible from another planet (or at least another continent). There are obvious reasons that TV companies can cancel the shows ... there is no one when performing well. Make sense? Anyway, to steer clear - it's raining and nothing else on this planet to do ... instead of standing in the rain - more fun.
