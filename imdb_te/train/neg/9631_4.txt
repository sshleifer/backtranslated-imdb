The film is promoting Ben Stiller and J. Aniston's identity. <br /> <br /> Here we have the recipe for a successful title, but this film is not successful. <br /> <br /> Polly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the kind of character she is perfectly fit. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same troublesome man as "to meet his parents", but the comic scene is much smaller compared to the title above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor without nothing special. <br /> <br /> These two well-known actors are good things - but what can they do when there is a poor story and a script? <br /> 10 to 4.
