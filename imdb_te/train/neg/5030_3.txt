What's in the skies? Is this a plane? Is it Superman ?? Err, what ?? It's a TURTLE!?! See, it's cold war! There's nothing bad news and other problems! Americans rattle the Russian territory on Earth's landscape and subsequent explosive layers, and literally wake up the giant prehistoric turtle-living gamma. He / she is not his friendly critter, it will immediately destroy everything and everyone in its path. Governments argue that ultimately decide to kill ugly bastard with a brand new and super sophisticated snow bomb, but is another surprise in the Gammera store? Damn turtle can fly! This is the first time that results in a tremendous grotesque and happier order! When Gumma suddenly damages his back, he turns him back and he raises himself up in the air. How do you love There's also a terrible sub plot about an annoying kid who can talk to the monster, but it's just not interesting enough. Flying Turtle, People !! This is too small to write about Japanese (and America revised) science-fiction efforts, in contrast to the obvious and totally shameless rip-off of classics such as the original Godzilla and the Beast 20.000 Fathoms. Effects and monster models are very hokey and, unlike the above mentioned images, it will succeed in creating an apocalyptic atmosphere. Notable actors such as Brian Donne ("The Quartermans Experiments") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not know whether they are on any movie set and the actual Japanese turbulence-scenes are not quite acceptable. However, gamer's own and personalized theme-song is great, but it comes with extra point.
