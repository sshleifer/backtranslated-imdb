In an all-inspired, snail-disappointment disappointment, Insideman tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington), who is on trial for his possible involvement in missing money. When a bank is stolen and a detachment thief (Clive Owen) and his team conduct hostages, the detective hires a thief thief? When he proves a shot he is innocent and his position is valuable. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions sent back by a bank owner's security deposit box to retrieve a bank deposit inside the bank, and you have three-way confusion. Unfortunately, you will set up everything in the picture and will not pay anything in the end. Denzel Washington is his most anticipated show in an inefficient and overwhelming ecumenical appearance. The only mask for this film is its best co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, better than the film. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most surprising and high-skill presentation dealing with the cruel, cutthroat villain. Clive Owen does not give much more than offspring and postures, but his depth and his accomplishment are more than his growing role. This is a very poor talent or interest movie wasted in the film. You need to think about what the director Spike Lee thinks about when creating this image. The most undisturbed element of Insideman is how undesirable it is. For a film that contains all the pre-production blockbuster, it comes with a terrible flat.
