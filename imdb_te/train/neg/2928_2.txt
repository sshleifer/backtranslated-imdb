I really want to see this movie, I want to wait to get our blockbuster total access account for months. <br /> When it appears in our mailbox, it is thrown directly into the DVD player. <br /> I was disappointed. I want to go out of the theater / press 'stop' <br /> <br /> I saw all the way I played but could not find anything from it. <br /> This acting is very good, but it's about it. Nothing is explained; When Matthew understood that some mental physician was downtrodden and turned into lands, he never gave us a 'decline'. If we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we did not see it happen or why it did not. In a interview with Matthew Doctor, Cedric revealed that he would once cheat him, but it was not a big deal. I guess I can look in this past, but - nothing. We're also getting suggestions for a centric hospital - but we can not see it again. <br /> <br /> Some movies 'take it', but this film ticked me honestly. Pierre appears in Cedric's former club and the difficulties begin, until he can not hide him or her hair until the end, and it takes me a good part to recognize Pierre. His individuality in the club and completely different from him is identified. <br /> <br /> This film is where you know everything and moves with its disarray, outside space and confusing speed. I was able to continue with movies such as 'Pie', 'Citizen Kane' and other Flash Movies / Flash-Forward Left and Right, but did not hold it in CU style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you will know what is going on and answer the main mysteries. CU will leave you when you are hanging. It has acting in it, 'we do not know, you can not recognize it for yourself. <br /> <br /> "I liked the characters, but the whole story is very disappointing.
