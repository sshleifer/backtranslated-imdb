Nights start with a series, maybe a pilot, one. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film someone only told the cyborgs (bad guys) but after the climax, Nea left many more of them To find out. <br /> It is said that cyborgs are difficult to kill, but after a month of training, Neva can destroy them with a single blow. <br /> <br /> Film is pure kicking. <br /> <br /> One positive thing in the whole movie: This is a lot of fun when looking at it. I'm talking about it with my friends. If you're laughing, I'd recommend it to be.
