Woody Allen, one of the sharp pens around his best time. He can have a strict inspection and wrap it around the punch line like nobody else. However, when he's in his trash, all his movies can be serious. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" opened the closure of this stink. Setup was one of his more intriguing ideas for a while. Four restaurants sit in a restaurant whether the essence of life is comedy or play. The story of a man to solve the argument argues that the story is a comedy or tragedy (a comedian, another dramatic playwright). The two men continue the story and the stories tell stories about weaving. When I first heard about this film, I understand that they are telling the same story, and the genre (comedy or drama) will only change how you look. Now it's interesting. Still, stories share only one main element and some side items. They are completely different stories with the main plot differences. The play is very strictly written and it can really act as self-imaging. This point, however, is that these elements prevented the audience from experiencing any emotional investment in any roles. Comedy is the story of the moments of success, but they are still small and fleeting. Farrell was obviously meant to stand up to Woody, but he was able to play this role very confident without Woody's stutters and hand-tics. Woody Woody is the best one. When someone tries, they do not play the role, they model a notable actor. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films have become a little easier in the theater than me. My money back.
