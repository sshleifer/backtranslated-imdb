The only reason I can not score for this film is that Sibrell shows that he is outstanding in the technical aspects of the film. It is a technically acknowledged film. <br /> As said, the film based on lies and distortions is not easily proven. The documentary uses propaganda methods to streamline space programs rather than actual reality. <br /> If you have any knowledge of mechanics in this orbit, the circulated cirbler's "undefined proof" of languages ​​can easily be rejected. <br /> I do not recommend seeing it, but if you do this, watch it for free on Google Video. Bart Cibral will not benefit from your curiosity.
