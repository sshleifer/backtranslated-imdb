In one case, it is like 'The Wizard of Oz', with black and white and Riviera with Paris. But in reality the designer gowns, Rivera's shots, big expensive cars, and music and dancing interlates are talking about the piano minnell, which represents one of his off-days, which concerns love, destitution and moral decline. It is worth noting, but a unique example of undesirable, dark storytelling and attractive style, heading in opposite directions. (Is not this a model for The Talented Mr. Replay? Will anyone have a connection between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
