The film is very bad and is worse in every imaginable way. Its poor performance and scripts are not just a lame and bizarre time. The authors and producers who really keep this film in my hall ashamed is to try the film and make it funny is obviously struggling. Actress, who replaced Jean Reno's legacy, has learned her lesson in the first film and adds a new girl who will be married. Almost all the original additions and gags back but this time it makes me want to get my eyes ripe from my sockets because it's definitely a good film's waste. Any scene in the film can be seen as a constant camera cuts and shotguns, making the viewer a violent confusing. The second film will be taken as a realistic hit and out of its coffin and the corpse in the public square and only harms the original idea and its legacy but our intellect. Unlike this novel, the Principals do not have plots in return for 'necklace'. This script is clearly written and does not exist since the script has been added daily. Do not mind the camera or shots in mind. For doing poor lighting and special effects. The film did not appear in Basis Film 101 as a student film. This is a big loose investment and it seems to have the strength to keep this unnatural brutal mistake from our misfortunes. This film is a good piece ... its END! The film is my # 1 worst movie all the time, and finally "Howard the Duck" is not a goose.
