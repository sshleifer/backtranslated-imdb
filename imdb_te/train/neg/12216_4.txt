Do not make me wrong - I love David Suchet as I go. I love the series as well as movies but already enough already: Nail on Death. Everyone has done it! We know who will die. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it happened. I already said it already! One of the novels of Mr. Suchet Agatha Christie's could use the fantastic talent. I will say that all actors acting is amazing. The sets are amazing and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised to see how he was "terrified". I hope I will not be that way in real life! I honestly can not remember that the very end from other movies is the same. Something I do not think so. I thought it was a brilliant touch whether I wrote it or not. I will be wasted in prison after being in prison!
