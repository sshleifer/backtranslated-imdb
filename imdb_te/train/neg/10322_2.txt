If you're hurt or entertaining or both, you'll probably see someone else. LMOTP is not really a great idea to rehearse beyond rehashing simple crazy clich√©s. <br /> In the second half, I felt uncomfortable. I sat through the compounded mess. <br /> <br /> CBC is exclusively productive in commentary and entertainment outside the thinly veiled Jimmykie campus, lame, harmful and anti-septic effort. And once "ZOMG Muslims in ROLAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" Hype wears his welcome out, because the show judges its benefits is because it is very depth because of the possibility to follow into the canceled ether. <br /> <br /> You are amused by many minute sensibilities on the subject you are engaged with Muslim culture in the West and do not see how easily / really enjoying it satisfying with the curiosity derived from the LMOTP hype. Other programs highlight the cultural / ethnic biometric issue of Western multi-ethnic communities. LMOTP never ranks in entertainment or insight.
