This film deals with a social commentary, in fact it is ridiculous as much racism as every bit condemns it. The mantle of the film: African-American = Strong ... Any other breed = weak. Rapaport is the worst part of the Omar Eps and a gunpowder over a Jewish man. The Jewish guy, in a stereotypical manner, gets scared and prepares for his life ... But the big, strong, offended Omar Epps is filled with fear. We are also confused by every brother member. The rape is a white girl, in fact, since she is just a weak white girl, it takes into consideration homosexuals. When he is rejected by a frustrated white man, he really comes on the skin of the skulls, who are wonderful cowardly; The black muscles were hard hit by the big muscle in particular. Wait ... Bassa Royce Beat a GUY TWICE HIS SIZE ??? <br /> <br /> Blacks reject their own people and easily move them with Omar Eps. Ice Cube threatens his White Roommates and puts them in line The scenes are just stupid - of course he dominates, his weak white roommates sit in fear of him. This film is just terrible and the end has made me laugh really loud. The overwhelming slow motion between Eps and Banks gets happy with the faces they make - like my nephew and cousins ​​making faces at each other (and they're all under 5). Make yourself a favor and cross this litter.
