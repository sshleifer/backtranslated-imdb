I love ... Peter Sellers is one of the most outstanding talented actors. But the selection of films after 1964 was very unfortunate. He did not realize how to use his talent. He's good to work with Kubrick's of the movie than the people he did. In his later films, "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" only attracted me. <br /> <br /> Before this, boultings and sellers did some movies and it's not too bad - I'm "Carlton Brown" and "Heaven's Above!" - in the sense of using at least one degree sellers. But, "There's a Girl in My Soup" is really a poor image and part of the dealer in terms of character is a terrible choice. In his films from 1955-64, you can expect at least some very inventive twist and always a troubled belief in his roles. Here, you are trying to play a simple romantic lead to Peter Sellers. It's a silent cellar that is playing quietly. He certainly does not persuade, he will try, or create an interesting character. <br /> <br /> He left such parts to the owners of the golden age like Cary Grant, and was famous for his famous dramatic and humorous roles. <br /> <br /> Pamphlets and sellers do not really make any real chemistry; This is not a simple, affordable love that matches exactly with William Powell and Myrna Lail. It's quite artificial, by all means - I know he's part of the role of Donwars and he's the powder of the ladies, but he does not really change that convincingly. Sellers "charm" is very much appreciated ... This character does not really have any depth, really does not get the viewer's sympathy or interest. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Lolita" passes through the movements of his shift when identifying the miracles of the iconoclasty appearance. <br /> <br /> There is nothing really about the plot, the direction or the characters, apparently they leave less or no impression. This is one of the most anemic, complacent, misleading and lightly cynical films I've ever seen. The inability of "vehicle" to sellers' controversial talents. <br /> <br /> <br />
