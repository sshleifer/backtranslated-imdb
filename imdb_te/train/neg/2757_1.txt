I'm a man who loves Guy movies ... I'm looking forward to fighting a special dragon with an army of amazing special effects. However, this is the film I have seen so far in my life. <br /> <br /> The story is standard, but the character of the story is terrible. The scene transitions are the worst I've ever seen. If your life is at risk, why not remove it? The snake dragon's actions are poorly written ... and the snake dragon's attacking capabilities are widespread throughout the film, many of the main characters die. <br /> <br /> When the director's love story was very stressful in the film, it was not viewed after the film was built, I loved the movies, but had to force me to finish, I thank God who did not buy this, I'm a friend <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, With just see ... very Warmness Discovery Channel.
