The film was disappointing even though I was appreciated in the DVD cover of the version I took. Yes, it is more realistic than other war films of the period when the irritability of mud, boredom and grunt is, but unfortunately the film comes from what it thinks of everything. No plot and dialogue is unchanged. A good war film is not a five-minute battle sequence. One of the best World War II movies, "Twelve Oaklaw Hai," is a lot less work. But the conversation and emotional tension will be replaced by cracking. The "Story of GIJ" exception is a small warship (in "City Under Siege" DVD) in Italy. This is one of the most fast and persuasive fighting scenes of any war film. But alas, the rest of the movie is not worth looking for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dandarro, played by Wally Cassell, is a mistake that does not mean "Romeo". In contrast, Sargent. Foolish person, a sympathetic to the race. As Captain Walker (Mitchum) says when he was volunteering for another junior: "Every step is one step ahead ... home." But the last step ?? A patrol too ?? He drives him on the mental brink. Very bad film does not do justice to some otherwise fine. The filming of the pile of Marineth ... It is practically komotos.
