The film, after the film's specialty, is a low budget and the lowest of all. I guess it's supposed to be a sort of inspirational movie, but it does not work for me. Look how some across it preachy.it flash shots are very pale shades, but what? There is no excitement in this film. The conversation is kill and clichéd. Of course, the whole picture feels like a bad 80's cliché. Acting is low, yet there is a lot more to do with actors (or not in this case). The above mentioned poor song choices are really bad literature. All the actors participated.All the talented, but you can not tell from this movie.This course is just my opinion, but I give a 1/10 Dream to give AKA Dream to be Believe
