Rossi wasted time on TV many times, saying that he had a superior effect on the modern day Puerto Ricón's dynamics. They are not. The truth is that Africans and Spanish and she knows. What killed me was that how some of the light skin black chick (with a clear black daddy, cousins ​​and pinch) influenced their Spanish speaking approach, food and music, as she pretends to recognize the true reality of modern Puerto Ricans. She is very typical and I have lost much of her respect for her and she does not support anything else. Also, she does not want to take more roles in black (ie Blake Blues) after she wants to dance around her African-ness. <br /> <br /> We can find a priceless black Latino (thanks to Joltarres, Jina Torres, Gina Rarana and Melissa Dasasa) for the Puerto Rican where the Puerto Rico here says they are African and not "Black". ... Thank you. We are "blacks" absolutely nothing with "you", so love is not lost. But, we would like for you to reject any good human therapy that you receive from the "blacks" blood, sweat and tears courtesy from the "blacks" you share nothing from the benefit of the Probably and Civil Rights movement in the States. <br /> If I am correct, Puerto Ricans have a terrible picture in the media, but blacks are trying to discredit your time because all the media are minorities to maintain minorities and generalizations of minorities and behaviors. However, you're obviously slipping into the hype, you're somehow white or upward ... you're not. Also, you feel compelled to believe that something is black BET culture ... again you need to take the wrong and leave the holiday out of the hood. Try visiting Atlanta, G., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, NC. No black people should claim your "culture".
