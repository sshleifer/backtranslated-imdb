After watching Hot Eliza Dushu in a pretty good wrong turn, I chose this film instead of the Return of the Living Dead of all the movies. Yet I have not yet seen, but one of the most popular horror films I have ever seen. There is nothing to recommend this film, and talking about the supposed killer cut. I do not even have a mediocre youth sex appeal for poor movies like Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend What You Know About. It just does not sense, having no excitement, has very little interesting acting or compelling writing. The date of release was dropped several times over a year and the reason is clear. Some of the meaningless sequences are confused and misunderstood. If you want to see a dish instead, turn it wrong. I would like to see a movie with her and Super-Elisabeth Harnovi - but I think this film is going to look like. Casey Affleck in Good Will Hunting is awesome here - he has two intelligence and guts. It fits in one.
