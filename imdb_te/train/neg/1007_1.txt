I found it difficult to see this after 5 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot line is very tight and dull, acting is awful, especially if he is really good from Justin Timberlake (he is singing as Dirt and voiced). Morgan Freeman seemed very inconvenient, especially after him and after Timberlake's concert, dancing to halfway on the half way to sing music. Freeman and Timberlake's characters are thought to have some kind of father / son relationship or something that is not clear in reality; <br /> <br /> Freeman's character seems to be defensive to the innocent and intelligent Timberlake character, but he pulls out all the gaps to uncover a completely ridiculous face. To give any credit to the incredible suspension story of infidelity, it is simply absurd and gets out of all ratios. <br /> Do not look at this film, it's the pure waste of time.
