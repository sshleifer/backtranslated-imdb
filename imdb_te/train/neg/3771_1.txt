It was one of the worst films of the 1990s. My friends & I watched the first half hour with our jaws that we sat down & really hit the floor at really bad when I saw this film (targeted at target audience). For the rest of the time, everyone in the theater started talking to each other, leaving them in their popcorn or paying for the work they usually pay to see this weaker excitement for the film. Though it looks like a good idea on the paper, it does not look like what's going on in the movie, it's what it looks like. Worst acting, garbage wear. I can not see how insulting it is to see. Save yourself an hour and a part of your life .........
