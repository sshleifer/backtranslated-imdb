There are many good actors (Robert Logia, Ellen Parker), good plot (mysterious missile from space), and most of the stock footage (the image of Air Force's Jets firing rockets, which is used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by play and impossible time line. <br /> The film is a missile from the location where the Soviets were attacked and accidentally diverted into a low-atmospheric orbit. With a speed of more than five miles and more than 4,000 miles, it exits a million degrees, excluding the glaciers, long-range alert (DEW) line bases and eskimos, all of the ground on fire. Every attempt to destroy the missile will fail. <br /> <br /> The first flaws appear in the film. We can not expect much from low-budget movies, some things do not forget - like little research. For example, both the Soviets and the US anti-fire anti-missile missiles have been consistent with the accuracy of the missile. However, until March 1961, Russians did not complete the first successful ABM tests. <br /> <br /> There is so much play. Dr. Loring (Lagi√°) and his assistant Jon Woods (Ellen Parker) will play their love with a timber like a log cabin. Partner's character cries and bo-hooes at Laghgaya sacrifice in her screen exam. He is a boring businessman. One scientist (Philip Pine) throws it up, William Shutner appears as a tense. A bus driver constantly spills out of the world's worst - end-of-scene after the scene. Only a good actor is a movie storyteller starring in the leading actor Lawrence Dawkins ("Naked City"). <br /> If this is not for time-line, all of these may ignore. After sending missile information to DC, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. A typical (Larry Kerr) missile was announced to hit New York City in 63 minutes. Thereafter, scientists are in talks and there is a deadly noise when the word from embassies asks to see if the missile is attacked by Russians and if a response is needed. <br /> <br /> The military is completely tied up. Civil Defense People leave the job and go to their stations. School buses face asylum seekers of eight million people choosing millions of children (and I've seen the white New York City I have ever seen, but look at the 50 science fiction films it's authentic). Press is kept in the dark for a minute. Then, a man at the Pentagon announced that the missile would attack Ottawa and Canada in 51 minutes! The above mentioned action took place within 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to fire, Lazia feels like a way to stop some alien missile. He slowly produces the celeload of plutonium, loads it on the jeep and takes it off to DC on a missile base from DC. Also, he knocked down the road through a wild driver, was broken up and then carjacked. Eventually he returns to Plutonium and takes over the missile. Again, this is the 63-minute time frame. <br /> <br /> The film also attracted the viewer, only to see that Ottawa was saved, men, women and children were found to shoot. The missile then had five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving the base (still to go to 4 miles). He reaches the base and gun missile, announces a two-minute countdown. Within five minutes. <br /> <br /> New York's boroughs are stirred at least. <br /> You will destroy the missile that you do not expect. The ABM warhead will destroy it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion will dissipate and clear to everything. <br /> <br /> There was a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshima in the suburbs of New York City and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The film has all the necessary elements to be a good B film, but wasted them. Laggia played his role, and you do not care that he has not sacrificed himself. You do not care about other characters, not even a long scientist who plays Pine. <br /> <br /> The film is in the scope of sexual intercourse (it is still not with Jack Bauer) under pressure to shake the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it is not reissued for any medium and good reason. I do not know if it is a film or a classic method, but the government has shown that the best scientists, commanders and businessmen send deep shelters, they're worth losing. There is no single woman or minority in the bunch. Hari Rhodes is the only black person in the film and comes with a slight bit of piano playing. It gives me the chance to save or destroy an alien five Earthlings planet and it is worse than "27 Days" he does not have any blacks or Hispanics <br /> <br /> I'm a fiction knight in a special science-Turner Classic Movies and I have shown it again. If you find this copy somewhere, you have to put it in Amazon.com.
