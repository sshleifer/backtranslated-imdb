This is the worst replica of the home alone movies ever seen! See part 1 and two, but do not let anyone say that this is Better than the First Two! I mean, really, you can not make a movie, make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I mean, it would have been better if it was not a "home alone" film, but they changed it to Home Alone. Culkin is now too old, so suppose you STOP make sequels! Excellent, this film makes me sick! Buy part 1 and 2.
