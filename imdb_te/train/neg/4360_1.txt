First, I have to say a lot about writing a comment for this film. The best review for this kind of film is just silence. Cinema housewives and grandparents. The film tries to look "real" and wants the characters to be "real people". The Italians do not think that they are "real": they are simply "low profile" stereotypes. This is what makes the Italian rural life very misleading. Plots are weak (plot? It's a plot?) And humor does not laugh more than 12 years.
