I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on the novel by science fiction writer Brian Aledis, the film tries to tell Tom and Barry Howe's twins twins picked from their family with an impresario to create a rock band from their team. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately Jimmy, the film is also very clever by half (if you forgive the punk). By combining genres, styles and sentiments, the directors (their previous movie is a magnificent documentary in Lost in Lounge in La Mancha) will make their way pretty quickly. I'm not sure whether I want to take it seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it's quite a bit. Plus, the rock and roll of promise does not move me. I've remembered a bit in the times of Hedwig and Angry Inches, and I found the original image and moving. But in this case, the songs are not so good, or the main characters are sympathetic. The more uncomfortable comparison will be similarly frustrating velvet goldmine.
