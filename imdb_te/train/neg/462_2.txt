It has come to be almost one of the bad movies of all time. Horror acting, awful script ... and they are good points! Sure one miss! Jokes, if you call them, are so predictable that curiosity should be. Pamela Anderson still relied on her body to remove it from the fact that her performance was just plastic! I agreed to give it a chance, hoping that it was going to be improved, alas, it did not! If you have a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle for a good read! I like Denis Richards, which is why I went to this movie, but she did not want to star in this movie!
