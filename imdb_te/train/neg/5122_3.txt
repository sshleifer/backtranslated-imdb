I cried and stunned fellow Christians to tell about my disappointment with the film. I'm hounded by this type of advertising: "I can not believe that I do not like it! It's made entirely by Christians!" "Everyone has donated their time and no one has been paid for the film! It's not Hollywood's a church, we have to spend our money on these pictures!" "It is a true church and a Christian school in Georgia! A writer wrote and directed." So, apparently, the reason I love this movie is just the way it is made and because it's the minimum amount that is used to make it and Christians. <br /> <br /> See, I have received the film without knowing anything about the background of the film. I never heard of it and no idea - something other than football - I said about it. I was disappointed with any other film. I was disappointed in lousy editing and sluggish script. I was very disappointed in the resolution after Climax. Do not worry. There are other cheap movies and other amazing movies that have earned me less respect. It's not about film making. This is the ultimate product. <br /> <br /> The author said that God does not say "yes" what we pray for, but he wants to show faith, God has changed our lives. That's true. However, God can change our lives and we are still ineffective. God can change our lives and can not get a raise from our job. God can change our lives and our car is still an old jalap. God can change our lives and our house is still stinky. Why did not he play the role in this film? <br /> <br /> Others have expressed their concern to the author / director in this regard, but clearly, he is defensive. <br /> <br /> I did not think acting was terrible or quite a lot of terrain shots. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I go to God and recognize his amazing power and our weakness. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing is very weak. It is easy to identify these characters because many characters develop. We're really getting coach wife and she's not pregnant (well, until the end of the movie). "I have a decapitated father and I can not play football very well, but I'm the winner's field goal, never before achieving a real goal." Another problem is the Christian school. Hmm, I worked for two Christian schools, I went to one another, and there were many nuns and wives in other Christian schools. All in all, I have some pretty close connections to ten different ones. All of these schools did not solve the issues I had seen. I saw their school totally surreal in the movie and they wanted to show human traits. <br /> <br /> Every thing - written or drawn or displayed on an instrument - I will close by telling the artist's world view. The world view shown to me in this movie "begs the successful ball games of the game, get new cars, get pregnant, raise up and stay in their home - span at all times." I like this film because of the repentance of the people I made. I think this is a good movie because it does not work well and is not for any other reasons.
