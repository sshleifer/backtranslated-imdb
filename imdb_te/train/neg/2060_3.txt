A harassing housewife (her troublesome lapsing Angie Dickinson, whose body cracks / her delicates frightened us with a severe closeup) sexually decides her husband gets bored and out of the department. This will soon get results in a string of murders containing a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, I'm in the wrong business if she wants to bring $ 600 a day for her home) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you want to see De Palma Rip off (I'm sorry, "pay it politely") see Hitchcock, instead of "Sisters". "Killed to Dress" while loading with style and technological expertise, is one of the troublesome thrillers I've had to sit in. The plot is absurd and tired. It has some surprisingly influential jump fears and the worst graphic murder scenes in the 1980s.
