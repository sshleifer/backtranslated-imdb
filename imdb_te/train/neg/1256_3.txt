The film's director, Tim Burton, tries to invest in a title known to bring his "eye" on the screen. He did it with Batman, Sleepy Hollow and has just done it. It's not remake. The only thing that is common in the genre is that it speaks of spoken speakers (and Charlton Heston plays a guest role). Burton rebuilt the story, and it will water up to today's mass audience. <br /> APPS is the product of its time on the original Planet. In the 1960s, the United States struggled to redefine its civilization. This is the tumultuous time of the soul that searches and rethinks social norms. Civil rights era that demanded equal treatment of long-standing groups. In this case, POTA reflects the philosophical confusion facing daily audience. POTA is a very intelligent film that captures complex questions and beautifully censored the oppression of the American community, justifying his criminal investigator in the lowest possible species. Colonel Taylor (Charleston Heston), Dr. He was intelligent and intelligent with intellectual and intelligent intelligence between Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) and Dr Zira (Kim Hunter). <br /> <br /> Burton's version is from the sixties produced in today's times as much as pot. This is Apes for Dummies. This is the surface and geezoon, changing politically correct methods for brilliant dialogue and focusing more on the form than material. Nothing comes to the picture except the cliffhanger that the 'surprise' ending is totally exaggerating and set the sequel. The end of Burton's discontinuation of the audience, "I know something you do not know, and you have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br /> From the technical point of view of Burton, as always The film is awesome and the decoration is amazing and the Burton's camerawork is impossible <br /> <br /> The story is compressed with a monster, with Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a human being, to fight the ruthless Apes The band was mixed with some turnkeys (especially Helena Bonham Carter Ari <br /> <br /> Today's fast food is very simple and simplistic with violence, simplicity and simplicity for this show. <br /> <br /> Acting is mixed, and Mark Wolfberg is a mistaken actor in this role. He is sad but playful with playing scathing characters. This episode needs an inspirational hero, not at Walmart's concert. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor, whose role is close to his ability, the disconnect is funnier. <br /> <br /> She tries to do something in her narrative role, but her comment is like a cross between college peacekeeper and loves a sick young man. <br /> <br /> Then Tim Roth is there. He will save the film from the whole tide with the worst performance, single walk. Roth is outrageous as General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and deadly bad guys I can remember in some time. In addition, his physical acting exaggeration translates a chimp man, which can almost certainly be believed to be a species. <br /> <br /> This film is a great disappointment. It is good entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rate it as 3/10. This is very good from the technical perspective, perhaps 9/10. This story is an insult to the original franchise. This is just another attempt at Burton's self-promotion, by using a famous title to attract boxes to the box office, to see how great he is. In fact, this is true, but instead of the usual minded pop up for collective use, it is great if he uses that talent to produce significant images.
