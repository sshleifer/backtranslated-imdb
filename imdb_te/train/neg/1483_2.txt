I gave this ridiculous, well-known comedy horror movie 2 because it has seen many famous porn stars in the past. In Ireland, but actually a group of vacation vacationers in Canada, cannibals, cannibals or something is run, and this is more or less in the Hillhay EYES and WRONG turn. The only problem, unless I miscounted, the show was only a converted one, and he was not that impressive. A home in the house from five years ago is like a potapleid mommy. Some help the ghrey but crazy deaths, but the film is definitely an amateur night and boring beyond belief. The end was predictable and death was done. Number pun intended.
