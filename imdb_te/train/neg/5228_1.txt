I saw this movie tonight. I can not begin to express how much this picture sucks. Writing, voice acting, even claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching a 24-hour C-span for comedy. It does not work. <br /> <br /> Also, cinematography is very low quality. I know this person is an image made by one person, but at least he can make the second of the second one to think that he can make the 97th worst value. <br /> <br /> This show is cake for being the worst image of all time. Oh, no. It's not really bad. If you're looking for an image that you're laughing, get clear from this abhorrent. My advice: Whether it's worth it or not. Your brain is more than you.
