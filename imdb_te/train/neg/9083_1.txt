It's terrible. Seeing everything is not fun. Even if the girl is using a vibration, it is not fun to watch this movie. I said it again, it's not fun to see a girl cheating with a vibrator. Or if only a piece of movie you see, just a girl using a move on the bed. They probably had to release a scene in the theaters, then the film was enjoying some degree. My suggestion, forward to that point, watch it, rewind the picture, look again, rewind, repeat. Perhaps you can enjoy it for 2 hours. In this movie I spit in the worst films I've had on your tomb and Doom waves.
