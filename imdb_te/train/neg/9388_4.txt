The security guard of the former private eye falls into his latest work and gets a chance to return to his previous career. His appointment: a newly-arrived French woman in California ... and suit and tie ricketkers wanted. An unsuccessful attempt to update the film Noir style without adequate sting or not (or without plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-composer Paul Magwood (edited without his film without his image) does not seem to have a high regard for the 40 films from the "Chandler"; His nostalgia is crumbling, but it is also bitter-fired and somewhat different. Handling is an interesting, appreciative low-key, and Warren Oats is doing well as 70 variants in this '70 Dig Variant Archie ', which does not have any snap. The cast is nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - though much has to do, and is exasperating across Karen's hot and cold running character. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stenwold, a good location shooting, but it did not come in any way. **** from * 1/2
