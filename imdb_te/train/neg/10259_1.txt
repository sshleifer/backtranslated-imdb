Whenever I was a child I always saw this movie in the theater and always remember it as my first experience of discovering a commercially awful movie. The trade is good, but I find that it has a whole explosion or some of the overall image (almost 4) and some non-image that are not in the image. There were some kind of alien residents but aliens never actually showed in the film. It is making a buck from a cheap cobbled film designed for the scam people. I guess my world of innocence which ended that day, I find there are bad people out there who make bad bad movies.
