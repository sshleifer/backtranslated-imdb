This is the only film I have ever played. Bad acting - bad storyline - bad cast - bad direction - bad cinematography - if they make a bad image they can not do better work. I hope they are proud of his turkey. I am surprised by those who have been associated with this film, which I have never been in Hollywood again. Do not waste your time!
