I purchased Unhinged because I was asleep by the image of Gothry on the face. If you want to see all the good parts of the film, see the box immediately. <br /> <br /> All the murders are shown in the film and I can say honestly they will still look good in the frames. <br /> Let's look at this plot. College girls (driving through a deep, dark woods, one of the longest driving sequences ever taken on the road) landed on a rock concert. The car was not visible to the car, but apparently it was enough to keep a character in the rest of the film in a movie (or possibly a script, and a coma before filming begins). <br /> <br /> Two girls are awake in a large, discrete home. The house, by the way, is more spectacular and plays more drama through its existence than any of the actors in the film. For some reason, this house does not have any roads. The only way you can go to the main road is to hike five miles through Woods. The girls spent the rest of the sitting sitting unhinged around an old-fashioned bitch (George Washington in the drag looks) and listening to whimsical conversations between her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. <br /> <br /> There are no girls who want to come back from the concert that we have dressed more than Guilligan Island's cast for a three-hour tour. <br /> When we look at the viewers, kill scenes, we no longer care. We want someone to kill us to end our pain. Eventually, it was finally shut down as the surprise was finally over and the surprise ended. Moreover, a good idea was written first in the film, and the authors later tried to lead a film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It's not worth it to remember how badly this movie will be, but never goes back for about two minutes, but it's not worth remembering. Do not waste your time. You just feel unhinged and want to recover your time and money.
