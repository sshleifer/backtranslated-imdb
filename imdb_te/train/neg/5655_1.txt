Egyptian films feature high-profile films with drama or romance or comedy or action sports ... "Jeab La Tahokhl El Lam" is prohibited in Egypt because it is content nudity (full frontal female nudity) and this kind of nudity is prohibited in Egyptian films. I saw the movies I felt down ... the fool story .. nude actress .. bad Action .. Some Horror & Horror Colors .. Dear friend .. You wanna see a great Egyptian movie ... Just: Farm Stay Away "Zayab La T'cohl El Lam." We have great movies in Egypt ... We are great actors who have achieved global success: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb. We have great directors like Yusuf Shahin, so you should not watch this movie ..
