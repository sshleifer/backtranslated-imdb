This film is horrific. Good fight scenes or acting is really bad, like telling you to read their lines from the card. With the cast line everyone's traumatic line delivery. Looking at the high school drama and the absence of softness in the interaction of actors (unnatural interruptions between lines of a different character, combined with fried line delivery with others). If the film is all the actions, it may be a forgery, but most movie plot has a setup and family guy style, rare cut-outs (oh, wow, they are bad). I assumed I was trying to be funny with this, but it came off a bunch of high schools / college entry students goofing for the afternoon trying to establish a funny Youtube clip again. <br /> Now fighting scenes. It is not very bad to take into consideration the level of quality found in the picture everywhere. Other posters are not exactly the same as they say. (Not like a Drunken master). Combats have excessive performances, with participants having different angles with different positions. <br /> <br /> In sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you are one of the friends of the person involved in this very, very cheap product. Any person you may ask? Oh, the same person who wrote and directed this middle school masterpiece.
