Everything in the picture is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take, for example, Mike Myers. He reached the discerning point ten years ago, did not change his shtick from his SNL days. He makes the same cutesy stream-off-conscious jokes and the same voices. His cat is painful unfunny. He tries harder way. He's some weird method of a comedian, he's not a cool cat. The rest of the movie is just bad. Senses are unbelievably ugly - and obviously millions of dollars waste. (The cardboard cut-out for background buildings makes more sense than building buildings and mainstream street.) Alec Balvin's funny tries to impress the great Santa's seal, but he is watching and abusive. There is also a right cheese moment with Fox Celebrity Paris Hilton --- this is a stinging mind in the mind of a doctor sauce story. Avoid this picture at all costs and folks. It's also not an interesting train wreck. (I hope that Horton Hears will do a job with Robert Williams, then we will have a bad-cover movie-starring-spaghetti-comedian trilogy.)
