.... This young age is not good. I saw this and it was actually aired when it was broadcast, and many others abandoned. In early 2002, I received novels for WOW and W and R and attracted more. I decided to see both again and invest in $ 200 plus DVD sets. <br /> <br /> I bought novels and received DVDs. <br /> Do you believe it is wrongly misunderstood? Read the novels and look for yourself. Do not consider this date? <br /> <br /> This little Don Curtis himself chose Ali MacGregor and Robert Mitchem. Boo !! The product quality, music scoring, dialogue - has become a softer ambitious producer / director of the late 70's soap opera that has a big story on his head. It's up to the minute long. <br /> <br /> We are very happy for the original broadcast and those who see them. IMO - This mini does not spend its reputation and is deeply disappointing.
