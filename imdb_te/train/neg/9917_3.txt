When Stanwick's husband is murdered during their marriage, she goes to a mountain lodge where she falls on a hill and is protected by wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls in love with him, in Chicago's huge estate (looks like encircled by the mountains!) Certainly leads to one-sided marriage. <br /> <br /> The film is a great cast (especially Morgan one of my favorites) and great director. , But the script is in the brain and at times. I'm ready to enjoy this movie, but I'm finally disappointed. It is still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes the 1930s movies.
