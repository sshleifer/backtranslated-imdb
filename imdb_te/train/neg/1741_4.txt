Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal Combo is gold with the likes of Hera Ferrari and Hangama, so I went with great hopes for the film (especially at Indian multiplex), especially after inspirational rewards. Unfortunately, like the earlier Hulkul, the film was very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Others commented, the old movie that is already started, it's just not improving, or extra layers. Some time later, you can go home because you want to close the movie (it's easy to reduce my losses if I'm looking at home). Akshay Kumar's performance is good and John Abraham can not repeat the comedy. The whole movie's comedy stuff is pretty weekend. I'm gonna double the whole movie. There is no laughter to laugh at the birds that served me at Hera Ferrill or Avera Pagal Deva. <br /> <br /> Paresh Rawl has some of the classic moments he had imagined, but overall, he did not give much room for his character and character, because he did not have much influence on the film. <br /> <br /> In the Neha film, Dhupia was the only one who saw her when she was on the screen. And some songs are fun. Especially for the opening and closing of ADA and KISS ME Baby, respectively. Otherwise, it's good that you just pass on this film.
