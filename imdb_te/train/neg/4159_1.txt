In this fantastically-intolerable apocalypse, the dual plague of zombies and vampires in the world suffers, but this is not quite worried about this grade-Z film, which is more than just a parody of Sheridan Le Fan's famous short novel about my mother's lasagna. The boredom still runs gas stations and physicians are still home calls and assisted police officers are still visible with radiation fluid when you need them. Plot, and I use that word loosely, at a church to kill a vampire who happens to be traveling by father, whose daughter does not rendevous with "General," a father and daughter. I agree that a moment of real humor can be seen either in the vast expanses of random humor. There is only enough nudity to keep the boy with fourteen interest in the film. Anyone with ancient caution.
