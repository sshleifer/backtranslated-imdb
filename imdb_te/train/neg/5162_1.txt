The film of "A History of Violence" reminds me of a close study of violent violence and violent behavior that reminds me of the film, but some people end up being less of a low-action film portraying some violence on some violence. Dustin Hoffmann and his new British bride go into a small English town and face endless harassment from local drunkards, but they hang in the pub throughout the day. Does not these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything he takes and loses every one of the drunken attackers, losing a whiskey at the end of his home and hitting anyone whiskey, a shotgun and someone grabbing the head bear a trap. <br /> <br /> In a small British town it is necessary to have a big beard with anyone. <br /> <br /> Sam Pekingpah, who designed "wild bunch", did not allow blood, no one survived. But it is done with style, and you believe it. Straw Dogs are not reliable. The first of all locations is wrong and does not work. Why put in England? I might be in some inner cities or in a small town in the American South in the 1930s. Secondly, it is clear that this is not in my mind, and these men clearly explained how torture would be, they were in a drunken and thought to kill Huffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpa is it.
