I like character based films. I also think that Hope Davis will change the constant good work, I have high hopes for this film. <br /> <br /> The main flaw is in this direction. There are many scenes in the daily scene. The film uses the character of Denis Liarry as the aloof of the Campbell Scott character. It does not work for me. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this storyline. The characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place where they start. <br /> Finally, editing has not done well. <br /> <br /> Without acting, it seems to be stronger and the film has failed in every aspect of the film.
