I am a huge stooges fan but it is one of the film and the only quality that is just curly is it. In this way he was a classic self (and not Larry's bad) at a time when he started drinking heavily. Mo's role is a simpler episode (mostly) and the film is named "The Curly and Larry Movie". Stooges movies are not very good at any (in my opinion), but a commenter says here, how sad this movie is to have a real potential. Casting is good, it is well directed, filmed and edited, but the story line attempts to throw some stooges with antics and musical numbers (I'm back again). Do it for yourself in this movie, waiting for the carry / lorry sequences and to find something in the kitchen to eat it and remove the garbage (relative to the can).
