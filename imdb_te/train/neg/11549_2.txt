Despite some fun moments, the movie is very lame. And it's gone, it's worse. After entering this work into the Monument Valley, I have seen amazing episodes than the crazy and incredible interactions of the characters. <br /> <br /> The daughter's character is particularly irrelevant. First she is in agreement, then realizes the truth and she bails. Then she will repeat again and again. Then she came back. There is no clear motivation for her decisions. Interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many possibilities have been lost. I would have to say that the pictures are much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently people who like Repo Match have been inclined to like this. Searchers do not have a match for researchers.
