Now let's see. What's funny in the first film? I know, funny accents, people falling into the water, crazy boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have distorted any good part, not good. Not many people fall into the water, it's not good. Boat crash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Not only that, they have many people in the film. This film is not about water, not on Earth. Sorry to say that the distance between funny episodes is too far away and the sponsors of the film will be exploited. Not good. In all, I give from ten to four since I have some funny episodes.
