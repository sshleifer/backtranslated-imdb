I saw this film in 1979 when I was 17 or 18 when it was released. 1/4 complete when the theater movie starts. In the film ten minutes and two friends in the theater who went with me were just two people. The film was really unreal and its script had no plot or causes and demanded to recover their money. We have decided to stay for the whole movie .... why are you enduring such violence? We wanted to be a true film critic ... it's hard to justify the best (a 10) to have a standard of building on all other movies. But it's easy to build up all the worst pictures of the previous one (and it's the best one ... it's the best one). There are other movies really deserved as a 1, but I have yet to see them. I'm basing now all the movies that I see in a movie based on this rubbish film .... I am a true movie credit ... he is.
