Well, first off, if you check the rebellion of zombies as some very early night of the Living Dead (1968) -Recember movie, forget it. This is about a more mental attitude of "zombies", the term refers to a person who is not in control of their will, but to someone else. Here are the "zombies", as small as they are in the picture, are usually in war and are usually subject to state or authority. <br /> <br /> The film was set during World War I. A "French Cambodian" has heard strange stories about the contingency of the aggressor - supposedly built by the use of Anchor Wat - zombies and there are stories of zombie armies that easily overcomes enemies. Armand Louq (Dean Jagger) brought back a priest, who recognizes Rajanism secretly, but he does not speak. <br /> <br /> "The odd things about the uprising of zombies are probably the author / director Victor Halperin It is similar to the way the game is planned to change its plan during the shooting of the script, which explores the zombie / military metaphor, and begins with the adventure items, but about 15 minutes later, it changes the gears and the love story of the love story <br /> <br /> The film is of interest to Halperin's will and power (and neutention "power"), which is interesting at that level, but the script and editing are very unstable. <br /> <br /> There are also old scenes, especially when a few scenes are fade or cut, attempting to refer to a zombie thread, but The zombie matter mechanics are obscure and confusing, the super-modulated footage of Bella Lugosi's Googly Eyes from the 1932 film White White also resorts to the Hollerine resorts, but it has something to do Never explains about it. There are lots of spaces in space including love story. Promises, interesting characters from the early reels are a long time disappear. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of antique, big different B movies, the rebellion of zombies may be worth watching at least once - if acting is not all bad, and you have good imagination, you put together an interesting story in your mind to fill all of the spaces Can be cut into pieces. But the first time I saw this film for the first time five years ago, I can not remember anything about it - so it's not exactly forgetting.
