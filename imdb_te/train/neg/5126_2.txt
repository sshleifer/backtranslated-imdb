I hired this movie because I hoped the whole family would enjoy it. Although this film is a friendly family, my family is not happy because it gives me the wrong impression of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You will not get awesome better grades. Infertility is always cured. You can not always get a raise. Sometimes, you get stuck with an old car. <br /> God does not meet our every maneuver. Instead, he was created to glorify him. Sometimes we glorify him when he appears to be bad. Christ to live The benefit of dying.
