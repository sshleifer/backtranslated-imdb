I did not expect much from this TV movie. <br /> <br /> For any TBS film featuring Antonio Sabato Junior you will need to set the midget limbo to be less than bar. However, it has also failed to be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene is lean back and says, "My work is done", by cutting and pasting scenes of anyone dealing with big business conspiracies even into the script from a dozen movies and TV shows. <br /> <br /> Earlier, if you were "mentally ill for mental disorder" see "X-Files". They work better. Also, please tell someone that you might be sitting by "Fatal Error".
