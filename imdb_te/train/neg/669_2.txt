I normally have the opinion of myself, but I returned from this film and thought to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fanatics. But what does the horror film do? I want to see even a bit of good script and character development. I know that they do not have to be in the horror films, but the Prom Night was what made no effort in that segment. Later, we all love the suspense. On the edge of your seat suspense with unexpected surprises. Yes, there is no one in Prom Night! However, we like an awful killer. Is that the Prom Night? No, it's pretty boy with a beautiful lil 'knife. And if all else fails ... at least the horror Gore has been guilty of its guilty pleasures to make it look like Gore Gore, and the occasional naked scene! Yes, when the horror movie like PG-13, like Prom Night, is good for you, they also leave that point. So these things are not there, I'm asking .... is it still considered horror film? Nope. I'll call more comedy. I feel that those in my theater are laughing at this point, and when I think they are really "funny", I think they're comedy (which sucks, but another story!). I think I should leave in new horror. Film Studios have been rebuilt into the worst of all the good horror movies of good ol 'days to earn money. The people I went to see did not say this remake. It made me mad! Wondering what will happen when there are no more films to remake ??? Where next will scare ???
