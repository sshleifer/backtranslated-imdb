This tiresome, like Las Vegas's Casino Heast movie, is almost impossible to watch and participate. This is what you see. Two good things in this movie are attached to the beautiful Stella Stevens and one she spent the entire program hoping she'll come out of one of those skimpy tops that she wears. Las Vegas (when it's still a cool place to visit) in the mid-70s Many great shots and day fashions are also good for a giggling laugh. Otherwise, a bigger one. The Rhino DVD has a very good wide screen transfer, but it's still not worth it in my humble opinion under 10 bucks.
