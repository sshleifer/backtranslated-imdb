Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, Vanity Trade Faith) with his local Jindin, Australian fishing buddies, weekend holiday, entertainment, and relaxation. But when Stewart realized that the body of an Aboriginal woman was floating in the face of a river, things became worse. The biggest crash of men is the men's category. They are not far from the valley, and instead some great catches finish their fishing weekend. Then they report headaches and body. <br /> <br /> The town and men's lives quickly become confusing. Local media trembled, and there were allegations of adivasi bias from local natives. <br /> Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, Emily Ross the Exorcis) struggles with her own mental illness, deeply grasping what her husband and his friends do. <br /> <br /> This young girl's life, now a media scene, is splayed in a Morgag slab among these chaos. <br /> <br /> She murders and then dumping into the water indicates what is in the town of Jindibin: men and women, a black and white, social and excluded department. <br /> <br /> The other two youngest children who are understandable are: Eight years after Stewart and Claire's son Asea's mother were killed eight years ago. The young woman lives with her grandparents and tries to make her the best way to her mother, and the new body's discovery seems ?? Surprisingly enough ?? <br /> <br /> Everyone in this zindipine township seems to bow down under its surface, but none of them dive into narrow waters and around (a nearby lake that uses for recreation and swimming includes the Jindibine old town under its surface Symbolic representation). <br /> <br /> Clair has nothing to force them to do. There are many story stories to be explored and it has not finished; Very loose threads. Acting is okay, but filming is terrible. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the symbolic films, Northfark is one of my all-time favorite of that vein. Zindabin has been able to see its own problems that are needed to pull up its heads up to the water, which just does not happen.
