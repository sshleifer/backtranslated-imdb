Mood, music and decor is a movie which is not enough to make a good image. Sure, the director treated many fine scenes in Los Angeles in thirty - I especially liked the trolley's approaching tunnel, and the tram mounted up the hill - but this fine cinematography is self-defeating at one angle because it creates a mood called "something going on" - and nothing. The script also puts some plots or feeling towards the action or injury - and time is no longer delivered. The film's plot (I imagine) the character and the emergency abuse of the characters have not been distributed. <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland, both the protagonists and their characters, are pretty handsome and have not given any repression or anguish. Another story. His character was very impressed, so play perfectly, I wanted the camera to follow him.
