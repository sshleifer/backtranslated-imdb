Pretty Crazy Hoodunit has a black cast, which attempts to find a killing film trumpet player who thinks it's going to make it to Hollywood. Is this his wife? His girlfriend? His Wood-Be-Girlfriend? Her father? His butler? Newspaper guy? Who knows? Who cares? The result is a bit of a sequence, and the actors really do not have a mood for me to find it one way or another. Why is the weapon snake poisoned? Who knows? Who cares? This music is alright, but it's a bit shorter, and most of these are pretty "this is not your time". All the black cast movies are good there.
