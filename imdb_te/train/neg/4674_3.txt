I do not know who, Blame Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance like Catherine is almost impossible to see. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin is doing a superior job - I'm worried about all inequality. His character is absolutely lovely and attractive. But certainly the Lead Lead did not show enough greedy, to put up with silliness. Chaplin behaves by not being able to understand the signal and sympathy of the leap, and she is incapable of surgery. There is some element of belief in his interest, but it is incomprehensible as it is played. Performances do not have jeeps. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, are fantastic despite any attempt to prevent them. Supporting cast is a joy to see. What is pity, too, is lovely to look product because the leads do not work together.
