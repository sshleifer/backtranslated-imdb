First 2/2/2003 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Jim Cummerid & Brian Smith) watched: The classic classic animated `101 dalmatians dub and un-astescular sequel sequel. Yes, the film's cinematic film will continue, but the problem is real. One of the great things about the original is the pace of the story, which has this one. The animation is also very exciting for Disney and we all have the same characters going all the same kind of story again. Disney Sequels and Back Make etc. We are going to stop boring .. etc. when we hire or stop buying this average fare they stopped.
