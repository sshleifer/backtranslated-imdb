I've been hoping to follow the classic story of Arabian Nights. Instead I was disappointed in a movie that I failed to keep my attention from scratch, even though I tried watching it twice! <br /> <br /> Karadin is a bonus in the film, but it is not as good as the actors do not like. <br /> <br /> Okay, the son of the dragon has many fans, but if you're looking for it, you've wondered to get something about the martial arts and plot line compared to Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras. If you want kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon, then you may be with Neinjas along with you.
