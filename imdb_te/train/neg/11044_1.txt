'Hydrosphere' is shown in Australia, it's very bad to see that you're hypnotized and eventually looking at it, it's nice to see if it's worse ... and it does! The storyline is written by a high school dramatic class, the sets are curious but are smaller than the thumbnails, and the acting is the wood. <br /> <br /> The baby 'Muppet' seems to have been stolen from the fabric of the 'Total Recall'. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very bad, most of which I laughed. Malcolm MacDowell should hang his head in shame. He clearly needs money!
