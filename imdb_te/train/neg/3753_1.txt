Due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It contains pasted clips from the recurring cut + Season 2, and its author, Maurice Harley, is described as "terrible, terrible". <br /> <br /> The producers can not wait to shoot a good person they know. I am stunned by the strike and can only release the flashback episode, or perhaps Rodden Berry was very sick when he could cancel this half-assertion. This episode includes the last performance of Diana Muldar (Dr. Katherine Pulaski).
