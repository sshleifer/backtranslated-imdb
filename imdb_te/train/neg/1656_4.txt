The camera-work and busy (non-scratches) background score for anyone except for those who worship silent movies will make it a recap of the 1933 release. Although the sound was common in 1928, there were no fifty words to talk about a woman's story, and unfortunately she left her husband a young man after the romantic interruption in the weddings and forests. <br /> <br /> The most obvious photographs scene is the jealous husband giving the young man a lift for a ride in a town, where he continues to drive normally until the man realizes his wife lover. A frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed towards a railroad crossing but losing his nerves, changing his mind to the last moment. <br /> <br /> Haydie Lamar has done a great deal in her psychiatrist Marilyn Dietrich, but her beauty has not been refined by cosmeticians, even though she was transported to Hollywood. Her acting is very sad when her performance is mourning, her only real love (ARIBERT MOG), when she sees a beautiful young stud taken by her naked swim, recalls only brief moments of smile. > The swimming scene is very brief, cleverly photographed, and not all thermal values ​​that are clearly produced. A romantic scene, later filmed mostly by a film with a painting feature film - is clearly visible throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This is something that the film has to be a symbolic piece of writing. <br /> You can not do that. It was fortunate that the sound episodes (including background music in the background of symphony) and absolutely loyal B. Meyer featured in Miss Lamarr, and based on which she gave her a career in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It was clear that this work was silently filmed with camera. At the end, the "workers" scene will be too long and no one needs to be jerked. It failed to end the movie correctly.
