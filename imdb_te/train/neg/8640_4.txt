I saw 3/4 in this movie and I was surprised to see why horrible reviews were coming here. It's easy to see (at 3am). It has a good cast - Kevin Dillon's character of the Soviet-era serial killer is very believable - he is worse and sprinkled. The rest of the main characters are not so bad. <br /> This is your distinctive Anonymous / Suspense movie. A married couple can not get pregnant for the help of an abortion clinic. <br /> As I said, this film is very good .. We are growing "Canon" to become more and more engaged in raising his infant and creating the perfect family with his mother. In fact, he does not work for his plan. <br /> <br /> Last 15 minutes are just terrible. I'm pretty patient with movies (especially at 3 am) but I'm surprised how bad it was written. <br /> <br /> More than anything, I was not the worst movie I ever had, and I could not sit it again. <br /> <br /> The role of Kevin Dillon - Kevin Dillon is one of the best serial killers previously. Try it .. =)
