Okay, I can not think much worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of more stupid than five young men (not as normal as a normal teen)? Do you dance in the same suites with different colors? Fans, have you ever seen a real person who broke into a mental wall and is continuing to fight without being injured and wounded? <br /> <br /> Power Rangers for five years boys, and I believe, I did not like this show in five years. <br /> I can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. ACT as Teenage Teenage is actually, and Tommy Oliver actually works as a teacher, or number, as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Many people are Power Rangers worse, but I can not. It is a shame to the trash. So it suffers, the five year old boy, Power Rangers is the worst.
