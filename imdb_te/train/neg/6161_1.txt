This is probably the worst fencing, knife fight, ever made film. That's just not because the sports fencing is poor, but the plot, the characters they had to throw in the semi-nude sex scene and later, the Fencing Club is trying to group a dance around a fencing scene around the fencing club trying to save the audience's interest. F. Murray's talent was damaged. You have worked well in the films that are in the role of a villain like Zorro, Scoracci, Basil Rathbone. As a fencer I found the inequality of fencing to be a sport in the film, but if it ever happened, it would be good, with the best characters and a story with more depth.
