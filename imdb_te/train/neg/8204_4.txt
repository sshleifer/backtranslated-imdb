A disparate, overly predictable and just a little bit entertaining low budget rehash of a science fiction principle we've seen before hundreds of times - a group of scientists alone facing some unknown alien, and all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica <br /> Film James Spider and almost nominal cast (except Carl Lewis, non-actor Not really bad) - the ho-hum performances of the script to activate the conversation is far from unexpected. The pace of the film does not have nearly no signal to do things slowly, and some action sequences are stereotypical and not exciting. No wonder this thing went directly to the DVD. Spencer - Sometimes, Cannes has done an excellent job in an amazing actor and innovative sci-fi movie 'Stargate' to win Cannes Best Actor Award for 'Sex, Lies and Video Tape' - this poor project to choose to sign. <br /> <br /> One of the most remarkable about "foreign hunter" is that if they saw his career he would have put his skill in more misses than hits. Several items from many great science fiction films, and still make the topic incomplete and contrived. `The Thing '(Howard Hawk's original and John Carpenter's amazing 1982 remake), there are huge borrowers from both' Contact 'and' West Break '; Some of the references to 'Aliens', CE3K ',' The Andromeda Strain ',' Kubrick's '2001' ('alien black box') and 'Mission to Mars' (ie Mystery Message); And even a slight dash ('science' fiction, they share a 'Cryptic' connection) in 'Sneakers' and 'A Recharged Mind'. Hell, Corn Fields, and Antarctica is also the most recent 'X Files Movie'. <br /> <br /> At the end of the bright opaque spacecraft, it looks exactly on a topic taken from `the abyss. ' <br /> This is better than all and ultimately some lightweight shocking. I can say a little more about the plot, but definitely not necessary. Do you already know in this movie without ever seeing it? (5 out of 10)
