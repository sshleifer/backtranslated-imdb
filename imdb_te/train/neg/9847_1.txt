Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratchar (HH H), a cook for the pirate ship that he captained after his first assassination. Though he buried a treasure, he begins to lose his memory and his treasure map is empty. Hence, Dick will force a person to see and communicate with him (and keep a statement for it?) And help guide the fund. How could someone make this nonsense movie? Former Gone Spike Milligan Medak was appointed director, and Milligan undoubtedly did not light anything in the director's chair, giving Medak the talent in The Ruling Class. In the first 10 minutes of Peter Boyle briefly appears as a doomed pirate captain. He is very grateful for the release of Young Frankenstein in the same year and released as a result, so he ceases to resume his resume. Franciosa Scratcher's brilliant force is brisk behind but both he and sellers look pretty desperate, even looking at the cellars' makeup and hair very terrible. The film was also bombed when they were filming. <br /> <br /> Parrot: (hanging to about) You have to pay for this. <br /> <br /> Scratch: No, t. I'll do it for free. <br /> It's one of the best jokes. It's amazing to me that most sellers are in the tunnels still in the tunnels, but these have been available for more VHS than 15 years ago! Looking to "A Show Called Fred", starring well-known British TV show Sellers, Milligan, and Richard Lester?
