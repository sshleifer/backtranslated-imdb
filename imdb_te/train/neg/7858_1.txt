I appreciate the need to appoint those who do not know the kind of 'horror' films, but they must appoint at least the right actors. Sergeant uses each line that specifically uses his unilateral side of the bulldozer. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There are not really identifiable plots, so many written words are f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other corrected bad language in place of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story is designed with a random gore and death, with a couple of fuzzy-worthy 'surprises' about 10 minutes. Happen. <br /> <br /> There is another film based on blood instead of any real cinematic experience.
