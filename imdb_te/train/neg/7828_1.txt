In addition to 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Tarantino emerged from Pulp Fiction and was one of the longest lines of rip-offs. The film creates for the first five minutes, but then filmmakers make an unreasonable mistake that does not allow unnecessary and grotesque violence to the "hip" average. You're better off skipping it.
