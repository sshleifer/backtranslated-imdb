I'm at a disadvantage here. I did not see the first two movies in this series, even though I had a lot of pictures of Larry Cohen. I think the fans of this series are a good movie. <br /> You do not get a real good look at Maniac Cop's (Robert Z'dar) face, but what I see is pretty terrible. Death scenes do not give too much pollen, so much of the film is shot. If I see the NC-17 Directors cut, I might be more attractive. <br /> <br /> The car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulani and Robert Devi was pretty intense. The best part of the film.
