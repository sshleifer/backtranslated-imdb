F * @ # What is it I see? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is very painful and crazy. In a tremendous exit from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting vampire-waz-vampire-vampires, such as the super-human strength creatures. Also? Oh, and their eyes blink in sardine way? Wow! Yet in this film, Seagal's ultimately to be more like Punch-and-Lane-pitch-kick-n-a-$$ ego, he is stronger than they are. Even so, the average human beings are crushed around him. Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighbors bully or drug dealer, but this is super human power people. Oh and get this, Seagal identity issues passes through briefly sting, because he and his colleagues picture the film because he thinks Wolverine! Oh my go ... and worst than all! Yes, it's worse than that. He also had a voice over voice changing when he was looking at his face. They can not lose him and I believe it is one of the other actors in the film. It is pure madness. I wanted to stop it, I watch a movie he will always end up with. It's all the time for your live streaming to video movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Absorption properties? Well I guess, I will be fair in that sense. At least some special effects are right, and I liked the wardrobe option for actors and actresses. Women are all very attractive IMO. Still, and I'm STILL, it's not blatant X-Men, Underworld, (Insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here)! The director, the writer, the producer, the film must trade and ban all from the business. I think most people feel about this film about Blood Rene (and all of the Uwe Bol's pictures). This is my total of $ 1.00 in this movie. See if you dare.
