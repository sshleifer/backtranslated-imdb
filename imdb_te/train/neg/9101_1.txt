The film is "Dark After Dark Channel". Take the language and themes of "We're Not Naughty" and you'll be left with dialogue and plot tools that insult anyone who does not describe the quality bell as "quality bell". The conversation is so laughable and dirty that the screenplay can be a product of locking Aron Spelling and Joe Esserthas in a room with instructions to create a blend of every sixth script in a room. If Roger Kumbley intended, the mission could be achieved.
