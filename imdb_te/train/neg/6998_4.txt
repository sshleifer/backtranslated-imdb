Hollywood has always suffered "religious image." Strange Cargo proves that there is no exception. Despite the use of a brilliant cast of talent and produced in the top budget, this film fails with a reliable movie photography by Robert Plunk. Perhaps the reason is that the sudden infiltration of fantasy elements can be viewed as realistic by the audience's intervention and the fate of characters. I'm all harder to sit still through metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and it is impossible for Ian Hunter to smoke all of it as a smoker-it-Christ person. And at least with the consensus in Boston, Detroit and Providence. This image is forbidden. Some Boston / Detroit / Providence film makers, if any, will go to complaints or other cities, since it is clear that Guylet and Crawford have been involved in some "messaging film" from the treble. It's disorganized everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this movie the revival has seen something in the TV. The scenario of a home atmosphere image appears to be more receptive to audiences. However, despite its increasing reputation as a novel or extraordinary feature film, the plot of this Strange cargo predicts speculative and heavily ethical lines, and the main characters are ultimately unexpected how fate is related to fate.
