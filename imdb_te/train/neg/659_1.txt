The film is a good example of the lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people paid to make these waste products shows that there is no real thought and talent in the entertainment business. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, the idea of ​​disappointing the audience (and the idiot that I rented as rented) is discouraged. He will kill the mother, father and brother without any reason. From the first five minutes you will see bad acting and direction. A few years later, a desperate teacher removes him from prison. HMM - ordinary bad writing - no one in town knows seriously until the last minute. The obsessive mentor turns into something like a naval seal and surrounds it, sniffs people and has a super-killer with a knife. Sure !!! The observer now kills the hotel maid for any reason, starts to hunt for swords, and young friends for its entertainment. Now the girl is the perfect way to love you. Abscesses teacher gets out of the hotel --- Stupid again, always knows his face to the police - but he runs them right. Now he kills two cops outside the house of the young man and somehow she sneaks into the bedroom and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is only one positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other occupation works with this low quality, they will be eliminated. Yet these idiots are writing and directing hundreds of thousands of dollars in this trash.
