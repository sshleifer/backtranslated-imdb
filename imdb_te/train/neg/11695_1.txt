Calling a film like "thin" is called a round or poly shore un-talent. <br /> Any news, but how would they want to know? <br /> <br /> In this movie ... The book is good, but it's a small derivative of other stories, "Be careful what you want". Burke kills a baby daughter and curses her father (Constantine TV's "room 222" from Constantine for several pounds per day). <br /> As I said, it starts to be good, but why is Mobster (Montgena)? Why fire up firearms automatically? Why turn into something more dependent on the FX? It would be more efficient if I had more weight on weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy knowledge and such a subtle surface. <br /> But it is not. <br /> And the conclusion ... The book is almost the same, but a little too talky. In fact, the entire film debate assumed that each plot of land would turn towards us. I was not expecting "Dead Zone", but thanks to any other "Pet Sematari" I could do. <br /> <br /> An actor who is trying to do at least half a good make-up job. However, the rest of the film is left ... it tells me ... "thinner".
