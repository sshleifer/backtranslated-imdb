Sorry, it's plain curiosity. The little girl sucks a brat, their enjoyable characters and plots. The film is also not a Gator as the film we'd believe in. If you check any full guide to the reptiles you will find that you are not really a crocodile, a gator. Naturally they realize that they are not real animal experts or are creature crook. It does not need a tragedy for the movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep this one.
