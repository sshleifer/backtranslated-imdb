It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> A realistic picture is a good thing for people. I do not have it. Life is also predictable, bad, evil, small, knowledgeable, sometimes. <br /> The most common places are: You are black, you are guilty, you are grieving and cursed, burned or bullied by anyone; Children do not play with weapons, it can be dangerous; Then there are those who go to church, then they are good and good ... <br /> <br /> Before this, I did not see such a bad image. The reason why photography is not even important is the importance of a movie. This one, daytime, open shot every scene is clear and annoyingly blue. They do not even care to correct color balance. Oh! I've rated more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this is my lowest lowest (3/10).
