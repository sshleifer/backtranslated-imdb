I'm into bad movies but there's nothing going for this. Even though it says the dead bodies, it is not funny. I know humor and underground movies but this director / writer is so boring that nobody directed but nobody directed but ever again to access the local cable! The movies are loving and comedy hates this movie. I never get to know how this work is unnecessary and frustrating. If you want this picture you have nothing here as a pat head. ZERO! If you compare the underground images, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The film starts by defining satire and I can explain anyone to show irony. The rule for humor is this ... If you're funny it is not you say or do anything but it's not sarcastic if you're not funny, you're not experimental, you're just curiosity and this film is not just funny. ZERO!
