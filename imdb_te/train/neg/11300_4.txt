5/27/2009 - 10 out of 4 (Dir-Harold Young): The 3rd Universal Mommy Movie is the first two from the viewer's perspective to the final result. This story is identical and results are huh-hum. At this point the story's story is a new follower of the Egyptian priest, who sends his mummy to his home, who can revive him to kill those who opened the original tomb. This time it is played by Lone Chaney (there is not much difference because this character is asked to perform a lot). The new priest becomes a corpse-keeper in the town and mommy sends out his dirty work after feeding him tanna leaf juice. One of the priest's fianc√©e fell down to the priest, yes --- to be immortal with him (we had never heard of). The plan actually interrupted that the torpers (like the Frankenstein monster) hunted mummy and the end of the creature's ending story ... How did they get a sequel? Can you learn from the next place in the series? Or not .....
