*** Spoilers *** Spoilers *** Spoilers *** Spoilers <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there are very rare films, they are becoming increasingly romantic comedy with inefficiency. Columbia Pictures' The Grudge. The film began to worse, otherwise the well-thought American Japanese TV film 'Ju-On' was inspired to remake the film in English. It launched a virtual tsunami of evil decisions surrounding the world until October 21, 2004, to wash off the shore in Orlando. <br /> <br /> Early, thin Mamma ghost looks like a cross between Margaret Choo and Alanis Moritz, along with a chubby, rambunctious but bad second grader with her deadly sideways. There is nothing terrible than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? That's perfect! With this weird bunch of count we must accidentally add a secret black cat named Chim Chim. (Remember speed racer?) As you have already guessed, they have killed this resident of Doom and now wants to kill everyone who breaks into the premises. As explained by a Japanese detective, as you are described by a Japanese detective, when you die in anxiety, they send their ghost proxies that I have forgotten as a county commissioner or something like that. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough with Bill Pullman, who has been praised for his death from the balcony. My assessment is that Bill Pullman has earned this work because he begs his children for the Tokyo Disneyland tour. After we bear nurse yoko's little interesting saga, 'Oh no one can go and shout the audience, but that's not her terrible alert and speculatively wipe out like a magical lantern. In the 30-minute film we finally saw its American hero Sarah Michelle Geller Karen. Sarah Michelle Geller may be a good actress but I can not think of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This is equivalent to Jennifer Aniston Star in the film about six friends' adventures in New York. Try to your extent, you can not stop thinking about the other project that she made famous. But when I could turn, Karen, nurse spooks us h hire to replace the original caregiver. <br /> <br /> She is looking at the fair fur vixen to search for evidence that I found halfway, find her ghost and drag and drop off its mask to reveal its real man gover Gover who owned the park 'If you do not intrude your kid and your dog, I'll stay away with it!' <br /> <br /> The director of the Ed Wood of Asia, Takashi Shimizu, took two unfortunate decisions relating to the sound. First, the soundtrack can be used only if someone is killed. This is a fantastic plan for viewers to get a two-minute warning. Second, he sounds like a gargling gopher with ghosts and gave a noisy sound. After this movie, I heard a lot of laughing and laughing theater sound. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only survivor to survive. And of course we set fire to fire the house to learn that her fate was dries in time for the next chapter. Nevertheless, considering the audience's ridiculous reactions, they did not want the sequel, but did not apologize. 'The Grudge' can easily be rewritten into comedy, then it will be worth its camp. It is a great cinematic thriller from 'Godzilla vs. Megallollan'. I suggested that the film should wait until you get to your local discount theater, where it deserves a great deal.
