I did not see the movie in the ages, but I commented on anything, because it was a very serious memory burning into my memory cells. At first the GETAWAY was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour - but not least 1) a Sam Peckinpah film, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Piggons, feature 3 variations. , 1994 version was slightly higher than that of the hot red Alec Baldwin and his soon-to-be divorced wife, Kim Basinger. MacQueen and his then-wife Alley McBride also broke up immediately after making their version of the film and filming Baldwin's portrait at their marriage councilor about the stupid idea of ​​making the film. <br /> <br /> Let 's just say it and get out of the way - Alec Baldwin is always absorbed and part of Baldwin to think so many of the reasons why this remake never bother me, Challenge the memory. As someone mentioned, Peckinpai's 1972 film is a satirical work for the simulation of Action / Adventure Hust's genre. By contrast, Baldwin, Basinginger, and the company's true Michael Madsen and James Woods's slimy unpinsepton villain appear to be only real people, trying to induce a more serious tone. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to make this film even more decisive, meaningful and non-vulgar. An opinion is not well suited because it is not new to offer, but it is rarely made. Peckinpah's image is actually a pretty little fun, an upbeat mood, which is a slog that this version takes a little too long or nothing overall. <br /> <br /> There is no artistic requirement in the film and the more inconvenient sequences are very uncomfortable. This is not a good idea to start a wave of big budget remakes around the brand name / actress, around the point of viewless and artistic stupidity. I tried at least one filmmaker to come up with a new idea for at least one film and wanted to flat out with the original. The film made me want to remove my eyebrows, and Mr Baldwin became one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood after 15 years of its release. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
