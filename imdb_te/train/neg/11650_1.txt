The first time you leave, you want the Brothers Brothers come with some new jokes. I did not expect. If the first one is not bad enough then this is so bad that it just hurts to see it. You think you'll come with a little more intelligent with all the actors in the film. Although they can not do, they should not have all the same characters, funny jokes, and somehow put in the film and laugh at it again and again. The thing I did not laugh at it for the first time. Though they failed at every level, they tried to make these images laughable. Most of the time, it is accidentally jokes, which is very frustrating and obscene and it is hard to see and enjoy. Then when they try to make scenes that are film scenes, they are 20 minutes entertaining in the scenes, possibly a joke in the whole scene. Even for older people and the people that it is not for a true young audience, well I'm supposed to be funny and fit in the range of age. If people find this funny, people say that different people have different ideas or different ideas if you are not one of the more mature or intelligent individuals. It does not take much skill to write that kind of script, though you'd go to see more intelligent and funniest movie movie spaceballs. It is actually a good and well-crafted parody and does not need to use frustrating and unpleasant jokes to make it funny.
