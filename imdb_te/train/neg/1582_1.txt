Oops! This film hurts my head. <br /> <br /> When swallowing trips like civilized seals, I also like the kid. But I did not like this movie. Now I hate it completely. <br /> Make a good fast story. Keep the title and throw away the rest. Instead of a few half-assesd gladiators storyline in the future, the whole thing in the scandal accident (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? Clearly the footage of what has really happened. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is from Goofy Shining Clothes <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie. I know, but some people are people, and I can not understand them.
