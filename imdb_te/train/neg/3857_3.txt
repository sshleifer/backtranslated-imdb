Like the other kind of film, I thought the film was fun entertaining. However, it is lame and does not find me smiling too. It can be seen on HBO, perhaps, or if you're hired to rent free, you need a movie that passes over time. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it may be funny if the script is good. Jason Lee will be happy, and he gets some laughs here and there, but the film comes flat. Just do not see this one. Directing is poor, but it is not as important as what it is. I guess its main drawback is not just too funny. Look at something else, do not waste your time here.
