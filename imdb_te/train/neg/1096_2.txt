While some scenes were realistic, many of them were portrayed by military preachers of former Nazi types. <br /> <br /> I am also a Viet Nam vet, in which military personnel who acted as soldiers during this period <br /> <br /> "Hero" and his friend (both privately) sit in the captain's office and smoke I really liked it. Like cigarettes and talking and talking to his friend with the captain. <br /> <br /> "What about this movie?" It seemed to wander around the place without focusing "anything except hatred". Thanks to God I came from the library and did not pay it for rent.
