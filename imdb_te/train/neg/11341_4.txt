In this way the disaster felicitates Fellini throughout his life. The line between the absurd writing and the free association bullshit is very small, and the picture is ultimately suited, and often depends on personal feelings. <br /> <br /> "Casanova" is more admirable for his sets, but not more comprehensive by Bucksky: <br /> "Casanova spit on his grave without any feeling to say with a big cock and long tongue and no guts all the truth It is true to say that ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find Human race Why today it happens: We combine intelligent and eternal Casanova, like all Easter parrots, which we encourage our poor children inside. "<br /> When I was able to do that, Felley was in charge of her subject; <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made up of decay and inappropriate behavior, making Felici more clear in "Satyaccan". The legacy of the plot is a soft romantic attribute, not just incompatibility; <br /> Furthermore, Casanova can only be one point in the form of a bizarre foolishness. And I'm challenging to formulate this item without being clear. Not Felicia. A slave, who looks like a maestro, is undoubtedly but whose moves are more satisfied than anyone. I can not imagine audiences enjoying this film. It's not worth telling the story.
