Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you never know through this rubbish mess. The film is not cheap and it is cheap - since 1955 the war scenes have been removed from the highest "The Last Command", and the footage shot 32 years ago in the film is more contemporary than anything else. In fact, some of the action scenes shot for the film are disorganized, confusing and inefficient, the rest of the movie looks fantastic. It has the look and feel of the bad student film (and the budget overall does not seem too high). It moves like molasses, over-the-top ham or under-the-top camouflage for most of the performance - though Raul Julia is much better than the cast of the rest of the cast - and it's annoying historical bugs. On top of that, it is WAY too long. If you're going to do a boring movie, do it in an hour and get over it - does not dry it over three hours, as does this. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, this film has stolen its action scenes from John Wayne's 1960s version or 1955 movie. It's hard to believe that it took six producers to make a lousy film. Skip.
