Why are filmmakers always going against author's writing? I mean, yes, things have to be cut for the purpose of the viewer, but see Anne of Green Gables. They did an amazing job of mixing important events, which is just delightful. I can not believe that they have combined three awesome novels for Anne's elder brothers. Doing so will see all the missing things. . . Paul Irving, Small Elizabeth, Widows, and Winds Poplars. . . And for Anne College years, for the sake of heaven !!! Is not it happy to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan must take the same films once, instead of mixing them all together, mixing letters and events as he does. This picture is good, if you leave the novels out of it !! But L.M. Montgomery's beautiful work is not a thing to be denied. The film did not disintegrate after seeing a successful way to succeed Anne of Green Gables' life.
