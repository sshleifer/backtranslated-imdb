The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, and Caesar's evolution is limited. In addition, the language is Spanish without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historic symbol, part of which is very difficult and I have worked for Leonor Verrella, who invented for a newist. She is strongly enthusiastic, but also very helpful, soft soul mate. Timothy Dalton as Caesar is accurate and their part is the main subject of the first episode. <br /> <br /> After Parachute, the new lover (Mark-Antoine) comes but the taste has gone: love. <br /> <br /> However, the product is luxurious: the sets are big and tastier; Exotic Morocco lives and wardrobe is amazing. There is absolutely no money for producers, but they cost nothing special effects. <br /> Lastly, I would love to hear French or English in order to get accurate feedback about these two films.
