Well. Astronaut Steve West sat in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "You have not lived until you've seen the sun through the Saturn rings", while apparently streaming through the window of the sunday sunlight, suddenly he is nose bleeding. Later, the West is back in some secret hospital, a melting jinatine mass, which causes a greedy nurse to walk through the fake glass door. Apparently, West "gets as strong as he melts", this hopelessly purile makes much sense like anything, adle-brain moovie. Then the Dopi sees the type of "Army Brass", Colman Francis (the director of several bad moose), trying to cover this information, but the go man kills everyone he sees because he is a soluble. He attacked a cheery old couple because he was melting. He makes a terrible actress scream and helplessly silent about 10 minutes because he is melting. He is melting because he is melting. The FX is starring through the slummer Rick Baker, but they just see the hockey. The film is poorly portrayed and everything looks very dark and it does not help any harder thing - nothing helps. Who said MooCow cut the cheese with this one ?? : = 8p ps - "Did you get any crackers?"
