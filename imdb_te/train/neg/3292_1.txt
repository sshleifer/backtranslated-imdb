<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> For this review, list good points and bad points. I'll start with bad. <br /> <br /> The bad points are: No idea about casting options (especially as Burt Reynolds bass hog), casting, modern day film, direction, compilation, soundtrack, and the making of a film in a television series, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson is in red bikini: Jessica Simpson as Dies Duke met her way from Emos to Michael Weston, "Where's Enos, Bass Hogg and Rosco?" In her clouded judgment, she tells where she is. "Enos, want this good image?" When asked, the red bikini would make his judgment muddied, in his right mind "not really." She looked in bikini, she was suddenly naked, and it did not even save the horror of the film. Get out of Hazard!
