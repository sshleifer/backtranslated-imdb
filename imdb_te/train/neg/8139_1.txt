Or maybe it's what it feels like. <br /> Anyway, "Bat People" is flat as a rug, which is as stunning as a rock and as a rock ... and three combined intellectuals. Well, a brief (fitting role, that ...): A doctor (mas) is melt by a bat by checking a cave with his wife (McAndu) and subsequently transforms into bat - exactly a bat <br /> <br /> But, there is a business of sheriff (Pattaki) in the work there. Sheriff: The Hawk kind. He hates people, he reads in married women, who steals handkerchiefs from Hebberdashers (Fined!), Who talks to one of his cigarette holders in his mouth and at the same time negotiating with him at Bufford T. "Smokey and the Bandit" and (which is the worst part) ... he's a very fond of all the movies! <br /> <br /> The whole movie is just a TV movie - like the weekly Croft (Gano, in this case). AIP to shout out! <br /> <br /> What can you say about a movie that MST3K can not even save? <br /> <br /> Without any stars "The Bat People", full version or MST3K version! <br /> <br /> If you continue to watch this movie, I will remember my TV.
