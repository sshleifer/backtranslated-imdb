This tragic portrait is similar to the 1971 Broadway revival, such as the 'Nostalgic' hit. When Burt Shevlove directed the revival, remember that he has rewritten the book extensively. I have the feeling that this heroine made a lot of change from the original 1925 version. I played 'innocent filmmaker' Jimmy Smith in 1974, and wanted to bring these $ 1 DVD back memories. There is no chance. "Hopper" is also a major disappointment, even as you look at "Tauber" Roland Young. There are three songs from the play, and much less. Also classic duet, "Tea for Two", is made like a real solos. The most familiar faces in this 1940 Fayak are not proud of everything, and the star, Anna Negal, is embarrassing to her. When I experience the song by spending a dollar, I know this film is bad. Another commentator referred to Doris Day version, known as "Tea Foro", and was about stage play (actually, actually), so that the true "NoNot" would find a more recognizable version.
