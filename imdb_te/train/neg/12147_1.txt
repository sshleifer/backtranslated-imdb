This is probably the most gruesome attempt in a zombie movie that I have had the misfortune I ever imagined. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is either a film producer, a film maker or a friend of filmmaker. How does this picture suck? Calculate the paths for us ... <br /> Plots? Incoherent. Conversation? Outrageous. I mean this is a low budget, I'm not the effects / gore slam. But is there a zombie that is not obese? C'mon! And for the film set in Rhode Island, the Massachusetts plate why did the truck make the game? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please do not put your ex-girlfriend or friend's sister in your nude picture. This is an ugly movie with ugly people and does not mention Romero in the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, no.
