I mentioned the first story I saw about 6 years ago. I recently bought the DVD, and I'm thinking why I liked it for the second time. Acting was terrific, and usually our fake costumes were stereo-typical Klan members. Acting is fine. <br /> <br /> Tim Roth as Lim Neine did a OK job, but I did not know what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> Plot line is good, but the hanging is just weak. I'm so tired of playing this role in Scotland films. Braveheart is still the worst, which only saves the images. But seriously, people can not talk in those days, why should all actors have glasses of voice? Another image to try and capture the essence of already tired and unpleasant stereotypes. I only notice those who say this film is good, and I know why they love me to be honest, they know that they have a desire for men in kills. However, if you're thinking of buying DVD, I'll spend some money, like a good image.
