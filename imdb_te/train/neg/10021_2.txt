The worst picture I have seen from Tera Jadu Chal Gaya. No story, no humor, nothing! Action sequences are typically combined into a series of thumb-up advertising sequences. <br /> <br /> I did not go to expectations, but it was disappointing that you were watching this movie. <br /> <br /> When you look at it, you are the only person in bikini karina. <br /> <br /> Every time I saw '1' worse, Bollywood proved to be wrong with me .
