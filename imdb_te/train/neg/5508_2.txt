Tim (Gary Daniels) wanted to break into serious television reporting. When he was awake for a job he had begun, he was sacked. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Harley) also said Zionara. Coming home, Tim seems to have realized that his uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) is from Mars! Calling Uncle Martine, Tim attempts to help his new friend navigate the earth soon. From the bathroom to the laundry room and more, Martin comes in trouble wherever he goes. Lovely Lizzy (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to earn time with Tim, but the course of true love does not run smooth work in this regard. Soon everyone is on TV, hunting for Tim, hoping for a story about a real alien. What is a man? For those who love old television presentations with Bill Bixby and Ray Walthon, the film is not desirable to build proverbial shoes. Its true, undeniably awful, with a reliance on the special effects that are supposed to fit into any plot and flat. Daniels is on Earth, but Lloyd's alien is just terrible, overdoing the storm. The rest of the cast is suitable for clothing, set, and product details. If your children see the cover and pray for the picture, they will convince you to pick another picture at the video store. Stay Guaranteed, children and adults will find a huge bore in this movie, so instead of a night at the museum in the 80 days or around the world.
