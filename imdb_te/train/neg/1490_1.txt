First, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in the film, and she's just awful. The film has every horror movement imaginable, and all played well. Over sex teen couple. Comentual (not) horny joke. Leopard cool chick. Creepy native color man. Parent-type couple. The manga chick of the dead in these films. The conversation is very painful and a walk will be distributed in the depth of the pool. It's almost like they want you to die earlier. Some time ago I saw the film's harsh cut, but somehow, it just degenerated. Certainly, here's the vampire that I try to eat Jameson's implants, but it also hires this dog. Avoid all costs.
