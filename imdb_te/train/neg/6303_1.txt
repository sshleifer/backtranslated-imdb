I am hoping for this film. I thought of interesting story. Although I recognized acting, I saved the Helena Bonham carter in an unsafe manner. I hoped to spend my time, but I finally wondered why I thought about this. Perhaps George Orwell's version has a message that provides a message. If the film achieved anything, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I believe his story is frustrating as this imitation. If the filmmaker's message was "worth living a secular life," then they succeeded. No one will recommend this film; 101 minutes of my life was ruined.
