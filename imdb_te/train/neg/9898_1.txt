This version of "Moby Dick" insulted the audience, which was based on Melville's novel - continued to show the fraudulent first chapter than the popular "Call Ishmael". The great example of how to modify and change a popular novel to increase its chances at the box office is how far from Hollywood (especially the early Hollywood), despite having a horrific performance from John Barrymore. The beautiful, poetic language of the novel was completely eradicated, and Ahab was shifted from his bride, blasphemy, obsessive madman, a defamation that he wanted to kill Moby Dick, his leg with a faulty hero. For this he is a standard evil brother who wants to be fiance, and a different ending is added!
