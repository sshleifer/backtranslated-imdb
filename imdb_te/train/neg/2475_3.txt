I was disappointed. The picture is a bit predictable and does not survive up to the hype that plastered over all the boxes. The characters are well developed, the Vantage myth is used in a special premise and the house is pretty awful but it just missed me. I kept waiting for the big AHHHHH or BOO! <br /> <br /> The film suffered from poor painting and poor painting. That way is not very bad thing and using the atmosphere and viewer imagination to create horror and suspense. Trying to make movies like Session 9 or Cube, and looking for a low budget, the horror movie is good.
