I was disappointed. This film has come out of my time and mental energy. Here is a picture of Allen's back: all-high level manhattan Narasimha discussing whether they cheat on their spouses. Woody, I have already seen these characters, and I have already seen the story from you ten times. Where's your creativity ??? You should open your eyes and watch around you. <br /> <br /> When you hear Woody Allen coming out of the new project, I do not have anything - now I can not wait for her Old Standby: The couple who are tired of each other and end up fraud. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win his fans, we must understand that our humor and intellect are inspired - not shame.
