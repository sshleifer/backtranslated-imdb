What a muddled mess. <br /> <br /> Previously, I saw this friend with a friend and we both thought about the many wonderful miracles of the movie, but this is not one of them. Thoughts / feelings and certainly have some good performances (in circumstances), it is buried under all random nonsense. Sir Anthony's natural birth killers leads to much of the same gene pool as far as editing the U turns and editing, or he sees himself in Nixon for inspiration. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you want about David Lynch, but at least he does not have a practice for madness. <br /> <br /> He said that he made the film a joke. This is not your money, bandwidth or time value.
