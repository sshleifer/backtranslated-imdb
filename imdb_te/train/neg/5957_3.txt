Undoubtedly and low-brain (hah!) 80 horror, as if you are in the right mind, it is considered fun as there are a dozen thirteen. Special effects appear to be missing out on two important paragraphs, namely, the worst performance and screenplay! "The Brain" is a unique silent-American town in the background, where each adolescence works in the same diner, the cherry bombs in high school throwing cherry bombs into the toilet. Here is Dr. Blake, a tea-guru and his adorable pet-brains, who start their search for control of the country across the country. Under the label of "independent thinkers", a large cheesy will force brain television sets and innocent spectators to kill! How nice Now, this is the Medoel Teen rebellion to save the world! The ridiculous thing about the plot is that Dr. Blake and his brilliant brain never explain where it actually came from. There are clear signs of extraterrestrial life but about it. Meh, who really need a background in such a movie? Unfortunately, unfortunately, the "bad" brain looks like over-sized cock-puppet. Only a more or less interesting element for horror buffs is the cast and crew of this film. Director Ed Hunt and author Barry Pearson are the same men who made the "bloody birthday" (flawed pleasure of mine) and "plague". Both were better films and they decided to resign the film industry wisely. The well-known face in the cast is greatly devoted to David Gale, the horror fans who worship him permanently for his role in the animator. A girl named Christine Kosakak gives nudity-factor and she certainly shows a great talent? She has 3 movies in her concert, of which she is "artwork". Initially, she is known as the "Runaway Model" and "3 Men and One Child", her role is referred to as 'Jack's Girls'. How really do I feel about her career as her actress?
