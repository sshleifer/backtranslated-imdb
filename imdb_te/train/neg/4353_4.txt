<br /> <br /> Class is a comedy series featuring a group of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I love the program idea. That's why it saddens me that class is not funny, despite the obvious potential. It's not just a dorky, not enough caricature. (Hah.) It is a slow tempo and indeed the lack of fun punch lines. <br /> <br /> Most of the letters written by Katow and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Coplan and Heather GÃ¶ttherche) are more difficult than writing letters. On the other hand, I find the most appealing characters of the main character Ethan and the used-to-du couple Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> I would not hurt this series anymore, choosing for his voice (any respectable character, anyway).
