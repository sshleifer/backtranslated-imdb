Unfortunately, this kind of comedy has improved since unfortunately release of 'Killer Tomatoes Attack', such as 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series. <br /> The acting was very bad; There is zero continuity in it and it feels just genuinely slow and inexpensive. You need to have multiple occasions once for a funniest movie to work, over a gag over. Singing in the movie is nonsense and the right for the flash furniture store across the screen is also the most nasty. Finally, however, you can see why this film is a culture; I can not see it quite differently. Suddenly terrible I would be doing this compilation.
