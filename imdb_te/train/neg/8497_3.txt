<br /> <br /> A culture in "literary famed" (Dumas, Flubert, Bulgak, Mappassant) is like a "Nouvel vague" cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France has a great tradition of artistic articulation and clever philosophy. But in the minute you get them an image camera and they're starting to react to how WOOHOOO begins to act! Plot? The theme? PSHAW! We have room round & amp; Goddard (Oh-la-la, clay artist who has unhealthy interest with the backs of people's head) is not as bad as this. No, the trapfight visibility is clear. But the security camera does at a speed-mart. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hey, you put aside everything to the cinema school intellectual expedition: I'm betting that the vein is now popping towards your neck. But my review is not to read the last sentence. <br /> <br /> If you want French literature, you will hate it. People who love this film probably do not read books other than Jack Carolock or the "Hickeyer's Guide to the Galaxy". Or they have read literature for The Doors songs, and they feel badly moving. What makes the boat yarrow? I am wondering that the film has passed some weak (Balak) instructions from Balajac, one of the best and most meaningful writers he has ever lived. Good try, bitter. <br /> <br /> This film is like AIDS-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who wants to think of you, you can use Jean Cocktio (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese Masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, Tufffoot, Goddard, and Andy Wurl. And pelt back the vein in your neck for petty. You look like a cabbage.
