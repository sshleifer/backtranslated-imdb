It really does not matter that the Superman comic books are unbelievable innocent and their goal is ten years old. "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for the readers of the U.S. Dear readers, how many will Superman defeat Kevin Spacey? Anyone? As I think. There are no spoilers here. <br /> <br /> Previously, the film is commercially seen (it is only for the scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent Drunk Budweiser). Superman's commercial, two and a half hours long. Think of this as "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You really think this movie is too long. <br /> Second, the scenario is not crazy. Sometimes it's stupid in the movie, although it's somewhat acceptable in the comic. And it will be like this case. Of course the dialogues are insulting. I can not believe that someone took money to write. How many times will we be playing villain-making lectures? How many times does physical laws have rape? (Jesus is not only the superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials) How many times Louis Vince is betrayed by Kent? How many times do the Hollywood producers seek in a worst comic book? Since it's hard to make a good story, why do you have a weak story for the starter? It does not work. Guys, get hold of. Please be stuck, please try again. Or is constantly in the strike and who cares. The concept of the WGA was permanently in the strike. There is no bad motive. I do not question that slippery money, but the quality of the product they delivered. There is no quality in this case. <br /> You can ask yourself: Yes it is true. <br /> <br /> Third, acting is weak and it is very surprising that Bryan Singer is directing it. Kevin Spacey is fun, but he is just the same person. The audience is not in the mood for jokes. Thing is a comic book hero who can develop true personality, with clear inspiration, doubts, fears, and some depths. Nobody has done that job and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> Lastly, the full effort of the creators makes this film ridiculous. The second unit is so bad that it does not attract attention, since there is nothing interesting going on the screen anyway. <br /> <br /> One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This film, ladies and centers, camp. Do not waste your money and stay home, read a book.
