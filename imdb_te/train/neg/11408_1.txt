It's just plain terrible. I have read this book for school, as I did all of the tests, and I like it! My teacher forced me to look at me and 20 other people, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk. What made this movie so terrible is the reason for killing you. First, this is done in the hallmark. Secondly, acting is terrible. Third, it's different from the book. Literally, I'm so sorry that I'm forgiven. In fact, I see Basic Instinct 2 rather than what I see. Take my advice, do not look at this film. Nobody wants to see this. It's terrible. Terrible!
