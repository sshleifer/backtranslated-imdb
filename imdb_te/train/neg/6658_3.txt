There are some ransom features in this program. A theme tune has a good melody. The show has a good campus. Also, I am in a minority, but I love cooking. I will take care of her, and Timmy is a mother character. However, I did not like this presentation, it's not massage but I found it very painful. <br /> <br /> I can not say it is the best animated show in Planet Earth. When I used that word for an animated TV show, I thought about Peter Pan and Pirates, I thought about Darkwing Duck, I thought about Scooby Doo and I thought about Talespin. And I really hope the Wild Thornberrys and it's not the only one who opposes the fact that it did jokes fun. Or I do not feel exactly the worst animated show in Adult Parents Planet Earth. I confess it's annoying, and overrated in some ways, but it's not the worst performance in Nicol√¢dia. This is chalk zone, which is the god who does not appear in the show. <br /> <br /> "It's one thing I do not like about this show", but I never The worst animated show Shaggy and Scooby Doo seen: get a clue which is animated, unfunny and frankly an insult. Animation. Characters, I forgive if I have offense, have very weird facial features, and the backgrounds are very dull and look good so they do not have the color that makes Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys. The characters except Wanda I find it very annoying. I can not sing Timmy String (such a choreographer) as a talented voice actress. Timmy I do not like everyone in the lead role, he is a very annoying and sometimes idiot and he's a poor decision making. And his voice gets on my nerves. I really like it but strong in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, the supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes are haphazard. They are a) Contributed, or b) know. Timmy's parents are terrifying characters that do not touch their son, and their personalities are worn thin. <br /> <br /> Most of the stories are very unusual, I've seen this before. The episodes after the baby's arrival are undesirable. <br /> <br /> Previously, the worst performance is not, but the animated fan is pretty poor, and very uncomfortable to sit. 3/10 - There are liberation attributes, and people who like it are fully understandable.
