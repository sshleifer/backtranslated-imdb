<br /> <br /> DreamWorks thought this was a very tired and decided to plan $ 80 million in lame animated film. They probably thought it was more than enough to bring the audience (mostly families) to watch in droves of spectacular animation. It worked well for the opening weekend, which made $ 26 million, about $ 38.1 mill. Overall (estimating this weekend). But when I came across the weekend the audience saw the same thing I saw a lot, and when I saw them I think they spread the word. This is a dirty picture separated from the rest of the animation, most likely the script appears at the age of three. <br /> <br /> The film is only 80 minutes. Not long, but it feels like a three-hour epic. Some of the adhesive points for me, one of the most irritating commentary is one of them, and it is clearly written. At one point he escapes some captors and you can see what the horse is apparently frightened, what the misconceptions about the story (the talented Matt Damon's voice). <br /> <br /> Bryan Adams is a steady pop up song, now I'm his music fan, I think he's good, but DreamWorks is really a talk Culver 8-9 Finally and there is a spoiler, a horse burns at a vacant place by a footwear footprint, lesser, she (horse) then falls into a raging river, the Spirit (the image's sight) tries to save her, but they go over two waterfalls and at least 50 Feet should have a fall, and then we see that this horse is alive. I know this is a children's film, but a small amount of realism is also unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Totally, it's really dull Oh, I'm not saying I can not enjoy the kids, but neither can wait for this trip to end their watches just to check their watches. This is definitely my top 10 worst list this year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
