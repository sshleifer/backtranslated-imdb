Ritchie's first two films are complex and beautiful fun. Here, is he two recent classic attacks ?? 'The common suspicions' and 'fight club' ?? <br /> <br /> What are the realities of the twists and the 'fight-club' twist that you put aside yourself (with the subsets of "suspects") And as an internal manifestation, the film struggles to continue its interest in its second half. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is to watch the movie (almost) is the ridding way of Ritchie and the Maurice-Jones dynamic With the camera. If Ritchie has reached a more satisfying plot and strictly corroborates, there is no reason to be able to make another cheerful gangster Capper. <br /> <br /> The revolver will waste your time. Knowledge is not unequal. If you want to see a great image that you do not have a logical view, look at the 'Last Highway', its virtue (and, incidentally, the unexpected escape from the solitary confinement).
