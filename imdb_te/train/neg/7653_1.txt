If I wanted to rate this film since I was honest from 1 to 10, then I would give a 4. This is not a tough critic, this movie is bad. From narrative to direction, editing is awful. This story is not half good to begin (since it's based on a video game, I do not know how to go into the movie) but directed and edited it even worse. The film goes on the awkward points of cuts and previous ones completely unrelated scenes; Some people, like a quick romantic scene in the middle of the story, also keep in mind how the characters do not show any feelings. You can go into this image expecting to see a pile of rubbish on an hour and a half screen and you'd still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you're wasting your money, and you're still wasting one hour and a half in your life if you do not pay anything. Make yourself a favor and see it.
