I've been a fan of the series and have read all 7 books. I wanted to see how to see it. What I say is that people who see it read this series and are interesting about it. It's too bad, and you're reading them. That does not mean, but Lucy is so ugly that it gets out of the cinema. Is she the daughter of directors? Seriously, I'm sure beavers in the film are jealous of her teeth. She has insulted the beaver's overboot. This film loses much of the translation. Tolkein LOTR books, or Harry Potter, do not even translate CS books easily. <br /> One thing they did was not right! Aslan! I did very well. As other human actors (beers, wolves) who have been shot in the face, Azlan is well-run, not an actor who is just a walk. (I think like that old horse custom? 2 people inside?) Moreover, it's interesting to me what the kids think about this film. Maybe they will enjoy But for the elderly, a CS fan is a safe bet they can practice.
