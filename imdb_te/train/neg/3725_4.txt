This is an interesting treatment of a very controversial subject (read other commentary on the film). <br /> <br /> Apparently, you prefer it or hate it and have diverged depending on what many people believe in the movie's revelations and end times. <br /> In general, the film - and its sequels - about $ 1.30 each were made. Production values ​​work with "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and acting is "Glen or Glenda" (as well as an apology for Ed Wood). Aside from the religious message, the story is scary when they come. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this story you should also think that the future may be something closer to each other. It becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> The film and its sequels have been the cause of the trouble? "Behind End" and "The Omega Code" "Thief" tried to try everything and attempted to explain all politics and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to it. At the same time, instead of a very thin outburst that attempts to explain what happened in the Middle East, "Thief" has done better in the horror of the movie. <br /> Forget politics, this film, and its sequels, for what - horror stories. They may be scary stories, indirectly, by the way, God makes them more intimidating. If you think about the subject, it does its job - even if you have never believed it.
