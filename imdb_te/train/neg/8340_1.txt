One of the worst films I have ever seen. I changed the midway when I saw tremendous news. When I turned back, I fell asleep. The film starts with a dream, continues with a dream, and ends with a dream. Then there are some dreams in the middle. Come on, what would you like to keep me interested? A movie is required to be interesting. Whether you're the only one of the minutes of the movie, and any sensible Phil-Goyer switch off. What is someone telling your dreams and what does it mean to them? <br /> This is terrible.
