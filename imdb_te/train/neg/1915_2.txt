It's a decent cast, but the film must be looking for an entertaining caper film somewhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy "Madonna Street Big Deal". William Mackie is one of our greatest actors, but here he is less useful. And his role was originally played by Marcello Mastroi, so I feel like he was trying to fill those shoes. Try to imitate Bogart or young de Niro. Art direction is great and does not bring the story, but the extra bits attached to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things that they have missed are missing. They are surprisingly awkward as they do and take away from the original surprise. Sam Rockwell has his odd and lively charm and Luis Guzman has that odd charisma, but the love story of the movie feels just clunky and flat. It's not too bad that no one has ever figured out how this film is made as well, but it is very bad that we live in a culture where we feel like we need to just re-learn fantastic things rather than amazing things.
