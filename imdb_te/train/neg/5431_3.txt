Your distinctive Priyadarshan film - There are quite a few simple characters in the little silly character. The entire cast of his signature Climax movie is coming together and some are fighting each other in a crazy motif on hidden money. Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamal Weekly, the black money in Hera Pheri, "Kodocco" etc. in the film Fira Hera Pheri, the director is ridiculously exaggerating. Do not get me wrong; As his films are clich√© and innocuous, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. Nevertheless, some of his previous films have a good sense of humor (hangamah and hera pheri noteworthy). <br /> <br /> The happiness of his movies is being repeatedly degraded because it uses the same formula. <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav gets frustrated, and the whole of Tusshar is not well. Kunal is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
