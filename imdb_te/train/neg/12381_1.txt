This movie is really bad. It plays on urban therapy of 70s / 80s and puts it in the context of a school. Urban crime is not a problem for most people or schools are not problem areas, but I can not say that exploitation is the biscuit of this kitchen. Violence is virtually predictable but in this case it is not for social issues, but it is used by a white, high-middle class student to become a criminal of his native high school. And of course he knows how to play the system. That sound is well known. Yes. This turd is a truly violent burglary, a really nasty piece of work. This is the disturbing brutality of wearing a social comment. It's like the funeral, the worst of Death 2-5 and the same thing. What's special is that Michael Fox had to do such a thing at the time.
