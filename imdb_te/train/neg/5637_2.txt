I want to make a fierce and varied film. I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss-intuitive movie. The film ended soon after the very first comment: "Rich Princess wants to be an actor and has no talent." ... she uses Daddy's money to make a film written by her, directs, and pays ... The development of any character to be closing and rising directions like a beginning, middle and end Continues to be good ..... and prakasavantamainadi vaiyyur the point? I go to a woman's house, find some pictures, throw a guardian, come out too cold (not trustworthy) checking on the sound and running on her caretaker lover ... the movie ends ... Some people give my son Arsuku education ?? I really need to know what point .... What's the focus of directors ..... why not the lover's development? Why the background on the guardian? What's the point of sight at night? What is the position of the lipstick in the car? Why is a dead guardian Why tell me about the mental patient / people who escaped? What's up with a pile? Oh and lamp whose 'house is it? Spatial? Why? Why does the guardian feel like it's his home? That factor has not always been ... for William Defoe ... he rented the movie because he is in the role and is famous for experimental roles ... write back and tell me what I need to learn. I love movies I'm just a mom in Central America .... Chris ....
