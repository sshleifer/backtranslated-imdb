Despite a brief encounter with a few moments in heavy rain, a drunk and a zinc and an organ grinder with a monkey and a sanitarium, and an encounter with Rosco "Fatty" Urbok silent comedy Buster Keaton and support from All Street, John we see the great Stone Face smile and Bunny in movies is one of the few times to be the ultimate in the "beautiful" scenes that meet especially since The fun arcade in the draft flirting with is a very funny sequence while John is only fitfully amusing! In addition, perhaps the jump cut has been modified because the film stock is in excessive use of several scenes. Still, you're done with an Arquale or Keaton, Good Night, Nurse! Definitely worth a look.
