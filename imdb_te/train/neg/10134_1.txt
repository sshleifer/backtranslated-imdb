<br /> <br /> Steven Siegel films are never an Oscar, but with each passing release they are still worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This guy begins to be taken by the FBI and is saved from the prison to rescue a stolen stealth aircraft that is actively engaged in clich√©s 'evil English villain' so Hollywood is obsessed with these days. <br /> <br /> The film is horrific enough to say that enough daising is almost always distributed with cheese and acting talent. The story is not interesting and it is absolutely no sense and does not add anything to the story, where there are the whole characters of the film, like 'lesbian' interaction between the two mainstream women in the cast. <br /> <br /> In a terrible script with bad communication, <br /> <br /> Boring and sometimes unfortunately choreographed action scenes, and absurd by sub-par actors Aina components to achieve the near impossible and the movie is only useful to worse. Give life and this miss, even if you're Seagal's most serious fan.
