See the movie's website, taking more time than writing in the script for this movie. It's not too long to be great. Original story? The original? They have found a script that is erroneous among the Old Testament, or face legal resistance for a bit of horn-out violence. High End Special Effects? I did well at Atari 7600 and a jar of chevbox. Stylish Cinematography? Oh yes, America's ridiculous home video look yet classic. I'm sure there is little money available for this title, so SF is not really good now, or is not a bit bad now, or just plain happy, but this movie wastes time and money. One of the 4 stories and all-in-the-befores is the unauthorized bits and is already full.
