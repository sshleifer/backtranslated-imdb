<br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was honest, unpretentious and kind, he looked at easily and looked like a well-educated and intellectual person. I saw a clown in this movie! The actor appears to be fake with gestures and mimicry that are affected. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin is another! <br /> <br /> After reading movies like "Talking of Fire" and "Apollo 13" I read Chartok's "Rockets and People" and "Correlation: Myths and Facts" Golovanov. I was amazed at the tiresome scenario, poor performance and build, and the inefficiencies of "space race". <br /> <br /> The film is well known in Russian historical facts. Many of the interesting facts of space projects were not displayed. Some facts and details are disorganized. For example, in 1945, Corollow was already a prisoner (not liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he had already been in the Kollima prison gold mine but in the Special Prison Bureau. The designer and dead prisoners were not buried in the Korolive Prison Bureau. But in this film Corolla worked as a grave digger after 1940 (the jailer had the shoulder straps on the uniform). IMHO, film writers have no knowledge of this part of history and they can not make interesting movies.
