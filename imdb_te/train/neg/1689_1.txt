Wow, what amount to let down! Actually people think this movie is scary. Special effects are the direct split of "The Ring". Story? Have one Not in my opinion .. a group of elegant imaging. The whole picture is boring, stupid, mess. I guess the bad movies are always on the market with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror I have seen in years. And that biff chick? Well, she's a bad actress! Barbie is so plastic and talented..Now, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talent! I thought that many films in the box office as PG-13 would help in the film and it was rated R, which bomb the IMO! Stupid image!
