The film began with good ideas, the Beacon scientist tested the invisible theory and Shu is the most common in his role. It all comes apart after all, it is now filmed on a sound of your special Hollywood thriller, galore with special effects, minus any kind of humor, wit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get audio cassette tape as an invisible man instead of John DeLanne instead of playing Leonard Noyy. It's fine now, and unlike this mess, HG Wells worked well.
