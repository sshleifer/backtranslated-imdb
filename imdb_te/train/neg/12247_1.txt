This movie is really terrible. That's 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are very terrible. <br /> A crocodile watching the tourists when filming a documentary about "blood surfing" Surfing blood or 31-foot crocodile when they surf around the sharks is a terrible mistake when interrupted. The sharks are not actually visible. The crocodile is the worst, and they are more repentant when they organize the creature, but the crocodile is trapped by the two female girls. Deaths are fake and pirates are just fill in time. <br /> <br /> A meaningless, terrible movie is worth seeing!
