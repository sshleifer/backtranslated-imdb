This horror film is really weak ... this is the right movie I am commenting on. There is nothing really terrible that a family really gained a beautiful German Shepherd boy. I have a German Shepherd and it's a good dog. I did not come to get one from this movie, but from the comedy "K-9". This is another story but everything else. This film does not have too much horror at the very scary scene and it looks really cheesy. Also, we see a person put his hand on a lawn mower. It's about it. When the father and his family are wondering, you can see if they are sleeping when they sleep. There are a lot of television movies that are working on all really weak horror film all through television standards ... "This House is Possessed" Pretty Good and another haunted house film about a woman and even these strange creatures are good. This one is really dull.
