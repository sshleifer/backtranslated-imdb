The film is so terrible that it's all over and my whole movie is laughedly laughed. Now the rest of the film is okay. It has some unexpectedly funny scenes, but there are some real good camera shots and edits. Yes the flight of Alderich Phoenix and the great director Happened by Baby Jane among others. Not in the direction of direction, acting or any technique. This film was destroyed in the third act. Why? Are murders, turns, turns and characters all around NUCLEAR material? When he comes, what the heck is smoking? The path that comes out of nowhere may be the largest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints of Burton's Planet of Apes, David Gale or CrudeVio's life is the worst end of the matter. Let's down what.
