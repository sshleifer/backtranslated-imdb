I rented a dubbing-English version of Lensman, which came from famous novels, so it contains some ingredient. There are hints of substance in the film, which is not much higher up the kiddie cartoon level. Perhaps this movie is a bad adaptation of the book, or it has lost a lot in the dubbing version. Or the source novels are also lighter. <br /> <br /> I have seen the details of derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatic, or error. Some examples: the opening sequences were adopted from the 2001 Star Gate scenery and Star Wars image of Hyper Space. <br /> <br /> Star comics begin to take on a comic relief style, but with kindness (humor does not work) and it plays seriously. In that sense, it was better for Star Wars franchise, which began with the intellectual wisdom of humor, and eventually deteriorated to annoying silliness of jar-jar. <br /> The farm has never seen a farm. Drilling grass on unharvested crops, rather than dumping porridge into work from one side to another and already-breeding rows or a truck, driving through the unharvested middle of a piece of harvester. Corn (maize) grain puut has gone, but farm lands are like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When Kim's father has to face his fortune, what a dramatic weight to the scene. It may be partially wrong with the English language voice actor, but the drawings are not too heavy. <br /> In the same way, Chris has shown little reaction, even if they are clearly close to the character of Henderson being murdered. (Henderson's death was not a spoiler, his name was not up until the scene of his death), and she immediately forgot him. Any expression of sympathy shows more than she does. I think the voice actor deserves a lot of blame in that case; <br /> <br /> In many cases the villains were unable to fulfill their orders. The villain leader frequently punishes those failures with painful deaths. <br /> <br /> If Stars are lifted from the Wars or from the previous evidence - I can not tell anyone from the Lensmans books. <br /> There is a spaceship crash-lands. When it falls to the ground, the ships break up. <br /> <br /> In most cases Chris seems to be an effective, hard-hitting hero, where she is an ineffective young man in a shirt suffering. Henderson's death is quick enough for someone to be able to get at least least shout, "Help, it came to me and I did not reach my gun!" <br /> <br /> The person with the most person (most of the time) D.J. Bill. Wolfman Jack, D.J. American graffiti. <br /> <br /> The two planets exploded in the film. The explosions were impressive, and there was a lot of inspiration for Star Wars. However, credit is not the cause of the explosion, rather than the primary weapon of Death Star. The dialogue has a good, interesting description for this conversation. <br /> <br /> Many other explosions in this film are just plain blasts. <br /> <br /> As borrowed from the video game in the late 1970s, some sound effects are very cheesy. Some of the images appear primarily as video games, and some influence from the tron ​​appears. On the other hand, the sound effects are often pretty good, but it emphasizes cheesy-noisy episodes. Art is very cool, especially when away from computer graphics that looks cheesy. <br /> <br /> Finally there is a story. If an image tells a good story, it can get away with product errors too. But the plot here is pretty light. An innocent boy is trying to help someone on a crippled spaceship and he gets the greatest strength he does not understand. He and a very wealthy team of fighters are fighting against a powerful, worst enemy. He makes friends, learns about his special power, and grows as a young man. If he is constantly and tributary, he may even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way such a story increases over the general shape, but much less than this film. <br /> Finally, this is just a kiddie cartoon. But since the primary intentional audience seems to have large children, it does not need to be more than that.
