Millie is a sap. She is married to a great man named Maitland and they have a baby. She cheated on her, divorces him ... but she keeps the child she loves. Back in the early 1930s, she allowed the excess spousal and child support right but the amazingly easy off-guy ... with no support ... no sap! Later, when she had a boyfriend and was very good at life, he would also become a cheat! <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a wild party girl - she can do everything to distract herself from the hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Initially the daughter of Milly survived now 17 and unusual fashions have not changed a bit. A friend of Millie (yes, it's another bad man!) Is currently playing a daughter's girlfriend, but he has a sculptural form on her. Millie promises that if he touches the girl, she will kill her. Take a wild assessment of what will happen next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madame X" but much more focused. So the inspirations and actions of Millie are very small. Moreover, the film seems to be very low - all men define the idea that pigs are. Unusual but not particularly good.
