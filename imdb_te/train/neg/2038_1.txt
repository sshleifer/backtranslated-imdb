Why would anyone want to see this? While this is a movie posted on YouTube as a teenager, I have done a lot of teens with her mommy's video camera. I may have congratulated his family and friends for acting on a good job. Sadly, it is made by many veteran filmmakers, who are obvious and professional actors. Sad ... and very curious, of course. As I mentioned, it's accurate enough to make it live on the video. It also has an article and an act of shouting "unpopularations" - how is this possible? Picture is filled with corpses and blood. Normally, I hate the ultra-violent movies and do not want to see that gore, which completely revolves around me. However, it is not realistic, it is bearable. However, you still have to warn you that there are some rare scenes. For example, the kid throwing radio into a woman's tub and her nude and frying scene is very bad. There are also scenes where you can hear psychos thinking as they fantasize about killing women. The level of the beauties that are pretty awful. <br /> <br /> The writers in the film are very ill - women like killing are for our entertainment. <br /> <br /> As a result of heartfelt murders, the film went to a dining room - wearing black hats and a nest-balls group! They speak pride, talk about their murders and confusion. <br /> <br /> Then, the film talks about various sexual crimes and murders and vampirism and cannibalism. Why, I do not know - maybe they are worst of this sort. <br /> Once again, you will see and hear the ideas and actions of a creepy man who appears in Germany. People will conquer him and kill them. <br /> <br /> I would like to consider this film. I have wondered why professional actors, obviously the majority of the Germans were chosen. When they try to act like Americans and the film is required to be in California, the voices STRONG. Perhaps German viewers might have wondered how rare it was to "real" acting, but for Americans it was not their fellow Americans! I really wondered why a zodiac killer (never captured), would want to have a "fan picture" of sorts for someone who is sick? I mean ... is this movie portrayed as a smile for the pirw? I can not see anyone wanting to see or enjoy this. In fact, who can move someone to make such a stupid and dangerous film? IMDB's bottom 100 list is worthless and deserving.
