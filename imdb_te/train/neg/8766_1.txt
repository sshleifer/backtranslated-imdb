I was alerted to not see this movie. It is almost insulting to the memory of those brave men, which fail to pay a tribute to a fantastic manner. The special impact was terrible, I did not expect total failure in the director's part to congratulate military technology. How fast is a gun gun with 600 rounds per minute at a speed of 1/10? How would the soldiers come forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? Where can artillery shells survive when 20 feet away? <br /> <br /> This disrespect to the weapons is not required to scare me, it is inconsistent with the complicated conditions and conversations that killed me. There are standard conversations like Hindustan Men Hai and LOC Cross Mat Karo Yeah Hukum Hii, such as Kaasi Ka Bhai Hai, Isi Lath Mat Math and Pakistani Se Jayada Mallamman. <br /> <br /> It is true that Shobha D. wrote the truth. The director worked without script and it shows. The film does not flow. From one battle to another does not gradually develop. It is only a gun because there is no connection to the whole plan in the war. Detailed scenes are awful. There is no major belief in military personnel. To make matters worse, the theatrical people cut the footage to four hours and three hours to fit in.
