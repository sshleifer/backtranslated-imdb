The package indicates that Warren Beatty and Goldie Han is pulling off a huge bank stolen, but that's not what I got out of! I did not get anything! Each other scene in the first half is the new character (without contact). The first half hour is full awareness, the rest is just a long, annoying, underlit chase scene. There is always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch ticking, a blaring siren, a train whistle, or Quincy Jones terribly scoring. There are so many ridiculous bad parts. Like, bad guys pursuing beati on thin ice with a car! Or nearly 15 times in the scene. I really hate this movie!
