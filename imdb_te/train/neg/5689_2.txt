Last year, Uwe Boll showed marginal improvement as filmmaker, "In the Name of the King" ("Lord of the Rings" clone) and proudly obscene, after 9/11. "But then" Seed, "and Counter Back to Zero Reset He has returned to keep his bid out for legitimacy and respect. <br /> <br /> All his paintings show a distinctive screenplay and are not discouraged. <br /> <br /> Increasingly misleading the social commentary of "Seed" from his frustration about the brutal notices of his debut films, and creating a spectacular slazer myth (the horror often takes a page from Robbie's successful reboot "Halloween") . Opposition Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), a mute, sat on the brut and death penalty that killed 666 people, waits for the death penalty; After failing to do the beast, he gets out of the tomb to take revenge on those who put him there ... so a string of ungrateful turbulence begins. <br /> <br /> The vein of a new-millennium slasher Michael Myers or Jason Vourhees is far too nondescript and boring to leave a view similar to a washed-up pro wrestler doing a "toolbox morse" inherited by boring victims. Furthermore, the character of Seed and Bol's "message" are contradictory to each other: the death penalty is wrong, perfect, but do we truly sympathize with the inexorable murderer who left his two hundred thousand dead bodies? <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Paree acts as a careless, long-lost brother to James Reard's role on the "Dexter": sitting in a desk and watching newspaper clippings looking at non-stop-motion scenes of animals and people trapped in the cave's cave . Time and he is the scene of the cardboard cops Storm Seed's hideout, this range is rare and not sexy (lighting does not exist) and it almost puts me (though there is a healthy dose of gore) Image is not limited to construction: "Seed" looks like a drunken cinematographer Undi, Bob and seamlessly connects to the camera, rather than the stomach-turning gore; This only takes a long time to only ignore the wayside that occurs a little, almost existent narrative. <br /> <br /> In 90 minutes, the film is as wide as a form of torture, which may be accompanied by the intent of Boll. <br /> <br /> Pure intellect ... I will joke on myself.
