Ouch! They can not get worse than this terrible adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. Although adaptation is adaptable to the novel, acting is just awful and sets and special effects are equivalent to a school game. I have read that BBC is the best thing ever for this miniature budget, but it must have taken a little more than $ 2, which was filmed. Mr. Beaver is the most deadly influence. I know that I have not spent time or time effectively with computer effects, but the store store man in a suit is awful. It's better to just cut out of the movie than what played the role! Avoid all these costs.
