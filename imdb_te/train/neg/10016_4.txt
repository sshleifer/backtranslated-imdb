One of the many 50 films about Hot Roding Teenage, which suffered the Ghost delusions of "dragstrip hollow". In this case, teens can not pay rent for their hangout and get deleted. With that to go somewhere else, they clearly decide the haunted house. As you may have guessed, when they arrive, some weird things are going on. <br /> <br /> You do not have anything in this movie which you have not seen in other movies, but it's good fun. My favorite character is foul pumpkin parrot. Well, let me repeat it: Quentin Tarantino did not speak like a character in the film, but he told me things he did not expect from the bird. The film's pure hook, but dangerous.
