With this ludicrously lackluster image should be embarrassing to Van Dean in memory, should really be involved in every single person. To be honest, I do not agree that I started doing it. Production values ​​are nowhere between the original crossing of 'Crossroads' and 'Prison Cell Black H'. More realistic dialogue and more plausible plot may arise at the age of five. For acting performances, if you guess the worst romance you've never seen - some of the incomplete 'story' acts to explain how the incomplete peroxide blonde boiler evolved. You will have some idea of ​​acting in 'Maiden Voyage' - tasted by a couple of blokes with whiskers. Because there is nothing else, sex scenes can not go forward. A terrible terrible picture.
