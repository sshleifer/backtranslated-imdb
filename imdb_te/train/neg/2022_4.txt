Man, it gets good reviews in review books. Frankly, I found very slow and unappealing right from the start. I waited to pick up a little steam but it did not. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare has never appealed to King James English, so it may be only me. The second half of the film has a fair share of the latter, which appears to have played the role of Ronald Coleman in the film. <br /> <br /> The good points of this film - thanks to the restored print - some good cinematography and a young, thinner and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is very boring, repeat quite a few scenes to see again. In addition, many actors nut cases, however, we know for Hollywood to prove here in this story.
