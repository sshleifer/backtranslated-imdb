This is a sarcasm in the era of women's rights movement. In fact, the coach (cinema) is not that wonderful. It runs into the same vein as a speedy BREAK (which is good, but still has a wing) and mainly the standard fare pads. It's easy to understand that I am uninteresting for this movie. Some relatives who are suddenly leading to success lead to a waste of time from a regular job by training. You have the same feeling after seeing it. It was a nice effort, but good things when acting against the opposite sex for a person's fate.
