Stewart Moss has acted as a scientist on his wife's trip and felt that he chose this character for this role for re-moving his eyes on his head ... imagine the auditions for this .. "You can not ... it's not much, thanks, next! ". Anyway, he was bitten by a bat, and then he could turn into some kind of bat and kill or kill people. Nobody will see his strange mutations, but he thinks he's changing because his changing ring wedding pops his wedding ring pop, etc. He's just kind of nuts or he's almost transforming into something up to the very end. It has some good places and sometimes has a good atmosphere, but unfortunately no one can do it with some laughter and amazingly bad acting. The fun is a "good so good" way, but just gives plain more bad side. 10 to 4.
