Anyone who worked with this film, especially the director, left the idea of ​​the logic of logic? These are not just the plot-holes, but the loss of any sympathy for the main story and his plight, the stories are so deep. That is, if you have a role as the most viewer, the characters are largely ignorant of the grave-hole plot, or boring and incomplete movie. Or, in the case of Downey's & Hanna characters, is apparently useless. Due to the presence of the important screen-time of the character of the film, the director liked his role and unnecessarily decided to increase his screen-time (the director did not change anything about the script), or his character was going to sacrifice on the altar of bad plots. <br /> <br /> I had to check the cover of the DVD to confirm that this credible talent was really made. I can not understand why Robert Altman is going to do this job. Surely he has some power to pick and choose. <br /> <br /> "I think Robert Downey Jr. may need money for his habits, I wanted Kenneth Branagh to try a South American accent, and I thought that I only gave a few pages of Robert Duvall's script and secretly alerted the character of the lone. The only inspiration I could see for Robert Allman was that I made a great deal of effort to make the film look great.I made a beautiful filter for how I created such a scene or used a bright orange float dress in another scene to draw eye movements, or to create a special mood. These things are common Do not notice, because most of the films that I will eventually come to engage me with intent to understand good stories and interesting characters.I saw the ending because I was convinced that some hilarious element of the hopeful DVD cover and having some prestigious factor in the film. <br /> <br /> Nice direction. I'm not looking at movies.
