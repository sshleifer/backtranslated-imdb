I was really surprised ... the movies they produced are not so good. I'm looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, although I know it probably sucks. I was pleasantly surprised. Nevertheless, they have gone too far from the book's storyline, and the film does not really portray how terrible it is. Ending is very different. Laura Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad aesthetic surgery. This acting is fine. If a theater is transformed, they should not have much time in the box "Taken for TV Movie" box, which is a good movie. If you see this movie, I encourage you to examine and read the book. I suspect you are disappointed and I think you will enjoy it every time I read it.
