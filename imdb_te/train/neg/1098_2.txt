I got this film at Walmart at $ 5 bin. I do not recommend going to this move. <br /> <br /> I saw in the cover and cut through the essence and thought it was a war film. I wish I could know how this film is going to be boring before turning around. It's my fault to think something is going to happen. This is just a group of people going from one boot camp to another. These silent soldiers deal with the soldiers very seriously and the main character seeks to get out of combat in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is my pride about the film: I see this movie slow and hard to see. It's one of those movies that you put and it's hard to watch because it's off but hanging to a string of hope that you will pick up at the end. It's not. After the film behind my T.V I was angry because I was angry for about 2 hours in my life and another 10 minutes of writing this review to warn people about it.
