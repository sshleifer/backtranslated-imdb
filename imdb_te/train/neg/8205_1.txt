Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. <br /> <br /> When the human being arrives on alien ship ports, the surprising events are boring and very dull. <br /> It's science fiction that I've seen so far in the trash. I saw 5 stars and I decided to see it since I liked the genre, but it was very bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are some very good movies on the subject of Alzheimer's, very low budget with them <br /> I give 3/10
