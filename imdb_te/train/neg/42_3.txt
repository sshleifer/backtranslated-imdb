This is perhaps the least recognizable in three titles from Jess Franco in the Official DPP Video Nasty List (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Bars Behind the Behind), a terrifically dull forest clunker, <br /> <br /> Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfelner cinema Actor Laura Crawford plays a role, a gang of cruel kidnappers stolen him and a remote trophy /> <br /> In the jungle lives on the island of stone coming back <br "demon god" to worship the wild species (like to eat the hearts of sacrificial offering to a large woman, nude, puffy-eyed local). <br /> <br /> Laura's agent travels on a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Clairv) and his Vietnam Wet Pilot Palace island, but trouble with the bad guys try to double-cross. In confusion, Laura escapes in the forest, but goes directly into the hands of the locals on the island, giving her to her god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs his usual heartfelt style and this ridiculous attempt is his typical horrible trademarks: garbage gour, murky cinematography, fast zooms, many punk shots, visual imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fist editing. The result is a real struggle to sit from start to finish and it's a terrible mess (it took me a couple of meetings to finish the subject), and even in her natural reputation all the sweeter Buchfellner's vision is not enough to rebuild me with this film anxiety.
