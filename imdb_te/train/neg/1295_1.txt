This is bad in the worst films I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I feel a masterpiece of the same director, another film by 80,000 V of the electric dragon. I really wanted to like this film - asano is a fantastic actor and storyteller is immensely attractive. <br /> <br /> There was nothing entertaining about it. And the effects the director used - such as the perpetual percussion and exaggerated use of slow motion - added to the fact that the plot was slow and the actors were delusionally discouraging. The bore of an hour spent on watches such as slashing mud idols and declaring he does not worship is a result of additional additional additional results. This plot has not been added. A fellow Japanese movie buff and I have both constantly checking time. We believe this movie is terrible. And the end is awful. I would make the viewer reward the least for the man sitting by this director, but sadly I was wrong.
