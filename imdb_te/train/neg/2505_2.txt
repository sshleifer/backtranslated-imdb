To find out that Lyon was not the right actress for this role, I saw both Little Richard in interviews and performances, and poor Lyon found enough in the music of this 50/60 music. Leone was very good as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but the film was completely unsuccessful to capture the Little Richard essence. <br /> <br /> "Return fools fall in love?" Actor Miguel Angele, who played the role of Little Richard in the remake of the powerful but elegant of the musicians, is a more favorable choice. <br /> If the performances are not incredible, the film will remain the same. And this happened. LR's degeneration into homosexuality and anaerobic is completely glazed or missed. <br /> <br /> "The Temptations" did well to strengthen the growth of the band, pimples and everything, the film did not miss a wider mark. <br /> <br /> What happens to director Robert Townsend, "Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented, funny guy but does not distribute anything near the first attempt.
