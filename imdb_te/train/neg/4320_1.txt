First of all, I said that this film is not for people looking to be curious and happy for the holidays. The film is cold, brutal, and just disappointingly disappointing. Mary Stein Burnen's husband lost his job, Christmas is losing his home and can not buy Christmas presents for kids because a hypocritical mother who is down in Christmas gets you thinking and happiness for the holidays. Thus Harry Dean Stanton Gideon arrives as the Christmas angel, watching his dark hat and pedophilie on a daily basis surrounding children in the dark overcut. Mary Stein Burnann's Christmas spirit is better than killing her family and proposes to bring her back when she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmail and his Christmas workshop appears to be a paradise for refugee Nazis in the Lamb. The film represents everything on the thick, because the rest of the movie is not too bitter and unbelievable, and you do not care about the happiest end when you come. I would like this movie to be a Capra-like thing, but it left the joy and feelings to be a holiday movie.
