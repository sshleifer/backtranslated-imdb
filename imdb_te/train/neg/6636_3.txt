The worst, at least the natural acting performances I've seen. It's not a surprise, given the clunky, lame dialog given by a note letters. Add that cheap product values ​​and I've got a movie that does not seem like it belongs on television. <br /> Plot-wise, Harlequin is also a terrible, cliché romance from a lifelong movie. It is possible to guess what the rest of the movie looks like by watching the movie's opening couple. Surprise, the only female character who ends up falling in love with any vision and mysterious stranger.
