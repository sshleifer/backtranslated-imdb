The story in this film, character development, and gags are all too weak. Time is very waste. Although the end credits of the Save Grace are raised through their struggles, a warm and messable experience is required. Such warm shading concepts do not have such a development possible. Drug clothing is extensive and most of the film does not have a real ring for life. The storyline needs to be tension, but the characters do not have enough development to take care of. Then they turn their attention to the time that they left the viewer through the solution of all the problems within a minute.
