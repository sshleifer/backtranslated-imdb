The plot of the film is not only the placement of two psychoses with the ability to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat, which is a terrible split of 'Miyari'. <br /> <br /> I gave such a low rating to the film because it was totally frustrating for me. <br /> <br /> I am scared of filmmakers dishing them, <br /> <br /> The film is completely distorted from violence and violence in order to earn points in the shock factor. <br /> The first ten minutes 'Seek' will find themselves for the remote.
