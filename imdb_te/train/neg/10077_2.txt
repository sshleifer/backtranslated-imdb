Well, at least my theater group, lol. While it's always my favorite music or story, it still has a little more special place in my heart since it's still a lot fun to watch, but of course I remember watching a Grease from a little girl. I heard terrible things about Grease 2 and I decided I would never see it, but my boyfriend agreed that it was not really bad, so I decided to give a shot, but I just laughed. The plot is first completely stolen from the first and they are not really brilliant, just to use the same characters, but not to mention the different names and actors. How did Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue after the ex-gangs left? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> Music and dance is not discontinued. But when Sandy's relative comes to the new student scene, he falls in love with Pink Lady Stephanie. But she must adhere to the code that she wants to adhere to pink ladies T-birds, so the new student decides to win her heart as her T-Bird. So he wore a rebellious motorcycle bandit dress up to ride and defeat evil bikers from kicking T-bird's baskets well. But who does he really tell Stephanie or she find her own? <br /> <br /> Grease 2 does not work like a silly TV show. The gang did not click as the first grease as well, not to mention the French coming back a bit crazy and unbelievable, I graduated from her Rydell, but apparently she was not. The songs are not really impressive; I am happy that Michelle is able to bounce back very fast, but I can not recommend this film because you are the only person with this silly little sequel, but I warn you <br /> <br /> You, more from this musical musical An enthusiastic attempt with money. <br /> <br />
