Despite the pretty bad reviews, I got to give this film a go ?? After all, all the action cat-robbers team will do all Star HK Super-babe Shu Qui plus 6 other oriental lovelies. Are definitely worth checking out? Marshall Angels is hard to beat when it comes to the infant celebration. Eye candy top quality. Shu Qui always looks awesome and the rest of them, Rosemary Wandbrook and Amanda Strong specifically attracted my Raving Eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a perfect stinker! The story is weak, the action is dirty and special effects are obviously curious. Director Clarence Fawk and producer Wang Jing gave us a photogenic cast and a little more. <br /> <br /> If you're the only reason you're thinking of this idea, you have sex and jen 2 again!
