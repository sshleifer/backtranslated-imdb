In contrast to other commentaries on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family found the film on DVD and at home to watch DVDs at home on DVD. Motion picture-based film is a major writer. The 30-second sounds of different story-lines from a dozen or more "story-lines" are a great and intuitive viewer, rather than trying to tell a complex story in a clever and clearer manner, constantly being obscured and overwhelming. No, sir, it's not. <br /> <br /> This film is the film's president, end and end. <br /> <br /> For TV and DVD shows of Hollywood and British film heroes in the 1940s and 1950s, well-known writers, writers, directors, and actors know the obvious story, mention and acting. </ p> <br /> This DVD does not have this family sitting again.
