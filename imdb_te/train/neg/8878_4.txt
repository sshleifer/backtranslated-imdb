Judy Holliday made a golden run in George Cooker's film version "Born Again" in 1950, and since then, her career attempts to get better things that allow her to retain the gold medal. <br /> Never happened. "It's Sheet Happen To You" (I can not think of a Blunder title), Holiday still has another variation on the dumb blonde, but not so dumb at all, but everything about the film and half the heart. Jack Lemmon, though his first film role, should not have enough energy to improve this recycled comedy. <br /> <br /> Audiences do not know how the movie ends, so most of it is looking forward to waiting. <br /> <br /> If you are attractive to Holiday, you'll enjoy it. <br /> Grade: C
