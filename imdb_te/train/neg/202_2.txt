This is not the sound of the bees, it is inspired by watching this very long, very boring, badly featured movie. I never know how 3 1/2 hours is never without sleeping. Plots are linear ... 3 1/2 hours 3 Talk about the complete unreliable morons about sex. You think Romer was terrible. If it's worse, it's possible. > I must be a masculist without seeing the whole movie or anyone killing it.
