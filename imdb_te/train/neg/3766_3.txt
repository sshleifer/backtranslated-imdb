I was aware that I was not watching this movie. But it's terrible for the words I've seen. I'm not strict, its movie is just terrible. Overall it's bad, I mean AWFUL special effects, acting is not too bad, but it's not as good as well, and Saskwach is like himself .... well, not Saskwatch. In my opinion, Harry and Henderson are the best Saskwatch film. It is not violent or horrific, but it has the best description of Saskatche. At least its claim and some half-donkey cgi are not rip-off. If you are disappointed, anyone in the movie really appreciates anyone. Or go watch the boondock saints, it's pretty good.
