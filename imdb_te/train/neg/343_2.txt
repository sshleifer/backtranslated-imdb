A truly, really terrible Canadian-German co-production, always wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays for an actress whose young daughter plays an actress to redefine the word "problem child" - the child killed his father, and mum took some "ancestors" before the death of the offspring. Now she moved up to the northwest US to start, but her baby still has a problem in her mother's dedication. <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaffer (daughter) is more murderers than people - she also provides an awful performance that has been wiped out. The non-interactive script, the usual direction and the terrible music (check the saxophone for the first time she performs the bikini-wearing baud) does not help; We are supposed to find her sexy and scary, but if she fails two counts. It is not sufficiently unsatisfactory and unpleasant to be ridiculous (and Arquette and Schaffer not really aware of the fact that the mother and daughter are not convinced), all of the grief for Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prokos, both of which are valuable, and both of them (especially Rosanna) reasons. </ p> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - "Lies and Murder" (from Two Short Productions) is such a "you have to make fun of" credit.
