Fox and foxes are a wonderful book of foxes. Stealing from farms and killing chase. The farmers decide that the three have this fox and try different ways to have a "solution". They were "foxes" at every turn and three farmers carried out land attacks. <br /> <br /> "Cinema" version, and I was a loose pastiche of the movie film, too loose, American Hast movies especially the Ocean Movies. They also have George Clooney who they add to add insult to Mr. Fox and manage to completely miss the story's point of view. So kudos to them .They make our money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl book book.
