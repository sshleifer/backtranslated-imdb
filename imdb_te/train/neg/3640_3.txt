I did not have the background knowledge of this film before I bought it, but it's cool alert and I'm just looking to see a slightly more kick butt Viking movie now ... Alas, this movie is not what I'm looking for. I thought it was better, but instead, the 84-minute time was completed and the boring Nordic soap opera that had been dragged for a long time. The motion of the film is very interesting: it's about Odin, who criticizes his god and Odin, and the son of the warlord called Berek, a furiously cursed death and rebirth. This bare person needs to live a violent lifetime after anger, madness, and lifelong. The film was filmed with sound, some of the rich cinematography and partial-good performances of actors, but I was frustrated and questioned when this dribbling ended. The filmmakers have an opportunity to make some entertaining and semi-specific, but they have retired the ball. It has improved with some cheap exploitative strategies thrown out as such unwanted nudity and gore. So, what are we talking about "berscakers" here? The Vikings need to be bad, with all the raps and frozen, the Bearscakes need not be serious yet? In all, if you're a fan of Young and Restless (etc ...), you're actually a mad Berserker who likes self-violence, I'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid.
