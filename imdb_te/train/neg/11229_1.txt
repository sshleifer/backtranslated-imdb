They looked at me in this school and it was terrible. The movie has expired. These stories were confused because the story was made more interesting. Teachers have spoken this as a treat but really it is a painful boring experience. I have very few actors in the film, but most of them do what they do in the real life of the movie. Cheese acting is very often. In addition, the story is very sympathetic and distorted. I do not like writing some lines and I want them to have more meaning. However, education, funny, curiosity, and hip are written, boring, dry, distracted, and old. I hope nobody takes time to watch this movie, because you can not see it.
