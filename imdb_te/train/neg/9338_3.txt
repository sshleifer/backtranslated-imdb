Palm Greer coffeemed. She is a nurse who wants to take revenge on her sister's bad heroine. As with any 70s Blaxploitation film, you can see racist bad guys get their just desserts. <br /> <br /> The number of these films produced in the 70s was really a reality for black and white audiences. It is primarily due to the racist racial contradiction, and humiliating, stereotypical roles in these films. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> There are other common threads between the brutal violence, the corruption police, the car, the generosity of nakedness, and the sex-crazed gorgeous women among other forms of coffee. <br /> <br /> Palm Grair is the undisputed queen of the blockbuster fans of the 70s. She's amazing, being two tough-like nails, and beautiful-drop-dead. Like her other films, Palm revealed other characters in coffee. In fact, Palm is very attractive on the screen, and these films do not see her in the lead role. <br /> <br /> If you like Palm Grier, it would be nice to watch his other films like Fox Brown or perhaps Foster on Friday. These films are less than coffee. Pam's role in Coffy, spoil her way too much to get bad guys. She is not less likely to take revenge on the palm roles of coffee in other blocks of plasma. <br /> <br /> If Palm Grier's other films can not see, I'll see only coffee. Otherwise, coffee waste time. Palm's talent as an actress only looks like coffee bearer.
