"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I have ever seen in my life. My aunt's holidays are very lovely. <br /> Actors are appointed on uglypeople.com. <br /> They walk and walk in the forest. Together with the three-part of "Lord of the Rings" is around-around walking. After the first hour, I started watching "trigger man" while reading Porsche's pamphlet. <br /> <br /> The amount of time and money you waste. I want this picture to give out 0 out of 10, because this is not possible, I need 1 star.
