The film has been kidnapped child from the perspective of Mom (Lisa Hartman Black), who plays a man in an action thriller. Unlike the other images on the police, his mother was kidnapped here by his former husband's mother. <br /> <br /> Before finally catching his son, very strange things happened. A local theater at a community theater tries to take a baby from a local children's play that looks like his son. She was caught, and finds it is not her child. Would have gotten so many people put in a few months in prison for mental ward or trial alone. However, the victim's parents will be released two hours later in the film to forgive her. The mother soon enters her mother's home and then the police reach and their guns target her, but she must let her escape because she recognizes her (and she's sorry). <br /> <br /> In this story they found children, but when police came to find a house they left behind the door and went out into the river. Such an emergency escape! Amma gets someone to give her a raft, and some time (real world), her and lawyer-boyfriend, and the police to catch the other raft pretty quickly and it's upside down water by drinking water. Instead of getting out of the raft to find Dad on the ground, he drowned the boy and thought she had flown into the water when she saw her life-jacket. However, she did not swim and sink a rock. The lawyer saves her, but they lose the chance to run after father. At one point Mom was told that his son died at a clinic in Mexico. Turn on and it goes, and it stops where no one knows! In some ways, this film really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive. On the other hand, men are happy to see all the crazy things men do in these types of films (or funny?).
