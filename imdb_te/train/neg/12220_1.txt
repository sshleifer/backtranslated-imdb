This film is more obscene than most of the films I've been doing and I've worked very hard. Absolute nonsense. It got terrible, forced conversation; Nonsense space development; The 'Spooky Imagery' scenes seen as High School Remedial Art Project have been removed rather than the horror film; 5/10 best attractive lady; Long, boring sex sequences are women (forget you forget about virgins! Especially with fake chest driven by them); muttered, difficult to understand speech from some of the characters; And masks from killer cloves to outer space during the Hollywood scene, because the film was pretty funny, but it was not. Wayne Fell is the bad guy in history. <br /> Make sure this one miss.
