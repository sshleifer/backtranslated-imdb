Set in Providence, Rhode Island, the mass feeding government seeks a satirical look of the role of the media. Best of all, it can be applied to the US to try to control the media during the Iraq war, but it is empty. There is never any tension in the story, acting is not good. Worse, worse in the direction of the movie, focus on the odd camera angles, which is "not an odd way to capture the camera." Special effects are very bad ... At one point the video of the explosion was filmed green on the city and it was greatly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are twin bright spots in the movie ... they are post-zombie services (including renewal service and a party bus). <br /> <br /> For a better zombie image, try to hide and creep. It has the same weak product value, but behind it there is much intelligence, humor and talent.
