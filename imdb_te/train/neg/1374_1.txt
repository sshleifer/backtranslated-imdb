Man, this is hilarious. It should be under comedy. Or STUPID. It was very easy to know what had happened to the horse pole. Seriously? I would like to influence anyone attached to this image immediately. For everybody who is looking at this "movie", go to some plot points. Oh stuck. Nothing. There is literally no plot. I am fed up with Casper Van Dean, and he decided to film something with some random one, and surprisingly, it was something on the video tape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not trust me Let's see. This is the man. I am so glad to you. But be ready to take your eyes out. If you sit through this without a cow in a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
