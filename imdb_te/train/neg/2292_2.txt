Firstly, I accept Batman: the best Batman series ever for the animated series. We saw it on TV. I do not realize that I had Season Four. Actually not. BTAS ends with Season 3, and will stop there. <br /> <br /> Why are they so tired of good things? Catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker looks scary, every time they seem to have modified his appearance, he looks more scary. <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne voiced by Kevin Conroy who made the best batman. He now looks like Superman. <br /> When they look at both, Bruce Wayne is now blue eyes. <br /> Night wing really needs a haircut, please! <br /> <br /> I've seen three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and this version is more violent and graphic (already) <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: Batman is not Season 4 in the animated series. They included the series as season 4 for Market 4. <br /> <br /> If they release new Batman adventures, I do not think many people have bought it. <br /> <br /> Build yourself up for 1-3 seasons of frustration and persistence.
