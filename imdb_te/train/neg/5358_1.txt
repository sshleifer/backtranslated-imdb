So far, all the good reviews posted for this film are known to anyone who is associated with the film or who knows who somebody knows and has seen several cuts in this way. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I've seen the last cut, and it's pure garbage. The only thing that's going for it is the ambition and multiplayer comos from horrific legends (none of the terrible length screen). The filmmakers produced the film at the horror convention weekend and took photographs shot in coffee breaks such as Tony Todd, Tom Savinie, David Hess and Michael Barryman. It is ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with sharp acting from the cast of non-cast actors than in the 21st century unacceptable. No or no action; This is a strange descriptive conversation. Ther Computer FX is a joke, but there is not enough or enough action for them to make this film enjoyable as an MST3K way. After 8 straight sequences about talking but talking, you'll see that you're moving faster for the button that goes forward ... and will not go. Absolutely not working.
