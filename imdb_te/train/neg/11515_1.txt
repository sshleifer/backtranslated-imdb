And forget this. Completely. If you really want to see Madonna's action, "Body of Evidence" should be rented, at least Willem Defoe is one of them. <br /> <br /> In this movie, when the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. You will not lose anything. Bruce Greenwood is ruined, Jane Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is terrible, it's fun. Why this mess got the original film butcher, I never knew; They thought it was "cash". Madonna, as an actress, is definitely not. <br /> If you take the original image from 1979, you will enjoy it, the actors can actually work. 1/10.
