It sounds very interesting but I have rented this movie because my horror movie is the worst thing I have ever seen! I read the comment from Gumbi-8 and be a part of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> Gumbi-8 is a member of a child with a child of 4 years or a few chaos who do not think that nobody has any inclination in their right minds. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the comments of Gumbi 8. <br /> <br /> "From the quick animation" of Doon "inspired early animation ... this film keeps the eye moving and the recurring view is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Animation is interesting and only keeps the eye of the film moving It's nice because aspect, you keep looking for any type of suspense.I am a breakaway Halloween $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and even the way <br /> <br /> Gumbi-8 is another fan of another quote: "This acting is also a strong factor in the film." <Br / <br /> <br / > Honorable for all actors, their performance is not more than the talent of Robert Nuptan. <br /> <br /> Attractive tagline: "Beware between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only pain you see is some red paint on the sheet on the body you have never seen. <br /> <br /> In concert, I saw horror films in the 50s, 60s and 70s. I felt very bad and I saw very good. The film's director did not make any effort, slept or acid hit. Nevertheless, the actors appreciated trying to keep working in a very good direction. I gave this film a 5 rating for 'B'.
