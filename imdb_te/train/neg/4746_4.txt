There are many things wrong with the film-Brenda Song's character is one of them. I do not believe the girl is a lousy actor- not honest. I believe that she gave her poor lines. <br /> <br /> She says she is "vain, rich girl", and it shows that she plays here where she's funny on TV, and it can not even get powder from me. <br /> <br /> I want to know when I sit down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is not that terrible ... at the beginning. Silver reaction to Shen is totally natural. How do you feel if a person claims to be a rebellious monk, you wore a medal and told you that you need to fight "the great nasty" and save the world? This brings me to another point. I know this film is completely fiction, but it is still established in Chinese culture. It looks like the "warriors" of the Wendy's family are women. Please correct me if I make a mistake, but I suspect the monks are just okay. Sure, maybe they were able to somehow work, but they did not give any explanation. <br /> <br /> They have contributed to the fraudulent efforts of women's empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> But, let's go. <br /> <br /> The silver role is changing and the film can not bear more. Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near home- I mean, who wants to fight evil at home back home? The problem is, when "bad" begins to manifest itself, silver wants to be like her. She is very careless - anyone like her. She did not care about her training. I use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this war, it's bad, and everything is gone." Wendy: "Wow, talk about stress ... talk about something else." Yeah, let's say silver. Let's also go dance and when you have to be properly trained. Course Shen allows her, but his role is not a necessity. <br /> <br /> She did not, and she was not trained, and both were killed. <br /> <br /> She makes silver's actions more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " , When she was trying to go home, the monks, (she was "an unnatural feeling of fighting an old man" because she was trapped in her coach and teacher community) <br /> <br /> When we first saw a half-fight fight, it's really fun. Finally, the great evil comes from the opponent's home-going body and his It creates a genuine form of the body of the ancient warriors out of the broken pieces <br /> <br /> Shen goes out and saves her from this guy - let me forget his long Chinese name Forgive - will teach him to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad enough that silver is too quick to come to power. <br /> <br /> She is "fate" because she can not be forgiven and she has "the inside power". <br /> When does she learn her medicine? No, worst ... when can she reproduce people? So Shen was raised from the dead. Then, silver and he fight with the guy. <br /> He loses the way easily. The worst part, when they jump together, and at the same time to kick him out, and he is forever deported. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Do you know the script writer and director want a little more "wit" for a war? # 2: Which sacrifice? Did not she go home? Because the girl did not break a sweater or bleeding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. Based on my comments, I gave the film one. Part of criticism, you need to know, however, one thing breaks down. You do not necessarily try to look for evil, but if it's there, you'll be brought to it. <br /> <br /> The movie is very bad, but something really funny happens when you do not really expect something great in the first place. Not to say that it was not right, it stopped anyone from seeing it.
