Like most festive entries, Hamilton has all the ideas and small implementation for an image for an interesting watch. While it is impressive for the obvious low budget it falters in the final twist film and draws it out and becomes dreadfully long during the obvious end. This film is about a family of murders trying to survive after the death of their parents. They kidnapped people, feed blood from them and feed something locked in their basement. Some nice dark comedy shows from Mckellhar and Fergence are just so so. This movie is realistic or very spectacular for that matter. But for the first half taps into an extraordinary hilarious and dark alloy, which is a surprising accomplishment. The whole film is not so successful, it portrays unrealistic twists as a spectacular confrontation, which makes the entire movie even worse. Although some talents are related to this product and it is deeply flawed, it is very insulting, although original and creative. <br /> When it comes to delivery, it will fail at every level. <br /> <br /> <br />
