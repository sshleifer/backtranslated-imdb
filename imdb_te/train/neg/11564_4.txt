Italian horror / suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and barbarians for red-haired girls like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know that he really loved his wife - a huge, decomposed fortress - separates them and tortures them, kills them and kills them. The most cynical item of the film is that, at the end of the film, Antonio de Tuff played this hero who is the hero of this hero. Nevertheless, immediately after his playboy uncle Roberto Malder's advice, De Teff settles down with his girlfriend at her uncle's party. She moves and strange things happen to De Tef's fragile state. He sees his dead wife watching and listening, and finally, if you're still excited, look at the title. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor aunt Agatha (she is younger than De Tepefi and holds her in her wheelchair and tries to see the old man) joins her task in a foxy farm. Inject another person and then buried alive. Why did Evelyn do what she did? Director Emilio Miraglia is doing some things well: The settings in this movie are well suited for the film, but believe that England believes that it is ridiculous. None of the actors will appear in English. Many dark black hair and Mediterranean complexes and wearable clothes are not an Englishman dead. But for everything, the scene of the ghory was effectively filmed and I liked a very cheerful decision. And of course any comedy, the red-headed Erica Blanc film ever. There is a sexual harassment streak; However, I realized that she was somewhat scared by the thought that she was very good and healthy to torture women to relieve her mental demons. C'mon.
