One of my favorite actors, James Spider, I thought the film was at least tolerable. It's not. After the first half of the day, I saw the rest of my hands with a remote control, so fast forward ready. So soft, so standard, one knows what's going on in every scene. The term of speech can also be evaluated for the term. One of these films is scratched, "How did this picture come about?" In an attempt to say something positive, I'll add some good entertainment and entertaining special effects. But, overall, if you see 5 science / movies, or you are over 9 years old, do it yourself and stay away from it.
