I enjoyed this movie. It has moved very slowly and is just boring. If it's on TV, it may be 15 to 20 minutes. What happened to the story? A cast and a photographer are working on a wrong foundation. If it depends on the life of the director, no one knows that the writing is also "loose." Then he may be the source of some people shaking off during the film which is directed at the pace of a snail. Music source, but for a different movie, this is not for ... Soap opera saga. There are times when the conversation does not understand when speaking to Armin Milan. I'm not alone, because I've heard a few chaos about whom to tell someone. Why do not Hollywood make better movies? This includes a great story nugget, but just run poorly.
