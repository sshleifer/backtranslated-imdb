<br /> <br /> The most inspiring thing about White Men is that it is a wonderful movie. For many years, I lived in the area as far as I was filmed in this film; Race tensions are high, and basketball represents everything for everyone. An image about the members of this "basketball culture" can be very interesting, but a simple acting and poor script should not work in White Men. Is cyclic. First, Billy can earn money or lose money by playing basketball. He goes back to his home and lounges with his girlfriends; And the process will be repeated. Most stories have been built up to some kind of climax, but the "climax" I saw is another sequence in this recurrence (in this case "Billy Basketball Playing to Play or Losing Money"). <br /> <> To improve a plot, some confusion should be solved; It's interesting to see if this movie is interesting. Apparently, White Men's authors can not forget this rule because the plot is a compilation that "bill needs to pay bills". I appreciated the change of pace from other formula sports movies, but - sorry - this is just plain awful. <br /> <br /> Despite all of this, I think white men are unable to jump. Apparently some disqualified sports fans dismiss a terrible piece of writing for some scenes with a basketball. Others, I'm sure, have played major roles and have gained big names. If the cast is completely replaced with previously unknown actors, if the basketball theme is replaced with lacrosure, can not anyone see this movie? <br /> <br /> I will give this film ten to two stars. Additional star "Jeopardy!" The scene kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
