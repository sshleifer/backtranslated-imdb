Lem plots and bilingual scripted letters appear as cardboard cut-outs. Needless to say, it made it difficult for any characters, especially the future husband to experience empathy; He looked like a cartoon. In summary, I guess you can say that your play is equal to making it for TV drama. It uses only about every click in the book. The breakdown of the traditional musicologist Salsa wants to break and play. Free-enthusiastic prospective guy "Been Counter" is engaged to personality, she does not love. I do not list them or I'd give the whole plot because it's spoiler. Dancing is nothing but nothing special. I looked worse. 3 stars for good music. The band is really tight. I watched it on YouTube. Thankfully I did not pay good money to watch at a theater. I have made great reviews in this film yet.
