In the first theatrical release, I returned to this movie at the theater. After films that have been seen for decades, it is not believed or not, this time is still clear in my eyes; <br /> The acting is very small in the standard set of random group of drunken high school students who read from the street and need to learn their lines. <br /> <br /> Each scene was laughing for a while after the first shock that faced disbelief because of a new lip. But after a while, even worn off that unreal pleasure and it just got really sad.
