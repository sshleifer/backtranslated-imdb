<br /> <br /> This is a drive-in feature, co-bill with the velvet vampire. A Spanish-Italian co-production that is at the same time assassinated women in a village, appears on a local count horse named Yanus Dolmer, and then goes with his 'man-eating' dog. <br /> The town is already suspected of being one behind him and burned his castle. <br /> <br /> The murders were initially killed by an older brother of Yanos Count Igor Dolmer, who were seriously threatened and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Then Igor (Erna Shur) shows him in his experiments before his death. Yonos agrees to replace her brother, and together they seek the principles for the reproduction of dead cells. <br /> <br /> However, Igor is still alive (despite the terrible burning) and the killing and killing of women in the village. <br /> <br /> We realize that there is a picture of his char-brilliant face in different places in the film, so we know he is alive, the whole thing is very clear. <br /> If Igor finds another meaningful ending, Ivan is struggling with Yenos, Igor drops bed candles, meets another, meets another, and finally knocks out the darkness. <br /> <br /> Retroidia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks very grainy and bad. Apart from the geese trailer, no other additions are included. Although it's a nice, creepy Spanish castle and good atmosphere, I found it very boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
