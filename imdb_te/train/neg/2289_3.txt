Unfortunately, Marie Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life with her own problems with men. In her work, each adult male character is portrayed as a weak, males or twisted. To add to her fiction, Betty Page tells her that her thoughts and problems are not right. Betty did not leave the biz because it was morally wrong or religious issues (though she was born again, despite being born again after her third husband's influence). As she was 30 years old, she acted, her acting career was somewhere and she thought she was missing. The signs of aggression and rape were extravagant and rejected in Batty's own words and the director's attempts to accuse the men of being victims of being Betty. Beetle almost made her own outfit in all of her shoots (she was not given by "sick" fascists). Bettie Yegier, who has made several famous photo shoots of Betty, made a lot of "naughty" shoots with Betti and Harron failed to be a morally upright professional photographer shot in the film. Only the Gretchen Mole Bettie can be saved. Otherwise, other films and documentaries are more accurate and honest to people of her life and those in it.
