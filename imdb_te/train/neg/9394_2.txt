Oh, man, how little serials have fallen by 1952! The frustrating thing is that all of Willy's serials are furious. The heroes are not only adding scenes that are not there in the previous chapter (and it will not be there - say the bad guys do not see them when the exploded on the field from 7 to 8. Let the characters jump), but I think this is a world record of the serial stock program. I mean, it's very stock footage! And from other serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from the King of Rocket Men, and the cold "melt rocks" episode 2 to 3 scenes from the Adventures of Captain Marvel), but by itself! The "Moon Trip" sequence recurring in Episode 8 from episode 1 (which is always the lowest, it is 30 seconds long and letters away from Episode 1 Earth's atmosphere)! And all scenes from episode 10 previous episodes! (Why never ever wonder why MST3K Episode 10, 11, and 12 episodes never stunned after 9/9, so they do not need to do the whole job again! <br /> <br /> Started in Science Factor. Always ready to see the sun moon! And the moon men who can not breathe in their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, it will be very tough and acrobatics (usually the best in serials) and a lot more. By visualisation, I think the commando is in the shape of a bullet (or lime-shaped) helmet that is completely ridiculous? The racquet's image was cool, and the movie was bad (and man, it was awful). The tank like the tank does not look much better, a bunch of kids will seem to be made for Halloween. The only positive thing I think is that the actor who plays the hero about it is the usual of the normal muscular hunk instead (hey, every one is right!) But then he's so irrevocable ... <br /> <br /> It is not worth watching nostalgia . See Captain Marvel instead. <br /> (See BTW, the unforgettable quotes section for the real ladies Lib Pearl).
