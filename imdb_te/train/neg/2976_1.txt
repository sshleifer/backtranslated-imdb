Exciting, it's really very much viewable. I mean, it's bad. This is very bad. But it is true-it destroys my life as bad-it's a bad thing-being fun and entertaining. That's right, that's pretty thick praise. Production values ​​are decomposed across the board, acting is excruciating and the Romero-wannabe satire does not make its mind on any side of the ecological fence of mocking it. Internal logic leads to getting rid of fridges, virus incubation times are needed for 'plots', to work against zombies or not, the zombies have no power to speak or not. Gore is sure to draw, but the frame is slapdash it is annoying. Conversation sounds like translated by the same computers that communicate conversations manuals, and none of the zombie invasion level is imprinted with the romance of Romero. It is topped by a horror synth score. Absolute worst.
