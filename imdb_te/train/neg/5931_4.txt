This image should only be 10 minutes. I have only 10 minutes worth of watchable content on this subject (I also feel like calling the movie). Early credit of the film was somewhat guaranteed. Since the film starts with the little comments, you really rub your hands and wait for more footage from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave makes a reasonable covering of one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of the cave's performance makes you more interested in Cohen, whose wit and well-spoken words are already linked to your fancy. But the cave's performance is literally just beginning with lengthy super boring performances by not having a less attraction to keep your seat as it turns out. What does the filmmaker really think about? Five minutes of close shots come to singers in fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker really think of stimulating the audience by adding "fake praise" to these endless evil scenes. This film will lead to accurate torture, which is very small in what you see. There is only one footage of the past of Cohen. In fact, a singer / poet absolutely nothing except some photographs of his early days! If you add all the minutes of the Cohen speaking, it may not reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes cruelly threw the camera's literature bit by bit between the dangerous camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people. If the film decides to waste your money, DO NOT! Just throw in the trash and save at least your time.
