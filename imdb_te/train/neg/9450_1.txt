Spend your time at any time, and the home office is better than this film. Jokes are not funny, Dr. Seas is not funny rhyme. Very soft way to waste an evening. My kids got frustrated at the younger ones at the start of 4-16 and left to play Barbies and the PS2 and play old ones left to surf the net. My wife left and made dishes. I'm done alone. It's the worst "kids" I've ever seen. If you want to watch a fun children's watch watch Shrek 2, the film is fun for kids and their parents. This image is avoided. It's not funny, it's not cute, the decoration of the cat is about it's only good thing and you can see that you're labeled the disc.
