If I give a zero, I'd change my mind and give the -10 instead. A terrible film without a plot of cinema is not known what will happen. Just plain boring. Please do not waste your money in this money. Pleaseee !!! It would have been better if the film really captured the story of a true horoscope killer, but what do you think of when I look at Nops and I see it? Like yourself and rent some classic movies instead, its good to see a movie you've seen as much as 3-4 times already to watch this rubbish! It is difficult to see why such films are made when people realize that they are not well known. The zodiac killer is called 'boreak killer' instead.
