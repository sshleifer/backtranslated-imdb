Despite the familiar "televised" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing unusual about this film or any performance. In fact, the only thing that separates it from the 1960s' 70s television series like "The Rat Patrol" is a big cast and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and is apparently trying to break away from all the comedy stuff he's doing ("Marquee", "Your Local Sheriff Support" - "Gun Fighter"). ). Unfortunately his ferocious likelihood will act against him because the sledge is a fairytale role written for cash by Clint Eastwood's spaghetti Western character. But the thing of Eastwood is not flat and ruddy. <br /> <br /> "Sledge that a man calls" can be classified as a Western medium. The slow-paced "action" television series fans have directed the film and co-authored with Frank Kowalsk. Some sophisticated slow moves shots and cross curls, which attracts attention rather than the intention of telling the story. <br /> The plot is a standard "big heist" thing (where "The Wager Wagon" inserted) allowed a $ 300,000 gold trafficking to be exploited. His gang is Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that the transport has been guarded by 40 corridors and stopped locking the treasury inside the provincial prison. <br /> <br /> The story makes a good bell of television, but a very thick film will be too old. <br /> <br /> Gerner does not allow any part to lose his role and does not produce enough suspense to attract the viewer. A fictitious and completely logic card game. <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
