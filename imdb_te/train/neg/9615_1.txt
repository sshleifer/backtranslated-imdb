This is from this adaptation he does not. He left only the back part, he made his own! The things he chose to leave were quite ridiculous, and I left most important parts of the novel. The plot is unstable, inconsistent and unstable. I'm not excited about the actors, but they can not work! Dickens are difficult, of course, but this is curiosity! Micawber was not more than the middle of the nineteenth century, Bettie not mentioned much about Trotwood! If you want to see a real Copperfield, see the 1999 BBC adaptation of the amazing. As for the screenplay writer, I think he read the cliff's notes!
