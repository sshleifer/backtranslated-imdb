All Adamson - I asked this film for a reason. He's one of the worst directors of all time - right there Eddie, Jr. and Pandian of Ray Dennis Steckler and awful. Nevertheless, although the film was very bad, I never had the worst level of previous movies ever since I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film was titled "Naughty Stewardess". Picture - something I'm not reviewing IMDb. However, the film is a few times - especially the first 10 minutes. But the script has undergone many changes, because most of the cinema is not violent in the movie or at the end of the film and certainly not sexy! <br /> <br /> All the tragedies are very confusing. For example, as a porn video, it's surprisingly small and it's incomprehensible why they put a 71-year-old man in love scenes. Sure, a 71-year-old Mr Livingstone looked pretty good - but he still was an old man and no one wanted to see him get with the young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes became too violent, Livingston became a Rambo-like figure! <br /> <br /> Overall, this tragedy is very small to recommend. It's not enough to be bad enough or care enough and the film manages to be even boring with such a silly title like "Naughty Stewards".
