If it's "Oh So Gorges," Natassia Mulhaye, this B-film is not a field of my TvO disc space! In what little rent, back in the warehouse's planned port port "Continuity People!" The basic principle of real cinematic making! One attorney space port at night and through the day (a night and day in a space station?) A warehouse! Please people! I will only praise the film, the wardrobe dip. Constantly exposing clothes that sturdy shape, keeping Natsassia! She had spent some time with the women who had seen this bombing to wear her everyday outfit! Science fiction channel spacebase is improved! There was some real humor in watching something very unbelievable. <br /> <br /> P. Michael Ironside, please hurry up your agent soon! You are very good for an actor and the film is also associated with this level.
