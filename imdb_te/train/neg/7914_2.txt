The film is a blockbuster film, which is really a reality. This is the type of image that the popcorn eat and see elegant graphics. In it's mind, this film is alongside ultra sleek iron man. Outside of popcorn munching action and special effects, the cliff drops slightly faster than the film Wile e Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, I have also included, but the film is not just a poor adaptation, but poor movie. For other reasons, the film is unsatisfactory. The producers are more focused on the eye than their minds. Long-awaited and promoted characters have been reduced to 4-scenes roles. Wolverine's main characters, Victor Creed (not known as Shabertot in the film) and Colonel Stricker have grown well. I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of LiveSchier. The rest are the remaining characters that lead to the path for the rest of the eye-candy. <br /> <br /> Wolverine's character was thoroughly developed after 30 minutes, even though Victor finally pulled off some of the pictures in the film. <br /> <br /> The twisted and perverse adaptation of the film "The Final Boss" in this movie is the original character and just gets what development he has to show the way. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are apparently thought to have made a bad grooved character that they are really supposed to do, whom they want to do and a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ...
