I tried to sit through this bomb a long time ago. A catastrophe .The act was very bad, it became flat as the main balloon. The reaction of actors due to this main character has not really ringed a modern reconstruction of Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat". I think Hitcock would be circular in its grave. There is no compelling film in the movie. It has some semi-big names but they do not have any attempts to make their characters. But you know, it's fine, no one is wrong. I mean, the script exploded in the first explosion. LOL.it is possible to end this thing will increase as it goes. But for me, I'm not ready to spend at least three days to find out. Unless you have at least three day weekend on the horizon, this stinker away 1/10
