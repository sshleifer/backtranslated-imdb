There is no plot and attention to this film. Yes, it's a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but screen-writers do not know anything about the film. There is no title along with this image. This is called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheers Never Win" or something like that. The characters did not develop and no one cares what's going on! The girl is the only person worth a roommate character (from that 70 show). She was happy and she stole every scene. Others are in their own college diplomas writing and they have a different career than acting.
