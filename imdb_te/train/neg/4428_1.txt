You lose 100 IQ points for just tuning. This presentation is awful, and I have denounced Tune from what I saw in commercials. But where did they turn this guy off? Also, what do they expect to do in the next season? The secret ended. Did everyone already setup? Are they going to see people living under a rock that's pretending to be next season? Where are they going to dig more stupid women? Look at what the big joke outside America is!
