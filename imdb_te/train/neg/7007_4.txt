This is a bad image. This plot is sentiment muted. I think product values ​​are OK, good photography, general direction and everything. Mark Hamill is terrible. I do not think much for him, and this film will ensure that understanding. Not surprisingly, he has no career in his career from his "Star Wars" films. He says "Bag-bye, Mark", and he drowns in a dark sense of nothing. On the other hand, a very young Anne Patts stole the show completely. She performed champs with a glamor, aesthetic and acting. When I saw her recently in "Texasville" and I saw her beauty. It was interesting to see her ten years earlier. However, if you are interested in Miss Potts, you will run away from the film to deliver to the hills.
