Well I like most people, give me a free ticket and I see a lot of things, now the multiplex cinemas are very good (I'm reminiscent of old "Fle Pitt" single screen films and I'm 40 years old). In England, the film was released as "Liar", a dog. This is good celluloid total waste. For photographer only 4/10 and set only.
