Somewhere I'd read this movie is considered comedy. After seeing it, I'll call anything. The point of this film is revealed to me. The conversation is all too relieved and absurd, many sets are the reasons behind, and all nudity and romantic sexual content, there is nothing romantic about this film ... I'm thinking about the heck about this thing! The title premise may be based on a fun (politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we treat cheap, unhealthy, incomplete sketches and deterioration and distortion. If I want, I'll buy the Grace Jones CD.
