I saw it a few days ago, so the details are hazy. The film was shot on hand-held cameras, much of which was made during the first release since it did not have much studio images. I did not help but audiences felt more of a gimmick than anything else designed to make us think that we are not all realms that come with any big budget looking at the screen, and more "true". <br /> <br /> The main problem I faced was their deeper, intimate equipment, blacks, and so on, but not all of them, Sensors of the world are tired, revealing things like bitter and paranoid psychoses. To put all of the conditions in which the greatest confrontation and tension at all times. Maybe it's deliberate to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, perhaps it may be lazy, or it just tries to appeal to a larger committee to a larger audience, I know, it's a pain to me. One novel is that a mix of volunteers and drafts (usually all characters are forced into the situation), but the scenes between the two main characters really make the player a player. It is the main pivot of the plot, voluntarily made for their nature and draft, as they acquire a function and self-value, but not all of it is forced and unforgettable. The other big bug I faced was to respond to every inevitable conflict with the first resistance and threats of violence, except for all soldiers (except for psychos and real softness), and when Farell's ubiquitous fascistism faced, I thought I needed to find a plus, It is strong and very important to take into consideration the characteristic nature of the characters Dayogyamaina load acting from the two leads, <br /> <br /> My uhalone, Boze brought JK duty of the Tutti, and for my money, it's much more fun to watch the 4 episodes.
