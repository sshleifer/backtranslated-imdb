Please! Do not waste money in this movie. It's not more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff that really does some high school kids. I do not close watching, and in general I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How will they find the distributor on earth? If funny, see Wikipedia for "Dark Area". Entry writer should completely avoid his mind. Perhaps he earned money from the producers. Money to spend on actors, camera and editing. It does not help because there is no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already gained a lot of attention. Please, the film's director, producer and writer, STOP are making movies like that ... you can not help yourself. The world is a good place without this film.
