In fact, the fact that someone in a bad script spent money was beyond me. This should be one of the worst movies, along with the "Haunted Highway" I've really seen. BAD actors, and a bad story. There is no general reaction to the incident, and although it is Halloween, ordinary people have large reactions, not strongly stated, people with tape do not breathe, they can not breathe (i can mix at least 50 in one room) and some With Satan pulling the dead from his home, a The age of 8 is also a difference between a toy and a person. This child does not like the reality of Satan's reality and the fact that no one is innocent or foolish in the day of Jesus. When I was 8 years old, I had more brains. <br /> <br /> But the stupid thing is that everyone seems to fall for Satan for this slogan. The question throughout the movie, is it really Satan, or is it killing some crazy person when he feels like it is? Well, he got human hands, hands, built and whatever, so I guess he is supposed to be in the film as well, otherwise they did a lousy job hidden. Then, this man is human and everyone, he is an elderly woman, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!) cops (I think all guns and training) and some other people. <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is the worst thing I've seen, and I do not recommend anyone who wastes 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to see this whole trash.
