Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have a cop materials which is his lifelong dream. But his fortunes changed when he crashed the car (too bad) and the physician was found. The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him. After this moment, he has unhealthy wild behaviors and is never one of the best police ever. By the time, he finds the changes and his animal instincts begin to take over his human side. At the same time, he finds a lovely girl and he tries to control himself and try to become a perfect gentleman who needs to behave with civilization. I'm not the big fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this was his first film I saw. However, I can easily tell him that he is the best person. (See Ally McBeil in his role, it is very fun) .Very good parts in his movie are combined with this goat. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to be less intelligent to the viewer. It's not too tight, but I think it's right to see this movie. But it is very sad to see very good movies in the box office. The Animal is not the worst movie I have ever seen but failed to get more than *.
