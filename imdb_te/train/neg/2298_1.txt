<br /> <br /> Some examples of Pop Robertson have referred to a "relatively good track record" on predictive expectations. In his widely reported commentary from the January 2 issue of the Christian Broadcasting Network's January 2 issue, "The Most Serious Terrorist Attacks" and "Mass Killing" in the United States during 2007's "second half", host Pat Robertson Praising the "relatively good track record" on earlier estimates. But Robertson's 2006 New Year's Estimates Review alleviates the claim. <br /> "President Bush is going to be strengthened." <br /> <br /> "The fall elections are incomplete, but the result of the war and the Republicans are responsible for the success of the economy." <br /> <br /> "The war in Iraq is going to be a success, we start withdrawing troops before the end of this year." <br /> <br /> In an Associated Press article on January 3, Robertson has a history of making predictable expectations: <br /> <br /> In January 2004, Bradcaster's president Bush was easily seen winning. Repeat elections. Bush won 51% of the vote, defeating Democrat Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson estimated that Robertson would succeed after his second term in office. All the proposals for social security reform will be accepted again, he said. <br /> He says he's talking directly to God ... if so, he's ridiculous to watch the song.
