What is Franco Jaffrelli thinking? Can I complain that Hollywood has taken responsibility for this mockery or is it that I have lost the Charlotte Bronte's classic position to someone who did not speak English in the first language? I do not think I can improve the comment I read below, so I'll paraphrise: "Jane Eyre is a great book, a screen writer for a short time." It is true that the film's two leads sin is miscast. But cast the cast, because the screen scenario best left all the scenes. Dialogue minds that you understand Jane and Rochester is a meeting and fun sharing ... removed from the script. Marriage proposal, good luck ... gone. <br /> <br /> Jane's secrets to protect Rochester from Old England England were half-ridiculous and half-ridiculous ... <br /> <br /> The ending of the novel with reverse family and Jane's interactions with Jaipyrely need to rewrite completely . <br /> <br /> Do not be sorry that he has been surgically removed from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
