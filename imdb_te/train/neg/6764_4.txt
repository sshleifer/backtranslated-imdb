<br /> <br /> It is the exceptional Oliver Stone film, but I have read the drugs during the filming, I do not need more explanation. 'Natural birth killers' are dangerous, insane, most of all we do not take; Strange, mental, and artistic imagery. <br /> 'Natural Landscape Killers' is a great scene that questions some of the teenagers about Mickey and Malory, and how the media is popular for two mass killers. If I'm a mass murderer, I'll become Mickey and Mallory. " <br /> <br /> Mickey recounts that Oliver Stone movies are a lot of errors. "Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" America, the country the country loves and admires. Natural Nature Killers estimate how massive media, technology and ethnic assassins are and how obscene to Americans (and most of the world) in extreme circumstances. Killers were killed by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliet Lewis (Mallory), surprising the two wonderful actors, who are going into the lives of two interesting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some killings are valuable, perhaps in the brutal doctrine of social Darwinism (Mysterious of the Fittest) - in his interview in Mickey's prison, saying that other races are murdered, we are destroying humans and other species; The script is interesting, but the film is not so serious about the blood climbing we have seen, but the question of society and human behavior. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film is done in maximum security jails; We see the hard facts of prison life; Warden's attitudes and filling up jails - perhaps Stone's future is a question that leads to society. <br /> Two other interesting characters; The first is a reporter who performs on 'America's Maniacs' and was engaged in raising ratings of what length he was going to capture Mickey and Mallory's story. The other is the police officer Skagneti, a madman, perhaps a brutal officer in love with Maliori - who had some unnatural attacks with mass murderers as his mother was killed during a massacre at Waco, Texas, by Charles Whitman. <br /> Cinematography is great. Different colors, shadows, and styles have created an unstable feeling; <br /> The camera work is mad; <br /> The camera work is mad; Stirring, buzzy, takes some decision to use it and accept it. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Bourne Killers' does not glamor the presence of frank murderers, which questions and how we fuel this feature ... <br /> <p> This review is very positive, but I do not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not happy with the screenplay and asked to remove his name. Why can i see it <br /> <br /> Sometimes the natural nature of the killers is cumbersome in the film. <br /> <br />
