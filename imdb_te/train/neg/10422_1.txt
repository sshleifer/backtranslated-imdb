At first, I was not afraid of anything ... anything except my few fears, but this film is absolutely horrific. It is not suitable for children! My mouth opened up the whole time that made me wonder. It's gear for a kid's picture, bunnies are murderous! It's unnecessary to be scary and G is rated. I recommend that you stay over 8. But do not get me wrong, it's a good movie if I do not have a mental scarcity as a child. I can not believe that I can allow a parent, let's see a 4 year old kid. It's just a serious and complicated, not to forget the young children, Gory. I'm worse 4 and I'm surprised by the violence. I do not recommend it
