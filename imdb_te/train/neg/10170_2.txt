Championship game is just a few days away, but things in New Orleans they should not be. Life on the virus comes to life on the player who has problems with the problem of gambling problems from the players with drug problems, living in a momentary and exciting time. Can things be reversed and a killer can be stopped before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> When you first read about the Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is not more than a plot and thought. Instead, the lousy soap opera-Ishao designed for TV movies in Super Dome Hollywood has one of the 70s and it will never be. The cast is slipping through it, no one is really beautiful. The best (or worst) example is that Van Johnson is in a very small role because he loses about why he's usually. The plot is dull, unhealthy, and unbelievable. Donna Mills hit "Man"? Yes true! It is believable about her drinking alcohol and dealing with David Jansen. There is no pace in this movie. Any flow of super dams is trying to get four or five stories into film zaps. Without any drama or suspense in view, it is a poor example of a TV movie made by Super Doom 70. The lone highlight for me was Charlie Jones's voice-over from the end - a sportsman I was touching. <br /> <br /> As many as I have seen in the Super Dome, I have been polite to the Mystery Science Theater 3000. This may be one of KTMA Public Access Episodes, but it is one of the best examples early on. But if I've only rated a superstar 2/10, I'll give this episode 3/5 in generosity in my MST3K rating.
