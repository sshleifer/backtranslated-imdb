Nobody really ruin the locals - from exploitation, yes, but from the most abusive treatment. <br /> <br /> The tourists are suffering. (Which is prohibited with a prohibited supermodel suppressed supermodel) token old-soul / mouthpiece blasphemy-small-girl-Eric-a-shine-the-heroes you see often in the 70's Europe), but most of the violent deaths - The next door neighbor, you mind. Get a couple killed in being actually heroic - none of them complement the sidekick role. <br /> <br /> Around thirty tourists are thrown by dirty tourists, perhaps unexpectedly attacking you over five minutes. <br /> <br /> The locals are determined not to wipe the surviving Westerns and practically "Hey, you're not so bad, you're sorry last night."

Barbara Bach. Did you know that you were initially interested in the film? I thought so.
