I grew up with a Baptist and tried to tell the story of this film, I can not believe the story anymore. I will give the film a great way to be good at the average lifetime of Week. A little bit interesting, average acting, a bit slower, the script is speculative, the music is sappy, and it's a bit dramatic. And all the remaining people are always good and clean Christians. None of them is a single curse. But the actor, who played the United Nations, described Bush as "New-Que-Lear" as "nuclear". Since Bush says that he is also called by God, are all the honorary memories of those Christians? LOL! I really had time to take the film seriously after that and make it difficult. After the "New-Q-Lear" incident, the film will feel like a packed, manipulative campaign. I'm looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something I might think of, but I found it here. If you are looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill the rainy afternoon. If you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
