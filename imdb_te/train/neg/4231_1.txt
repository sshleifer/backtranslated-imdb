I found it in a bargain bin and I felt it committed to see it all the way through this movie because I bought it on my own, but I had so many times to turn it off and writing off the money I paid. If you're a fan of gore and brutality, this film is okay. If the producers of this film are familiar with it, it's a sickening effect on the creative use of fake blood and body parts. <br /> <br /> The film is depicted in the home camera with video credentials and horrific actors. It has been translated from German, but allowing for that too, the sound is awful. Beyond the special effects, the film gets a budget as the budget gets. If they spend quite a bit of actors and blood and guts instead of a real script, the film might be a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about an army of tin-masked salads about three men who live in an island. They were captured, and the rest of the film was about to escape. <br /> <br /> I would call this story the most unfortunate because it really was combined with the obscenity-filled dialog in the series of torture and fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> There is no redemption of this film, like mindless gore. Warn you.
