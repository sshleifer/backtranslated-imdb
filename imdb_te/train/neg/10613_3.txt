Dancing is probably the only thing to watch about the film - and even frustrating in comparison to some other films. <br /> At me, this is the worst kind of film - one that feels like it's the work of art, because it has all the pictures in the picture. Yes, it's pretty picky, but ultimately dancing is not deep and tension. Tango is a tease, it's hot, it's drama, it's adventurous - obviously not this movie.
