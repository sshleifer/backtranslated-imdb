There is a great film about Steve Biko. Sadly this is not. Denzel Washington - has never been so smooth for actors - the greatest attraction of the biko is not entirely clear. Attenborough's large group of scenes are ridiculous. The Sovetto massacre is not like this, three well-groomed children (some cartwheels!) Are happy marching to soldiers' guns. The film is buried deep in the film. If the fight against apartheid is anything but it is the fight of black people, somehow we are white and run to his family. I'm undoubtedly Donald Woods is a good person, but when he was not, Bicco said it was important. Penelope Wilton's accent is a pure Hampshire and she is not fully aware of herself in South Africa. At all. Wood's family dog ​​gets more scratches than black maid. A big, full movie about a dozen black people - I saw family music sound their sound - it sounds like "a musical sound." <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film with a good intent if it is somewhat useless white on a good black fight. There really needs South African liberals who are well thought out, so there is a hole on the head.
