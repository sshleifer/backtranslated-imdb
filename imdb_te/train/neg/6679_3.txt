<br /> <br /> In the film, Manoj Aggarwal is his father, mother, grandfather and sister in 8-9 characters, but he is in disguise. Detective loses his photos at the airport when he's flirting with the scene <br /> <br /> When he's disguised, Tracking changes and a sound-proof Lal and then dive into the TV. <br /> <br /> The rest of the image has the same errors and ends in a predictable note. There are African and many other scenes like Govinda. <br /> <br /> Manoj Aggarwal is directing. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Govinda has proven again among the actors. He has all the characters and characters so well whereas he is such characters but very hype 6-7 characters actually look like the fat does not fit in the queen movie, the teams are well Govinda thatz It is nothing that she is great and the rest of the roles is Stamina Pandey Johnny Liver is very funny and very funny in 1 character and Tinu Anand loses Satish Kaushik's delight, Paresh Okay Tanaz Okay
