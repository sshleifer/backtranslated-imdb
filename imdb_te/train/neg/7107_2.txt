I'm sure MST3K's fun-made movies are some sort of IMDB cult. After reading dozens of commentaries on how little they were after seeing both as "verlar", I believe some people are here. People who hate people say "are scared only by gore", "do not know good horror" or stuff like that. Well, I do not really care for the gore, but I want something to happen in a movie! That's where a lot of wife is sitting and around! Or walking around the house / garden! There's a need to give it a picture of atmosphoere, walks and stares of someone you could just get by having meaning. Oh, and "will you think"? Yes, I'm thinking "Move! @ @ $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror films I've ever scene! <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm a big fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of thing.
