The movie is very slow. There are some nice pictures but it actually does not surpass the fact that the film is boring. You see a watermelon and a sexual contact with a little more watermelon and a sexual intercourse. It is also interesting to sound someone interesting but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is not fun. Even if you are laughing at times, it is not really enough and it is disappointing and can be more refusing than fun. Some film tries to place video clips in the film to disturb Boredom Director. They are probably really colorful clips from the 50s but are definitely hard to say and they are really sad so trying hard funny. Many times you have a feeling that the plot will evolve into something, created a powerful scene but in the end it will evaporate something and that's it. In addition to clips, no dialogues are in the music. The director is trying to be genuinely and artfully with all the costs. Personally I can not recommend the movie. I believe that the art should not be boring. During the projection, the whole film was rounded up, which confirmed my short review.
