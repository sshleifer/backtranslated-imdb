I read it and maybe laugh if I accidentally crossed this script in the alphabet. I'm laughing at the director who wants me to laugh. I'm not fully aware of where I am. If I do not care if this Woody Allen, this author does not write a dialogue or at least listen to him, throwing the clowns even harder and can not write performances from casting star cast. For example: <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking to get a job at an art gallery." <br /> <br /> It is true that it is true, but honestly, what about art historians? How do you answer <br /> <br /> "This is a respectable character from the writer, and I know that I do not have any understanding of Allen's work and I do not like to learn it." Are the characters untouched without exception, trying to show that we are suffering from all human condition, or are you really poor writing?
