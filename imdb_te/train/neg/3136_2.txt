There is a clear hype of the film. Let's look at the main reasons that nobody can see Leo and Kate in the film. I'm not saying that I'm not good actors, I'm stunk in this film. Special effects are good (and I would say film producers make a good vessel visible to the eye), but there are also several major flaws in IT. For example, before going to the ship, you can see an incomplete blue screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I love the REAL Titanic story, but the film is an insult to the story. Editing is outrageous - there is no reason for 2 1/2 hours (except for a biography of MAYBE), and the writing and screenplay was stilted awfully. <br /> <br /> Music is probably better than I expected (and not only "My Heart Will Go On"). I have a scene when the ship is sinking and the bass is heard. This may well be the highlight of the image. For mood throughout, it's pretty dull. <br /> <br /> In a nut shell, I changed the beautiful story of Titanic into an over, hype chic flick.
