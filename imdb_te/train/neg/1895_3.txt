The spectacular and spectacular film to see the Master of Flight Guillotine of 1975. This is not because the film has inspired specifically in the fight or has no feelings. It's a camp classic because the image is so over-crazy that it's so bad - it's bad, but happy bad. The film paints a blind man with a frisbee-instrument on a chain that chops the heads of people like throws at his enemies! Who cares that physics is inaccessible or that the film has 12 feet long paper-long arms or silly subjects known as Guy Blind? <br /> <br /> For this film, I have been very interested to see fatal flying gilities - one of my favorite "bad" films (1977), though it is not a sequel, but taking a little bit of ideas and ideas from the original The film does not neglect to make the movie as coherent or visible. Sure, it's crazy fun, but it's not close to the Master of the Gilette flying in the entertainment value. As with the original image, there are these weird flying devices that divide the heads, but they are very different - with circular blades and with almost a mind of their own. There is also no blind guy, but there are some really bad ones who are not really depth or understand the audience in this English-dubbed version because the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, at the same time, some martial arts action is great. Not far from the high standards of Bruce Lee or Sony Chiba movies, this action is far better despite the ridiculous and often confusing plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a ridiculous movie because many of its many, many, many shortcomings like the martial arts fans liked), but it is also one that others may stop or laugh at instead instead of enjoying off the action. But most importantly, it does not come close to being funny or watchful of the funny guitotine master. Very bad.
