<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, Relieved, Olly walks on a 'restful' boat tour, but he and Stan combine to escape the escape thief (Richard Kramer). <br /> <br /> This feature is a lengthy comedy - ok entry, which, as a form of Laurel and Hardy's best work, has recognized the final collaboration between Lal H and producer Hal Roaches. The end of a memorable marine journey after capturing the episode by the episodic, film memorable Kramer (who is a seagull to prove how tough he is!). Gordon Douglas's appointment as an actress who had previously been responsible for Olly's first solo attempt in the solo era (produced by ZENOBIA 1939) was probably gagged, but not motivated, but its work is not a measure of pzazz here. Fair, but nothing special. L & H Regular Charlie Hall and James Finlayson perform guest roles.
