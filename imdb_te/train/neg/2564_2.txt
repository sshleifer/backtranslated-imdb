When I went to watch movies, I'd stand or I'd slept, but I was sleepy, but it's pure worse, in fact I got up and walked out! Together I hate it. Also, they should not have taken Brendon Frasier off, he is much better. I really liked Jorge of Jungle 1, and that's not as good as the first one when the graphics, for example, the bird, and crash in a tree, is not as good as I expected. I hope to take care of this director, and the next movies he made, he needs to rethink ... terrible! I really worked well for Ursala, because she made the movie worthy (as long as I go out) ... In total I have 2
