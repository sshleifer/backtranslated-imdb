When the film was created, director Mary Harron intended to explain the career progress of Betty Page, from early modeling days to Senate Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency and her religious resurrection to go home in the 50s and to get her all the facts, She can take any time to explain something in depth. <br /> <br /> I think that you have talks about people in the pace career, discussions about her causes, decisions, life events and personal suffering, but Harron does not make any personal search of the character's personal exploration. In the first fifteen minutes or in the film there are small references to child abuse, domestic violence and gang rape. Haroron and Guineau Turner (co-writer) thought you wanted to do any glass that was not attractive and attractive. I'm going to figure out who is behind the posters, but the list of all the things you have given is some of her famous photo shoots and remakes. <br /> <br /> You're really disappointed as you look at all the movies, and are looking forward to disclosing some additional layers. How did she introduce her religion to her religion? From this young Tennessee girl modeling has changed slavery into photography. <br /> <br /> It shows that the film goes to another modeling agency and puts it on what she says, but it certainly has some shock and discussions, all 50s after. <br /> When Harron tried to make a point about how rare it was from today's scales (the page never took photos of explicit sexual acts) and some reaction was really mesmerizing and this was a mock in the eyes of others, even though it was true. Today we should not look and care about children, but we have some idea about how surprising it is for a contemporary audience. This feminine central part of the Senate hearing in the Juvenile Delinquency, but no one really was really stunned. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm thinking of how I would like to subscribe to this film. Harron and Turner could not escape anything that the viewer was unwilling to do. They could see Miss Page's two lifelong fans and have been disappointed to make sure nothing is absolutely nothing and that they can put a bad light on their heroine, so none of the in-depth research of who she really is. (There are reports of violent nature and psychological problems before and after her career) and the rest is a string of events made by her career, without any material behind it.
