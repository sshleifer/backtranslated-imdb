I've seen "Jimcata" in a theater way of 85, and I can not remember any of the plot except for Kurt Thomas's vague films, and eventually I'm fighting in the backdrop of the stone walls and frustration. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I once again opted to copy the newly released DVD to enter the world of ZimCÃ t. <br /> One of the films that came at this time is the video that goes live today 80. Jonathan Cabot, the filmmaker Jimnest Kurt Thomas appointed Blue from entering the country of "Parmicast" and won "The Game", a sponsored by Khan Suicide Bledport promotes his people, "Yak Power." The goal of the mission is in the Star Wars protection system. Jonathan Princess is trained at Ruby Martial Arts, who has never spoken or left home. Once trained tries to combine with locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. <br /> <br /> Cabot does not have to say he struggles for his life along the streets of Parmestan, fighting for the game, destiny, and on the way to the game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas director Robert Claies, who never looks set on it. The script is ineffective on this side. See other reviews for many houlers. The town of Crazies has some good moments, but ultimately bad editing is bad. End ... me. Still here is a germ of action adventure. Hong Kong version may also be better with more visceral action and speedy speed.
