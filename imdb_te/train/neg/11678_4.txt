I was an unsatisfactory, incredible heist film. With an A-list cast, a veteran Maverick director, particularly three Leeds and Spike Lee, was expected to have a lot of imagination and at the end felt that the film was added to sub-generation. Initially, the dramatic Clive Owen's career rarely repeats itself with a diagnosis, repeats unnecessarily, and then finding the story with chaos and not showing untold eyewitness interviews, then began to appear in the scenes that you see. Camera shots with a handful of camera shots are continually shifting the camera work of course, but director Lee has failed to provide thrills or suspense, the film's main protagonists are falling primarily without doing anything. Dinjal Washington thirty five years ago in the "Night of the Night" with her "hot" William Defoe (in a bit-part) with clothes for the "shaft" and the bad-donid jivev debate ("No one knows him") Some of his lightweight "Night of Heat" discourages her with a muddy and inappropriate "dirty-toe"). Clive Owens plays his character with the English voice, believing that the gang is believed to be a Arab-based hero, and his 90% playing on his face. Jody Foster offers another of her patented tight lipped, snow maiden, sub-clurling starling, turns into a well-connected financial bounty-hunter, you have little influence. Overall, with a light but clear twist at the end, a movie's true mish-mash, actually starting the title, gives away spoiler fans. The worst scene (many) undoubtedly the Washington-based witness-face-to-face and unbelievable, with an 8-year-old street-kid, conversations with Owen's two children in the pre-emptive race. Jokes in the film are characters for classic hasht films like "Serpio" and "Dog Day Afternoon" - but do not respect self praise. Instead of "the hot rock" ... and some good luck.
