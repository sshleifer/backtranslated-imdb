<br /> <br /> Many days after Ada's convincing, I'm afraid that people will spend a lot of time doing such a horror film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> As a science fiction film, it is undoubtedly a fierce failure. Somehow, the main character takes the past of life and manages to interact with it on her personal computer - Timothy Leary's advice and inspiring words. <br /> <br /> As a drama film, it is undoubtedly a fierce failure. However, the writer / director eighty-five minutes is not necessarily nothing but a continuous, unnecessary, unpleasant and frivolous play. <br /> <br /> I suspect that all the plays in the film act like an irritating one. <br /> <br /> I am completely criticizing my degree of imagination. I banned me from leaving the theater in situations I had seen, but I do not question whether I was missing. I'm still angry and took time to see it. I have criticized this film more effectively, and I'm more inspiring.
