This review will surprise me. The plot is a mess. The letters are wooden. Michael Bowen spies other characters, and all of them misinterprets. No one has any rifting quality or point-of-interest. This is not an awkward task. This is not predictable. It is not contradictory. It's not clever. There's nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That's certainly not a theatrical release. "This network" will stream that platform. I definitely recommend switching to a good information on PBS or Garden Smart Show if faced with this mess on night television. If you face the daytime television, it will take a long walk. Even if you're in fog, you're not bothered by this trash. Life is small. This image is too long.
