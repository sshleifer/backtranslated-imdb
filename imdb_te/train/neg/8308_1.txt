Over the past few years, entertainment has fallen to the Tonight Hill, but last night (August 17, 2006) they reached a new level. <br /> Try to hype their broadcast, post the original photos of JonBenet Ramsay's body in their teasers last night they decided ... "Pictures in the context you have never seen before". Both photos are graphic and are very disturbing. She was on the side of her face and head / neck and the cord used to shout her around her neck was clearly visible and hurt on her face. It's terrible terrible, I can not believe it. How about any remote controversy regarding Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing !! They reduced the level of their respect and values ​​to a new level ... and it shows. It was used as a premiere program to see ... now it's even worse. <br /> <br /> From now on, I see access Hollywood.
