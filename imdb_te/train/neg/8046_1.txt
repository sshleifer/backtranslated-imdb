No? Did not think so! Well, in that case all you have to do is stay away, it's just "Reward No Know No Secret", which is just umpteenth nonsense- "scream" slasher is definitely not with any redemption value. The plot is very ridiculous; The characters are insufferably dumb, the gore-factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring! You can already get from the title, this film is basically a similar arrangement and the killer's motivations are equally stupid, "I still inspend what you did last summer". Whatever the mystery for me anyway, why would anyone want to steal ideas from junk like "junk"? At least the film depends on the precious rock of Jennifer Love Hewitt, but the girls in this junk are not terrible and unattractive. A year after her boyfriend Beth Morgan, her new annoying lover and four other general psychology college students still went to Florida to spend their Spring Break Holiday on a fancy beach home. The killer did not make a move for the entire year, but now he follows Florida's pose and leaves the business card behind the Tattoo Message. There is no need for a horror expert to understand the hidden face behind the mask that you are not really afraid of and the authors' attempts to put it on the wrong track. As the plot is too narrow, most part is entirely absurd padding, including the subtle plot for the incomprehensible Floridian Police Force and the 'mysterious' FBI inspector who has a personal score for relief. These killings will take place sooner (do you hate it when it happens?), There is not any inappropriate T & A to enjoy and you can not get the quality of dialogues much better. Only by the worst like this you will realize that you are going for the happiest soul of the slashers of the 80s going for good.
