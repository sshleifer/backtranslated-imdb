OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, the rest of the peace. You love most fans. Now ... this film is not a movie. It is directed by "The Crocodile Hunter" TV programming between bad acting, bad scripts, and steve among animals. He is an animal angry / entertainer. Millions will lose him. But the whole movie idea is a big mistake. The plot is extinct, it almost does not exist. The cast is terrible. Acting primary school level actors are not even valuable. You must clear this direction. If you do not get a half-way better performance from your actors, even if the script is bad, you should not be good at first. I wrote a good script. I have never seen this movie. In fact, I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50, $ 1.50 for my son), which is a friend to inspect instead of watching Scooby Doo live action. My son, who did not have such a discriminatory movie, but he never asked me to see him again. If you want Steve Irwin's fanatical memories, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this film like a plague. If I'm Steve, I know that I do not need to be remembered for this film. Respect him: Avoid this movie!
