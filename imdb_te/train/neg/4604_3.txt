I have to push back to watch this movie because it's really painful. Who does not prove to be an efficient artist? I am full of absurdity, if I mention all of them, I will give the film. Norman Pietersen aka George Wend really should be a stable that has agreed to make this film. This act is tedious and the story is even worse. I was not honored and rational, I did not understand where the author came from or where he was. Every major character has a puzzled opacity, a string of unimaginable and ridiculous events, then the movie is over. The conversation does not make a disgraceful picture of the other, but only a tactical train.
