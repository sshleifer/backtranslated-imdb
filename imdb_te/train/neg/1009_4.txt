*** Review includes some spoilers *** I'll make this review small and sweet. I'm interested and have some top actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman because I bought this movie from the best purchase. How bad is this? Well, this is very bad. Justin Timberlake portrayed Pollock, a journalist delaying a case leading to corruption cops at Edison's Police Force. LL Cool J Deid, F.R.A.T. The so-called special team team is a police team. (First Response Assault Tactics). He teamed up with an "on-the-edge" bad cape named Lazarov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening sequence we see Lazarus & Deed some bank robbers, but tonight they are separating couples from drugs. I do not give too much away, but things turn bad for boys doing drugs. Pollock, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to trial, including Deeds & Lazarev. He suspects the foul play and the help of Ashford, and some investigations become ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) F.R.A.T. <br /> You can say that Freeman and Spacey's performance is pretty lax. Dylan McDermott is the only person to give the whole performance. He is a full nut in this film and I believe in him. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says each line is the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. He is very good at films such as Deep Blue Sea & Any Givan Sunday. The film starts with some good actions, but then the rest of the film will move. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this image. I put it on ebay this weekend.
