For my life I can not understand good reviews of this piece of garbage. This does not mean. Matthew Modine is a terrible miscast like a celebrity ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others said it, but why do I reiterate, why is stupid accent? Absolutely unnecessary. And her performance is just bad. I do not know what her voice was, or what threw it. There is no chemistry between these two. <br /> And the girl Modine suddenly fell in love with her head shaved head half shark and acting in a goofy way? Where did it come from? We wanted to forgive her because she started to crack her marriage with her work, but apparently, I did not care about these people.
