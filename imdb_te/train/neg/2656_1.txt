<br /> <br /> As a fan of Diane Keaton in general, I tried to see tonight. The second time I had to change it because I had no sympathy for my daughter or my mother. Both have been less self-absorbed and others, including disrespect, disrespectfully and negligently adding to the combination. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we should not see her." Keaton has done a good job of moving her into a state of surprise and passion, but it has gone too far for me. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want to take care of the leader, I need to care about the characters in advance - if it is in the hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> The cast was honest and well played - I felt them! * - And Gay Best Friend is wonderful, but combined, it's not enough for me to take a movie.
