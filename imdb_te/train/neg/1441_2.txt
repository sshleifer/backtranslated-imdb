I chose this movie on a cover alone, thinking that I was for an adventure to the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I went to a virtual palace. I do not like any seven-seven that I had before. The film is too big, I can not find any quality in this movie. The cover illustrates amazing special effects. There is no one. The film is very light and simple mockery is also scary. It provides the idea that you can solve problems with violence. It's good if you want to teach your children. I do not. Stay away from it. If you're looking for family entertainment, it's a bit more exciting.
