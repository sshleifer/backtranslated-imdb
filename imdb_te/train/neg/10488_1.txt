Elvis left the palace and he was fortunately unable to see this unfortunate stinker. The scene director Joel Zwick later finds ways to make the scripts less fun. The film is entertaining, filled with fun deaths, smooth gay characters and hacks. This makes it clear that Kim Basinger will follow Doom's Day as premature retirement. Let us remind her that she is (expert) and she is not. David Leezer, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are wasted here. Zwick finds a way to reduce their talent at every turn. Elvis Play Guy is more like Gomer than King. Casting a small girl playing Bessinger's role is only good. She really looks like her and actually looks good. Tom Hanks needs to look for Cameo. The comic film is not all that funny, but at least its painful. There is no wonder if Zwick is portraying something of Hanks or something that would make him this film.
