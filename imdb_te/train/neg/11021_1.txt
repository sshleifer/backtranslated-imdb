<br /> <br /> Hemi Foy tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and later experienced some sort of opepus complex. <br /> It's about 95 minutes long, but it's fine in ten. <br /> <br /> There was an hour where he was practicing on the roofs and eating habits in the church tower (such as Quasimodo) (he had little sympathy). <br /> There is a strange love story there is nothing to do with anything. She looks like her mother, yes, what? We know that he misses his mother, it's about the first ten minutes. They should just start and finish together and this is an O.K. Short film. Now it's a portrait of a changeable character. He is a man who happens to be the subject. <br /> <br /> This whole oyster need to analyze his character. He dressed in his face and women's costume and wears a dead badger on his head. A badger! You got to see the end! He returned to his home with a badger on his head (and it was initially portrayed as a paltry horror film to kill his father's wife who initially had sex). And some felt they were not enough entertaining enough to put some indie punk music in this background. Although I have to admit, I'm allergic to the images that I want to write moody on your nose. This MacKenzie seems to be trying to show us that he / she is studying psychology at school as a director / guy. You are very clever! Thanks for bringing back our memories of these forgotten principles! You really dug! What a wolf! Okay now I relied on some random book on this film, but anyway .. <br /> It's boring. A lot of spoken heads. Plus the colors changed from the scene to the scenery from the scene, you know cool and warm .. why? Perhaps "Hallam Fo" is a feature and a test film for color blind people. <br /> <br /> "Indie-how-how-how-how-are beautiful drawings they were performing on the show. And all of the "beautiful" sex stuff that's going to be an independent clich√© but I would recommend that I've laughed more than a few times, even though it really is a movie student and really looking to see how such a trash is through the machine.
