After very bad memories, I took to skip this episode every time I showed in Season 2 Sequence. Recently I saw again when I remembered again. <br /> <br /> I always thought this was a deadly ST: TNG episode (except "shades of gray"), which is rarely counted as episode). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " There's no question of who's who's controversy, about Guinan's description of how funny a daring joke (which is not), a lovely, dangerous rogue Okona, the announcement of DeWena Troy, and everyone's steady elbowing reminders where highlighted and triple- Plot point that does not underline, it does not have any unbelievable moment. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a lovely actor in other situations, is the puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the plot's plot. On the other hand, a small role of John Baronman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") was not allotted to the character's journalist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the day, you can think of this as a pretty little loyalty to a less original series episode.My, I'm "Square Time" or "Who's Q"
