[*** Possible spoiler ***] The image's reputation is advance, so I sit down and expect it to see in the letterbox on the TCM. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent and product values ​​are first-rate, but the characters are not deep, the plot is narrow, and the whole thing takes a long time. For an image dealing with alcoholism, family divisions, unfaithfulness, gambling and sexual oppression, the film is interestingly flat, proxy, lifeless, and cliché-ridden. An example is described as a lack of faith in Frank Hirsch: his wife's heavy strength is to "go upstairs and relax a bit", leading to a predictable request for her headache - further assuming - with her secretary ("Hey Nancy, I've Got Blues Tonight, Go for a drive "), according to all the well-dressed formula. We do not think this is real people, but cardboard cutouts acting as a puppet play. In addition, the origin of a clear clash between Frank and Dave Hirsch is not really explored or explained. Dave's desire to be repeated again and again with Gwen is her absence of inaccuracy or out of the pot. Shirley MacLaine / Gunny's disappointing role is that his next marriage is from the moment the director provided the director, however, has clearly failed and evident - meetings of this type of soap opera will be solved only by killing anyone. The moment when the jealous lover ran with a gun I daved or jinny - who killed me? The whole thing is fraudulent with the capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> There are innovations of MacLine's performance and Dean Martin. But overall I can see the film's interest in the entire history of Hollywood history.
