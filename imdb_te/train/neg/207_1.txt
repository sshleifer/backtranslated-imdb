The film is a ramons concert in 90 minutes, which is a little stupid and full of frustration. <br /> <br /> If you are a big rumen fan, do not waste your time in the way I do not. This is completely unwatchable from start to finish. This film is called Ramon Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There are no plots found in this image. Until teen comedies go, you're scrapping this barrel.
