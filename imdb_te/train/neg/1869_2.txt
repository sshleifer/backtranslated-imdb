Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei clearly has this romantic thriller that reflects the 8MM of Joel Schumacher. <br /> <br /> When she kidnaps her daughter, a mother enters into a dark world of underground pornography, because live actor films are internationally owned by the kidnappers, especially when clients are good. The search for her daughter, not only in Europe, but also in adultery. She sleeps with some boys to get her credentials. <br /> <br /> When she is linked with a company caught by memorable Dr. Hades, she is under great danger. <br /> <br /> When it started the promise, it is not good to say this. The problem is that the film is not too sleazy or clear as the film can expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (originally released in Russia!) Is not enough Gary or contains nudity and sexuality to keep the audience's attention. The plot is not exclusive, except for surprisingly many different locations throughout Europe. The end is very disappointing. This act is not exceptional, except for Anita Aur, who plays Dr. Hades: she is very creepy. <br /> <br /> In all, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to the collectors of Bruno Matte. But it's nice to see the man behind the dominance: this is his first thriller from GLI OCCHI DENTRO in 1994's Giovanni.
