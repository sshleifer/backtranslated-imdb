I saw 7.5 IMDb ratings in this movie and decided to take this roster to rent my roommate based on it. She said she had seen her before. "It was funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," she caught her. Compared with other Bollywood films, this film is expected to be 10 to 7.5, but compared to all other films I have seen during my lifetime, this is no more than a 3. Not good for me. Characters are reliable, the law is not realistic and how their motives are committed. It is dramatic and the songs are not so great. My biggest problem with Bollywood films is lack of sensitivity. All emotions are way too much and therefore not at all realistic. Any emotion or bond between the characters that are at least bit of a bit should be developed with unnecessary song. I understand that the relationship between father and son is more than one friend between a parent and a child without having to notify it by a five minute long song. Stupid humorous relaxation with a laugh track is not entirely funny or in necessity (we'll get it, not a sharp tool in Laxman's shed). <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** If someone usually has a terminal stage lung cancer, it seems that their son's son is wrong without telling something. Many plot holes to count. The film was very entertaining for the first time, and Bollywood movies are unwilling to like it but it is very bad. It is very fun to do with the amusing and heartfelt film and it's best to do it better, in the first half of the film all the amusing episodes and finally all the heartfelt episodes. <br /> **************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************* I spent a lot of time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the fun parts I had. I do not kill a single tear or I feel like that, I'm drowned with an embarrassing feeling when trying to dramatically end. If you want to see something better, I do not recommend this movie, but I would recommend if you want to see a sad Bollywood movie.
