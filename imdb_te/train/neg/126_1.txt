"I'm Curious: Yellow" is a dangerous and serious steam pile. This is a political perspective but the film is not taken at any level seriously. This is not true if the previous male nudity is an automatic NC-17. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they offer only a few sneak peeks, but where are the R-rated movies that have been enjoyed with Valvas and Leppia? Somewhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for bad cable shows: swinging in sleeves breeze but in the view of the clitoris. And we do not have a trace of pink that appears in those pretentious indie movies like Vincent Gollo's Brown Bunny, who is being treated for throbbing Johnson's site, but Chloe Sevigny. Before the so-called "double-standard" in nudity, a must have an essentially anatomical difference between mentally thick men and women: for a man who does not appear when actresses are naked, and can not say the same. In fact, you can not see any male genitalia in an American movie that is usually romantic or explicit porn. This double double standard is lower than the intentionally depressing ability to say culturally in the bodies of double standard women.
