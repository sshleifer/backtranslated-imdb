This film does not have an awful lot to do with the predecessor "Robot Jokes". This is not an alternate name for robot Wars "Robot Wars" and "Robot Jokes 2: Robot Wars". It's a robotic sphere of giant robots struggling with each other in the near future "robot jokes". This concept has been abandoned for this concept and has a completely cryptic story that is not entirely original or deliberate. It's a shame that really is quite different from its predecessor, and maybe it's probably more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Like the "Robot Jokes", this is a big difference in the B-film that it is not very good. Perhaps it is the fact that even though the "Robot Jokes" was released in 1980, the B-movies still got the charm and the '80's of the time when the class had a specific bit. Tell us about this movie. It's just lame, badly made, looking poor and not exciting enough. It's also 'this is it?' <br /> <br /> The lack of its story is that the good storyline is really clear. <br /> Maybe a good mainstream villain was a good idea, some good idea, and a few other things for some of the main characters, <br /> They are for this film with actors. They do not like their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul suffers as the main character, giving him a gift to a woman and Mr. Perfeker who can compete with anyone. <br /> <br /> For the future film, with the notion of the big battle droids in it, the film is not necessarily in action. If they made a few more and more actions in the film, the film was at least fun. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
