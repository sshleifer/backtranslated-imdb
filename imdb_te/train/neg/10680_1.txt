<br /> This is one of the worst films ever made - it's very simple. There is not a redemption quality about this film. The first 10 minutes are very tricky - they believe that you are actually surprised and believe that you are on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will be punching up for 83 minutes without seeing any stolen and smashed scenes without any organization. The lake is ludicrous, it looks like an aquarium and the lake bed has the same plant in different areas. The characters exhibit their modern teleportation powers, for example Alex Thomas falls (drunk) into the lake and then ends up with an impossible location in his boat. The last minute by fifth grader would be written in the last minute of the dialogue space-time continuous cleavage by Angie Hormone Kate put a pitiful performance, worse. This is the example when she says "flashlight!" In such a stupid manner that shows the entry of how much of a human body is cracked before it snaps in half. Finally, this movie edition is so strange and terrifying that I have not seen so far. Cameraman is like a group of camcorders given by scientists. This is an example when suddenly shortening the headlights on Alex's car. I have to bet it is a little bit of time spent to modify this movie. The end is completely curious. Directors are clearly trying to create a mysterious plot line as a viewer, "Oh!" Instead, we're left to see some dumb painting with a spider that somehow fits into the story source. Unfortunately, millions do not have a perspective for the film to creep up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
