Really terrible movie. It is expected, however. Apparently a low budget: all dances and actress (if you call "acting"), however, a man who is in a model after the predator, cabin cabin in a cabin, and a cabin with a nude shadow in a shower sequence. But there are some ransom points. While the story is not new, most of them have not progressed. For one, the black person does not die when he attacks (for the first time) and he is not one of the first couple to die. But it's small. More importantly, about Cat's experiments and Wess & Steve I have a very interesting twist. When Steve Cat told her, she knew what she did, what I said and gave me a catwalk. But when the creature reveals who he really is, I was pleasantly surprised by the strange revelation of the revelation. <br /> <br /> If the movie is too bad and it is good to see if it is ... unless you are in a mood for the cheapest scene flick.
