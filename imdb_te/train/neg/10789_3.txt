If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Altıoklar, it is promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see and have nothing but Altıklar's popular style about the most famous things like sex, marriage and cheating. Most nudity is found out of nowhere and it has proven that Altıklar has failed to "try something new" as he is "quoted", even if the plot has no connection. Most sex centered jokes is to show that Altıklar has fallen for the famous saying "sex sells." I wanted to see a good story with a good story. But in the end I have found that I sit for 90 minutes and focus on Altıklar's experimental yet still looking democracy work.
