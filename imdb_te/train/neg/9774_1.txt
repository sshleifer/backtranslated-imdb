Hubert Selby Jr. gave us a "Reckame for a Dream" book and co-wrote the screenplay for Aronofsky. The film succeeded at every level through the intimate and impersonal images of the characters' lives and the evils that destroyed them. "Brooklyn's last departure" still have multiple roles living in vice and sad lives, but it rarely made them the same justice Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The movies in this movie are laughingly anti-gay. The picture is equivalent to death in homosexuality. A homosexual role is spent on rocks, through a speeding car, into the sky, and dead lands on the pavement. Another cross was crucified and some more beaten. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, if it is completed, forces the scenes of union workers literally struggle with strike-breakers. <br /> <br /> Director Yulie Edel has a skill level as a TV director but he is a very small knife. Movies. The film does not seem to be settled on a genre. The lake is presented as a full-fledged character with no dolls, and Baldwin knows how stupid looks in his smallest part. And then our mainstream, Jerefer Jason comes in the league, an unpleasant hooker called Tralala (it is neither believing nor, I'm not joking). Her performance is not great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. The poor use of the color and composition makes it less visible than that and takes a "real" edge from even more provocative bits. A failure.
