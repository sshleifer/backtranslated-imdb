Stephen J. Connell decided a few years ago that he had expanded his horizons and doubles in horror. As a result, "Dead Above Ground" is an endless part of the waste. Now, I recognize her name with this particular image, but I have my glasses and I've lost it, but when I'm in the video shopping. The first question, who is the heck target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" kids movie, but then again there is a lot of tops kids and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. The main characters are very cute if you want to see anyone, some kind, some kind of farm accessories and go to them. A man reveals that a clock is passed by a bed and breakfast, and there are children's teeth collected by the witch for the murder of children. Perhaps something real estate agent failed to mention. Of course the modern day is now the devil of little girls around to warn the true live little girl who lives there now that something bad happens. It does, and squatting on the property that the new owner has taken, there are also two bubbas, so they're very much vengeful. This whole thing is, things that are not appropriate for younger children, except of course the cable has a junk feel for making some for kids at Halloween, so this is average, so it's also chaos. Anchor Bay is a big boo and a new low, if you look at their regular track record with fine releases to get it too much. The UK will get a Phantom box set, we will get "Tooth Fairy". Rarely seems fair. 1 in 10, perfect trash.
