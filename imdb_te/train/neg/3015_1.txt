This is a bad image. Humor is not one of the bad ones. It's a bad thing. It's painful to see. Dangerous in this direction, jumping around and using green and yellow colors in the picture appear to be characterized by disease. Keira Knightly is not convinced as a tough chic at all, and I can not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed for these criminal waste of celluloid. The script is terrible and acting is like fingernails across a chalk board. If you do not see, do not do that. You will not be lost and you do not see this barely two hours in your life .I have seen bad images before and have experienced them because of their mistakes. This time is just waste.
