What a bad image. I was really surprised by DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you are baseball, and show the bases of the Basis Ball, look at the action somewhat realistically. Why are the viewers standing out for no reason at all? *** Potential Spoiler *** And the final scene in the movie .... What is it? Dinero learned that we had entered the field in an umpire uniform, and that this sport was also believed to be a symbolic sink ... This is one of the most deadly scenes in a sporting movie. 10 to 3 stars.
