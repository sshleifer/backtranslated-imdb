Wow you guys are so cool! Corny, Corny, Corny How did I feel about the film? It started well with a good idea, escaped a man (Edward Asner) from Jail, dressed as a Santa, a group of children to help him find a bag of money stolen by him, believed. The film is like a Christmas version of "Whistle Down the Wind". The film starts well but gradually becomes Chisier and Cheesey, and finally it becomes ridiculous and you take the film seriously. For example, you can get his son's worst son, Sunner (Rene Abusejonis), who can not heal his son badly, even if he does not buy good clothes, but poor kid it's jeans with holes! But the 45 second sequence that Samner visits with Fake Santa will get you a happy Christmas carol at the end of the cinema and hug his neglected son ... how it is ... I'm especially good for Christmas to feel better at Christmas and I'm a big fan of seasonal TV movie, But it's a pioneer to me ID, it's a shame Since it is, but in the second half of the film, the rest just do not fit the image of a supernatural element. It's not too bad, some solid acting are especially from kids, but there are plenty of good Christmas image around.
