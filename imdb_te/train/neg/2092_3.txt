Generally, "Caprica" ​​is a story of Silen origin. The premise of the show is interesting. Nevertheless, the authors follow a lot of storytelling and spoil it with many POV letters that pile up the story. There are stories about Hitler's speed. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his only work prototype was driven by an AI version of his dead daughter Joe, a Soldiers of the One (STO), died in a suicide bomber that was caused by the underground monochist terrorist group. <br /> Meanwhile, Joshi Adama (father of "Battlestar Galactica's Commander Adama") struggles with his family, a Maciellielli virtual version of Capikia, the daughter of his daughter's AI version (who died in bombing) (1930s Chicago ). <br /> <br /> In addition to the vapid script, Capica is faced with the same source of many source stories. We already know that it ends (i.e., the cylans will develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
