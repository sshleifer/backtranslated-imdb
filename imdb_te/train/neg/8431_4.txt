The fact that the characters are unable to identify these characters, although the actors are doing a persuasive job playing Lazarus that is paraded on the screen, my watch has been watching my watch just over a 20-minute film (and more than that one later). The development of the plot is confusing and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is practically defective, the primary quality of the action of characters and the cavalier path in which they are treated. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the Wendy's Pons, and Cress should put emotionally emotional characters. However, this faux sociological analysis is a big step from CARICIAS or Kresses, which are both distorted and despised for well-established reasons for the film. We are following the meddles of genuine intellectual intelligence, which means that we have a seriously depressed and defunct woman in Emore Idiota. This is due to its own recession but the script does not support that. I do not give the rest of the story where there is no moscowists there. Will he be cured by his invasion, or is the woman surprised by her displeasure from her conscience? <br /> These are all abuses, ignorance, betrayal, buddy dialogue, weak philosophy, etc ?? Camera work looks great and there is something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to show these players in a raw and sunny light because I saw Kayatana Guilen Kurovo (when she was indulging personally) of any of her movies. <br /> <br /> Pons Pons achieved his goal of gratitude as we do not believe that we need to be forced to see the lower level of society. The exact waste of the scenes of almost identical scenes (the actors were filmed, once the background of blue-green suits could have special effects for a micro organism in the studio). <br /> <br /> I have heard many people in the mood of the male audience, but a visual view proves that the scenes are not the real goal.
