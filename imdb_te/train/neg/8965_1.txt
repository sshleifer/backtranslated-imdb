This is a very low budget, made for TV, a movie that is genuinely successful. They are the fan of the B-movies, and this is a good name because they, the director and the plot are original good, and about this film is just about ruined, it's paired with the "Cube" name for the whole series. Characters are annoying and flawless, with continuous problems, and many more productive screw-ups. This story does not give way to the development of exceptional conversations and suffers from it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's good because it's upset. Picture, I'd probably give about four. I would give a "1" rating pretty much a statement on how the effects and intelligence are paled in the same as compared to the first one.
