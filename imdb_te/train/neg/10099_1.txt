Thanks to God! It did not rent my money but downloaded it! This is the worst image I have ever seen in my whole life, F ***** g Visual Effects, Unnecessary Gore and Nudity! Far away from other zombie movies like Night Live Dead and others. The film has loop holes and bugs. If you have the right time after reading this comment correctly, please see the Directors (Onion Loss) profile. This movie is why I mean self-explanation, which means that every film directed by Elli Luml is rated between 1 and 2. Now these films are not ready to look for what's going to be directed, but I just complete this by saying a strong sentence. Do not watch this movie for fun or time passing or extreme boredom.
