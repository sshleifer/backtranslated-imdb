Mayan, I started with the awful picture of this goddess. Bad to say bad bad story. The director did not know what he was thinking when he made this film. Namaste London is very happy to be honest. Soundtrack is good. But this is one .. my good .. for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one .. The songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman needs music director. <br /> <br /> The director has to do a much better job of giving two great actors. Even if the first half is good, the last 30 minutes in the film is OK. <br /> <br /> Performances from Salman and Ajay avoid the entire disaster. I saw the last good picture from Bollywood (and I'll load them) Dee Dee and Wake Up Sid.
