666: Child Stars crashes begin, covering the event for Channel 6 news, a little boy named Donald (Buoo Poo Stewart), a newsletter Erica (Sarah Living) and her cameraman husband Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent). The first Donald looks like a normal kid but death tries to follow him, warnings from a nun & vicker Scott believe that Donald is bad and all the deaths ... <br /> Jake Jackson, nicknamed Jake Perez, is said to be 666: Really weak. When I look at, I'm responsible for the film that is concerned, and I'm very worried because their track record is terrible. They seem to have the expertise in creating and / or distributing low-budget horror movies of some recent big big budget horror film Rip-offs & 666: Child You Do not Need a Degree in Rocket Science This is the full cash released in The Omen (2006) payment. Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel's script is terrible and does not match the Hollywood equivalent aspirations, Can Donald's Anthropogenic of a Small Town in a Small Town Can Properly Understand? Is this a great starting point for bringing the world down to destruction? Each character in 666: Child's main character's owl, adoptive parents, some character from the prince and the evil baby who tries to warn them. There is no real lack of incident, no gore & the plot is poor. I don't kill Donald a dentist because their teeth are just random and unnecessary, all the dosa images have attracted Donald, and where did Daddy come from? The confusing mess that is very quickly becomes very boring. <br /> The 6 numbers are also annoying. Very impartial. <br /> Director Perez is doing this. There is no blood or gore, some blood sprays, hand cut and some appear to appear in a circle in their circular shape but much better than the screen appears. It is absolutely not a scary, there is no tension because thanks to no weather thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house & we never really knew what Donald was trying to do was never any threat from him <br /> <br / technically this film is alright, Reasonably well made, but the low cost is because the original film is very poor Yasanni causes. <br /> <br /> 666: Child is a poor man. Omen Rip-off, I'll be remade anytime sooner or later. Not good & definitely not recommended. Sequel 666: The Beast (2007), which went straight to DVD.
