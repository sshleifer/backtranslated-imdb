I have seen the earlier Ittenbach film, "Moon Burning". While the movie is rather horrible and nasty, "Premutos" seems to play for laughter. While Ittan Bach is admirable for how much money he earned in the course of his free space (DVD documentary is worth it to see), I'm constantly struggling with fast-forward for the next gore scenario. Certainly, there's gore, and if you're all then go ahead and have fun. But be warned: There is a tremendous amount of lame comedy and tedious storytelling. Most people compare Peter Jackson's movies, notably "Brandi". But what Jackson finds in "Budget Taste" is that it does not have a thing that has Itenbach Jackson. 3/10 (for pretty good and enormous gore effects, and for getting limited resources - but I'm not worth the money I paid for it)
