This flies is pretty surreal to what can ... It's a cartoon, so something can happen. <br /> <br /> First, I loved animated films. Unfortunately this year's performance is very weak. This is not the only list of cartoon errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I will pull the tag line. The film has great 3D effects. <br /> <br /> The film "flies" does not look like real flies. At least they were able to block them. But Sean flies, seriously? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it's written for children aged 6. <br /> <br /> 4) High patriotism. For example: "They're all after American files!" Oh, give me a break.
