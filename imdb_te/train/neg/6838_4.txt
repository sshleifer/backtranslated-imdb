Plot Abbreviation: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, a man who built the Victoria Tunnel, was murdered along with his wife along with his wife. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, broke up. 25 years later, a Karate preacher in Los Angeles, a smuggler who lives in Hong Kong, Alex must succeed in order to take revenge for the murder of their parents and suit the society. <br /> This is the second time Jean-Claude Van Dumme & Sheldon Lottie worked together, formerly "Lionheart". It was the first of three films to feature Van Dumme Dual characters ("Maximum Risk" & "Repliant"). The plot is quite simple, the only redeeming feature of the revenge story, Van Dumme's performance, played by two different people? prissy rich kid & tough - & amp; Chomping tumble, cigar tough guy. When it went, Van Dumm√© did not do a good job in the role, although his little fun on Alex. The brothers are mistaken for each other, wearing different clothes and having different hairstyles. Bole Young is a very valuable assistant for the badges.
