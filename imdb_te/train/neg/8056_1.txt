College (Melissa Szemmiller) is an incomprehensible, boring and abusive supernatural "thriller", a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after mentioning the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck) in a car accident. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you how bad I was ... no matter what kind of importance or what kind of entertainment is at all. I did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all tragic and unbelievable (again, their characters are not good). A horror film is a joke to promote this. Bhayapedutunnayi? There is no sense or suspense - there are some good songs but about it. <br /> How did this project get green light on Earth? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has a clear vision or talent that I can not understand. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
