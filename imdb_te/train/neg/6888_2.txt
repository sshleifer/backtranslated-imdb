<br /> <br /> Zone Header is terribly annoying and can not escape from the same Napoleon dynamite routine. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same insane, very engaging mother, who does not care much about her children's lives (see I'm So So). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anna: <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is fun but not fun. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your soul, skip this image.
