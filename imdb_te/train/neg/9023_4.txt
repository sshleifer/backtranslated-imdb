I've seen anime but I'm not a die hard fan; And I do not read the manga. The critics of the film have a lot of backgrounds that are wikipedia, because I say this. I've seen "St. John's Wort" and it's not a masterpiece with any story of fiction, but I've chosen "Shinio" as everyone likes it. Well, I saw this afternoon, and fought very hard to watch. Yes, it's pretty - slow motion water scenes, leaves on autumn trees, flickering CGI eye - imposing. <br /> <br /> "Romeo and Juliet" seemed to have been taken by someone - the translation also threw in some "X-Men" for good measure - lovers who crossed the star. Split two Wolverine powers in the roles - a cloak of a bear dressed with his claws and gray-haired guy capable of healing his temperament. Then you have a girl with a kiss of poison - that poison ivy (from Batman). Why did these women give such mute powers? The poison girl kisses her leg. Man, it's great power for you. And the other girl, she can create bugs from this yellow dirt that rub her hands on. The other woman has crossed one lovers of the star, has a hypnotic stare strength. <br /> <br /> "Some of these are" House of Flying Doggers "and "Shinio" is made by an enthusiast - other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> You mean, I will avoid this film unless I was 18 years old A.
