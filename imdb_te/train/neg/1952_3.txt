Scott Menville is not Cassie Cassem. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is too tight and nothing has sounded like he ever heard. The previous incarnations of Scooby show. <br /> I'm not sure what they're doing in the villain's sense, but it's a formula used in previous scores of music. <br /> <br /> Animation style is very strange and distorted. I like it, but the real Scooby-Doo type animation is not. But the weird animation used in other WB programs has increased over me; <br /> <br /> It is not a proper tumultuous voice. Properly performing the performance is enough to make one jar. In addition, I'm not a brisk, a nimble fan. As you say, drift or die. Let's see how we look after two episodes - then I will make a more solid view.
