There are some great actors in this movie! Unfortunately they forgot how to work. I hoped that the film was very good but acting was very robot, it was very early. In fact, the actors would read the entire time from the script. Maybe it's a musical score or director, but one thing is certainly an artist to get a different job! Facial powder is so thick that you can look caked on the faces of actors! Nobody should recommend this film, which is a little surprising to the theaters. Cuba Gudging Jr. / James Woods is not giving up to you all. The great amount of plots just need a whole lot more.
