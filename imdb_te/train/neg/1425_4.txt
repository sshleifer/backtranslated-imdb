I'm not sure about other reviewers watching HK movies, but Eagles Enter is no longer on the pile in the HK operation. Michael "Fitz" Wang should be happy to be able to get jobs in HK as he does not stop his path from a wet paper bag in England. Shannon Lee is good and a fantastic fighter (better than her father's leg is better), but her acting skills are also sub-equal. In fact, all the English dialogue (more than 90% of the image - more than the gen-wipe cops) is very bad, the sadness of bad dialogue delivery and English's Redundancy Subs as I switch to Mandaline Audio. Sure, there are some good pistols (but we have not already seen before) and good cinematography, but the visual effects of cheesy really spoil the action. <br /> Maybe, Shannon and Benny will see "jet" Uruguaydes. <br /> Finally, you can see some scenes that seem to be "familiar", especially from a helicopter wearing in the open market (matrix) and fitz diving black fatigues (MI: 2). Suppose some have thought of some things in the film.
