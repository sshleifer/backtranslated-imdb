I saw this film a few years ago in the BBC. How? I do not know, so it's "very bad" goodies, Kidman, Baldwin, and Pullman should now be afraid when they see it. I was wondered by Woody Allen's extraordinary stories and played with pleasure by Leslie Nelson as part of Baldwin. Tonight I tried to see again but life was very small. For a few moments I've seen for a lovely nicol she is hot about 93, Baldwin has always done a good movie? Pullman played his role in the "Nice, soft" character from his mouth when the woman who refuses to "misogethe" abuse herself by blaming herself for murdering herself. Stay away.
