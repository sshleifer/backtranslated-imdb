When star star sets up, how can they destroy good work through bad pictures? Burt Reynolds upstairs, then the horrific Hall Neidom started making chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the hottest property in Hollywood, and has to be invited to ridicule himself with the shocking Last Action Hero. And here, the playful Eddie Murphy erases memories of 48 hours trading places with "family" adventure picture, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and usually plain terrible misfire which is likely to see Charlotte Lewis's great big chest in a stiff blouse and is an attractive item of the whole image . <br /> The story is a pure heart. This was related to a social worker Murphy, who was approached by the mysterious forms and said that he was the person he chose. I choose what I'm asking. His job is to defend a Tibetan boy with spiritual powers from the race of demons that want to rule the world. The mainstream, classy actor Charles Donz is very unhappy in this film, but hey, I paid a lot to sacrifice his talent. It's a lot worse for all Murphy movies. Murphy is not a film in a distinguished role, and although it is true in two points, the film is actually no apology - although it is different and non-formulaic <br /> - Full load of the worst. <br /> <br />
