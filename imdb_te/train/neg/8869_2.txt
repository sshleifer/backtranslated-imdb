With the release of "Ferrigt Foreflutet", the Swedish film industry has actually reached rock bottom. In the past years Stefan (Jens Hultne) spent a quiet life with his wife Mary (Regina Lund). One day Stephen's old friend comes in a favor to ask him. Stephan has to do a small courier job. He will have to bring a suitcase with a heroine through Sweden-Germany rituals. In Germany, it's unlikely to work without planning and Stefan is in big trouble. It's always good to watch a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family drama model. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the product do not have any idea how to write, shoot or cut a picture, the result is only a disaster. Content can end: bad acting, absurd plot and idiot dialogues. The highlight of the film is the most beautiful sexual scene in the very beautiful Regina Lund. For a few seconds, it's about 90 minutes pure, which really makes it worse.
