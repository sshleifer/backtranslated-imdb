Well, I say, this movie is very bad, I have to go out if I have to review it for work. And the worst part is, I drank over the city when I wanted to look very bad, $ 10 parking paid two times because newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always plays - the only time I saw John Travolta in the film. However, the plot had a probability - it sounded great in the preview, but it was totally ridiculous, predictable, weak plot and filled with turn points. I want to save this Christmas Christmas DIDN, and Santa does not need a replacdmetn, but nope is only the coolest part sleigh rides, and the little bladck kid is the best character I'm sure this movie will be great for young children, but so for adults to sit in it Is lame.
