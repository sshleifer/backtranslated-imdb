See, I am studying and reading these comments and I have said that this is a lot but I try to clean it up even though it's small. <br /> <br /> First, how did this film go wrong? It did not show any kind of nostity and I said to many people, "Hollywood", do you mean a real life story? When people wake up and can never see the true truth about u 2pac and Biggie never ever ... its all covered up and buried down deep. Secondly, I'm not 2pac but against Biggie I love them both but the 2pac and Lil Kim definitely get embarrassed in this movie ... <br /> <br /> After all, I think the movie is awesome and true is all about uuuuu You do not know anything about him all and see a lot of the blind too because this is very much love these Hollywood young movies. Use your mind and look at the clouds ... When it comes to this topic you have a lot of what I say, 60% of what I say is because I can say only because it's a little bit of its wider but cinematic, I've done better. <br /> <br /> See, I love hip hop and I live for it, but watching this movie is a little bit of surveillance that no one wants to live. Honor 2pac and BIG with all. Because other young artists who make up for lifestyle like this can turn the other page as youths are being destroyed. <br /> <br /> Let's say real hip-hop love and intellect, smart and everything. <br /> <OK I feel like most of you are crazy, but it's just my opinion. Look I'm probably wrong about something and I'm in hip hop in 17 years and 18 years and I still do not know how many articles I've read in Boxing 2pac or Biggie I do not know this is a bad movie and I have supported and listened to their music ... Many of you There are. <br /> <br /> In the end, I say to Biggie and Tupac fans and family members, these two men and all the time will be great, no matter how they lived their lives but try to be in the future, learning and love each other, Think, because at END .. How much money or name is not about how U and max U How is it? That is, it should know about your soul, your soul, your body and mind ... to do so, you will live after death! Love the peace and ya all !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY and others make a change in this world !!!!
