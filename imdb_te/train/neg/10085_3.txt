Why are all the movies in lifetime that have such titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​oh, how provocative !! "I know this is good". The image is not unique. Real people really do not speak like these characters and the conditions are really hackneyed. Bush is more than a lesbian woman named "point" than the gay character. If you want to kiss two hot women in a very loose fashion, you can enjoy it. It looks like people have noticed the people who really do not come out of the world. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
