I thought it was very good. I love Tim Burton's work, so I'm really glad to see these online short films. <br /> They do not have anything I did not expect. <br /> I'm not sure. I guess they are just dull. <br /> <br /> The sound that I like Roy The Toxic Boy and Stainless Boy affects me. <br /> <br /> The girl's episode is probably very impressive to me. <br /> I do not even like some of the characters die. A fire gas station is usually how the match girl directs or how the girl who stares dead. Surprisingly, Roy's death is fun. Death by a car Fraser Very original ;-) I found it difficult to laugh. <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not right for children. Some language and gore. This is what I say! 3/10
