Gratuitous. The PG rating obtained by the movie is yet another big mistake by the MPAA. Whale rider gets a PG-13 but does the film get a PG? Please. Parents do not cheat, this movie is a huge mistake taking a basic school child. <br /> <br /> I have learned many times that I'm uncomfortable because humor is not inappropriate for children, but it is completely blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, Cat in the Hot is still a horrible film. Only the cast and crew of this film will save. Although Preston is very pretty for this role, Kelly Preston and Alike Baldwin are always good in their roles (in this case or disgusting). Children are designated actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Fanning is the only human element in the film, watching me and throwing things off the screen. <br /> <br /> Do I know there is a huge spoken cat in this film? Mike Myers is totally vulnerable. I do not like him as Shrek's voice, and I really believe that Myers will not be allowed to come back to the movies anytime and again. <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, he should stay away, but one day, he was 82 minutes of my life, personal anger and quarrels wasted 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cat in the hight may be the worst children's film.
