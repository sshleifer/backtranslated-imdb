Hood of the Dead Speaking of a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma, pharmacists and prostitutes fill the streets. One night, Rick's brother fired a gang who ran in the street that had previously fought with him. Desperate, Rick will bring unhealthy blood cells to the health of their scientist partner to bring the newest formula they worked. The formula is not tested by human or dead body, but Rick is restored to his brother. He gives a double dose of body formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and returns to the body and returns to the feast of the human flesh. Rick must find his zombie brother now before the whole hood transforms into dead neighbors. One piece of the hood of the living dead of the living. The plot is a direct split of Resident Evil, acting is particularly terrible with Rick's fake crying for his brother, as guns are being duplicated because every time the weapon is removed, and making it laugh. It is only fake blood on the face of the actors. Zombies are also modified. They will run, grow, and die in the heart to die! Zombies must kill, groan, and die in the brain to die! This film is very terrible, the only good moment for this movie. The hood of the Living Dead is 3 in 10, here and there is a little fun, but it is only a small budget fierce fest.
