...... This film is pretty awful, and I have seen it unfortunately only to stop me from giving a rating. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, fluorescent UV style blood / teeth / eyes give it an "awful" look, and the script is similar ... it is a test to see how long the film will wait. This is not even predictable but a good way. This film is not good. I saw 10 minutes ago and I'm there, I'm there. (Oh and do not let the acting film down, it's also terrible)
