There are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawah, Michael Ortona and Jason Segel respectively) named Slackers, who have graduated from university without a honest test, but it will succeed. It will continue to be very rare, but Nathan (Schwarzscharman) suggests that the most fond of the character they are up to. Nathan begins blackmailing her to meet the girl in her eyes. The only problem when the trilogy starts working on it, Dave's gorgeous and good-hearted Angela (James King) unfortunately falls in love with a brilliant genre. Squartzman can easily see this film because his performance is good. King's performance is average, I think she hired her to stay around with her beautiful look. Slackers reminiscent of American Pani in a different direction. Jokes are as stupid as America. But are not they all used? I feel that the filmmakers of this movie genre are realistic about them. Overall, a smiley movie (except Schwartzman) and a matter of some smiley moments. * Out of
