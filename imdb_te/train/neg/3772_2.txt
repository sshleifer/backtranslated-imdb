I saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. Paintings are terrible in the wake of cities. Even the mob characters looked very weird. Warren Beatty did not perform an awful work like Dick Tracy, but it was not one of his good performances. Madonna must stick only to sing. Glenn Headley did a good job in the film. I gave 2/10 to this movie because of the amazing performance by Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career but he still did a good job.
