I'm going to criticize the film. There is not much to talk about. There are scenes of good animal activities that are pretty good at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a middling idol. He looks a bit a bit and is not particularly good. But okay. He is the man in that lion. We know that when he can not take time away from his lions with his girlfriend, he will end up with her on an island and save the day. Some people say this is a history lesson. The scenes at the circus are another day, especially children hang around. I also returned in the thirties, who traveled on three Masters scooters. It appeared somewhat in 1860. I guess that's the stock footage I have. It is not a wonder that everything is broken. They always talk about fixing her. There is also a bad way. It tells us a little about women's relations at that time. But if you do not take too tight, you can enjoy watching it.
