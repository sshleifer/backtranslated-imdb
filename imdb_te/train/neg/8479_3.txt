Well, when I came to the board in the film, I really wanted to make people happy. I was amazed to see that people aged 7 years liked it. <br /> <br /> "I'm sorry Jordan, but I'm happy with that performance, but my younger sister (actually, only 10) is awful, you know that an image goes to the toilet when it does not take the lead. I do not even have the plot to redeem it.I also was very lame in the role of Pamela ... I was curious about the border lining. <br /> <br /> Also, Spencer, Hollywood, <br /> <br /> I see the dates and actually, he is four years older than she The difference in the "Go figure" was very big, and Jordan was a pretty girl, but in GF, she looked like 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a little kid! <br />) Christy Yamaguchi Jenny Abel (Spencer) I know that the girl is just skateboarding, I know that Catelynn is good and everything, but it's still going to go to a school where there is no scholar ships for Christie Skating, or a scooter to use a skate coach with such connections <br This is not the worst ever, but DCOM accident I think it was also very low, alu.
