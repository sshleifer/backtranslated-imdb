There is a good scene in the fat coin. The title character comes in an argument with another woman and after threatening, Fate Cain sprayed her face. This scene works, at the same time unexpected, fantastically and fun. In that case, the writer / director Usmanman Semben gives the audience an easy, two-hour look at a worthy portrait role. In the scene, she is a brave guy who is courageous in her actions. For the rest of the film, the only thing he will show is the conflicting tones. <br /> The tone is across. Not all movies are explicitly in a particular style, but do not think any type of fat coin is appropriate. This is a play, despite the moments of such a wide-ranging comedy (spraying on the face). On the other hand, this film is not a comedy and is caught in the movie Senbane. There is a way to successfully combine comedy and drama. Unfortunately, Semenin did not find that balance. Instead, one sequence after another leaves two different tones hanging in the air, drifting into each other without much sacred or reason. <br /> <br /> The fat coin has a two-hour long working period. The film ends with a big party where all the characters' contradictions are not resolved and they are not a quick solution. The scene is longer than any other scenario, perhaps twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the scenes have slowed down to the scenes, so it is very difficult to get at the start of the finale in the beginning, and it will be useful for a disappointing viewing experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not the right audience. I felt nothing towards the characters and that there was no connection to any part of the story. Perhaps find something meaningful in the story and see the strongest characters. However, I could not do that, so I can not recommend it.
