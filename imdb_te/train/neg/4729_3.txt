A Littleville Love is one of the Little Elvis' peculiar films. Part Slapstick, Part Fluff, Part Surreal and Part Often. An annoying voice of Elvis meets a very off-beat girl. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense in most Elvis Presley movies, and there are plenty of odd characters. There is not much music in this song, but I like what I like but nobody can remember. Strange continuation. Elvis and Michael Carey go into her beach house tonight, but after a few minutes the delivery boy comes and it's stark daylight! What ?? It's about the essence of the movie. What ?? Oh, two good things about the film: a) Elvis looks great and b) dog steals.
