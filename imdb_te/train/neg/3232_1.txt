There are no plots for this film, no role is developed, and no budget. It sucks to keep up with really short words. As there is no development for the film, it can not even be seen as artistic or trying to make a statement against violence. It probably leaves two other reasons to see. Shocked or getting off as a sick little freaky. Well here comes small. The girl reaction just looks dumb. It's really easy to say that the duplicate (honestly professional wrestling is very easy to tell when they try to get through this movie is much more realistic, they throw innards on her, but she sleeps for so much so that it's just so dumb it's really worthwhile to really cut out from the scene before going to the eye At the end, I'm honestly lady Everything is a lot more duplicate and everything except the eye exception is the film about filmmaking, go hostel and hostel 2. There is also a realistic storyline where you can not only have two realistic violence, but it is a realistic storyline that makes you care about people and the tow movies really consider the deep level Working on aliens American fears and ethics problem Hours, an individual examination of how far to go, and many other things, such as human instincts vs civilization. Iolence. This is a very good options over this piece of crap
