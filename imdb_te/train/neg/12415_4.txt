Surprisingly, I would like to see the broadcast on the opening credit sequence show and want to air the show in seven seasons. I'll admit that Epsen is better than Jed Clumpet, though Epsen is badly mistaken. <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I saw interviews with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube by their television channel's archive. Let's say that I'm more kind about Goldsmith about the show "Barnaby Jones."
