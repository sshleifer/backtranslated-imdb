I saw this movie very little. This is one of the strongest films I have ever seen. Now, generally I like the weird movies, but it's just a bit too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot for this movie. If anything, it starts with toys like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Riggi Ann and Andy go on an expedition to save their new friend Babbet. From there, craziness is great. Greedy, Lonnese, a sea monster named Gazuk, and a group of pianists who perform the performances of the performances, all of which weirder the film. Also, I can not help but feel that Babbage is annoying and a bit too whiny. <br /> <br /> Now that I do not like this movie, there are some beautiful parts. I liked the song of the camel. Although it is a song about loneliness, it has a friendly feeling. Then, Sir is Leonard. Most Lonyas are just plain nuts, Sir Leonard is the most interesting and perhaps ridiculous. King Ko Ko was a little frustrating. Dr. Evil appeared as a villain. Moreover, Raggie Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. A good song is good for a few boys who want to work hard. But, honestly, even these things did not make any good on the film. <br /> <br /> I do not personally recommend this movie, I have to admit, its lovely moments. If you're interested, see it, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" from the simple one.
