Good actors are slower than these slow sweats and chaotic comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard to bring something to life, but a turquoise arrangement that does not miss all the right loses that make it a watch. Without favorable comments here, this film is awful. Badly directed. Well edited. Badly acted. Wrong badly. <br /> <br /> Uddinov, who entered an American insurance company to hack and earn millions of pounds on your computer. He is more than luminous and reliable (he learns to read some of his computer skills reading pamphlets, and computer expert Robert Marley going to South America and stealing his identity). <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot of the plot is to have a flat in his building. She ends up with scenes involving Bob Newhart, where she does not go, but Ustinov bit the bit of money and tries to continue a stage of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he married Smith and they have almost become the main end of each British caper comedy, which goes to Brazil (a fish in the run is called a wolta) <br /> The surprising twist of the end is more ridiculous than everything that came before . In the end I was thinking to be really off my rocker to stick out the drivel like this. Caesar Romero did not help a comio. One of the most infamous, poorly paced 'humor' I've seen, and definitely the worst caper. Do not waste your time. If you like it you should see good images.
