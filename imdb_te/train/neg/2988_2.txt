At first I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulzi. This film is completely worse. I could not stand to see. The fact that the storyline is a joke, a joke of acting, and nothing with the zombi 3 zombie 2 is more joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, this movie is not worth $ 1.00, it costs to rent. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one is terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
