It comes to me as a soap opera. I guess I can be considered "social commentary" of people in the town. But in the final analysis, I did not care how I categorized this film. None of the characters are very fond of or appealing. I did not think of chemistry between Hudson and Baucal. If a love story is here, it will go ill. And despite the end of the twist provided by the full and immediate (and therefore, incomprehensible) coup in the witness stand, Dorothy does not have enough of my interest in the story. Whether Frudian signs and psychology are so early, this story is deadly, dramatic and softer. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson towering wood. It is the most impressive character of Lauren Bacal and one of her poor performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack have provided more inspirational appearances, but her role is frustrating, and his curiosity. Robert Keith, the romantic, out-of-father father of two offender adult children, is the most sympathetic character. Everything is very interesting, Robert Wilke, who looks bad in a small role as the owner of the bar. <br /> <br /> In countless Western countries he is known to be a bad man, but here he is a sincere and loving brother. <br /> <br /> I will take my social commentary with the interesting, attractive story and some of the favorite characters.
