The UK police, which are surrounded by US teeth weapons, seem to be running and you know that CID officers have stopped work and moved into uniform when the pub went down! It is one of the most spectacular films of the "real" UK police ever held in a loyal public. I might need to have money to pay his back tax bill to Mr. Snipes but the good actor like Heck Charles Dance can see that there is a secret of what it's doing. <br /> The worse less budget than the Worse "B" movie 50's. An hour and half of suicide and time I will never return. <br /> <br /> That's exactly the plague.
