"It's as difficult as liking to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship like drama like romantic scenes like thrown out like a good measure, and stir like it's like making money and stuff like us." - Ellen, a lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kiss, Like On, Like, Mouth and Stuff" is as good as artwork. Ellen's hairy hands and chris look like my years of long movie-viewing experience and height. <br /> <br /> The new US-20-something-airhead recordings began with "My Likes". 1. Chris is deployed with his genitals. And that's not the: Chris fat wins audiences with a full screen shot of Chris fat white stomach after completing the way Unn's Catholic documentary (so guided by Ellen and Patrick) is really thrilling. I can say honesty, I have not seen such kind of grace. Chris, you have to do more scenes in your next movies, because that clever and intelligent man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" are the sequels of the beginning. Quick w *** and then a hairy, fat, white stomach: what film-goker can be requested? No need to say, I can sit all day and see Chris (though I'm straight) ... such poetry in the move. Such elegance, such style. Plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy - the scene is less than the total amount, with the divine inspiration. <br /> <br /> Barbara Streisand is not even more spiritual than that. Ellen's hairy, thick hands. The wobbly-camera close-ups photographed by Ellen and Patrick's skill often created confusion about the correct identity of questionable sex, since our two directors of photography (I can not adequately emphasize). There are many scenes when we see a body (leg, arm or foot), but it is often a guessing player: is the body part man or woman? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and Wattper, have their intentions to create their gender-based confusion with their intentions. It's hard to guess whether a male or a male is watching the leg. Patrick is very thin and capable in his movements, hence the hair and natural, Ellen and the other girl are very butch, with their thick legs and hands. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Brilliant - Particularly conflicts with the theme of reversal between the sexes: the most original and the majestic. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex every time, wants to speak to her former Patrick - like a girl. <br /> <br /> Ellen's search for left-handed companion. "He should love The Simpsons, it is a leftist." The filmmakers decided to break a long tradition of good left-handers. Ellen refresh - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" is really unusual in less than 80 minutes than her and her generous friends (3,849, accurate). <br /> They have been able to transfer their real-life inability to the real screen with the least effort on the big screen. Close-ups of the toes. There are a lot of things for foot faculty who think it is the most generous way to reach sexual minorities. After all, the shoe- and foot-fetishists are offered less of modern cinema, so it's good to see someone there is CARES <br /> <br /> KOTM, or, KLOTLMAS, provides more than meets the eye. This is not a modest little picture about people engaged in deep relationships when drowning in meaningless conversations. No, it's too much. It's all about the silly creatures guides light; Just out of movie school and chewing out the vast labyrinths of many fake-artistic wannabes that seem to play well in sophisticated festivals such as Sanyans and Cannes, guiding the light and access to them. The required exposure has some real cash for some change, promoting Sean Penn and George Clooney hire the interests of the world and encourage the solution of all the political issues in the world. What's the better way than by doing romance early? <br /> If Chris and Ellen's camera is in the camera here, as clearly stated in the final credits, then the two are in front of the camera.
