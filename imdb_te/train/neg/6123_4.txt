When Teen-Agent was the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was one of the best films I made. In fact, the reason for this is Bo Derek and the clothes of his various countries in the film. However, now I am old and honestly saying this movie is awful. You mind, Bo Derek is totally beautiful, and she and husband director John Derek make sure you look her plenty. But when it's out of the movie, it's a big thick ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular as he thinks you should, but he sees Jane (of course, Bo) for the first time, he does not know what he thinks. Although it is worn by a wet-looking shirt, her breast is unique. Tarzan is the only primitive man to face this problem. If you are looking for an image that slobber on a beautiful naked body, then this ticket may fill. If you're looking for a brilliant, amusing and valuable image, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere at that point !!!
