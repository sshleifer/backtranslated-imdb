Wow, I hate this movie. The subject should be really good result, and the main actor is definitely sensitive and has enough expertise to handle the topic, but the script - even if * * is a script - is a mess. It is less cinematic than a random slide that goes anywhere. I tell you that I'm going somewhere faster, it will surely sit somewhere longer than 81 minutes. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. So Farooza Bowl (SP?), His sometimes-harder but ultimately-loving-and-accepted mother. There's a lot to say here for the mess of the movie, because it's a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but it was never made out-of-take from a movie. Skip this one - this is not a $ 6 value for a pay per view.
