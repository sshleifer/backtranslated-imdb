I love the special effects and I see new technologies that science fiction has to say. The special effects of this film are very good. For the last three years, I have seen most of the film because it is being broadcast on HDBO. I must confess, I will miss some scenes, but I usually draw into movies, and see some scenes more than once. But every time I saw a bit of "Halo Man", I was disappointed, almost "movie noir." I'm not sure; Maybe I should not be bad at Kevin Bacon, and that's a disappointment. But I know how he behaves so much that he can witness the most unfortunate people. Regardless, I can recommend this film for excitement (though some parts move slowly), but I do not recommend young people 14 years (maybe 12, they mature).
