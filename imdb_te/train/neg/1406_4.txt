This "movie" is like a music video. He said in an interview from 2004 that when he is doing movies, he feels he's doing music, and when he's doing music, he thinks he's making movies. <br /> <br /> Conversations in the movies are like a noise, Kusturica in the same interview. <br /> <br /> "Do tell me this thing" is very little "noise". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> It was the first 30 minutes and the music video was a few points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "I have this promise" no plot. As I read, I'm looking forward to writing this script Rano Bocaiko - one of my favorite scripts, "Life is a Miracle". Rango Boogie writes great dialogues, but they are "noise" for Kusturika, and most of my regretted I have only seen two words, and I found Rango to be a bookie. The director used the other part of the script to give his son Strybard's music his confusing music. <br /> <br /> In an interview with Gordon Mihail (scripts written for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat"), Kusturia did not follow the script. "The black cat white cat" is the only script, for which he says Kusturica that he does not touch it. According to Gordon Michek, Kunstarka will return to the script and if he does not, he can not make a good movie. And I think this is "this promise to me". <br /> <br /> He has followed the script of "Rango Boogie". <br /> <br /> <br /> "This promise to me" is called "comedy", but there are very few moments, which make me laugh. The funny movements are the "black cat white cat" in the same style, but not all that funny. <br /> <br /> However, some people who "liked this promise" knew that I was very positive. Image.
