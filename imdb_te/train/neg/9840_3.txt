Quirky, independent, theatrical, and Christian slater - all teasers make me look like an hour or a "jewelry" of a movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never gets. The film is contrary to the film. For a moment I can not stop dishonesty. Well overtone, perfectly theater sets, overdone, apparently theater acting, overdone, definitely directing the theater - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegro's crocodile does not need to give hammer style. And it's hard to experience any feelings for Julian Poe because we never know him. A ridiculous girlfriend, annoying towns, idiot clerics, breastfeeding children - anyone who has a long-term desire to reach anyone, especially in the seaside (Slater's character), decides to be tough?
