I promised never to come out of the movie (Rambo 3, Basis Mai, Deep Impact, a very different type of deck that hurt me) but Mr. Seid was almost successful. Huststage is really awful experience. Anyone watching this film thinks that the Austrians are a pessimistic, curious bunch. It refers to a world that does not exist in love and humanity, and people insult for each other for the same reason - distract from their own unfortunate existence. But director Seidel is in the Austrian (European Western?) Suburbs with a documentary-style style (directly from the imagination of Austrian Shock-Cartoonist Dex) with professional actors. The viewer is filmed with sex orgies, torture and disabled people against women, madness and degradation. But this is not social criticism. It's just pure shock without any cosmetic value. Instead you make bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anyone needs anybody to realize that there are any mistakes in our society, this person should live with the closed eyes. It is fake social criticism with a wedge hammer. And it looks at people as a frustrated disappointment. It shows offenders - not why I hate it. But it describes the average people in an ugly, mistype way. That's why this movie is really unpleasant.
