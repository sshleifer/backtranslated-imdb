Haideyo gosa of the 1969 film "hitokiri" (malleler, or "tencu" - gold punishment) in the lead roles ( "Western" name-action format), the main characters are: lest sakamoto, hampipi tekci, simbi Tanaka, ijo okada, ____, anonoji. "హిట్లకిరి" అనే పేరు చారిత్రాత్మక పదంగా, నాలుగు సూపర్-కత్తులు కలిగిన ఒక సమూహాన్ని సూచిస్తుంది, వీరు 1800 ల మధ్యకాలంలో పాలక టోకుగావ షోగునేట్లో కీలకమైన వ్యక్తుల హత్యలను నిర్వహించారు, "విధేయుడు" (అనగా అల్-నేషనల్, ప్రో-చక్రవర్తి) టోసా వంశం యొక్క కక్ష. What about this fight? In fact, you can not find in this movie. <br /> <br /> No more gosh than you reveal the original bloody slicing and dicing and very bright killer Ijo Okada original (not at the absurd length). For example, Sagamoto is a man of historical significance that is considered the Japanese navy father of Imperial. The closest Gosha comes to provide a history lesson in which Takki's mansion comes from trying to discover him as philosopher, hoping to betray the obedience. He began to force them to defend the foreign warships in Japan's ports and the weak international war conditions in Japan. Want to learn more? Sorry. In the mid-sentence this grieving speech was cut by Gosh (!). There is a lot more to inform his audience about a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film is totally confusing to me about the goals of these two sides in this struggle. For two and a half centuries, Japan has taken over Shogunt Central, which is an organization that can prevent social change in society and prevent social change. It is fearful of contamination outside of both theoretical and technical. With this spirit, the tools of "leveling" in Europe and the United States boycotted guns that stood up to a farmer's samurai. During this period, the Emperor was no more than a spiritual figure. But <br /> <br /> feudal phethodams lived among the neutral parts of the towns, new traders, landlords and emerging artists - - by its French name, known in Europe by burjuvas class. Inevitably, as this new class has gained strength, it has laid many limits on feudal society. In Europe, the king (emperor) became the main figure in the bourgeois struggle for power against the feudal government. But political leadership does not fully understand the benefits of the working class. When the world came out in 1853 with a bang, U.S. In the form of Admiral Perry's "Black Ships", Japan's ruling class has led to a crisis. These foreigners do not have any comparison with their army. In addition, they were destroyed by the British and French imperialists in China. What to do to protect Japan from the fate of its weak neighbors? Surprisingly, some of the things in the unstable shogunate are unwilling to trade with foreigners to gain their modern technology. This is represented by Sagamoto in the film (just just). On the other hand, represented by the emperor-faithful ultra-nationalists teci, foreigners believed to have the strength, they "sold the country" has reduced the other section. In this way, the key is to kill the shagunat images - and away we go. <br /> <br /> Teach me inspiration, the biggest puzzle of the film. Gocha pointed out that he was fighting primarily for his personal development rather than credibility. Can we represent the total amount of loyalists? <br /> <br /> Many critics compared the film to "Goikin", the same year Gosh did. But, "gokikin" a sharp, sublime, adventure yarn, there is a hero worthy of sympathy, "hitokiri" there is still somewhere in the vicinity, such is the hero. Sacomo may be the hero of the film but we do not have permission to learn him - or he's standing up - that's enough for him to achieve that status. /> <br /> In his excellent scores in terms of five Kurosawa <br movies, masaru sato's score is very disappointing, "Bonanza" episode is from the tiraskarincabadinadiga. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
