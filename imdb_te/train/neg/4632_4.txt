Maria Bell did not think about what people would do in her film roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and popular movie to be her actress. Perhaps those movies need, Sugar Coated (aka "Hollywood") then and then (Cayote ugly and of course Mommy 3). /> <br /> If I fail to do it (it can not spoil), Maria Bell has starred in other independent / small films. Image. It's almost a trick for me, along with strange stuff. But in the end (and though I tried to deal with some errors like bad passing and dramatization), the film is still too long
