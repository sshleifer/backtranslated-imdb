Claire Denis's films appear to be one of two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and intimate. <br /> Now, I see "Chocolat", since then it is not as terrible as "True Every Day" or "Joy Pass Soulmill". I've made a point to see every new movie Denise does. I was disappointed. "L'intrus" is no exception. She has since made a film personally and her first moves. <br /> <br /> You will get Denise a lot of regulars: her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her plenty of cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; "Trouble Ever Day" and "Jai Pass Sommil," Gregor Colin, and Litis or Black Man from Russian Girl. Michelle Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera was bleeding on the curve of the hair hanging on his forehead and got hit somewhere in Korea, and I finally cut it, it was relieved. <br /> <br /> Some actions were made - a man searching for fierce murders, a son - and there could be a plot, but an opinion was not able to recognize it and I was afraid of two views, from the question. For one thing, the score is jarring and obtrusive (in "Beau Travail"). For the other, the seasons have become too aberrous and are more confusing about what's going on. Oh, there are some beautiful shots out there, and if you liked the "Friday Evening" with its shots of folds in huge drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the beauty of El intras .. Otherwise, let's steer clear. I've seen the film in French and I can not avoid the crucial thing, but the dialogue in a Denis movie is rarely five pages , Plenty of space and the edges of the double. "Chocolat" the best in the silence; "L'Intrus", it is just dull.
