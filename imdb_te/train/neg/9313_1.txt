The worst low-budget horror film I've ever seen. I am an open minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies, I'm looking for some of the less well-known horror movies in particular. They are always good for a smile, I believe I know, I've seen a lot. But this movie is terrible. I'm thinking of stopping it in the first five minutes ... I should be. Nothing is good about it, first and foremost, camera crew a $$ suck3d. Introductory ending is stupid. Acting and special effects are terrible. Please, I'm feeding you, do not watch this movie, you absolutely hate it.
