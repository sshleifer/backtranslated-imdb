Oh man! I'm just talking now! Very bad / cheesy horror flicks This movie is really in a class of its own. <br /> First, the film is not originally in English. That's ok because the voice dubbing is really exceptional! Here's my favorite summary from the dialog (where is it too much to come from) ?? <br /> "I'm a little better, I'm just thirsting!" Your blood! <br /> <br /> No play! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and the scientists. <br /> Scene 1? Scientist: "You can not do that? It's a disaster!" - Military Officer: "It's Science Fiction Only" (he was a complete disaster as he was anticipated scientist). <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you die many people!" - Military Officer: "You do not know what you're talking about." (He and many others die). <br /> Scene 3? Scientist: "Do not do that! It kills everyone!" - Military Officer: "It's nonsense" (he goes to kill everyone) <br /> Sean 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You get the idea). <br /> Is not it enough? There are some scenes that really have instant lyrics! In one scene, the army is literally pointing guns at 10 unarmed men. The leader shouts, "Em 'm im!" And all 10 Army guys, at one time, fight both their guns and fists two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. Do not care for details! <br /> <br /> The film has hip / upbeat '80's keyboard / synth sound track. I realize this review may have some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratch the surface. The image of this caliber comes out only once a decade! A real movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
