Fetinctic, Overlong Fabrication The history of the Federal Bureau of Investigations is history. An airplane exploits the explosion and begins to be very exciting, but in the way of a play involving James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles (Miles accustomed to playing wives suffering mourning, and her nerves will come here correctly). The honor director Mervyn Leroy gave this dawn a follow up of the Whitehead book, but without the influence of talent, the film was not very effective. Stewart's partner was best performed by Murray Hamilton, although many dialogues are ridiculous and scratched, and the film appears twice as long. **** from * 1/2
