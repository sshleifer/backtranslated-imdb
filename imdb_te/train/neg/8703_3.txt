<br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised if they have cargo living dinosaurs. The Army Commando team is now required to think carefully about the removal of human species and the reptiles. <br /> <br /> You will see the cover and get your first impressions of the movie. That's pretty cool. Acting is just acceptable from certain characters. This story is poor, with images that are all about trying to kill the army and dinosaurs. This film came three years after Jurassic Park. Instead, the film 'Jurassic Park' came 13 years before. Dinosaurs' clothes are getting very little, and I understand the clothes. Apparently people dressed up, and this film makes no effort to hiding this. While a dinosaur is running a corridor, a scene is created in a way where anyone will be riding a life. It's a good thing coming out of this movie. Short running time. <br /> <br /> "It's like Friday Night's Nightmare". - Officer (Brian Curry)
