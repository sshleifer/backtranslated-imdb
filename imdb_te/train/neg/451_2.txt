I do not care how many proposals this junk this and that's the best, stunk this movie. Stop the set or O.J. I do not know whether to sue with a lawyer. I'm rarely bored of this. This scar is slapping into every movie to call it entertainment. The whole story is stupid, acting uninspired, 'drama' is emotional. I do not have to pay for this satisfactory experience.
