Well, there is no real plot to talk, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and inappropriate sex (sometimes it's fun, but it's not this case). What can I say about this? The action takes place, when it moves, and the two characters fall from a skyscraper (to be several miles high), but there is a cold scene where there is not much "whole" recommendation. If you want to see it, but if you skip it you will not miss much ...
