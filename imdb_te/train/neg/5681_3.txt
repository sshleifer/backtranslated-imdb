I chose Seed and it was his good movies because I saw another Uwe boll movie, and I was stumble on a local DVD-store when I saw and loved the post (yes, in fact I loved postage). <br /> <br /> The first 10 to 15 minutes are very promising and the most important mental thriller appeared at the start, which immediately landed down from there and ultimately the most common slasher movies I have ever seen, a huge amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses Including sub-part acting. Boll made his best effort to come up with a good plot, but after a while gave it up. Maybe he must adhere to comedy? Some good things about this film he manage to create a whole creepy environment, special effects are better than what I expected and the soundtrack will go well in the overall atmosphere, but the simplicity of the film combines the entire nature of the film with its final half hour, Destroyed. There are many very well-made surprising scenes, but they seem to be shocking for the shock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know how to make a film. The seed is not one of them.
