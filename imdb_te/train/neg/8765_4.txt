I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. A quick summary of this image is essentially AVOID. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir's controversial territories from India in 1999. . In reality, the Indian army has suffered from Pakistani forces from the film. <br /> <br /> This is what I think is not true that the Indian army is ridiculous and stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw almost this movie <br /> <br /> Many domestic audiences wanted to be like this film, but they remained laughing at funny scenes. <br /> <br /> This script is absolutely inaccurate. It is not known to Mr. Dutta about how a squad works, and it expresses the idea that bad war films are used for reference. <br /> <br /> Many actors from Principals are not stellar but it is difficult to criticize most of them if they take into consideration the script they gave. For the supporting cast, I can say that they are enthusiasts. <br /> The editing is also very bad. <br /> <br /> Very nice, it is difficult to learn what will happen for a long time, and music suddenly ends with changes in the scene. <br /> <br /> Good things: Cinematography is great, the color of the film is not exactly visible (color balance is often different in scenes). Also, some of the songs in the film were very pleasant - for the first half dozen or more verses. <br /> <br /> They are bad for a long time. This confusion lasted for four hours. It is here that a good editor is able to hit the 1.5-minute distance. Sadly, the good editor is not working in this movie.
