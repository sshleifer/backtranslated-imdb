Without doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted money! I told the plot, sorry, there is a plot? When there was a terrible moment ... no, nothing cared! I have the best special effect on hiding under the bed covers ..., do not think one thing for it. You know exactly where the killer started. There is nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact just two blurry bits in the misty when you see the kid sister, in the shower and when you see Nurse Toppan saw her top off. The film is about the idea of ​​how to do a horror movie.
