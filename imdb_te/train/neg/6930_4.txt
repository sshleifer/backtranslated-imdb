Dr. Tark's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist traveling to a mad shelter to write about a new technology that they use with their patients. However, journalists quickly realize that they are not visible and the refuge is driven by patients and doctors are in the cages. First of all, some parts of the picture are just plain boring and just wants you to fall asleep, and the interesting episodes are interesting for all the wrong reasons (for example, a guy he feels a chicken). The story is actually quite good, but the film is also bombs. The music of the film is really odd and something you hear in some mad comedy, and yes, there's a scene involving chicken men dancing, pretty much made me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> Rated: R. for violence and nudity.
