Wow. Who ever told anyone that Edward D. Wood Jr. did not influence anyone? The exact case in this steam pile point of assortment; "Violent Years", like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" makes Keith Richards's worst past as my first overnight emitter. I'm not getting near the whistle-tear dug from pure clay that looks like my best, nightclubs, walking, and bullets. However, I can think of some parties that are actually going well. Also, if you are looking for a definite example of Santa-Satan Dichotomy on the VHS tape, look no further. I know that the MST3K version is now available, do not check this image. Move "Santa Claus" to Satan here.
