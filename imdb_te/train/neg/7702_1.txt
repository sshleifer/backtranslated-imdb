I live in a black town with a black man. There are some major suspicions about Tyler Perry's work. I realized that some people feel the need to appreciate him because he tries to portray a positive scenario about black and culture. <br /> <br /> I am honestly believing that I have been on Perry White, the film NAACP, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson on his donkey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] The characters are poorly written and acted. Jokes are very bad, I have to assume that something is funny. <br /> <br /> I'm going to get this big big pile. <br /> <br /> Made = Suck. This character may have some appeal, but it is no longer available. What she will ever do is to be less than her usual to intimidate the children and threaten the elders with violence. She is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with a fianc√©e's wife is the horse's bone. If a woman is frightened when a husband dies, why should she try to escape when she is sleeping on the bed? It did not make much sense for her to leave when she was at work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hoped that the characters in the arc were very painful and frightening, and I hoped she would throw her the balcony and did not hesitate to be royal. <br /> <br /> Then there are two love birds. A bus driver asks a woman who suffers her when she makes her rounds. I can not believe it. I can not really believe when she agreed to go with him. But what happens to the cat is that the adult man is cutting the pebbles in a window and inspiring suggestions through a mega bitch at a age of ten. I do not use this word lightly, but the woman has only two modes. Moros is the victim and the mental momma is one of the two faces she has shown continuously. The bus driver is not going to get any. He married her without sampling things - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is a family reunion scene. Here we have the weight of the mother, which has speculative subjects, grinding, shirtless, overly muscular, b-ball, Maya Angelo grinding for great taste. When the children pulled out the furrows out there, calling me a meeting, the oldest of them was a heart attack. All this is going on at the worst resume, laughably easy for groups separately, and then they ring an hour. When they do, everyone dries up what they are doing and drops what they do for a tough talking, like Pavlov's Dogs Pack - WTF !! <br /> You have the last five minutes of the film. In it we see manhandled by his long-standing victim and all bad actress to be future pros who abuse. The black angels are worn and a miraculous marriage hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! Testing your entrance test for pain, and the second villain in the story also handed her donkey. What did not guess, what did not happen. Instead, Perry removed the test of challenging and closed the tone in the tone - WTF !! <br /> <br /> "Do not start me on the rest of Tyler Perry's paintings, and I'm going to say this. According to a Black Guy, DW lives in the Griffith's legacy The irony is that it belongs to a black race that appreciates what our country's birth can do, sells us the river. Vadalivestanu ginjalloki them. Thanks a lot, dude !! What are you going to adopt it in 2009, the Colonial is a comedy about the savage beating and rape of slaves in the United States?
