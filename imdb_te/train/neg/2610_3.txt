102 dalmatians [Walt Disney]: I'm not a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly padded storyline, horrible for starring Glen Clock, hams every scene her own amusing, and very boring and uninteresting lead actors for her. Once again dogs are only "actors", which are "real" and have a story. Here's another waste attempt. GRADE: D.
