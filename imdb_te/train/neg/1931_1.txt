I was very excited to see this. Most unfortunately the conversation is quite stupid and far from the awe or interest that stimulates the whole picture. A child can see the missing logic for the behavior of the character. Today children need creative stories to stimulate them, which makes 'daytime dream' about events. E.T. This is exactly what movies like. And Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids are thinking about Jedi Nights and ignoring their own lightbulbs?) At this time, you should not waste your time and money seriously.
