Drew Barrymore is an actress, not only in her career, but also in her private life. After a brilliant child actress she fell into the dark with images of low quality. She is reminder of the worst days of Darby Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film is reminiscent of Brian D'Palma's "Rising Coin", a plot with many personality disorders that set the story for horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is a Bollywood heroine named Hollywood Gooding. A young woman trying to live her life in California, her other personality killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her vicious personality is back in her life to destroy her newly found peace and her newly discovered love. In the midst of chaos, his new boyfriend, Patrick Hysmith (George Newberg), tries to help Holly face his last demons. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Paulam's underestimated thriller, "Doppelganger" is not a wretch, it is not only to fulfill its purpose, it will end in the ultimate end of cinema history. Although Barrymore does not look good, she treats her with respect to the above average performance. The remaining cast is from mediocre to up-to-top performances, while Leslie Hope is the best of them. <br /> <br /> The script is completely clear and the effect of De Palm is very clear. While the film is trying to make it realistic by making literal notes in almost every line, dialogues are dull and woodworking is definitely not good. It has nudity and overwhelming reasons and the overuse of special effects. <br /> <br /> The effects made are exceptionally made by KNB, and there are really some good stuff in the film. However, the overwhelming over-use reliance on the effects of the effects only reduces the effect of KNB's work and it makes fun of what's in a different movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a low-quality movie, but it can be a very interesting movie with a better and more coherent script. Unfortunately, we have a normal picture of every second of everything here. Barrymore's beauty is valuable. 3/10
