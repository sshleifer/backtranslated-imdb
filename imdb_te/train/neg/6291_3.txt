Now I recently laughed until the fun of the joyous comic bachelor party, the pleasure of seeing my one of my new favorite comedies hurt it's kind of movies. So naturally I wanted to see a sequel, but it would be funny, but the Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by American Pea Generation, and it loses the hole's benefit of the first film. Yes, the first movie is nudity, but it does not perform in every scene. Even the plot is the same from scratch, it's not always complaining with me, but this could have been quite a bit original. <br /> <br /> The real old actors in this movie are not happy because it is cheesy or really crazy. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are up against everyone, dating only 2 months. Melinda has a great family, but they are very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd Ron, feared he would take his job. So they go out for a bachelor party at the weekend for Miami and Todd himself is going to make Ron get into the film, which changes his mind about Melinda's marriage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Bachelor party 2: A couple of last temptation is laughing here and there, but all over the first time failed to emancipate what achieved. These guys are very bad than Ron's friends, who love him except Seth, and he is so funny. Other than Seth's other favorite characters are Ron and Melinda, who gets more or less on your nerves than all. Would you like to see this movie? Just Gets Girls Wild Gone, This is the same thing as a movie. The original Bachelor's party sticks to the tears of the smile. <br /> <br />
