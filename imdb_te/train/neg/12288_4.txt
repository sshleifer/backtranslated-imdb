The film is a frequently used strategy in low-budget horror movies, but it takes a long way to shut down the budget deficit in a dark and visually crazy manner. If you frequently watch the black screen (maybe even have a bad video transfer), it will swoon poorly and murky (and takes place almost entirely at night). Oops, the best word to describe the plot of the movie is "murky". Filmmakers discourage diverse (and unrealistic) horror ideas without reasoning and half the way you feel that they have left the work to make up half the horror movie; Do you know when you see the characters that make you a little bit of mortal danger (or, in some cases, even dead)?
