The world is an endless film, odd because it thinks about the total destruction of the Earth. The main character is kind of scientist, I'm not sure exactly what kind. He has two jobs in the government (?) Facility that protects four security men. His first job is to monitor places and broadcasts (although it does not work in job # 2, it actually looks like a hobby). Job # 2 needs him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ... At least I think it's best I can figure out. The scientist takes his wife out there apparently "plant" is not exactly the top secret. When she finds a message from her space (as they go to dinner) she loses: Major earth exploitation, repeat and over. He said he was always the first messenger from a place where he could break the meaning; His wife says he will be late for dinner. So they go to the party (!?!). Only a few seconds later, China finds that he has suffered a major earthquake. From there, this film ... somewhere! Yes, Christopher Lee has it, but it really does not help too much. Besides, Lee Hoouling II will give a poor performance as his performance. This film is boring, but if you like Christopher Lee or Z-Grade sci-fi to suffer through it once you have enough stupid stuff. Plus, there is a lot of stock footage that destroys the Earth.
