For science bullying film to work well it should be original or very good replacement. This is not even a film. A disease is people because of a toxin and not because people are essentially a fake-genuine twist, but it kills a very small twist people. <br /> <br /> The government conspiracy theory is that there is no genuine error of the film that the contaminated man has no inquiries. Although the character is madly insignificant, he is not. Pity without meaning is the meaning of it. Other characters are cookie cutter because they are ridiculous. Subplots are twisted and annoying. And the saddest thing film is also very flat enjoyed as mock material. The image is smaller than 45 minutes and it's worth watching.
