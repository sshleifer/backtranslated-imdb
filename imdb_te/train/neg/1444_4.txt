The film is very long and unfortunately is different from the novel. If you want to watch the movie, the first novel is not read as it laughs at you. However, cinematography is ok, and if you're a person who loves adventure genres in Africa, then go for it. Acting performances are sufficient, but many important events in the novel have been deleted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis did not seek his missing brother, instead of looking for his father. Goghol was fraudulent and killed in the cave, but was shown here as a good man who would like to be with the new king.
