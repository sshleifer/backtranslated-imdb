Did you know that the feeling of being happy when you watch the film is a serious, thoughtful piece of the movie that you will find hard to fail? When you can not help, when you laugh in the worst terrible nature that disperses your screen? <br /> <br /> The "Dead of House" manages to rebuild the concept that you want to know from the beginning to the end of the "House of the Dead" when you sleep while the cat is typically curly on your forehead. Men's actors have been clear since the opening of their split-size (which they do not shy away), but their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude is the men. I honestly did not care about the characters at any moment in the film and I really wanted their death because they left me for a good hour. Wowe Boll considered a two-hour footage as a film from the original game. At least we get good acting? However, because of the script's script, it is certainly challenging to build a persuasive film that all the credits are not placed on the actors. The worst part of the film is undoubtedly and in fact there are such lines: "These are zombies, pure and simple" and "not cop, we do not go there!" It's very painful. <br /> <br /> We all know zombie movies never feel particularly provocative or full of meaning; Better they are two hours of action, blood and cupboard terror are harmless. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Your bin is not the worst kind of bag that comes out of the bag, it goes into the room and kills sour milk in cartoons and gray skins. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received no bad reviews, and Danish movies did not buy the film. <br /> <br /> The final score is 1/10.
