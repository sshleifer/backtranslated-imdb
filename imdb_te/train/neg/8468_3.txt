"They're in our" poor science fiction best. Average acting bags in this movie. Plots have a lot of holes. Aliens have come to land on an asteroid and have been hiding between us for more than 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them look human. They have exotic-skeletons (why they need plastic surgery) in their alien form, but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. After the project Blue Book closed, the heroine's father was "disappeared", but was considered a F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, select "Body Snatches Invasion" and see how it happened.
