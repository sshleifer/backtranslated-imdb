If you see previous films and shows of Rodney Dangeror, you can find many jokes made in this fantastic frame. Written as a sitcom, I'm failing to strike any unwilling strand from a self-help physician played by Molly Shannon, a sexually-flawed liver of John Lynette, 'I'm fat and so funny'. 5 wives are adequately liked, and if this is a pilot for the action-adventure series, it can work. Instead, it happens as a masculine fantasy trying to avoid being politically incorrect.
