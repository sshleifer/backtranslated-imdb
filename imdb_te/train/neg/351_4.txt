1/16/2002 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery? / Thriller turns the most ridiculous plot. Despite the most talented actors, the film is very predictable and underestimates the audience. I hope this film is not stupid and they're still doing some stars pockets while still doing what they are doing. First, the film will be directed against Canaryl's punishment, but for the audience, let the mill run, not the standard, the thriller ever. . We are pulled into every silly switch in the role, because it's filmed when we need it in the story and we're ready for this thing before it ends. Yes, there is some good acting here, especially in the role of Blair Underwood, Fish Burn, and Ed Harris's psycho-co-operative character, but the story does not work until the long-awaited conclusion.
