After watching this movie on the SCIFI channel, I ended up with only a few enthusiasts who did not see a movie a movie. The film is an endless series of extreme events, or "delights" to a friend who reads on my shoulder. Commenting the plot is not really worth it, but basically crashing into the Yeti territory carrying football players. By the end of the film, we are trying to run 50 feet before Asid waddling, and a man's legs can not afford and can be defeated and beaten with him, a woman killing a javelin 30 mb rabbit A woman has been shot dead with an obvious number of bullets, A snow peak holds a person's foot and holds a glue, Radam and more bizarre collection of events. Generally, if you sleep on a Saturday, avoid the film as a plague, for the purpose of watching the worst of Seascape Channel's original films. Or when my friend read on my shoulder saying: "This is the best film I have seen." The friend on my right is saying: "Only war techno music is good."
