Anyone who read my review for Uwe Boll's "Alone in the Dark" will have to remember that I compared each other's unenviable work of sitting by that piece of human waste that has every hair on your arm. Well, this contraction is a step closer to the gutter garbage and try to imagine the pain of your teeth without Novakin. Do this and you have a simple idea about what Eli Roth's "cabin fever" is. <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> If you look at the Uwe Boll, it's the most terrible film ever made. But, in all honesty, I have to say that the "cabin fever" comes too close. The film which has no valid reason to meet any form in the theatrical release requires another mourning. As for Eli Roth, he has created the most annoying and convoluted pieces of a film that I'd never seen in my entire life. How do you make up this story? This storyline is without bad writing, without bad writing, and without that unwanted and intrusive comedy. A film dealing with a grotesque meat-eating virus should be better than the rat out for us here. This script has failed me with too many levels. <br /> <br /> Although I do not doubt the obvious talent of this director, I know he has reduced the ball a lot in thinking of correctly redefining the horror style. Production of missing opportunities can actually be a gross game on words. Even a generous amount of blood and bloodless special effects has not been saved, and I usually go. There is nothing really about "cabin fever", I can easily recommend to anyone. When half the way out of the theater, you know that the third of the movie will sink. My best advice to those who read this is just renting before purchase. One view is enough for me to know that I am feeling again and again.
