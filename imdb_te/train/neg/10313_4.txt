This film is hard to get hold of, and I finally feel it is upset and disappointed. One of the great stories of the twentieth century: the unknown person uses the failed airline industry and receives millions of ransom without hurting or hitting anyone. With all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a faint, full-fledged movie of this true life event. While Williams was always interesting, the authors thought D.B. Cooper's personality was heroic to wear as an actor, what we get is a type-get-enough and insufficient insight into any man's mind or insight into the mind of a person who is daring to pull off. Harrold practically steals the film with her pluck and pure beauty, but in real delusional plot and dull direction management. Even the film is already disgraced.
