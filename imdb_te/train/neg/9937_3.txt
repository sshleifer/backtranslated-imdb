Originally, it was a long time film, which was not centered on the proof of the left repo political revolution. When someone tells me that honestly, the only true revolutionary way to be intellectual (it's very nonsensical because the answer is obviously clever) It has reduced me to despair; If we are back as all that monkeys in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellect is one of many human features, but it does not mean that we should be as high as possible. But it meets this academic message with the use of Goddard's rock music; That's why the Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> This song is a 'devil for sympathy', whose creations we witness, from which the film takes its name, nothing special. Led Zeppelin's 'Thankeo' (Led Zeppelin II), which is particularly true but the chord sequence has been used for good effect. Besides, 'Sir' mock Jagger pretends to be his most vague way (not as Bob Dylan) - note how the first melodic phrase repeatedly repeats. <br /> <br /> Black Panthers painted in the film do not seem to have learned about what they are struggling, with the most interesting scenes being feminist equilibrium; <br /> The reality is that the 1960s and today's sexually liberated (a message that actually believes in the behavior of Rolling Stones) was released on DVD Sunday Times! For a real depth of sympathy for the left wing sympathy, listen to 'Al Gran Soli Kariko' Amor of Luigi Nano's masterpiece.
