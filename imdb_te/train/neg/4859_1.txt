He made 34 films between 1985 and 2000. When you come to filmmaking, I admire the director tad sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if there is anything to go through with his zombie blood bat trilogy, they are probably all garbage (and a quick look on their IMDB ratings will verify my hunch). <br /> <br /> Part 3 is the lowest detection of detention after the students escape from the high-profile army directly in their school and attacked by dead living groups. Director Sheets from a terrible script by Brian Ecclund (a heavily dependent on F-Bomb's liberal use) is another frustrating naive attempt to have some mind-bearing horror performances from its non-talented cast, horrific visual effects (some worst CGI) <br /> <br /> Finally, after the perpetual irony, looking for their lives Running the characters, and the animals do not like innardrasku people after the death of an immortal, zombie Armageddon, the end of the time-travel / paradox twist is terminated, it will force the audience to see the film again a couple of minutes from the beginning, as many of the paintings. Honestly ... once is enough, Mr. Sheets? What do we need to look for again?
