Actually, it is not near. This is a very accurate copy of something new to the story. But directing is very weak. Bashinger is weak - without good direction. The second league compared to Baldwin McQueen. I saw it with curiosity, I saw Pekingpai's masterpiece as a huge fan and I thought. The latter rate is almost a B film with acting and directing. I'm not even disappointed, I do not know what they're trying to do. <br /> <br /> This remake does not attempt to play with the original thing, it is not a tribute, in fact there is some good actor of its era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a copy of the gigabytes of the stunning photograph of the stunning photograph. This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again :)))
