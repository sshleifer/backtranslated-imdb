About 15 minutes old, my wife wanted to go out already. That's because of the material, but the lack of it. They decided to fill the fields where the funny thing is with language too and they should be located with absolutely indecent talk as they could. When it's (rarely) left, we want to sit back and watch (not laugh, you do not think) and wait for the next macro-out or offensive comment (s). After 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we read said how great it is. The trailer is good and Roger Ebert called it "brilliant" and stated that it was not a raw sex comedy. Went to the right movie? Besides Cool, this is the only film I went out for ... I do not regret it. I'm sick of trying to see comedy in America.
