Poor Upei Goldberg. Imagine her at her friend's dinner, and add her a comment for a deep political debate. People looked at her and said, "Oh, you know, the star of Theodore Rex". How can she get rid of someone after she is cutting herself as the worst star of this abusive star? Even small children will be cringing in horror at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters'. In fact, thinking about it, 'Sigmund' is superior to it. <br /> How is it made? By telling the producer an illegal substance before telling about it? Look at this bizarre abomination in your own danger.
