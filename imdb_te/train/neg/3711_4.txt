When I did not watch a movie trailer, I saw the film, instead of my judgments on my friends' opinions. Now I love Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie is flat on its face. <br /> <br /> Rock offers a couple of funny jokes during the rack, but unfortunately this film is very funny. The film connects both laughter and love, and attempts to make it fail. The romance story in this movie is straight forward (luckily), but the rock from this film is strong and condemning too much by bland. After all, the film is the first and comedy comedy where laughter needs basic importance. Not much of this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also very interesting. Some parts are extinct altogether. That means that the cast support is funny, they certainly do not have a good job. The couple of angels tried to make a couple jokes from heaven, which was dry and dull. The underlying lights of the first incarnation of rock are also bland. If they were somewhere in the right place, however, they looked ridiculous by comparing rock.
