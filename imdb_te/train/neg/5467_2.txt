What to say about this movie? It is well known about some good drugs with good drugs and convicts who sell bad drugs to the public. Being a poisonous process, two of them have adverse effects and his girlfriend throws some of the creatures growing in the school's basement. It was all there and they went down on it for 84 minutes. This image is too bad and should be locked forever. Even if it is not correct, some of the Troma's movies and what they want can be seen. Although I have Troma movies, there are the worst films. I was curious about the disease.
