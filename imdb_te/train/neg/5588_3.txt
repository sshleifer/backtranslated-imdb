It was an attempt by two author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers in Abrhaine "Tarzan of the Apes". But this desert-set film does not feature any feat in the successful forest adventure of Burroughs. Praise is the love between the famous English Nobel Zone Hall ("El 'Lion" chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke ("Princess" Yulialah) who is revenge to merge with speech. Although the early states, abducting behavioral criminals, the child's mother lived - but she never entered the film. <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. MacCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
