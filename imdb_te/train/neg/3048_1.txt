Santa Claus's craziest appearance is always committed to any medium, whether it's a book, an image or an image. Santa looks like a perv looking kids and twisted story to bring Merlin to help him defeat one of the satanic followers, one of the satanic, there is not any good things. It's ridiculous to say at least 1959 standards and bad influences. If a kid watch this film, he has nightmares and never to visit Santa. They are spots for life. Imagine a kid in the "Christmas story" when they start screaming after being placed in Santa's lap. Kid looks at this movie and how it changes.
