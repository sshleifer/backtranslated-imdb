Well, with endless quest for horror, we come across this film, apparently re-released in the recent DVD for some ungodly reason. The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. <br /> <br /> I do not think this film is going to be low. <br /> <br /> With no budget that is wasted inexpensive beer, no talent hacks, "slaughter hikes" start slowly and pays the pace up to an hour. First, we know that he is a 't even know what they're supposed to be like ... by a group ... jocks? He has to act as a leader with his ultra hooks. Then, it is not a 'big man' and dumb losses and chicks should be 'hot'. Why is this group refusing to pick one of them why it's a secret, but I guess the viewer is anticipated, choosing these 'cool kids' in a device. The choice of actors is terrifying because most of the highlights are played by thirty-somethings. Here are some of the actors (known as, if you can call them) a group of brits, whose tunes slip many times across this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> The killer rabbit is not great, and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; Lines like: 'This place gives me creeps ...' and 'someone else is a gimme beer' highlights ... It's just not good. If you do not wast some friends and leave this skip until you slap a real sluggish effort at a slazer. If you want to see better, I've done Bauva's "Bay of Blood" 14 years ago and it's great. If you want to see good bad slasher, see "Just Before Dawn" or "Burning." 10 to 2, children.
