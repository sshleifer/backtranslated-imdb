<br /> <br /> In the preface to this review, I think it's interesting to me about the film. However, I did not see my hand slightly distorted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, how little is the man. In my view, the worst thing about this whole Springer phenomenon is that they do not have the same kind of people in the "Jerry Springer Show" (which is itself accursed), but many people are very interesting and enthusiastic and listen to their lives (yes, Suppose it is true). <br /> We behave this way of behavior (as some say) or corrupt our minds or / or violate this kind of behavior. <br /> Suffice soap box (sort of). Here's Skinny: The film has an R rating, and it's a bit more appropriate than the enormous sexual content I've had (if I'm away in a few scenes, I'm not fully aware), and I'm an NC-17 (other critic of the cap) Commenting that sex is just a big excuse to show). The plot is very nasty, combining the stories of a fully-functioning family and a group of disturbed blacks that appear in different Springer programs. In the end, the film is about a solution to the need to look at a real world (which seems to be seen in his program) - and Springer leaves the rhetoric. I agree with him - it's important to know that it really seeks to influence the world's really positive change. Let me tell you - in a new newspaper or news with a pretty bad view of the world, but we do not pay good money to support the sensitive and perhaps formal titles, Springer wants us to give.
