That is amazing! Fidani (he is also a self-confident) is the cheapest director in the world. This film stole Leone's original title "Duck You Peaker!" But tell the pinker story of the Pinkterton agent against the killer "Testsa de Ferro" (improbable Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). This explosion shot in Lazio's beloved landscapes is poor and silly. The story is evil and crazy at the same time. At the same time, Fidani is not possible. There was some kind of crazy controversy in the story (talks at the Sheriff's house and the duties of Butch Cassidy!)! Yes, really like the Budch Cassidy, idiot). In the story of Italian television, Renzo Arbor, one of the most prized Anchorman is the creation of enormous contourments, unfair plot, bad acting and faux. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes great and terrible, but I'm sure it's the only money for playing with iron horses) 10 of 2 But ... do not miss it !!!!!
