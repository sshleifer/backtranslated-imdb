Have I ever congratulated this trash of the sequel? It is to throw all the balls! Not all the worst, it does not even compare the first installment of the series! The comedy is not funny. Where did all unexpectedly laugh? Enough slapstick on-the-field action is too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this from a full nine-innings shutout. What's next, main league 4: returning to the Little League? Ehh, maybe! Leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to all the star game. This person has three attacks.
