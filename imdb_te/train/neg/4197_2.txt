The Dutch soap actress did not attend her English classes) plays the great girl Freya, who is a 'thrill-seeking' habit. It primarily performs dangerous stunts, breaks down and annoy people. And not in a fun jacuzzo way. Then there is Draco (Rivas). He has run the glue but there are other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer) who also plays a dubious role. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone seems to be involved, but we really do not care for the viewer, this cast is likable or believable, and the story does not make any sense. <br /> Why is it also done? 2/10.
