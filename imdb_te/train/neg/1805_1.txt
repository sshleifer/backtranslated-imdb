This film is definitely one of its product and in any other case, it's a stupid stupid image. Heck, even seeing its proper case, it's too bad !! For many, this is a very insane story and the Italian director Michaeline Angelo Antonioni has a very self-made intention. In this case, he tried to portray a lot of artworks with a fictitious hippie film and was successful only in producing large numbers of bombs. <br /> <br /> The film sat around talking platitudes as the complaint begins about "the power of the students" and "man" with "it" too, where the film begins in a rap session. These hippies seemed a bit silly to complain too loudly for these special babies and to cry out the revolutionary jungle, as many parents thought they were sent to college. Shortly thereafter, violence between students and "establishment pigs" breaks out and a policeman is killed. Our "hero", Mark, may not be able to do it, but he'll have to run to prevent the prosecution. Instead of going to Mexico or Canada, he only makes a whole moron - steals an airplane and flies to the majestic desert! There, he meets a chic meet and they sit around philosophizing for hours. Then, they have sex with one of the weirder sex scenes in the history of cinema. When they are in the dirt, suddenly the other couples do not appear anywhere and there is a huge mood. When you look at a bit of skin (assuring an R-rating), this is not clear. In fact, it will last for a long time and it's just like minding buzzles. Moreover, when they are done, many people, many other couples disappear into the thin air. <br /> After that, the pair will paint the plane with the help of a couple and it looks like the creation of Peter Max. Despite the development of the aircraft's appearance, bad cops respond to his back plane by better revolutionary shooting. When the girl realizes, she goes into semi-catatonic state and ends with her predicting that her fascist pig's parents will destroy and destroy all the evils (such as hard work and responsibility) that they stand. Instead of a simple explosion, you will see that the same immaculate house is about 8 times exploding. Then, unpredictably, you'll see TVs, refrigerators and other things that are slowly exploding in motion. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>? The same preferred character as well as an extensive album. It's easy to get at least 15 minutes a bit faster - especially if there are not too many plots or dialogs. The bottom line is this very dumb picture and I'm not surprised to be listed in the book "The Fifty Worst Films" by Harry Medved. It is well worth this temple of garbage. Such a reputation is a crime to spend a lot of money to produce such a magnificent film! <br /> Two final observations. If you're smiling in silly hippie movies, try looking at the trial of Billi Jack. In addition, the mainstream, Mark Freakat, played his role in real life. He died at the age of 27 in prison a few years after "Revolution", in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent man. Dong hippies !!
