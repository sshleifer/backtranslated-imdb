It's not one of Arquale or Keaton's best movies, it's perfect. The son's wife is tired of her heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanitarium that a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed treatment! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and takes the surgery. Then, he is fleeing and he is chased about the place where he meets a beautiful girl who wants to escape. Finally, they chase the staff, they run away, Arubuki knows that the girl is silly, and Arbuckle is back soon. However, he is awake and everything after surgery is a dream - no sexy crazy girl and doctor. Keaton was not as inefficient as he seemed to dream. <br /> <br /> Humor with this movie is a big problem. Certainly, the mood of people suffering from mental illness is very low, but on that day it laughs promise. I like laughter even if something is funny to respond! <br /> <br /> In the FYI - Chase sequence, when fattening wonders as a species of men over 200 pounds (wow, what is that disadvantage?). And, shortly thereafter, he supports the number 5 just any freshly painted post. As a result, five is now behind the shirt of fat and he will be a regular participant. However, the number that appeared on the back of the fat's shirt, but in the front-lines - a mistake, a mirror image should be realized.
