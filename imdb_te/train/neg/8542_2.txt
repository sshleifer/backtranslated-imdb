I'm going to set up the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and The WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte de los Brujaz) as the 17th film. <br /> <br /> Hold on to my attention all this picture. The plot is incomplete. The dialog seems to be improved. Acting is weak. <br /> <br /> The best scenario was the start of the excitement that she burned her illegitimate daughter. However, this scene is only connected to the other side, the main character Mario with the most predominant whiskey. <br /> <br /> This film is not effective at any level. The music is very inappropriate. Lighting is very dark, so some scenes are completely black. It's really just watching - what can I say?
