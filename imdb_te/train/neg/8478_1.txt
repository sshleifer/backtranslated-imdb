This film is probably the biggest waste of my life. Acting is curious. Jordan Hinson did not show any frustration. At the beginning of the film, she should be discouraged. Instead, she lifted her head. She was filled with tears without a weeping tear. Out of all the girls I wanted to actresses, I was so angry that she got angry. Everyone has over-acting. It's annoying. It is also an insult to spot skaters. Jordan took one month, and they led her to make the Olympic team. It was practically spat out on realistic skaters who were put on their work. A pitiful consent for an image, and a pitiful attempt to hockey and skating affiliation. Do not waste your life. It is not even a star.
