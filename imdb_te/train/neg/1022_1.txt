Started with the poster (Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only starred) the whole movie fraud. The next one is a stereotype, this film is nothing - or anything new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you know that you paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J's another way out of their film. <br /> <br /> In general, the corrupt system in the story is the city, all frank business and secretly support in town, in the eyes of some heat-shot politicians. The Supreme Ombudsman and the above legislation are called FRAT and what is expected? They shot and kicked a kick-ass dome cop - and suspects, friends, you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that were discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything is happy and we will serve the final: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see these waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey are only 10 minutes!
