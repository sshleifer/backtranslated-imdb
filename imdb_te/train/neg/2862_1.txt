Anyone needs to send this Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Did he ever know how to do a movie? Can everybody just make movies these days? In the past, it is always necessary to start a movie before anyone can do it. After seeing this sluggish BTK film and the others he made, it is clear that the poor guy is very business about making films as I do. In fact I think I can do better films than Uli LAME-ALL. Unlike the names and the killer of the victims, the film did not complete with the BTK killer. That's it. Where did the big idea that BTK mice and killed all other unsatisfactory worst people in the film? This is an excellent example of trying to attract people to look at their imagery because of the term "BTK". Absolutely pitiful. I acted in a serial killer movie. I smoked that kid many cigarettes. Whoever has to shoot.
