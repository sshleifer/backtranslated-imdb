It is the official sequel of '92 Science Fiction Action Thriller. In reality, Van Damme was restored to many dead Vietnam War vets by the perfect soldiers (Unisols). Since Van Dummie has a daughter about this age, I guess it's one dozen years later. Now Yuen has been working with the government to train the 2500 signature to train newest assays. As always, something went wrong: the on-site super-computer (known as Seth in the same year "King Cobra") goes power-crazy, taking the command of UniSol's new computer, a new super-humanoid body (Jai White). We see the next step in the evolution of them! Van Dummay's struggles are particularly remarkable, especially with Euenlow (Pro Wrestler Goldberg). Run him down with a truck - go to any! Bury him, shoot him - do not forget! Most humor von dummies can now see how outdoored and out-classed (he goes around the edges). But, even if he takes a spots, he will keep on kickin! The most sequels of this sort are genuine caste-tale mimics, and it is a strictly intellectual stroke, though you're a positive-wrestling fan, especially entertaining.
