This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the best part is Christian J. Molly's "Leonard" trying to do the jumping upward out of the bar, I wished to do on the DVD, looking at this shitty movie to get rid of it. It is good to wait to be good, Sean Austin "Andrew" (very nice in this role, is very bad in the film), Kaira Zedwige "Bevan" Ron Livingston "Chad", Renee Zellweger "The Poem" (they put his name on the cover, She will have 1 line and less 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If there is any respect to the cast, they will go out and buy all copies of this image And author / George Hickenlooper and writer John Enbom
