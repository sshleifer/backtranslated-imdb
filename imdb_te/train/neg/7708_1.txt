The only item of this film from protecting my favorite favorite piece of celluloid is the single agent who tries to infiltrate man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato dress: "Can someone pass ketchup?" I requested someone with sleep disorder to use this film as a relief. It works better than a high dose of demarol.
