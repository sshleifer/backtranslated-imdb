It's the worst movie I have ever seen at the World Fest and it has received acclaim afterwards! I get such recognition based on the number of actors who are known in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only a few minutes in the movie. A better actress than the allowed episode for M.Parker. The rest of the acting is difficult to judge because the film is very ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore has a bore to watch. This story does not have a real emotional depth. A film that is about to work with an unmanned actor is not very real to me. Or the development of the police. One of the simplest videos I see in the 90s is that ... it's not even good at those standards.
