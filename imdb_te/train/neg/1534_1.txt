The key that pretends to be the key to digitally shot footage is "I plan to do so." The film looks like Reeves Oscar winner (not intended for pun). The greatest thing about it is the box of ERATicate in the Second Segment (which is strong in terms of the heroine and twist in three stories). Wish I'd like to spend it Â£ 399, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Director's cut. If you buy it, you're really upset with disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid the plague. If you see something with inhuman and actors with more than 2x4 woods, go ahead. But if you want some quality wavelolf action, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romandanta: The Towolf Hunt.
