This move is bad when they come. I'm forced to give it a 2 for the scene. In the most breathtaking places in the US there are many great shots of the southwest including many of the Monument Valley. It's also, one of the most crowded, starting with John Ford. In fact, a scene with Chris and the girl was filmed in a spot called John Ford Point.
