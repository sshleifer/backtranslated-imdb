Well, basically, the film is blowing! Blair Witch's concept of Sean Penn's misconception about how to show the world about the "war on terror" The script sounds like it's written in the 8th grader (no offense of 8th graders); The two main actors starred in the film; They used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (I did not know anything about those things - but I did not look like real documentaries I saw), and all Christian Johnson took the worst idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time my dog ​​tried to draw a picture and ended up with a really bad stick figure that looked like a big beard. I'll see Blair Witch VIII again, than sit back again.
