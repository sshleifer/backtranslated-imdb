I rarely comment on movies but I have read other comments and I can not believe that people are killing this celluloid. I know they have their own agenda but have been able to take some merit; It was poorly portrayed, badly portrayed, and the story is thought to be the director doing him as he goes along. I do not focus on filmmakers' sexual content of young children because they know what they wanted and their audience. I can say that it's a terrible movie, content bad and objectionable, product irrelevant and I can not legally make this movie today
