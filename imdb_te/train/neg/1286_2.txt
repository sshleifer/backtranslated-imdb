How do you make a Scotman love in town in the bathroom? I have a distinct advantage for many critics who were born in Scotland. Many Americans take this simple nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four legs are good - two legs bad", Orwell has it. Jessica Lange has a voice that denies the production of the Welles - next - the Amateur Dramatic Society of "Brigadon". Liam Neeson - is well known for ladies - at Edinburgh Waverly's Great Grandmother once on the train. And the Eld Enemy? From where do Scots come to hunt and blame everyone? Messrs Roth, Cox and Hurt must be ashamed to sink in such a racist manner. A masterpiece of historic accuracy is compared to "Robin Hood - Prince of the Pirates". And at least Alan Rickman is funny.
