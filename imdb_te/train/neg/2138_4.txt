War, Inc. - Corporations take the future war and use a single murderer Brand Houser (John Cusack) to do their wet work on rival CEOs. A dark comedy portrayed the military and corporations sarcastically. This is very difficult to figure out exactly what is going on. I'm waiting for things to make sense. <br /> <br /> It is considered by Cusack to be the "spiritual heir" to Gussey Point Blanc. That is, the war is more or less hit. We want to kill Cusack again as a killer with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack is reluctant to half a dozen people unreliable. Short fights are good. There is no other film. It's all about the weird edge. War Inc. is not funny to be a ridiculous, and I think anyone can think of the message of the movie, which is considered corporates and heartfelt ways of wars. How they affect average citizens. It is not funny because it is interesting, but does not work on irony, and at its heart is the picture heart. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a good performance. His role is to shots the shots of the hot sauce and drive the private aircraft to Tinist but it is intended to replace the character of the quirks. Malisa Tomo is slipping into a romantic headliner. There really is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian pronunciation and does not make her a fool. Jon Cusack just screams and pimples and sleeps. Blech. Ben Kingsley will return to the Oscars if he does not start doling out a good show again and again. <br /> It's not a horrible film, but in the end you're the "battle, what's the good?" Absolutely nothing. C
