The rural family drama - perhaps "ordinary people" is acceptable - a young boy has left his elder brother with anxiety disappear after a shooting accident. Despite the down beet (relentless glam treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics that explore this tragic story. Unfortunately, the film's lack of adult characters to take charge of the discrete agricultural climate and situation gave the film a stutifying experience. With the cast of Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brilli, the film is a small-scale reunion of "The Natural". This project did not take the necessary talent behind the camera, and really took a stubborn and memorable picture. **** from * 1/2
