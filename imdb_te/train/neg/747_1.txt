Finally I'm H.G. I thought I was going to do justice to Wells Classic, not another version of the correct language or age, but the book was based. <br /> It is only 180 min (yes 3 hours) long and only 150 pages. <br /> If Timothy Hines comes to the nerves here and says, "If you could do anything ..." I said, "Yes, I think" and I never used a video camera or play school in any kind or my life. <br /> <br /> I have paid a lot of money to get this rubbish from the USA to the UK, do not make that mistake.
