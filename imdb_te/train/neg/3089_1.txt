This movie is very bad, it's funny. In fact, the television show, Mystery Science Theater 3000, watching three characters and performing ludicrous movies, has been used quite simply. <br /> If you are not ready to stop at the first scene, do not watch the hogoblins. Actually, this movie does not look as long. Please. At least not bad. Its jokes are not funny (at least to say), and you'll find it fun or funny when you see the movie. <br /> Get rid of yourself. Read the book. Make laundry. Any haggoblins are more fun than watching.
