As the others say, the film is discouragingly discouraging for the mindless or masochists. <br /> <br /> After seeing Tripsport and Acid House as one of the most daunting places in Scotland in the first world we know. But such humor or gritty realism does not work without movies like railroad and acid house. And more importantly a film does not work without a good script and there is nothing new, inspiring or inspiring idea about the script for this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film has won two shows of Bafta is not bad for the British film industry. <br /> <br /> This movie is not very bad, it's not easy to rent for a week or so. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and give this image a wide berth.
