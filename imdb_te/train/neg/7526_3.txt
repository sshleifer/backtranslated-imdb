B film Kung Fu Flix's high-grade cheese charge. Bruce "Wannabe" Lee Bruce Lee is playing ... I think. Of course, let's look at Bruce's quick clips and look at the short-sightings of his eyes and look like Bruce if you quit at the right angle for some time during the winter time. You'll laugh in awe of how the image splicing is not very good, but some cool removed scenes from the dragon are thrown in the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed and killed when he was hanging from a helicopter. Bruce's brother (Bruce's gestures and fighting styles - most fraudulently) may have been Bruce's brother, although they believe Bruce Lee can be forgiven to try Bruce. See Bruce go on top with a shy lion. The ke-based section is deprecated, you will see. Bruce also mistakenly recognized that a person who had lost a handicap was severely damaging. In the end, the scenario was shown just 3 minutes ago by the director "Threatened by the Sun"! They thought that only one creature with a disadvantage disorder could understand the film. <br /> <br />
