Most of the French movies I've seen - and experienced - have more talk than action, but it's okay. I found them with interesting, more photographer and secret actors. <br /> <br /> If Gerald Depardieo is in every French film, I'm surprised! <br /> <br /> There are similar interesting visuals in the film. But it's debate, debate and more ... it's for a play but not for murder mystery. <br /> Actually, this movie has played almost all scenes in one room. So, if you love dramas, you should like it ... but want a little more bang for the murder story.
