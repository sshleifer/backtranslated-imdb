If you come on Tina Fay you can do this better then. I know how I finished the film as soon as the film starts. It is definitely funny at times. Funny out loud even loud. But this movie is not smiling enough to save. I do not recommend buying this. Most of the time I recommend renting, but it's everything. Baby Mama has some funny scenes but tries to make it imaginable and heart-shaking. <br /> <br /> Tina Fay and Amy Poller have made a good team. One of your favorite movies is the Mean Girls. Tina Fay and Amy Poler have done well and they are doing well in this regard. But this is not the best. Baby Mama has a great supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Don Cooke, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin included the richness of prints. <br /> <br /> Another pregnant film hit the world of cinema. After great knock up and juno, baby mama is much more average compared to that. Knocked Up and Juno are the happiest, heartfelt and conclusions that leave you with the smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama is not the best comedy of the year, it has not tried. I do recommend that I recommend but not completely hilarious. It tries to mean the average comedy that is not very emotional. I give baby mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
