Here my complaints are concerned about the pace of the film and the thing in hand. The image gives a fresh and interesting perspective when using old image and letters, and the selected material to highlight is not very interesting (when Goebbels complains about this or that disease, or Tc. Little German homeland). In addition, the film c. Steams by 1920-1939 and later years of war. Overall, filmmaker has little more sensibility than the film history channel documentary editor, so life details of Goebbels can be more artifact. However, I wish.
