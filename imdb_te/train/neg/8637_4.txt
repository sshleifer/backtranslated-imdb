A mystery film threw up with some inappropriate horror elements; <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman with a nightmare when her sex partner comes out of bed, she goes to a crying boy and kills him. She will wake up. The man dies in the hospital and spits the blood. His breakaway daughter arrives, and she deals with her to contact her through her dreams (I think), and she wants to recognize those who killed him before her body is completely broken up in her grave. <br /> For those who have done much, or about how much; It was discovered long before many audiences revealed it. <br /> <br /> The horrors are caused by the horror: the Goths autopsy, the killer of the boy, the recurring nightmare, a nightmare <br /> <br /> The eggs combine a tile to the eyes, then cut the moves and the many shots of the damaged person nightmares And indeed in his grave. <br /> I'm dedicated to the end of the fun Clive Barker! Interesting.
