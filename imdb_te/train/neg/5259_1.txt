After I finished watching the film, I wasted 2 hours in my life. It will never come back for 2 hours. The Hague. "Wow this is good!" But the first impression does not mean anything. I'm so excited about this film until the dumbest end I've ever seen. The film is just curious. Acting is murky, the storyline is original but the original and it's not necessarily anything, it's not a bad movie! Do not see this movie !!! Warning !! If you have spent 2 hours in your life anytime you have a dumbbell movie? 1/10
