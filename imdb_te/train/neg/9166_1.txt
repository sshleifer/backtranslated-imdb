Rachel is a good word for describing this movie. <br /> <br /> Every point of sale is a point of sale, a gimmick. Transformers' gimmick fantastic effects as well as fans' boys' memories. Sleeps in Seattle's gymmic have a condition in their tag-line, "No one has ever seen anyone meeting you, no one knows someone else for you. Most romance is heavily dependent on these maneuvers and some big names are drawn. Leap Years employed both Irish folklore and employed both the most popular names in the country. <br /> <br /> Now all the audience is in the movie, characters, conflicts, consequences, crisis, settlement and proof, they also leap years, interesting sub-plot and perhaps, sometime, good mid-turn or in the middle <br /> Jean Eo is trying not to win. If they try, their goal is clearly visible at the other court, at the other stadium, at the other end of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Leighr, failed to provide a completely inspiring dialogue. Many lines are compiled. Looks like she's in a bag full of lines that she wants to use in her movie: "Well, I've read or read books from movies I've read or read books or quotes and they'd make a good sound to the viewers if they liked me well.That's why I do all that I have to do If I mix, I have them all Payogincukonu. "As a result, there is hate. I can not say that the lines are not unnecessary and may not be in the story or plot, but they seem to come out of nowhere, just to keep you with quotation quotes. On the individual level, people who cite quotes based on most of our conversations are aware. <br /> <br /> Second, the characters are silly and one dimensional. They do not believe in the exclusion of their inspiration (required to run the plot) with an exceptional dialogue. They have no idea who they are. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to drive the story because the gimmick in leap years is very bad. Then again, there are fewer movies but it did better than this. They make it with my first and second point. Moreover, sub-plot is incompatible (it's not bad for movies) and thin (bad stuff). <br /> <br /> Jeanio and producers are terrifying places with fancy locations acceptable photography. They probably understood that some viewers could be more likely to be approved than others by using cinematography, soundtrack and filming space. <br /> <br /> It is not good that this movie is very good. It's just bad. Do not see it.
