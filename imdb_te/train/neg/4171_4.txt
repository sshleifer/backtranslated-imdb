I saw this title 15 or 20 times in the blockbuster, and I'm looking for half that's fine to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> *** Spearlings AHED *** Misfit staff ******************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ******* Vampire hunters (including a vampire ... go figure) tried to wipe out all the vampires found in the mining colony from the mining colony. The band members are: a disgusting, nevere-do-well-captain (dead man who died), his book-experience, the first mate, the above Vampire Vampire Hunter (not a typo), a dark cowboy and really, really Butch Asia Commando, Tough guy "male ... it's almost like the cast for MTV's 'Real World'. After the killing of the captain, mock-blood suckers (and it turns out, lovers of the good parts of parts of the human body) hates everyone over his first mate Blah, Blah, Blah ... Blah, Blah, Blah ... I have gone, but this is the same storyline that used in more than a hundred other films. <br /> These effects cheese and why Michael Ironside is beyond me in this film. <br /> <br /> Vampire vampire hunter (still not typo) is pretty hot, but if you look forward to her exposure, look in the other places. <br /> I can not tell if I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but wait for the science fiction channel to come on.
