Muscle man-monkey in African forests is hunted by an opportunistic tour group; The lovely daughter of the team's leader finds him first. The most-Bollywood version of Tarzan's story has the production, but it has disabled people with the simultaneous dirty directing of the movie I have ever seen. John Derek Cheesy slows down the slow movements of action shots and wife Boe Derek's clothing body beyond the peek-a-boo glimpses; He's very talented behind the camera like Ed Wood. Trying to get cheek sexuality in the tongue, Dorx does not have the finesse, time and time. They are a sense of self-parody and bravura abdication (they throw winds warning), but after a good start it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keefe (who has the clock in his mouth all the time) has a title role, but plays the third cinematography for John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's self-importance. * ** from
