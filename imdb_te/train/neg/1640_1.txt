This film ... everything: story, acting, surprise, ingenuity and spirit. At fifteen minutes, I said at the screen, "How can these guys stay together and treat themselves as friends?" For another fifteen minutes, I pray for Amanda Peet as much as possible. When a bad image quietly rears the ugly head, the eye candy is a nice consolation. But that's not too much! Cheat in all fields!
