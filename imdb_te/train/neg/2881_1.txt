The film was very ridiculous, and I really did not finish watching, and I thought someone had done their own version and dubbed it from the movie store on DVD. This film made me ill because it was not puzzled, but because I lost 2 50 !!!! It looks like my brother and I went into the house and made the film ourselves and earned the slogan footage! I'm also ticked, BTK Killer deserves more credit than it is not even accurate I come on the cow's head and clearly make out the game flour or bubble gum OMG I can not even get all the words to describe it Do not look at this movie !!!!!!!
