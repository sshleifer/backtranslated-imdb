So far nightmares and dreamscapes are inaccurate and disappointing. <br /> <br /> The first division, directed by Brian Henson, is a well-directed, enthusiastic, and, interestingly, performance by William Hurt, although it is a well-directed, less enthusiastic, The story is not just a good way. The screenplay is bad, desperate, obsolete leaders needing to move the plot undoubtedly, and the characters are clunky, unnecessarily raising for unnecessary exposure purposes. This performance was not exaggerated and unbelievable, and secondly I thought it was more emotional for the cold-blooded killer in the first story than the newly arrived couple. The director uses one million tricks to produce a striking spooky, but with an amateur acting and writing, the final result appears as the freshman-year film school project, the camera moves on for them and the plots <br /> If the rest of the series continues, I will seriously break. I'm William H. I'm looking forward to Mackie's fate, and I hope he is a good director and story writer for his department. Thus far the quality is very unstable to predict.
