Billy Crystal is the co-producer, co-producer and stars of this highly safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and elderly. Billy plays a heart attack with a heart attack (Hey Heck), whom he loves his beloved father (Alan King), who is a big actor. This script will try their best in a flat, crystal and king ready for sub-neil Simon nonsense, one-liner gallery, Henry Winkler (difficult in sitcom mode), and family-controversial, but over the top of the King's interest and often over. Jabeth Williams was one of his ungrateful roles, but brought his natural, down-home class to a friend of a proverb. It's a joke, I guess, but with tears moving back with tears ... insult. ** from **
