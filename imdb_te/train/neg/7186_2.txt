I am sorry for all fans, but this is a useless film. Acting is bad, even with wood, which initially breathes the Bhayapet-Factor and does not work properly. I think it was supposed to be a twist at the end, but it ended up just maddeningly confusing. What hell? Who killed the killer of everyone else? <br /> <br /> Its original is unequal, and it is not good to be a slave directly. <br /> <br /> If someone in a party does it, the disc is thrown out of the window, like the Silence of the Lambs or The Shining Put a good horror film.
