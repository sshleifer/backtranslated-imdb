I find this wondering what people have seen it that I've given it to a 10 I have not. The movie is very hard and / or is in a platform. If anyone is ridiculous, it will not be deceived, it's 98% odd-drama and 2% comedy. Not all actors can deny the great performance, it looks like something really lost somewhere. The original script does not know whether it's good, what to edit or do. There is a probability, instead it is really a flop. I like to have half an hour in this film and I like half the investment, but the video rental space did not come back. Save your money and see someone else.
