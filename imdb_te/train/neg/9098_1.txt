Why do some movies directly go to the video and the obvious reason is that the theater viewers have to release the video directly if it is too short. In fact, although it is good, they are not really suitable for movies released directly to the video. Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne is good or at least a good agent, and Sarah Thompson's characters are entitled Teen Melodramas, which are not exempt from the film but at least the actors have the probability. The film is also incorrect: the film takes place prior to Cruel Intensions, so the film is actually prequel and stupid. This is a film that is similar to coding and soft core pornography and pay-per-view handicraft films. Fortunately the actors, hopefully they can remove this from their resume. You're just looking to see a bit, but do not have the courage to buy it. Then rent the movie as a starter.
