This is one of the horrible, sexy B-movies, which can not play anywhere near the theater. Most women are worn in "bunny" costumes, and a very fat woman has the most intense jokes, and they are working in a bad old restaurant, who wants to get the man "obedient" to the Odiban son (Jim Hanks, Tom's brother). Hanks is actually kind of good, but this movie goes somewhere and there is no point. Why do you need to know why this is also made? However, because of Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but more than a few), it has received a stellar "2" from 10. I think nice though, I think.
