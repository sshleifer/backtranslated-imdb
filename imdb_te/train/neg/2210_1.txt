This is a very funny picture. <br /> <br /> Everything is so serious in this movie. I mean I would come on a shark head on a human body. It can take no harm. Good job is science fiction comedy films. I never get the movies anymore retarded. If they continue to do so they need to rename the science fiction channel as a comedy science fiction channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can not take the next blockbuster film 4 from Science Philo. <br /> I'm ready with popcorn's bowl and beer case or alcohol bottle and I'm ready to laugh again !!!
