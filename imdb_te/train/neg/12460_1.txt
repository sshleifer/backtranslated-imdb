George Clooney's role is where we have gathered his finger-nails. We're not upset - sitting in this clock hour and we know what we think. To say that the film is incomprehensible, boring, solemn hate it will be over-appreciated! How many people can sit in the corners of the film's chaotic, slow, discouraged duplicate and choose it only for an Oscar? Clooney is sick as we see him. What is he thinking? Oh .. and what's with those subtitles? - We just have a bad DVD or is the original image like that - leaving hanging in the air between the sentences? Without this film, the film is very difficult. I'm in accordance with the cast and made it clear with the available items.
