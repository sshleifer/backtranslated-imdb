I can not understand all the hype about this film. Well, if you like cheap publish, you love this movie, but if you want good stories and good actors - do not look at it. Personally, I really did not like actors in the film, they rented directly from the street. Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. The overall quality of the film is not much of a budget. When we watch this movie (me and 3 people) we all have a mind to make this effort to get their graduation in film school, making this film - with a little effort. The other problem that really reduces the overall experience is bad cam (very shaking) and bad sound, the whole film is restored with a microphone.
