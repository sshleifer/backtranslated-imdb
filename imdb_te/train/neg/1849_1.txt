I think I may be a diamond in the move, but what I found is just a bad writing and horrific direction (although not a shot of the scenes), going on, it's very uninteresting and immature) this album can be done with 2 VCRs and stock low budget video. I would say that it's not even something like a small digital video. <br /> <br /> There are a few simple ways to solve the movie with the director. Hamm Sandwiches is making a lot of efforts for this film. It may be good, but that means extra work.
