I thought they were friend cops for Gary Bassie and Fred Williamson. If they were in the bunny opening scene, then the movie would not be shown again for 40 minutes. Though he is amazing in every scene. <br /> When he's disguised as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> The amazing story about this film. Fred Williamson is trying to find out who hunts and kills the phone sex operators. At one point I think its Bassie. But I'm partially right. The bus was not a killer, but he was harassing women by phone. Why? I do not know. In what way he is connected to the killer, which he does for kicks he is expecting.
