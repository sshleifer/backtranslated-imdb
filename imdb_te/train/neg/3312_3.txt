... but I'm sorry for watching. The IMDb ratings are very high (and they're also very high in Netflix), I've put it in my queue because it's a delicate comedy from the UK, a category that has produced many of the images I love. On the other hand, "Saving Grace" comes in the laughter-less comedy category by Hollywood films that show and direct. Brenda Blethin is a powerful actress, and I liked her in other films. The feeling - a gardener who can overcome the drought knowing confronts after the death of her husband is growing marijuana - do not blame me. Though serious efforts are being made on the part of the cast to produce humor, the film is flat on my face (going to be flat on my groove) as long as I and my wife are concerned. Beforehand, oh sensitive reader, all offbeat British comedies are unsuccessful. This is a bad thing.
