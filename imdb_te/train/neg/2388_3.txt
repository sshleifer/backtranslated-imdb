Nobody should ever try to get the screen in the Tom Robins book. While the film is good and the performances are good, the most well-known dialogue is worse when speaking. Or, in other words, no one's name seems to have been written in a pearl radium. Overall, the notes of the badly-acclaimed Cliffs book - parts are hacked by a fifth volume of bookstore and current stories, and the end of the book (without discretion) has ended. Most plots get lost in the end of the book, making everything all right, and there is more than one reference to what the viewer says is "huh". A valuable attempt, unfortunately - the script should be read, compared to the book, ash, and all the actors sent off something very nice. I was impressed by Gus van Sant, but I could not make a good book of a complicated book without his talented person making a small book.
