<br /> <br /> I am very proud of the book written by Robin Klein, so I'm very happy when I hear that the book is based on the making. <br /> <br /> When I saw it I was deeply disappointed in the film. <br /> <br /> I loved this book - the most ridiculous Erica and the interesting way she sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I was the same as I expected in the book. So, I went along for the ride. It's not all bad, I guess. Miss Belmont is different from what I thought of her! <br /> <br /> It was on his own, I thought I did a good film and actors / actresses in it - she thinks she has one to drink and drink the smoke - Jean Kitson, who plays her, but alas, I feel helpless to help but feel Not a fan of the book (one of my all time favorite books) = P
