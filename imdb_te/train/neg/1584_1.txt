I read Bachmann from the King's books and I thought for the main character John and his family. This image may be too high for SO. Why bother? It was set during the big action movie craze. I saw the movie and in pain during the whole thing. I did not feel anything for the character and less for his role. Yes it's funny scenes (or ridiculous), but I think this does not save the movie in my eyes. <br /> When you read the book you will feel the climax and fire in the heart of John, seeking his last revenge. <br /> <br /> I will give you a lower number. If I read the book it may not be less.
