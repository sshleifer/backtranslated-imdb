Steven Segel films go to the bottom of this barrel. Fodder for his best bored young men. These are the tips of a fragments, then drops. The letters are all on the cardboard. The story is double dull. I can not spoil it by ending it. If you already see someone you already know Steven Seagal's films will end. Here goes. Instead of killing him instead of killing his brain, they are a super-doper government agent who is far from getting bored. He escapes, and, of course, is through his old general who is arrested and needs a one-man experience his one-man experience to get back a stealth aircraft handed by a rogue Air Force pilot by a pilot, who is surprised, surprised, seagull training. All segments except Segar and his beloved girlfriend die as heroes, and Steve-Bib will save the entire world in a crackle, or fall aggressively. Whatever. Some surplus is made with Air Force and Navy Flying Film. And a lot of boom booms. Get some POPay cartoons instead.
