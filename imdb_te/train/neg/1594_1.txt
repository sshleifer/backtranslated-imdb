Wow. When I saw this film, I felt a punch of pants. <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. With the help of "Spirit of the Forest" ("Princess Mononoke"?), They will see a child named Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> Tom (Ash) and Haq (Sam) are exaggerated with nature, hippies, and some video hunter attempts to release Celebi ("Spirit") from the guy. I do not know yet. It's unclear. When Ash and his famous friends, Celebi (Celebi) looked at Sam Floet, he was surprised.) Then, after their return, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandfather. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded? If you love your children, you can not reveal them. (10 to 1)
