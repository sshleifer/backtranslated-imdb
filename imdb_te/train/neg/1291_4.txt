It is sad that I can make a long time in history so attractive and into a Ho-Hang event rich in the subject for the film. Wm C Quantrille is shown in the film very little, perhaps the most rare person of the period. Frank James never mentioned, Clay Yanger, Ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who cries for the sister he has been murdered in the script every time he goes into battle. Instead, we were forced to look at the fictional characters that we did not make for anyone we made. How sad it is. These dresses are wonderful while shooting in Missouri. I hope to make a film from Aime Lee, try again, or some filmmaker will consider the tremendous wealth of goods to write a play on the screen.
