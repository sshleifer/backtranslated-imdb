Easy to put: the image is boring. Clich√© on Clich has been confirmed and heroes do not come together. It is obvious if the director does not know whether or not to make a film or a documentary. The main theme is very thin (a CIA agent ordered to kill the oil prince, and then threatened the prince (why?)) And thus some features were added to make this film more interesting. Thus, a child dies, which is in the father's "natural" response: free of charge to the person who is indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer is drunk and "friend" and keeps him, who does not know. Some children are suicidal and blast the ship. <br /> <br /> For all, this is one of the worst films I've seen for a long time. I'm not entertaining or cleverly challenging. I laughed or cried, I was not aware of it or I was forced to learn more or take a reason. It's nothing for me, it's worse about a movie in my eyes.
