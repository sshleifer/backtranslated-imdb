In the morning when I went home, my kids kept the movie in the hotel room for fun because I packed their toys away. (See the Toddlers "Regis and Kathy Lee" or "The View."). My four-year-old acknowledged a scene funny, but the rest told me "very crazy". It's four years old, folks. <br /> <br /> "To say that this film is bad, Holocaust is a little bit wrong The movie "is really bad, and the plot is stupid, and the script is ineffective." If you want this comedy, you can not even laugh at it, it makes it even worse. Nonsense "Bacchi" Pinchot is a bit of an odd fake voice (as long as I can say Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Kakni-Cajun), but all the characters are awful, I do not see the real Laurel and Hardy movie at the age, but I know that way better than this. What is the point of destroying a classic comic duo ... this is the bottom line: derivative garbage.You have some freaky Bronson Pinchot F Avoid at all costs unless I have a 2/10
