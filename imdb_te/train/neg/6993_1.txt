No horrible movie. I can not believe that looking at this reconstruction will waste 90 minutes of my life. Please tell us why this movie was cast by Wing Rames and Mehky Pfeiffer. Mehki Pfifer is a great man in E.R and Ving Rhames and probably does not know what he is doing. I feel terrible for them. The music backgammon I'm not sure I'm all compatible with all the stories and it's amazing how to find these directors who do not have any lives while creating an amazing and balanced movie. I think any future director is terrible, such a great classic film is different. This image should not be in the first place. <br /> <br /> "I love you." - 10 out of 10.
