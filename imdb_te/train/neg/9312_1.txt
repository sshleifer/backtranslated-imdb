The worst picture on earth. I do not know where to start, but I hope to save them from punishing another person with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, the film is similar to an evil porno without sex. The actors are some of the worst I have ever seen, and they are still worse than trying to ridicule the film. The film should definitely have a low budget breaking record that I'm sure is definitely worth wasting on the cover of the film. The film has now become a joke with my friends and has become standard for comparing other bad movies. I'd like to start to compare any other movie. I am personally responsible for the reference to a friend and I'm surprised to see this movie. Do not see this movie!
