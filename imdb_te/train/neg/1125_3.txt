I went to school with Jeremy Earl, I heard about the movie, I'm not really sure if it's in the theater. I do not remember the name. I saw it, it was one of the school specialties. Acting is good, not right. The plot is weak and the lines are beautiful. So the comment that I can give this picture is only "Ih" I took the picture from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental space, this would not last if I could walk past it and I could not recommend it to anyone in the past. I have seen many times that I have painted urban children, using that accent or overly old. Many times I think their characters will be unbelievable.
