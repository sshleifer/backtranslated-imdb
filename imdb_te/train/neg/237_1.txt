I was enthusiastic about the film, as Mr Brosnan's performance was as fun as a cod in "Cast Panama" (10/10 rate on board: casting, acting, script, story, compilation, pace, music, emotional effect, etc.). I was very disappointed. It is obscene, obscene, "Panama's Tyler" is not a rich and satisfied film in every way bankrupt film, not a movie. It's blame on screen writing and direction. I sat in the theater waiting for "good part". It never came. Even if a line of dialog does not let me smile, I laughed or did not cry. Worth $ 7? Original.
