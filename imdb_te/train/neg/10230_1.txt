It was done on a copy. If not mine and I have spent my own money on this I'll find that I am responsible and demand it back! I can say this is a terrible student film. There is no awareness about film media. Acting is a terrible god, unrealistic and dumbfounded story from the original Twilight Zone series, and the change in the tone of the main character's 'role of the ghost' is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The 'glowing' reviews of the movie are only acceptable from friends and family. <br /> Amateur! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid!
