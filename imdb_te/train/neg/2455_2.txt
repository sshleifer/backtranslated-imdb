I'm going to see my movie with my parents in the summer of 78, and I'm pretty at that time. <br /> <br /> Before Jackson's films came out, my wife and I had rented this movie and never saw it and I was nostalgic. <br /> <a href="http://directory.blogspot.com </a> </ span> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> An animation technique for people in the budget, as this film is primarily made with rotoscoping. Most of the film is animated in the word's most descriptive meaning. <br /> <br /> According to budget hurdles, the film - already a compilation of "There are some scenes standing in front of a screen, The Fellowship of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - are further reduced. <br /> It's not all bad, but it's a warm welcome to the animation, I'm not in Jackson's movies. <br /> <br /> It's great when compared to good cinema. Many years later, half an hour long TV was broadcast, which was intended to close things. I say it is a musical.
