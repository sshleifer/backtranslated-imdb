This is just a bad image. With what has seemed to be a very nice budget it has the potential to be very good. It's almost. Almost Salma Hayek, almost like Jackie Chan, hero heroes, almost crouching tiger wars and duets ... almost music, conan ... that's it. But in the end it's just dull and it's hard to find anything interesting. Perhaps John Rice-Davis is flying in the duel battle as the heroes in the hero apart or the crouching tiger who preceded it ... I'm really shy about the poor old John. He is all good actor and better qualified. So you - if you still have the chance to see just something.
