The film was originally a litte of confusion. I'm usually like Gina Phillips, but I'm saying this is a bad choice, as Rossi's film is ringing, she's not even good movies. Jeepers Creepers are a good way. Anyway, Faye Dunauve is good. She completely killed me and in the end, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassie (Phillips) who came to the funeral of her twin sisters. Her sister owns and her grandmother (Dwava) lives with a mother named Emma. She does not die as long as Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is alive and wants to live with her, and hates her relationships very much. If Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries. This is an unnatural part of the Ravens. When relationships sleep, the Ravens eat there organs, so they can not sleep. But they are. Usually it's all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, b / c Mary Ellen can stay alive so they have to suffer forever. Yes, I hope this helps. If it's not, sorry. Love Love.
