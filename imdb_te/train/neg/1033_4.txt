Where am I Scooby Doo, and I still love it. This is one of my favorite cartoons, including Darkwinging Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for kids, voices are good (Don messiah and Casey Kazenbe are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), theme tuning is acceptable and some nice animation. But this was disappointing. I usually do not mind Scrappy, but when he looks like the main character, it's annoying. Catchfrage is full of puppets, slightly more scary than normal. Half a gang is not after the first year, somehow it does not feel Scooby Doo. And jokes and story lines are simple lame and uneven, there are unmasking demons or baddies haunting very little. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue, but this program is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, voices, theme tune and it's fine for kids. Bethany Cox
