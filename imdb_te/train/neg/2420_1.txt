I usually comment on the movies I like, reflecting "everyone / her own taste", but here I want to make exception. In the premise of the film, which appears to be losing in Shuffle, these two self-centered adults have a definite right to go to Las Vegas, to drink, marry, and count on their respective offspring. Even if culturally granted sanity is allowed, they do not have the courage or responsibility to wake up the next morning and to remove what is in motion. After all, "love" is important, is not it? Hell with everyone. It is not true that "working at the end" is not true; It is actually quite irrelevant. In particular, disrespect to others, especially if they are teenagers, and especially if they are in dependency status, will be brought to light and strengthened. These "parents" have very harmful behaviors such as the heart of the social workers on their heads in the heart of the heart.
