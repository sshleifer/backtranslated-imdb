The film was first released in Christmas, in 1940. A very poor copy was opened and now made on CD. Do not buy it! The picture is obscure and horrific. Casting is poor, the script is terrifying and dire to the direction. <br /> <br /> Film Roland Young songs and dance. <br /> Maybe this film is deliberately lost.
