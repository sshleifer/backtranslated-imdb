The poor actress Jeremy Renner is a disappointing and unreasonable real crime film that is desperately losing his character by Jeffrey Dahmer's main character of the most notable divergent / serial killers of the past century. Directly released in early 2003, "Dahmer" is an outrageous, boring, ill-fated and almost bloody-ceremony of a real crime drama that has a perfect helper to make it the ultimate killer! What, though, for me, for unknown reasons, trying to attempt a human audience with some sympathy, the final single, depression and seriously socially useless gay losing the man he shot, the cool against all the wrong places for love, he and the sicko and a madman is to measure and hated Do it! Overall, 2003's "Dhammer" is one of the most worrying serial killer biopics that I'm telling you to be the real culprits to avoid everywhere as I'm tearing up! It's even worse than the other patric and exploitative straight-to-video trash like "GC", "Bundy", "Ed Jin" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
