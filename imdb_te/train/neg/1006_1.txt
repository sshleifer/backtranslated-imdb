OK I have some pretty big names to hear about this new Justin Timberlake film. Morgan Freeman, a freelance man who was an asset to Hollywood, but was completely ruined in the film. Since we've seen American Beauty and the General Suspects, I've got a great fan of Kevin Spacey. Both of these great actors signed the film that I thought of as the greatest film I ever heard of this story. Then enter the fresh face Justin Timberlake. The film is his first film and the rotten Tomato has not hit him yet because I'm looking forward to a fresh look. Well that's the reason, I might add, because no one ever sees this film or because of the difficulty reading this review. The picture is very terrible when I got into the first 15 minutes. These characters are of the same dimensional, some biblical characters appear as Don Corleone. They got a liner and sound-bite valuables. Token Troubled Black Guy (LL COOL J) With a beautiful woman he is not even in real life otherwise. The captain is the youngest person who speaks in such a high tone. With an experience, the leader will have a sharp image without a rich man. Oh and gun fire lots, I mean a whole lot. SPOILER (NOT !!!) This kind of gun firing, leaving each of the police dead, kills them. <br /> If you want to see Edison, all 13-year-old girls have fun there, since you're a great fan of one of the stars or Justin Timberlake! This movie is terrible because I have more thumbs because this movie is terrible because I'm too thumbs down because the movie is terrible because the movie is terrible ... <br /> Maya G * D has Mercy in all And this terrible saving us because it's not the end because it's just a story About ain are expected. Movies. Well worse, another RNB has turned out to be a terrible actor, the singer is terrible actor Usher, he will check the lol, or even the rich or trying to die '. Now the special thing about that film is that it is aged at age 30 or under 16 years of age or young teens. I can go with this.
