I saw this terrible thing on TV. You do not need to say that it is one of those movies you see to see how hard it can be. Frankly, I do not know how little the bar will go. <br /> <br /> The characters are the next to a sluggish stereo-type and the intent to make another "Bad News Bears" a clear attempt to say little. <br /> <br /> I have seen some gift turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list any of these from "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this way, This ... this ... is not even good.
