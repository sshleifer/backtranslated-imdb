The film tells of a young scientist who creates a bloodbath that rebuilds the dead. He uses his brother when he is shot and killed in a drive. His brother then hurts other gang members. Some of the scenes are very slow and they run very little in other scenes. The story is not mediocre but the story does not help. The blood on the decorative face will be. I'm sure the film budget is very limited. I believe that the film's story will be more realistic and better-budgeted. If you do not want to see a good zombie flick, you can not see one.
