I argued with me whether this is a rental. I've always rented what I heard (do not remember being in theaters). Great cast ... that's what the scales have evolved. Within 30 minutes, I almost stopped looking. The first few minutes are pleasant to watch, but unbelievable. It's only worse then. If you want to make some of their images better, the authors of this film can do little research on future projects. Or they may try to write something slightly reliable. Although I have to read the script, I will write that many good actors will make the film acceptable to this movie (only one word) and give it a 2. Oh my God has sucked this movie.
