I'm reading posts about Wonder Woman's attire for this TV movie. It should be shown at the time of the film, not dressed in traditional clothes. The producers are actually dealing with WW's comic book writer's concept of the early seventies. <br /> <br /> For the film, I agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! When I was in ABC in 1974, I was a kid, so I was right at the age to appreciate a movie about the comic book hero. <br /> <br /> Previously, I was "overwhelming" with the plot, and I stopped watching three quarters of the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not at the right age to congratulate Kathy Lee! :-)
