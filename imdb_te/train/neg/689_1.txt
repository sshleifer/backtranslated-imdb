What is ........... it is This must necessarily be the biggest waste of the image, settings and camera. I know it's not set your expectations of 80's slasher high, but it is very stupid to be true. I have won this movie for $ 0.89 and I still want to pay my money back. <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations? In fact, you will not be less labor. Why are you The manufacturer of this piece of garbage certainly does not care. They did not try to create a bit bit tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's easy to find money with such a name) Even Kindred (1986) wich is enjoyable and recently he has done Soul Survivors. Full trash as well, but at least one has Elijah Dushku. This is Junk Daphne's debut debut !!! (Who ??) Yeah that's right, Melrose Place chick. Her most memorable role will die 15 minutes. After opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one cares or he does not care. The rest of the actors ... Actually the word is not desirable, are absolutely interesting. You're hoping to die quickly and painful death and not just their characters <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
