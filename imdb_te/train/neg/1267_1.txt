Why me Why should I try to kill such an interesting plot? <br /> If I warn other people, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for college course. Otherwise, I was clearly at the back of the subject and looked at the summary. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, poorly developed, and he is concentrating on a creepy little white man cool when hanging with the LA-style token black man. Feel the stereo LA concept of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. However, note that the film is not considered to be "LA lifestyle", and this is an excellent example of the product that is derived from it.
