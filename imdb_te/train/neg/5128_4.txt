This early B entry patriotic category made a pretty young Jean Tyne on ads and posters, but when you were riding a camel train with Hollywood you would better look her up. In the past, we had just set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert, but there was just a rally with the attackers. I saw sanders as very enjoyable cads that were fun to witness a rare good guy. However, the attraction of Bruce Cabot is pretty much mystery - he's in base and incomparable comparison, but I always thought he was out of the car, laughing, and covered in Greece and sixth grade education. Some people 'em, like Jean-Queen's queen role. This action warned about the attack of locals with adventure filling, tho, and guns, ready to crush and attack Britons in their country, the final gun battle, in which we lose a major role is all good. This feature does not require your bastest attention on Saturday afternoon, but it is a well-programmed programmer. Dorothy Dandridge is almost as interesting as finding one of his first roles and a great assistant cast and astonishing performance. Five to two or two and a half stars .- MDM
