The film did not show the distinctive gay stereotypes I see. But this does not completely change the fact that there is no storyline. I'm sure there are many gay men who are happy to see what the black gay characters are rarely seen and because they can not be fully developed by the characters. But, in fact, the author was originally in the middle, in the end and finally how hard it was to script the script. Or about how the story focused. Not really point to this movie, and although this is a low budget movie, it is still not necessary for story or lack of story.
