<br /> <br /> Bloody (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for durham slasher fans that Drepaff. The values ​​produced in the films are pretty low and the story of the story is pretty, hanging around for red herring where there is a creepy bum. In fact, the structure of the story is very beautiful, save one or two cruel murders. But the film is really good with its surprisingly extreme climax (in the atmosphere) and a fairly bold, exceptional resolution. <br /> <br /> The cast is very poor. Very good at Stephen Sachs's good turn. <br /> <br /> Make Daphne Juni as a unfortunate student. <br /> <br /> B Straw's effort is good for everyone. Full Ho-Hum. <br /> <br />
