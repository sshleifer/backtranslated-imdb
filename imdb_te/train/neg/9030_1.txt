Faces are not cut, throat cut, blood scratches, and ultimately three main characters are discouraged or die. They also blow up Kevin Costner's dog with shotgun. Why would anyone want to see this film? Good people are good people are not only the other way when the bad guys are killed. Take, for example, Underworld and Underworld Evolution, where demons are killed where you can enjoy justice. In this movie, good guys cut up. See the difference? Why would anyone want to make a film that is discouraging audiences? This film is a waste of beautiful photography and talented editing talent. Keep this one to the category of sensitive corpse.
