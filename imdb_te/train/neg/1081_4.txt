The whole picture does not have the same sympathy role. Do you think the lawyer played by Kenneth Braeg will pull us? Well, let's see - we will learn Schizbag's defense lawyer. He deals with his colleagues like livestock, participates in their own crisis (in the process, one of them is killed), threatens his child's safety, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, school managers - and all this for? Because he was thinking with his little head! I was really pulling stuffing from the father and his gang lawyer and dragging him to swamp ... it would have made for a very satisfying ending.
