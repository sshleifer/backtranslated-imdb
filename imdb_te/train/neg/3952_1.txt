Boogieman is a terrible film that does not look like a movie to return, which plays as the episode of TV sitcom while passing the old episodes. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the film's first film is a continuous and annoying past. Again and the same footage. <br /> <br /> The film is really about a mental woman who has visions of the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first film that I do not want to see. The same scenes are over and over and who I do not know who. It will make a few bucks quickly and the whole image looks like it's made.
