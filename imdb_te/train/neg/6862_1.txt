This garbage bin waste is one of the best low quality for the original dumb "Blind Dead". I do not believe what many people say about these films and what they say about it. Since I was a child I heard how horrific and great these films are, and I have seen and disappointed them, since the 1970s, everyone on drugs did not know how boring it was.
