Sure, this is not really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very famous German musician, who loves or hates his acting and is exactly the same about the film. It was written a few years ago based on autobiographical "Dieter Bollen" but it is not accurate. The film is full of some sexually explicit content (at least American standard), which is fun (not for other "actors") or mute - it depends on your personal kind of humor, or you can not "bohen" -fan or not. There is not much to criticize and speak technically. Speaking about me, I recognized this movie as okay-movie.
