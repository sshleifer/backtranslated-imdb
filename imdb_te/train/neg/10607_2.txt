Jean Claude Van Dummey tries to save his career by continuation of the Universal Soldier. But did the film save him? I think he will go to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inner part of that facility. Scary, huh? Acting (according to the details) is not scary. <br /> <br /> Then Van Dumme is a black girl (do not remember where .... it does not matter anyway), some are trying to escape the muscle. But they are new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (just like the image). Shortly after, Van Dummay fights with Goldberg, but "Mission" will be canceled. It's just a test (this movie is a test for our nerves?). The new Universal Soldier project (Van Dumas has seen the role of the first film to be the most undesirable thing), and Van Damme serves the government. But it's the sequel. And a "story" should come. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes, a super computer can shut it down and he will hear the conversation for leaving the project. Of course the cube gets angry and excites all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Dumme escapes comfort, but the computer hunts some soldiers (because he is the best duel soldier (really?), And one of Goldberg's predators, he is always a stinging punishment for the audience, just as he had imagined. /> <br /> Van Dame to save his daughter after some "story" <br /> <br /> If Van Dame has struggled with the Bad Guy, you can finally see the most expensive scene of the entire movie (see for yourself, it is very funny to say) <br /> <br <br /> 'Do not see it, but if you do, put a sixth part with you!
