I feel like I have, con is, do not come for it. After reading the luminous reviews (Director for years was ready to make him favorite by writing a movie reviewer with Sky) I had solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong character, a secret plot development and poetic movements. Unfortunately, the critics do not deliver promises, for the most part, cheesy low budget special effects (where is that clutch cobweb scene?), Unrealistic combat choreography <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' starts with some beautiful locations shots in Scotland , But from here is straight downhill. Unfortunately, the director attempts to start driving a silly driver with a heavy hand-voiced voice over which you will be self-assuring, creating space for a short period of time building, building or creating suspense. The main characters are so unsympathetic and very badly acted - do not care what the audience do, do desperate things desperate things ... like this film !. To make matters worse, 'tribute' (the director is typical trying to pay his dues to past owners) is completely clich√© or unbelievable. The soundtrack only lifted me and kept me in the film but failed to support the dramatic storyline, and added some time to it. </ P> <p> For some reason the film should be more erroneous and very honest and annoying. <br /> <br /> I imagine that I would like to try the best of the surreal realism in the movie but they are often destroyed when they are cut through strange and abstract and sometimes nonsense scenes. You do not need a huge budget to make a really movable movie, many say how much money to make the film, not half a million money ... so what? Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... or their agents are thinking <br /> <br /> You pass in this turkey unless you're masochistic or senseless .... <br /> <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
