Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost badly. I said "almost". This is a lot of random scenes with a tremendous effort in a story. Prophets (you can not call them "heroes") can shoot innocent people for their food, and even loot them for similar reasons. There are also tonnes of homorosticism, which is a recession. (Spanier: Villains (though not as naked as naked as other reviews say) was a miraculous recovery by adding another 70-minute audience-torture.) Misuse took place several times in this torture. If you are in MST3K mood, you might see this, but for the most part you may forget this. Instead go to the original Canon DVD rental.
