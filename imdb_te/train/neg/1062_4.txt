Ouch! This one is a bit painful to sit by. It's a beautiful and amusing premise, but it goes from there to hell. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he is not disappointed with this one. Deborah Cara Unger and John Neville have surprisingly good performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tillley, among others, played on top. I've written parts, and it's very hard for actors, script and director to make such scraps. If you have the worst characters, it's okay, but you should look good to work. It's not here. Run the throw from this movie if possible.
