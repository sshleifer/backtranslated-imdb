This is exactly what you say about the film, but it's pretty awful. Why do you want to see why this is Tina Lewis and Adam West, but that's it, but their talents are wasted in this waste. Some of Adam's scenes, as he's running because you can not see his face. If the zombie was embarrassed to be in the glitter, just think what he thought about this appearance? Before or after, I'm not sure, but, still, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (check first and last mystery science theater 3000 version) compared to this. The gang is very annoying and actors with more acting by some. Of course, of the wild one shot by Marlon Brando. That's amazing. I hope she and Adam got a good salary! Pass!
