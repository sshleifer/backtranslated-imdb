I saw this movie (especially Brody Corbett in it) and I'm not happy. <br /> <br /> In fact, computer graphics were excellent, but the story line requires little touch. Also, I feel that the film is much better with curses and blood, and if PG-13 is rated. <br /> It tastes more -> teens. More young people (especially teen girls) also attracts, a bigger length of Brady Corbett on Thunderbird's poster! <br /> <br /> Although the film is down to points, I have seen it and thought it's okay!
