Overall, more reinforcing and filled holes than Swiss cheese! The director and co-author wanted to mix genres - drama and comedy in this case. Well, at least here, these two mixes like vinegar and oil. To boot, humor is not very funny and juvenile. In addition, the image is not really realistic. Libertines are taken to the French establishment against the will of the legal system and the frank hospitality of the French hospitals. I saw this movie on my big screen TV at home and moved in the picture. In the end I finally sent one of the main characters of the fast food speech to the son of his beloved lover. At that time I was worn by a dead lover, the marriage of convenience and the innocent chaos plot dealing with a nutty ex-lover. Sometimes this theme leads to the families of the two main characters, and then back to one of them - Ismail or mainly Norah. In view of the loss of audience, the perspectives from Norah and Ismaili are changing, and her ex-lover is contained in his psychiatric hospital against his will. There are two powerful interesting films, none of which are well developed. The sermon really does not wrap a lot of sub-plots and want to believe Nora will find some pleasure even though the opportunities offered in her life are equal to the chance of a snow ball in hell. Actors are their best and most appealing, but it is not enough to overcome all the glaring errors of poor writing, editing and lack of vision.
