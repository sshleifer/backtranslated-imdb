This image has never been made. Absolutely complete animation, beyond bad performance. All the people behind the movie are "perfectly, cool!" He said. I'm astonished how this film really frightened. At one point, it was very well a waste point, the cobbler of the saber tooth producing gold cigarette comes from the roof of the creator ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain in the film was killed in the first few minutes of his first appearance. Some two people will be killed to shoot and fire before the other two men are burned. Then, a random one in the jungle was a waiting waiter ... it scares me for a unique cause. Will be a part two? <br /> <br /> The film is pure worse. Slide end display credits from Power Point.
