The American Human Association monitored the use of animals in filmmaking about 60 years ago, the origin of "Any Animals Can not Be Damaged ..." (AHA's Registered Trademark). Jesse James (1939) was forced to kill a horse from a horse for a shot in the film. Needless to say, this vicious action will kill me the entire entertainment of the film. I think at least that the horse is not dead in vain, it's waking up to kindness and horror pain. People start making movies for fame, but I can not help but feel the poor animal is chosen, the way he took!
