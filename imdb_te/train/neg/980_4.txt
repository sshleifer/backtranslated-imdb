My first full Heston film. Everyone knows that everyone already knows. A "science fiction thriller". Campy factor. Everything that goes with this film is inserted into my head when I was renting it and I saw it in the morning and it was the perfect mood in the mood that I thought I'd be (blankets). And tried to understand what would lead to the ending of the permanent destruction of the pop culture, which did not really do. Everything is all over the place, having no back pain in relationships, has no end to the end. Everything is kind of dumbfounded in the end that there is no type and watchman, but it also gets some clearer, because even though it is well known to all people, even when people throw windows, quick answers to anyone will enjoy a movie.
