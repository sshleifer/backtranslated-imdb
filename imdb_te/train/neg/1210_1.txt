Where to start ... Oh yes, to the message to the bad: When you see the first person you've tracked (to kill you) when you see the crime you have, another chance away. Message to the victim: The thugs are talking to themselves and argue, take the opportunity to "get away", sit there and watch them until they hear the sound they hear. Message to the director: If someone is in a vehicle or at the start of 5 or 10 minutes, you can not be bad guys on their balls or immediately bumper! Time and motion do not work that way. It is good to think that a woman who is abusive to leave an abusive relationship at home is brutal (4) men do not kill.
