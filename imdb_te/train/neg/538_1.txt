Wow, no acting talent is in vain. My husband and I sat there, both ideas, this is getting good, these actresses are very good to waste their time with this rubbish. Unattractive characters, hacked script, and simpler motion make two hours longer. I really could not hack it and went to the grocery store (cat litter to be more appealing than this film). The husband confirmed that he was dead and not confirmed - by the time Buddy was killed, they were all hurt by a car and would want to end their painful lives. It is infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful scenery and clothing can not be alive.
