I'm looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing "back to Paradise" I'm embarrassing. I was disappointed. The most realistic thing about it is that the unexpected ending was partially stolen from "go back to paradise". <br /> I'm looking forward too much. "<br /> <br />" I'm the character of the dance and the first, and even though she is very hurt. I could not see anything about the film, and if it could do so well, for example, jail conditions and horror panic have more importance, it's a lot of fun and more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The great thing about the film is "tragedy "On the end. I could not guess. <br /> <br /> By the time I looked at what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
