Unlike many people who did not like this film, I realized that it was impossible to understand it. Understanding what it means is a great understanding. <br /> <p> I do not want to toss this word around, but in this case it fits well. The director initially gave the word a very "ego" way and worse, much irrelevant. It's incomplete that it delivers things in a worryingly contradictory order, which is very alcoholic to recall the earliest sequences of the director, and they were looking for us for 2 hours in the end, and finally to CARE. <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal movie for it. (Creating a story rather than a real world that does not adhere to real life) but having a simple and modern day story, and it is not difficult to find modern day landscape, it may not be particularly difficult to engage the audience, but the combination of events that just dreamed may simply not be met. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this film is to look at a story; Probably the most good story is based on a book, but the fact that the camera does not appear to capture the necessary moments and tie together any lines of cohesion. <br /> Stylized movie. Compare it to Gapar Noi's "Seal Contain Towers". He gave us a coherent, very appealing and brilliant deep story. The film does not provide intellectual study, and it is very stylized, in a dismal performance, the director finally left the necessary story of the good story and the confusion of events that we met together with all the remaining elements. <br /> Yes indeed it's possible to make sense of things .... to a point. As I mentioned, the viewer will reach a stage where they are called "who cares". It's like watching a guy's cabbage mundane story going to a supermarket and buying groceries in a wealthy fashion. It is completely unhealthy and unhealthy with murders. <br /> <br /> Many people today are not able to understand or be intimidated by intellectuals, and in each film the viewer may feel silly. There is a lot of time in your hands, then I tell you about this movie. It's a story based on a book that is presented in a very effective way and my bottom line argument.
