<br /> <br /> The film was filmed in 1976 at Flagstaff, AZ at North Arizona University, and at Oak Creek Canon near Zedana, AZ. The film is a good group of extra-drama students from the NAU. I spent the first year in the theater, but for some reason I was not involved in production. <br /> <br /> There are two Principals in the film and a scene in the film which is nude to be part of their lovely ritual. Woods. They are looking at the back of the movie, doing so. The thing, I know from the theater section but two boys are not actors. Identification of these "stunt posters" is anonymous, at least for this website, unless they decide to "exposed" themselves!
