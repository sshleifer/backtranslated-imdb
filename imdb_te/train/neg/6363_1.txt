<br /> I do not slot anyone in this movie and I feel the first one. <br /> This is awful. I did not actually see its end. It's like watching a boring soap or a good one (all the soaps are rubbish). Actors are poor and the storyline is bad. The person who gave the 10/10 rating did not know what he was about. The script is awful. 2 people are in an angry conversation involving threats together and you expect a good guy to say some is good and beat him out of the trash. He said, "If you do ... I will do it harm" Haha. If the comedy is your subject, stay away. Please do not see this movie because ... it's CRAP! <br /> <br /> Summary: Poor performance, bad fights, bad script. <br /> Do not look! In fact this is my opinion.
