A really effective director like Andre de Toth, a skillful skill in the slippery, did not transfer this concept first. He was particularly interested in bringing in the real possibility of playing the role of William Bishop. Being a movie, it's very confusing (the critic is told by Chip). The main issues are with direction, cheap budget and poor script. The strength is an excellent cast and an interesting simple concept - the characters are pulled in different directions by the opposing forces. If necessary, it is necessary to add positive things by replaying the script instead of rewriting the script, instead of scrolling, embarrassing confusion (to try to identify you if you can do the motions and interactivity). In addition, a large budget gained positions from diverse locations and studio shots, and all-clear-clear clear LA locations. Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth), Dehner, Reeves, James Milankan and William Bishop in the wastes of an amazing cast, before their premature death. Some films cite the significance of a filmmaking that is more than just this pale of uncertain Westerns, which is much higher in the right hand.
