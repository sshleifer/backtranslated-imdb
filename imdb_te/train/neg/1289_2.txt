This was low in Western areas. The writing is too intense, the characters are embarrassing or boring or violent, torture is not intimidated and technically very authentically executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the Fleet that shows us his talent, filling his piece with that sense and his active voice just cheats here. 'Ride with the Devil' is one of my five worst movie experiences, and the Western country has no respect for it.
