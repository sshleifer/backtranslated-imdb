EPSILON, a.k.a. ALIEN VISITOR, I did not expect it. It is not a budget Australian film with special effects, rather than a fast scene and quick view cuts. The female alien can change the understanding of time between "glow" and "fast" humans from space or time from the location of the alien (fully speaking Australian). <br /> <a href="http://directory.blogspot.com </a> </ a> The age of two grandchildren tells her the story of her two grandchildren, and she told her about 40 years ago "when she came to her naked and totally desolate planet, no star was found in the sky from her ... camping alone in the Australian Outback Meets the person who is doing it, and obviously surprises him. She is here by "mistaken", and is angry when she says that she is on earth. Earthlings are known as a metaphor for the enormous damn of the environment and the rest of the universe is considered a metaphor for the most insulting subject: "foul air breathe" but nothing about it, stick their heads under the sand as an ostrich. In another amusing metaphor, Earthlings "frogs". <br /> <br /> From there, when trying to understand the psychology and perspectives of perfect, "quaint". Humans begin to grasp the possibility of being ignorant and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, when looking forward to returning home, this man is totally wrong in his thinking and falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Conversations about the perspectives are interesting, but it is all heavily encompassing the environmental message and low-budgeted feel (two main actors around the various deadly scenes, and the evil exploitation of humans on the planet can never be seen). The environmental message does not provide any solutions, but if one does not do one or two horrible metaphors about nature and what happens to man. Logic does not even hang together: the rest of the world is "given" on Earth, and by mistake, by taking a picture of a space-feminine woman found on the ground can cause some positive change. What is it accomplished from the Battalion pollution and waste of intruders who were deliberately sent here?
