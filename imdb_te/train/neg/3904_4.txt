I agree - Emma, ​​in my opinion, the only great novel ever written. Any man's creation is close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Jen Aston reaches the end of his art. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the best palimpsest. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things here - Kate Berkensale (formerly Flora Post in Cold Comfort Form, clearly Emma's ingenious spiritual couple) is an amazing Emma. Raymond Coulthard will be fittingly adorned by Frank Churchill. The product is very beautiful, but the inner parts are very dark. <br /> <br /> There are many major problems. First, Mark Strong - the first, was not right for Mr. Knightley. This is probably because he probably plays the role of a Census Victorian Parson. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the length one. To be simplified, the image is very small - to get the right kind of feel, it should be twice as long. <br /> Last and most important is the quality of adaptation. Aston is an adapter dream - all conversations are already present. It should be cut and properly arranged. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a very gloomy picture, and the last thing Emma is scary. More significantly, Davis bucolic feast seemed to fit the end of the end of the banquet. What planet or small task of Thomas Hardy came from here? It is completely revealed from the style and spirit of the novel. <br /> Look at the paltrow version, or see Kate in the Cold Comfort Form.
