So what is the big fuss of doing So Indian Jones wannabe when you are an actor who cast like a fantasy dude from adventure storybooks that does not want to go on an adventure ??? Whoever wrote the script for Jake Speed ​​is probably dismissed, but for whatever reasons, the film is not out of curiosity! It does not have any action, but look at the dark side of the movie. It is not comparable to the Indian Jones or other action adventure thrillers of cliffhuners and narrow escape, and Jake Speed ​​is encouraged by the use of intelligent campaigns to make me and others more interested! Besides, I have never heard of the person, so do I need her attention?
