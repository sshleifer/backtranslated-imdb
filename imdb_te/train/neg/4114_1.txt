There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die And why do they make these shorts in the movies ??? The premise is irrelevant. Thrill acting is a dimensional. Special effects become overdone. And an ending gun battle between the film's humorous few shots produced so far. However, if they have good shots, everyone in the first five minutes will die and the movie will not be there. It was so bad that it did not happen. When I tried to stop it several times, I met with it to see how bad it was. (SPOILER?) The final line is the entire dope, the cunning scene crown stupidity. Because it is not suitable for the second feature state in the third rate drive-in season. Along with the general fear of the film, I am very concerned about its impact on younger audiences. Americans wonder why such incidents like crank out and like Columbine happen happen. This is really a simple film at the Brabdinggnigian level.
