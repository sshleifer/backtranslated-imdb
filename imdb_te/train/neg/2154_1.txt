I agree. I found this video to be used and bought it because I was too sexy in the gutenberg jacket on her lingerie. But there is another story inside. Although the film is primarily a parody of "invisible-man" style special effects (most visible strings and other such kits), the script lacked any opportunity-in fact out of its way - -WASP races and real-or-imagined homosexuals. Everyone is homosexual or racist or both as an insult to a person in the script. It starts on the windows on your nerves, along with moving sound, candid-camera style photography and dramatic storytelling. However, the end is somewhat surprising. But by the time you spend there, you do not care less. Very bad, this is a reasonably good picture.
