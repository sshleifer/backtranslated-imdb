The film was promoted in radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to Kinneypalis multiplex, our expectations were very high. Oh boy, how sad this picture! This is a movie in Hollywood style of film. "Shades are very clear that we are not ready to build big Hollywood movies. I'm not a film critic but a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As I said my subject, it's nothing, and then looped. If you do not see anything, you can also watch on television. We have the feeling of shades when we see shades. Shades bad production !!!
