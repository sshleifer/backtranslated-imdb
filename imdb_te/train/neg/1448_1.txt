After growing up in Texas, with less than 15 km of Gilly, I can tell you that I was throwing this film up. This film does not live in the majority of Texas. Plots are weak, and fake tones are entertaining, and all Texas beer drinking water, such as hanky-tonkine, redneux, strengthens the stereotypical picture. Terrible fake Texas tunes are what kills me for it. True, most Texan's accents are a Texas twang, but these people overdo it. Anyone from New Jersey and Ohio can not make Texas tunes. It does not work. John Travolta should be accompanied by disco-dance or 50s. Debra Winger is more persuasive as Wonder Girl as her Texan.
