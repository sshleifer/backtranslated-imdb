There are no words that I can not say for the horrible composition of BTK Killer. One of the ten people in the film is really bad luck. From start to finish, there is not a highlight. The whole thing is scary; Script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, acting, real information, acting, just name a few. The scenes are literally laugh-out-loud, for the worst way to mix the whole thing. This review may seem like an unjust and fierce attack on a low budget film, but it is not. Just thinking about the movie that I saw makes my blood boil. I do not know how this film has been granted rights to the production. I actually searched to recommend BTK, because it really stands up to what a pathetic and awful thing to do. I can say honestly, it's the worst of all the years in the film. MOVIE. Ever. I spent my life on this unpleasant garbage, and I enjoyed the nearby building and knew what I was doing. ZERO out of TEN.
