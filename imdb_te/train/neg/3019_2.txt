How can you make a tough lifestyle and attractive violent bounty story? This is irrelevant. Moreover, the director's visual style is frustrating and obscure, the plot is a risky, boring, chaos gangster movie rhish and acting is incredible. The new characters throughout the film introduce the film and are largely fragmented - most out of the sequence - to be shown to be just as good and confusing. The film really does not know you and then says, "It really did not happen," - (fake) See the 'first ladies' (apparently) killing. <br /> <br /> The first, the wrong, the sequence of events in this film? <br /> <br /> In casting, terrible selection of terrible, violent plot and headache is a terrible choice. 1/5.
