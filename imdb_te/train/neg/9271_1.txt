The small minority of the film has got this film serious. I know it's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with brain cells can see that this is the worst. So it's not bad to be part of this franchise. I am telling my friends that I am a part of this film and I try to give them a career. In every way do not talk to poor people and others. The storyline is a weak rehash of previous entries, the script is similarly the same. Instead of trying to hide the lack of realism by using a girl (Wow!) Filmmakers do not have thoughts, and there is no total fear of sadness. Absolutely no vomiting features, absolutely turd. I've got a couple of chancers a mark because I have NAS to earn this part of Chen. They actually made more effort than building this film. Shame.
