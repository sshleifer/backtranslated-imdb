This story is a very delicate study about three women: Muriel (Charlotte von Denen IMD), Laura (Ells Dätermans) 37 and Martha (Freder Pitters) Murray's mother is the oldest. They live in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Important Laura wants a kid. Murale comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreamed about her youth when she was young. In fact there is nothing in this film, so you wait for something - for example in an accident - this makes the story dramatic. As time passes, you want director Dorothée van den Berg to develop only three women and nothing mental imagery. This film is disappointing because women do not need to learn from your experiences, so it is left with a nonsense feeling.
