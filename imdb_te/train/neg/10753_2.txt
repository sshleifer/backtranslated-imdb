<br /> <br /> Calvin - "Well, I have the brain, but they are lost in the rewrites. <br /> <br />" I think Susan Calvin is the role played by Asimov's work. . In the books, she was one of the first strong female leaders, and she was able to think through the problem. <br /> <br /> There are references to the laws of Asimov's robotics, but they follow the CGI and action sequences. <br /> Smith is mostly in his movies, but honestly, the story is not good. YOu figure it as long before these intellectual characters.
