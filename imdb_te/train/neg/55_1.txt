I give two movies to 1/10, this stinker and "the man from earth to earth." I remember seeing a protocol in a theater at the beginning of the 80s in high school. The script insults anyone (of a high school student) intellect. It was completely lost in the butt and got me lost with "landscapes" Gag. Goldie Hane is considered to be attractive but appears as a vapid and moronic. There are insulting stereotypes about Arabia, and then Goldie suffocates everybody, worrying mass group abuse. This act is terrible, including Gordy Hon. I could not stand to see another movie until she was able to redeem it in every I Love You You. This is a film that you do not want to do any work on screenplay. The worst.
