What do you get when you have bad acting, bad direction, long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You'll get Jessica: A Ghost Story looks like it's burned on the betacom, this is fine, but the lighting is in this medium's praise. That is not the case. There are some CUs in the shadow of the person's face. Particularly a scene of psychiatrists. It's a joke when you ask me. In some scenes, they were able to cut easily in half ... but I think I do not have a movie throughout the fees. The main character is very flat. He is the lead man, so he must have some "hero" items for his role, but he did not. He fears the whole picture and feels afraid. I have gone, but I do not want to waste my time. Even though lighting is terrible, I have to say that they have a good camera movement. Very nice lighting does not compliment it. The cover of the DVD is good, and where it ends. Just terrible.
