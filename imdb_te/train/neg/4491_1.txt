1/10 and I do not go with my ratings. <br /> <br /> Skip this "movie" and wait for the "trilogy" final image, do not buy or rent. Believe me you do not have one thing. The architect does not give the new information: _ (spoiler) _ There is more NEO, he's like nr.6 or something. You could already figure out something like that from the first movie: It's very accurate because the job created by Agent Smith is telling us the first matrix. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where ever I saw this? The characters first appeared in the first film correctly! There are no new action-scenes with more opponents. <br /> <br /> In the BIG fight we have not seen action-scene (20+ ships), someone (in the revolutions?), Someone (hmmmm, who is probably a knife who wants to kill) <br /> <br /> Immediately to make money in the shameless ploy Especially for those looking at it once), it's like a charm.
