Is the single positive for this film? Critics of video games can recognize gaming errors. <br /> I might have missed something, but Super Mario Bros was not 3. Suppose a game that was never played first. Well if the case is, and I do not miss anything ... how the role of Fred Savage, and even the girl already know a lot about the game? <br /> There is also the low quality of the film that is actually busy with gaming errors. Nothing is honestly very memorable. It is not advisable to play video games in the footage shown by the kid. In those days I had so much experience that many children had reunited. Actin and storyline are just mediocre in their strong points. The characters are bland and absolutely interesting, the 'Wizard' (the little boy) is a very quiet, completely dry children's cliche because of a little kid who is almost talking due to an injury. It's not unrealistic, it also begins to set up a plot for more than 30 minutes. </ P> <p> Honestly, it is necessary to look here. You would like it to be good if you grow up with this movie. It's about playing video games, and you probably have an obsession with NES while you've seen it. <br /> If you do not like a kid, you are not interested in it, but it is very little that prevents it from going. <br /> No sir, I do not like it.
