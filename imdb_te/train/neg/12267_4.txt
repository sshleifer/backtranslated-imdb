I'm just talking about film, I really do not like it. <br /> <br /> Anyway FX or because we have a single cabin in the scenario for the whole movie, it keeps watching me. <br /> If acting is dark, I do not like it, his "friends" are all happy and then they are mad, but you do not have any idea; Then they play different roles, one is the loyalist, the other is the adversary, but they never point to! Also, lighting is terrible and I just mentioned technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I'm okay "I'm out here!" From some letters. <br /> <br /> The story is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and fiction. . <br/> <br /> <br /> Finally, do not believe or believe the story of man, do not spend the whole time as you believe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what you want,
