For all its visual happiness, how well the revival was in direct action. The animation is big, yes, wonderful, but the characters are very cool and empty in the film and style. With real actors, perhaps the film is not as important as the world. I have a lot to admire here, but I have found that I can all admire the end. I did not enjoy movies and this explains what I have not seen: visual elements have a defining positive perspective of an image, but without good story and strong characters, it does not. I do not say this movie is going to come, but it's sometimes dangerous. I love dark science fiction thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two pictures that I think are fantastic. But Blade Runner features its tragic villain and Dark City its thought-inspiring story arc. Renaissance shadow and light, but a little else. I thought I would like this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters were like that. The revival color and the historical and artistic explosion of life. This year I saw one of the most unpleasant and lifeless movies, taking the title from the Renaissance.
