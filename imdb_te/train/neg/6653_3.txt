I saw this movie, it's a big waste of time. The girl who plays Eva (Ellen Fudgestad) does not work at all. She read her lines as simplistic, and she has a very natural-facial expression through her entire image. Rosanna Mutter, who plays Petra on the other hand, is natural. She played a part in her great perfection. <br /> <br /> Spellers! The story is very simple - we have seen many times, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, she gets jealous, he breaks the other girl and they eventually end up together. No one is surprised, Eva knows that it will break down, "hook up" with Adam Petra. The only thing that no one has ever seen is that Petra told Adam to go to Eva after the party. <br /> <br /> In the film, one of the petra's faces that she has seen before the audience has become all the worse. She told me to restore Eva's heart, which is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a simple picture with simple actors, so I do not recommend it!
