The film is capable of, but Lindsey Croz's performance makes it really bad. I have never seen her before and perhaps have some Crauss fans who she likes, but her performance in the film is bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When she distributed lines she seemed to have been trying to make sure she had the lines correctly and read off the list in her head. So, her voice is very small. I can not believe anybody who plays badly in acting has played a major role in a movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hate this feeling about her, but this comment should be "this" long and her performance sticks to more than one. <br /> <br /> However, when the story progresses, I like it. The first part of the script contains the production of a good image. But in the end it was disappointing. If her acting is good, I like it.
