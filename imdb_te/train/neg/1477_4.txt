I have seen two other best works of Cancone from Blake Floatation from Dolomite and also (Avening) Disco Godfather, our friend Rudi Ray Moore. But this film, Human Tornado (Anna Dolomite 2) always has a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence sets the tone. <br /> The tone sets the opening sequence. When some racist local police resist the house for good reason, and you do not know, our old Paul dolomite is hanging with a white woman! The bed in Old Doe is no more than the wife of Sharif. When she saw her, she cried: "He did me!" DOLLYITY 's cry: "& $ $ @ you are $ real? <br /> <br /> What are the shortest Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters' fame), continuity defects (the characters look at one way in a shot and the dolomites suit his nightclub <br /> <br /> But the real pleasure is Rudy Ray Moore himself.Did you think that the man is good in this movie? It is not known, but you have to worship with the enthusiasm he has, which is totally naked on a hill, or cut in his prominence (eg quick!) Into the cave $ @ (Take his own tomb!) The composite war is painted at high speeds, but occassionaly Rudy pose and his teeth grits slow <br /> <br /> Human tornado, the original dolomite, is an incomprehensible picture of enormous proportions but it is at least fun, and certainly you have to work hard for these people There is a need, it's not too much, enjoy my heartfelt recommendations.
