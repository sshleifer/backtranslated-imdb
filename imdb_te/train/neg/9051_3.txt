I'm so happy when it comes! I can not wait to see. No power wastes! It's kind of like that rarity's CD through your favorite band you found on the rack in your local band store. Being a hardcore fan is a valuable discovery. But once you know clearly why these dogs never make it into the real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' which contains everything that is lynching. "Six Men Getting Sick" is somewhat interesting in sight, but small and repetitive. It is the power of Lynch's later work "Grandmother" that is not just an immature work. It looks tedious and looks like a student image. But it's only 70 years old ... it's only interesting if you wish to make a mental analysis of the director. But you can see the seeds of his trademark images and sounds briefly. "Alpahabet" is not unforgettable (not really! I can not remember this!) "Precious" does not mean. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is just plain silly. "Lumi√®re" is only worth a bunch. Without dialogue, Linch tells a comparatively unsatisfying story of his finest work. I had to see this many times. But it will be less than 2 minutes. DVD rental or buying difficulty is worth it.
