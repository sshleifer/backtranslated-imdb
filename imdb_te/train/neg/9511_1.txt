I would like to see this film since it was first promoted on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see at Last Night 7:40. I'm worried about the day I wasted this trash in my trash. Initially all the bunch sex is the worst and clich√© trend. They are exaggerated to work in love reality. All the stereo types of girls. The boyfriend is very sly at his age. Moves the pregnant woman into the gases without any laughing. Bank robbery is totally boring with the deceptions used in other films. Their escape car, Chevy Van, has an old beat, which has no breaks. Hey why do not they get a nice loser vehicle for exploitation? It may have raised the audience's view of the movie. This film has less and less low budget because there is no damaged or damaged. The film contains a lot of things that lead to feeding the seeds of Christian people. Hey I imagined a car chase scene because all the bank stolen movies chase the car but I have never had anything. So I'm going to have this picture b less and budget up to 10 stars.
