I was frustrated because I could not finish the movie because I was watching movie theaters and I and my friends were just tired, I got up and left for another 2 minutes. I think that's going to shoot again and again ... I know the whole whole movie because my friend told me what to do at the end and I'm not surprised at all. She's going to do it right and be happy if you want him to be true, you know you should be a complete idiot. I do not miss anything and if someone asks me to see the movie and say "on my dead body".
