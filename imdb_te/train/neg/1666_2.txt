What film can it become more innocent than this? You can not trust a piece of this script. And from the first 10 minutes you can imagine the plot and the ending of its ssooooo. <br /> <br /> She looks like a popular actress like her acting Barbie (but she does not make it, the doll has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> The passing of the character and leaving the music school seems like a historical biography of the opera novel. <br /> <br /> Did not I talk deep into characters? But the good thing about this film is Madsen's performance, which brings life to a melo-like one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> This image is very cheesy and it sticks to your teeth. I said, "Oh, do not give us a break!" Brothers Grimm book shouted 13 year old Britney-obsessed girls that the book is somewhere hidden in the attic if we want some fairy tales. I gave 2 instead of Virginia Madsen instead of one.
