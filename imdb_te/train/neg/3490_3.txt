Jean Arthur enjoyed my interest in "The Devil and Miss Jones", so I tried to sit through this second string screwball about investigating the death of this breed - but I did. Former husband William Powell, who is taken in a glass, cinema-man fashion, wants another shot at the wedding, but the character does not always think that the character is just a string of knowledge (she is interesting to be a heroine-type funny but once a dead body - these '30 comedians Like all women - she faints). William Powell had a long time working with Miss Arthur, but you never know from the final result; They were awkwardly standing beside each other and hesitated over their marauder. Pavel's worthy person is a victim of the actor, and the pregnant woman is pregnant with abortions to laugh the viewer.
