The director of Altonman's experience can not ever imagine that we should spend time or worry about what's going to happen, which is not related to any redemption symptoms of a nervous and main character-a central puzzle about this that is seriously confusing. The tremendous part of the trash. In addition to this useless error, a deep density is required to follow the plot line. Since the setup of the brachag character is very clear, we thought that the writer and the director think that they have completely lost their respect for their audience. The next issue is in the main part of the film: the director is self-pleased with the deep contempt for the viewer's taste, values ​​and intelligence. <br /> <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
