It's very bad, very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. I did not bother to see it, I did it 20 minutes later and was initially disappointing ... I really do not understand the taste of people, I'm a fiery movie fan and I'm not easy but I have a limit! Perhaps this was a very good actor at the start of the Hayast, but it's just that. I do not waste 15 minutes. You will be able to see. I'm acting with good monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just awful. Do not they pay letters in C-films? Not that it's not the first time I feel a horror movie bad but it is absolutely one of my ten down movies and it's portraying a vampire's portrait, lake, camp cabin cabin places!
