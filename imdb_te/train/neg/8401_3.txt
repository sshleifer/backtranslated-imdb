As it was seen in TMC, it's fresh in my mind. While Stuus has stars featured, it does not really run the display. For the first time, they were split into 2 groups - the MOI, "Shorty" and Larry and Curley were a pair, not all of the full band's work. The plot is an interesting romance story, where two ladies have a casting ability, another group of musical stooges that are unheard of, unless you consider their efforts to be sadly rarely funny. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to ranch and then rely on horses, dorky western dress is crazy, and the camera has an awful lot of film with no stooges. By the way, this is exactly after Curly's first stroke, and his reduced power level is clear. Vernon Dente does not appear in the beginning of an early role. I like all the guys but curly stuff, these guys have always loved, but this little cookie is pretty lousy.
