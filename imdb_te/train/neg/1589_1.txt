It's unbelievable that the script will make any screen smaller, even cliche and completely nasty. The dialogue in the film is seen as Catwoman's high culture classics. Billy Jane has been playing badminton Harmonica, playing Elvis, Gansling, a former footballer of the Marshall Arts Master, a former soccer player, who changed NBA slave who played NBC's craptastic show "Next Action Star" winner. His appearance is cool and cool way so cool. The "film" will be done in Vegas, and the authors make it a perfect fit for a film about a man who is trying to survive 24 hours against a scapegoat, wealthy gambler who gave it $ 2.4 million to his goal by playing poker there. Therefore hunting. A hunt with sudden explosions, construction yard settings, shady cinematography, and one-liner who has the word "bet" or "gambling". The woman winner is also thrown in the mix, for which reasons I do not know. Oh but do not lose the loss of "NAS" fans as well as make their memorable characters. The surprise end will knock off your socks if you love predictable or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reorganize his decision to sell more. I thought I could return my life for those two hours.
