"Child Child" is one of the Gofeist films ever made. It's not the worst (although some disagree with me), but this is not the best one. It took him bizarrely about a disappointing 7-year-old boy who had driven him into a stupid couple (John Ritter, Amy Asbeck). The film is very small and unbelievable because the boy does not buy a second to die, as the kid plays in the film. When I laughed at it many times, it was Assin and wrong. (I do not really know why). But I can not recommend this film. I'm very kind. If there's a positive thing about "problem child" it's just awful that it's better than a sequel. <br /> <br /> ** (from four)
