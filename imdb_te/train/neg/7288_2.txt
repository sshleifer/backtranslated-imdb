Note all the directors: Long is not necessarily good. This image is too long. But it's not good. The scenes are way too long, path, way, way, way too. Sexual scenes are unnecessary and are often too long. This image was edited up or down for 2 hours and 10 minutes, but it turned out to be very memorable, in which I only gave 2 to 10. It is less than average. <br /> <br /> There are other issues in this marathon too. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fennes plays the whole family tree. The person who plays the big-grandfather does not look like him, but the grandfather, the son (the voice that does not consist of us) all the ralph fennes, the different facial hair and the same bull-headed personality. No one will notice that no one will appear in this moment, yet their photos are taken at every turn. <br /> <br /> Although any news from Germany has long been a long time, it is very small, but if it is not for 3 weeks, it's not too annoying. The Jews are surrounded and sent by ridiculous. Perhaps the idea that some word can get and execute is probably discussed. <br /> <br /> Love stories in this film are totally wrong. You always tell us the story and the relationship between the main characters is very small. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. Then have children. Then we forget about 6 centuries and develop relationships. <br /> <br /> This 2-hour film is not much trouble, but has not given us the time we spent with us. <br /> <br /> The ending is just bad. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be harassed by watching this tragedy. On a week basis, I mean the endless loop, who's the same thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to see if I can do anything for Robert Redford. The film was long out of the film that was completely lost. <br /> Sunshine, the full title. When the sun is shining, you start looking, it is better after the darkness when you leave.
