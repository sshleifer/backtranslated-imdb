Okay, this stupid is that they are not "another nightmare film," which is "the last one" ... and what do they do? They make another, the next part (BAD), but why are they playing with us? However, this film is never quite understandable, it is very soft, the characters are one dimensional, Freddy is another joker, which is very stupid for a good series. The plot is very bad, and it's even worse than Part 2 and 5. In 3D, I do not get a stupid story in the film! This film is very unpleasant and I do not think this is mainly the whole movie. It's much different than these prequals, it tries and tries, but this hardest tried, and there are no death scenes that have been cut back on the face, even if they are different, they will suck big time. How have they gone this distance? Do not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? Do they still do that? Do not miss this sack for a knights series to lose all of its money. <br /> <br /> Acting on the pitch, Very funny to describe the lack of / deaths / horror / very confusing.
