drss1942 really took words right from my mouth. I liked Segal's early films and I still feel like the only person who believed him. I saw this movie (okay, 90% fell asleep, so I did not end). When I woke up and saw that I was in the DVD menu, I could not find out what happened to me in the film, even if it did not. There is something strange about Segal and others voice. Kinda reminded me about the original Mad Max dubbed, but in the same language (Austrian English, right?) Anyway, if I have 10 thumbs, they have all suggested this segregation right now.
