Acting in the film for the first time? The character, Lyon, is funny enough but soon after sexual jokes and humor are no more dumb to hear anymore. Some movies can stay away with sexual jokes, and their audience has the edge to know exactly when the ads arrive. Some films are American films and scary movie. The horror film is stupid, and does not do well without the American sex sexual jokes. Only the character, along with Lyon, will then have some humor ferrell. The character is really dumb and all is, watching dumb humor is all for me. The picture is OK, and nothing else. I do not really understand why a movie will get depended on where the snl people who are dying away from the show and always played in the show. Skates spent 5 minutes, and if they close the 5-minute sketch, what's the world coming up? Molly Shannon had a superstar, Cherie O'Tater had a horror film, but she played a prominent role, and Elf. But good, but he's some dumb picture, but I cant remember, and guide Mike Myers to the world. Can the mad TV staff get the movie deals anytime? Only one guy has seen the break, but only as a TV show with 2 movies and andy dick. But that guy relies on comedy in his life to be humorous or persistent. This film is not good, but it has some positive humor. No waste of film and people's money. (D D-)
