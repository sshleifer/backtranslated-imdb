This too does not plumb Creepshow 3 depths, but it comes closer. <br /> <br /> It is also refreshing from the twilight zone (refreshing zone) and getting bored. Can be compared to Sherling's next night gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and writers forgot that Serling would sympathize with them. <br /> <br /> Create story: Adam West ... Well, himself. He is not the way to the Bruce Wayne / Batman campus, but he rarely does. He is not particularly not-troublesome "Jay" (ominous spine-chilling name to match such things as Doctor Terror, Emras, and The Crypt Keeper) and some slight awkward / creepy ads. <br /> Abramayat: Seed Rod Serling's "A Stop in Vigilabe"? Then you see it. Red Herring of Natso's wife was introduced without any benefit, but the main character's friend found him a laugh. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Memories of various serial time travel stories combined with Steve Allen's "Minds a Meeting". Most of the actors are not too bad (like Cassius, walking, talking and awkwardness except Jose Austin), and this idea is a little interesting. But like Abernia, it does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Life replay: Not a bad piece. , And manages to click and creepshow both 3.

When he visited the bookstore before he died, he was trapped and ... did not die? What? Huh? I do not expect the sense because the supposer is supernatural. <br /> <br /> Overall: Two new Twilight zones are not different from the series, or from some episodes of Tales from the Darkside or Manners. The last two stories and the second part is probably worth your time. But there is nothing really amazing here.
