Being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me Sage insight, I know what bit is there too first ... and on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "incoming freshman" and being very proud. It's funny, sexy, rare, all the major requirements in the drive-in image. Keep in mind that you have been shot and released in front of all the rest of the animals ... Animal house, Porky's etc ... In its own way, this film is really ahead of its time. For whatever reasons, the film was given to major distributors who were editing the original image in half, and then the most random scenes were edited in (then should I say "shuffled"?). Fat man, people with goat heads .... what was heck? I'm sure it was put for extra T & A, but it was slow speed, it did not happen anything before grind to anything a screeching and painful halt. But all in all, it's a fun memory for me ... especially that's the worst thing I've seen so far ... I'm in!
