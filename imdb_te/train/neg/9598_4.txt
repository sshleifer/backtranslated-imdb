There are two full-time jobs in Robert Columbia. He is known globetting TV reporter worldwide. <br /> <br /> I know very well that 'Vivier Vivi Pour' is titled 'Live for Life' in English, but I have worked equally well. Some life! Robert has always had at least three women in her life: a mistress on her way, one of her and a wife who has been betrayed at home. It helps Robert to be a glide liar. One of his most useful lies is "I'll call you tomorrow" and "It took me long to finish my work. "He spent a lot of time and money on flights, trains and hotel rooms. <br /> <br /> Some people may get excited about his life, but I think it's very tedious. His colleagues, including his wife Catherine, are attractive and loving women. <br /> <br /> His lifestyle is very intense and he is very fraudulent, and you wonder if he is enjoying everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dialog or French-only conversations have extensions. We will see wars, torture and troop training portfolios with direct action. <br /> <br /> When returning from Africa to Robert Flight, we wait for the airport to the terminal and wait for the taxi. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Annie is the Girardot standout actor. She is the most interesting character and she played the perfection of it. It is also good to see Candice Bergen at the start of his career. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lelchau's novel techniques. In a hotel room, camera covers around the room like Robert and his mistress argued. At each passing around the room we can see them briefly. On another scene in a train sleeping car, Robert sleeps on the upper bunk while his wife is down. Robert gives his wife some important but sad news, but we hear some parts of it because of the train's stab. I realized that his wife was unable to understand each word because of the surprising nature of the news. I enjoyed exciting safari sequences in Africa. Cinematography of those scenes and those in Amsterdam are great. <br /> I reviewed this project in the Library of Congress. I named this project a fifty: forgotten 50 important images in 50 years. This film can be confirmed, like the other forty-nine I can recognize, in the video after its original release, was not broadcast or distributed. <br /> In my opinion, it is worthwhile to be available again. <br /> <br />
