The book has never seen Robert Wise's production in 1963, for the movie fans (and Shirley Jackson's "The Hunting of the Hill House") and for Julie Harris, the reincarnation is pretty good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be a part of it, Hockey is particularly frightening without special effects, which is professional and believable. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, it is very close since 1963.
