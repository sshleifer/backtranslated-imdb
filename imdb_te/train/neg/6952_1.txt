The most horrifying work of a great series. This should not be the name of the Batelstar Galaktica, because it is only one name. There are too many changes to the changes. When you have strong women's roles, one of the men to attract "male audiences", men and men from men have moved to Asian to Asian. I lost the Egyptian feeling. Gonna search on earth. The absence of cylans going to reject the terminator takes away from the film, specifically a fempto. There is a lot of cheese for the original show, but it's a big following. They tried to catch the bottom, but they would make "their story" as the fans did nothing and spit on their faces. The changes are good, if they do something good, just do not make them.
