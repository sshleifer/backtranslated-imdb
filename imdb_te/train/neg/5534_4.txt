I work on my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and one of ZomBIes's Rival Summits movies. <br /> <br /> I see a laugh riot in all these films as my seven year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> When I saw the white zombie, this is really the core of the zombies in the movie (Think of Clive Barker's Snake and Rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let Die funeral, NOT Night of the Living Dead). However, although the title "zombie" has a word, this is a bit more than a love triangle with the supernatural expert Armand Lauck killed by Claire Duuel; He was elected with his colleague Clifford Grayson. <br /> These friends or axis - I have real difficulty in understanding those who worked for these people. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see Bela Lugosi in credit for the film. But, it works as a brain-control device for his eyes (from the white zombie) zombies.
