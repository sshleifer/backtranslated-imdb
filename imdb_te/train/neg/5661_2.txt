The premise is very ridiculous and is certainly ridiculous. Tritter was just wasted by the second encounter with what happened. The house hires some people and turns the tritter into de-physically. In real life, Tritter would have hauled up the abuses, the malware the the episode would have been exposed to the court, providing motive and opportunity and the lawyers would have been tritter and mincemeat from the special branch for the work he worked. He is imprisoned in cooperating with the abuse of the house, chase, foreman, cameraman, Wilson and rodents. The suit house won a tasty solution, enough to supply him with Vicadin at his age. While the Tritter people will close driving a cab somewhere, people are trying to rehabilitate himself by good for two years before the fact that they want to see it before.
