Really shows that the hype is not everything. Only shows movies because of a crappy actor Abhishek and his father and his wife. Amitabh is always great. Ajay Devgan is always a joke shitty and useless and new guy. Famous actor is a waste of time as an actor. Such an enthusiastic image from such an honorary director and such big industry. The amount of Bollywood movies I've read has gone down. <br /> <br /> RGV is doing very bad movies for a while. Time to get different actors. Hrithik to anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Each other prominent woman is half naked. Pffffft.
