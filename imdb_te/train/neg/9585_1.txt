I remembered this picture in 86, when it came out the first time and any awful movie. This acting is very weak or a breath of air. I think I put to sleep more than one occasion & I'm not tired of remembering. Please avoid at all costs and still have your teeth taken out of any intoxicating case that is more entertaining. It's pity I could not give a zero or negative score. I want to say that getting out of the video shop is what I do not waste my money because the film is very poor and it is practically surprising. If I remember I watched with a girl who wanted to sit & really went out & she sat next to me and was not really enough to keep awake yet.
