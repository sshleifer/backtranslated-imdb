Cheap and deliberately dull story and acting. It's not a good way, it's not good, it's not good, and it's not unforgettable. Blooper reel actors included with the DVD showed how poorly flawed and less fun. The mysterious and occult base is unstable, and the enemies have failed to be creepy or believable. 'Homorotri' overtones are nonsensical and unsatisfactory, and are limited to youngsters who say their chests are soft in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but at least a little bit of action might have kept me and my girlfriend awake.
