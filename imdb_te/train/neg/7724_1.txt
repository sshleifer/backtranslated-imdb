After seeing negative reviews for the film, I found that it was another comic work that was not yet. I saw the first two combat scenes, distributed regular conversations by Lugarren, and saw all of the other Oriental actors, and the scene was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and begins a leisier flying, the plot is different, the script writers are beginning to drink and the film is welcome, turning it into a worst action movie. Lunkner was struck by his previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others for this different feat, as well as Van Dam's films, Seagal's films and Stallone's non-rocky movies. The worst performance in the film (when there is no scene in the face of Till Career's dolph, a laughing value), with the worst dialogue (Brandon Lee's short Dolphin's commentary is always a movie) and garbage in a movie (full of Japanese costume dolph). The film meets "Tango and Cash", "Commando", meets "Friday 13th" (because of the fraudulent nudity and Lunggren's performance is much like Jason Voorius), an hour and a fifteen minute joke of an image. /> <br /> Good (not about how awful) shows go bad man (still looks defiled by his entire appearance) and Carrere (who told her 5 lines without breaking out something smiling). <br /> <br /> Brandon Lee is just as close to Lunggren's side, and is doing really awful at that point. <br /> <br /> The horror, horror movie. Fear it and avoid it. If you look at it, ask yourself why the underwater shots are very clear underwater shots. Check out the underwater shots, check out the worst scene of the scene, the deadly fighting-scene ended. <br /> <br /> There is every version of a bad fight scenario for the film to be filled with little attention and nudity. <br /> <br /> A big bad movie !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
