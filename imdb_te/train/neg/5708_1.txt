People who love me will make this film separate. It's not just realistic. Plot is very imaginative. You can look forward to everything that is going to happen. In fact, they find the treasure and are dirty slums and betrayed the bad man. We've seen it a million times before. The authors of the film should assume that most of the film is stupid. They have to be right because most people really liked this movie. I mean solving the implications in a few seconds. Hidden hidden treasure room under the Manhattan subway? I think you've found the room before all the things that went underground in New York. And who built all during the Civil War? Love story between Ben and Abigail ?? How beautiful, and I thought Claude Cussler novels were weak in romance. In just 2 seconds, I'm falling in love, and I'll be more concerned with saving my own donkey. A piece of hell and stupid paper with the girl. 1/10 garbage
