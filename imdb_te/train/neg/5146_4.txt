For most of the time I'm looking forward to watching this movie, where there is no distribution in the Latin magazines in Japanese or any oriental movies, we can find some of those movies in some underground stores and I found Avon, I thought it was good, but the only thing in the film is the first scene, The rest of the picture is boring and sensible, plain Tupid, a lot of useless scenes, and a boring story. Writing about this film is wasting my time. Sorry but true.
