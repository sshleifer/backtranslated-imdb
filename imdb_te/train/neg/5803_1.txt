<br /> <br /> The film is the first Russian horror film. Unfortunately, I am very worried, "The Witch" (its Russian title) will be disgusting in the gallery of the terrible Russian films. It is based on Nikolai Gogol's story "We", a classic in Russia. The key word for "dependent" story is not needed here. Instead, you know little about Gogol, and it's better. <br /> <br /> This is a distinct product, as it is very useful for directors to take the stories of other distinct cultures and to their own culture. The main part of American reconstructions of foreign films was important, but subsequent to the Scarges Kurosawa's Seven Samurai The Magnificent Seven, and Kurosawa moved to Japan, shifting Shakespeare's Macbeth into Japan, becoming King Lear, a riveting ram. Nevertheless, with "The Witch", we have to copy the Russian lands into the American soil. The film was filmed in English in Estonia, which has dubbed English and has reasonable contemporary lip movements using American actors. <br /> <br /> As a natural consequence, the tale has lost the colorful Ukrainian background, the canister is lifted out of the old manusual book of some old in the American town. Banny became a seminarian Khoma Brutus, instead we were a powdery journalist who won the Pulitzer Prize, and at the same time often wrote about programs like X-Files and Miss Boobs competitions. (I never thought I was given Pulitzer Prize for that progress, now I am modestly repaired). In the strange scenes for Russian language, journalist Ivan Berkhof is named. They are impossible to get a more Hackneyed, Cliche and Generic than this film because they should name him John Smith. <br /> <br /> Berk√∂f goes to Castlevilleville, enters the dirt road, where he finds a wrecked house and meets the old wood. All that is accompanied by a radio statement about the evil forces being at their most powerful, and people staying in good home and avoiding water. Did not you say I'm really raining? After some horror scenes, I find that our journalist dressed as a priest, mistakenly called a priest and wanted to pray for his priest with his dead daughter after the local sheriff attacked her daughter badly three nights. At this time, the action starts with supposedly. Those who have time to kill have welcomed it. <br /> What is wrong with this movie? Everything starts with dialogue for the conversation section. The dialogue I heard in Russian was clearly written in English and was specially edited out of the clones and common people from American films. Actors apparently fought with the English language, as the time of their speech was laborious and unnatural, and followed by the Russian dubbed suit. Acting is much worse, and since the actors are very difficult to speak, they are not only able to reach the range of facial expressions. For the most part, you would like them to be empty or they are. Only exceptions include Lumbit Ulfasac, Estate Estonias Actor and Arnis Lizitis, who play a wheelchair bound resident of Catwallville. Oh, and of course the Rooster camera is completely natural! I complained that the actors were disappointed by dogs and cats but when Nikolau was disappointed by a rooster it was a sad testimony to the normal quality of acting in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a horror moment in the whole movie, and there is not an original moment in either image. Mind you, this comment comes from a novice rather than a horror. The film is filled with the standard tactics used in the horror film. At a crucial time, the camera is loving the camera lamp. The lamp goes out instantaneously. It should also look at some horror movies. An example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps from a bathtub and runs at the camera. He looks like a lynchlath! <br /> <br /> Those in Russia who love it should be promoted as a mystical thriller. I'm not thrilled either. It's the run of the mill to finish from scratch. I especially behaved if the whole population of the small town knew exactly how they lived in the horror movie, unless they were not sure whether they were zombies or not. Thus, some of them played in the zombie case. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film have found faith. Such fine collections such as idiot acts, stupidly contrived moments, and yes, clauses are not eligible to be loyal. This image is very well and completely fake it deserves only to perform in a wax figure museum.
