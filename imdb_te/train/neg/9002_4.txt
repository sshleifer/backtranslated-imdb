OK .... I have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and cheesy! Dean Cain is the only ransom feature of this film. <br /> <br /> The film has some sense - Underground experiment creates a real live fire breathing dragon - mainly joins "Jurassic Park" "Fire of Rain" ..... There are some great opportunities but they are not following .... Special effects are good - even though you do not know Dragon CGI, it's terrible <br /> <br /> I'm not blaming Dean Cain Matalalo one though), I will put director and writer Philip Roth blamed. It was his job to make this film .... and, unfortunately, he failed.
