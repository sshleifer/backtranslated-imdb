I feel like a genius; I think that's the same person I've seen through this duplicate image. I've seen it three times, once with the commentator, and I've seen all the moments of frustration, all the time black on the screen and all the worse, this movie really solves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he is in a town in grief, he is very sad or with him. That and he is an idiot. Although not for the comment by Peter Cowie, it is not just a film, it only explains the book that came, and I was not in the stomach. I like French movies, but it's totally absurd. <br /> <br /> The Diary of a Country Priest is portrayed in beautiful black and white photography but is not protected by this grave dull trip. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance of Claude Laddua creates heartfelt and thoughtful, if you are a saddest, this film is empty I'm empty Because of the insulting concept of Catholic priesthood, it is a disgraceful and profound perception The company. Countless young priest on Countess's pride is a weak scene but 90% of the film will drag you down its silent introspection and window into the melancholy thoughts of the young priest. <br /> <br /> I look forward to doing English SUBTITLE to understand why I do not understand or understand. Image. Well, the English SUBTITLE times is impossible to read / read at times and there is a lot I could read (and I'm not particularly slow reader - I finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days). <br /> I love this film. I try everything "selected" by the Criterion Collection, and why is it so special in some ways that these kinds of controversies. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the feelings of empathy for the main character through this entire two-hour film, which was never vain. He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter. And for that, I say stunk.
