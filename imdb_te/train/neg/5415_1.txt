Dil Film is a memorable film that brought the film to great director like Indra Kumar. The film is good with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti. <br /> <br /> But every successful director comes with some hits, along with some hits. Parry Mohan is such an image. <br /> <br /> While comedy is good, they failed to laugh at the audience. <br /> If you want to watch a movie and a smile, please do not see. The curiosity comedy makes you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is worth a try.
