This week, I thought it was fun to catch up with Corey Hymn, with last week and seeing all two "Lost Boys" movies. <br /> I'm not my favorite boy, it's not too far - I liked those two Kores in some of my early teen days. <br /> <br /> I have acted in three films. Unfortunately, I have opted for "Dream Machine" for the first time (never seen it), and it's very scary, I decided to lock Cory back in my room, first to make him forget. But first I tried to fight through this film. I wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bulster's Day Off" (1986), but caught in its own fantasy. Practically all the film wants to be comedy and in the end it tries to be a thriller thriller. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is: a dead body in Porsche's trunk. The rest of the others have failed very badly, which is difficult. Hi too. I can give him the youth, enthusiastic himself, but at least with some directive guidelines. This is clearly not in the "Dream Machine". So, we have a perfect car, yes, that black porsche. Is Ham's perfect friend? Even though there are not any lines in the picture, the blonde chick. Accurate murder ... almost? Some man who flat on his donkey as the villain of the film is not always successful, trying to pull the body out of the trunk, after which he finally cries for Jake Lee Curtis and Cory Hemm and Mackay. Do not worry if they try to do anything they do. A stupid, unnatural film with the director directing the director does not know how to direct his cast. <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: Are you smiling directly on camera in the last shot of the film? Yours or Director? So not full.
