Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. In this horror story, the newly married husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) find that his former wife was remembered and disturbed by their empty building and lava screaming. Does the husband try to drive his already eager bride mad? Or learn the savior gardener Mickey (Alex Nicole) who took care of the grounds of the building from the death of the original mistress of the house? This low budget horror film is a story line that ultimately keeps you end all the way. Special effects are also very bad at the 1958 standards. The sounds of the skull screaming at times as I should be in a Godzilla movie. Ruth Conway also starred in the role of Reverend Snow. By the way ... Cold Gardener (Nicole) is the film director. You can catch this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
