The only reason for the single reason is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast of "The Norris Tapes". <br /> <br /> *** Small spoilers ** ******************* ************************************************** <br /> <br /> David Norris tried to write a book on the supernatural. One day after he postponed his publisher, he was secretly disappearing and suggested that he had done something Deccan had done to mortgage risk. The whole series of this modest pilot is clearly perceived as a series of sequences by "Norris tapes" - a set of audio tapes recorded by the author while investigating supernatural cases. In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies - but before the purchase of a native Egyptian scraps ring, he will give him immortal after death after killing him from the local bodyguard. Soon the ring is not immortal. <br /> <br /> Instead, it only rebuilds the corpse of the sculpture, enables him to escape the encryption, so he drives around their young girls drying around their blood. <br /> <br /> When the blue-face, yellow-eyes and you've seen ARRRGHHHHS last time you see "Scooby Doo" cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) a dark night. <br /> <br /> She interacts with mutual acquaintance Norris, avoiding her to get her help in solving the mysteries behind her husband's abnormal returns on her estate. There is no Vampire in this story, even if you read or heard where. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? I do not know. We are not attacking him, as we are attacking him. Why? To complete the second part of his bid for immortality. This allows the rebuilt sculpture to live forever, if the life-size statue of Sargath is built from a mixture of clay and human blood. <br /> <br /> When this is completed, Sargoth hopes to retain this statue, which can be used by entering our world. <br /> "The Nortelis Tapes" is a series for a very good reason ... it's the worst. As you can see from my collection, the story is nonsensical and bad. Acting and conversation is not good. It does not even compete for the "So Bad It's Good" award. <br /> <br /> I am happy to be on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03, after years of terribly confused tales of the great merit of "The Nortelis Tapes". <br /> <br /> When this garner was first demonstrated two days ago, you have come to appreciate what you have heard so far from other IMDB reviewers, from dummies and reviewing the presentation based on the nostalgia of the youth. Or maybe they are Dan Curtis' loyal fans. However, they provided misleading reviews of "The Nortelis Tapes". <br /> <br /> Polly Orchid - October 17, 2003
