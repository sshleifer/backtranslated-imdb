The zombie 3 begins when a heavily armed team steals a chemical that is developed to revive the dead and try to escape the man while the metal container is being violated. The man gets a little green on a wound in his hand and turns it into a zombie-eating cannabis immediately. Kenny (Deran Sarfion) and his army buddies Patricia (Beatrice Ring) and her friend Lea (Deborah Bergammi) who have been pecked by zombie birds (!) For fresh victims in the neighborhood area within hours. General Morton will be responsible for the situation & stop the zombie plague spread across the entire world! <br /> <br /> The Italian producer, Italian zombie gore, was directed by Lucyo Fulzi, but the story was faced with a stroke, requesting Franco Guidenji's second unit director Bruno Matte & Claudio Fragosso to complete the film. Apparently Mattei & Fragasso just ended up being almost a straight 50/50 split when they actually completed their very own & most of their own & Zombie 3 added footage fullscreen shot. The script by Fragasso is a perfect mess, so none of it is well thought & gets stupid. The scenes of zombie birds that attack people are not technically useless, the whole idea is simply irrelevant. The zombies do not adhere to themselves, the Patricia bridge is seen as a shot of zombies when they are shuffled, but then with a machete with a zombie attack, as it is on steroids, then 10 minutes before the film is complete for any reasonable explanation , Suddenly speaking the ability to speak daft Ni develops suddenly. There are so many things on the scene, zombie 3, after the scene of the really dull broken English conversation which is not terribly thought & unlikely directed action, awful character & makes sense. Then the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly blew up the air & bite someone who was about to kill the Kenny & Roger of Guy at the end of the white necklace suits, but the ability to fly through the scene about using their instead is the scene scene when Kenny refuses to use their guns when they refuse to use their guns, their Continues to be one of the most inefficient by the shooting started, they decide to try and kill the hand. The scenes are forever kept in the film and later Kenny takes on the helicopter, but for some seconds he can not rest on the ground for a few seconds to pick his friend & then the load of zombies suddenly only hiding themselves under the grass grass piles of zombies? This is a fun and entertaining movie that is all fun and fun, it's just boring, repetitive and just fun to watch, except for some unexpected laughs. <br /> <It is difficult to get to know exactly what is responsible but nobody is well documented in the footage. Some manufacturers have tried to bathe every scene in the smoke, and the problem is that they only have a fog machine and you notice a mist of thickness in the corner of the screen, which is directly coming from the machine and is disintegrating across the scene . It does not add to any sort of atmosphere when it's set during the day & when they get it right & fog across the screen as the fog equally fires a fog day scene! The direction is poor without any stability & it just looks & feel at the bottom of the barrel stuff. There is a legend woman who actually rips out of the stomach of a pregnant woman (actually took her legs off the pool by the way & why did not she take the legs off who saved her?) & Some OK looking zombies is Gary as it is. Forecci is regularly served at the end of the 70s and 80s, which do not have any good feeding scenes, no intestines, no 'head shots' or too little. <br /> Technically the film is poor, special effects are inexpensive, cinematography is dull, music is terrible, the areas are bland and it has rock bottom production values. It was originally filmed to reduce the minimum cost in the Philippines. <br /> <br /> The film is dubbed in full and acting is still awful but the English version seems to have written the person who does not understand the language. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is not a sequel to Fullsilis Classic Zombie Gore Fest Zombi 2 (1979), which did nothing else apart from cash-title. I'm sorry, but an amateur mess of Zombie 3 movie, it's boring, it makes no sense, it's not funny enough to be fun, it does not have any good gore. One to avoid.
