I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This must be the worst part of the monkey S @ # t I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Wardrobe: I have reviewed reviews on this site that suggests that cheap como costumes and painters wear clothes, which I think will come to my taste in horror, from home depot. Masks are made from what looks like tin flakes. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore is pretty good, I should give it up. But Itenbach's Burning Moon is a low budget film. <br /> Acting: terrible! I did not care about dubbing. I found it to be a joke in Ettenbach's "Premetos" (Great Picture). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not miss all the movies Good directors like Jorge Butterzez and Olaf Ittanbach are also in the same gore and subjects. Check out Primates, Blood House, Scram and Nickmontics.
