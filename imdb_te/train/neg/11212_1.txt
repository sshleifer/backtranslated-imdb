<br /> <br /> In the premise of the film is good enough, but with the role of the sub-part, it is murky and dull. <br /> <br /> The film does not work because of the nature of the death of spoilers, this is not a murderer but a murder. There is also a mystery that reveals that some kind of flash through a kind of kind of justice will do the degree of justice. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so this woman called her sister and heard her message. It is dull and frustrating. <br /> <br /> It is very nice with some polishing and better performance.
