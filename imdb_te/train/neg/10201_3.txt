This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect criminal execution and investigating police officer, who ignored all evidence, knew who was guilty immediately. The audience waits for the audience to wait around the entire film. As a result, each episode "Colombo" or "Murder She Wrote" is like. The director himself refers to the story of Hockney by showing the police officer looking up the episode of the talkie! The story fills up to 90 minutes, but the director insisted on using every cliche in every 120 minutes book. Skip this, you do not have anything.
