I guess it's a long film and record breaking film featuring 30 actors after Johnny Dushman (2002). <br /> <br /> The film is based on Kargil War as the title suggests, but the problem is that many characters and romantic subtitles and many characters' songs are boring being. <br /> <br /> A huge cast of Ajay Devgan is long and Saif is good for his part and his first film with Kareena, Abhishek Manoj Bajpai is wasting his conversations. , Sunil's fun Akshay Khanna is the rest of the queen is good, Isha is good
