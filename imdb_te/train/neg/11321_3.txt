You can not really go too far when the opening story is not so great. The motion of the blood of the cyborg needs is mere doping. <br /> The script blas√© '. Actors do not have much to work with. Sets in the desert have been set up to reduce costs. If there is a desert in the background, the movie does not have a budget. <br /> <br /> If the narrative is okay the budget is okay. "Solarababes" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of good work from $ $. But the film appears to have to remove their change to buy a sandwich for the cameraman. <br /> Finally, this film is doing the biggest crime in all: it's not full! It ends with a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just odd. <br /> <br /> Just the bad.
