This movie is like every other Dutch movie, so you enjoy movies such as Turks fruit and De Kleine Blonde Dude. Then you will be right in this case (although both are good stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts adequately, but also ends with nothing to do with a good scene storyline. There was a lot of nudity (but me and others found that girl attractive), the dialogue was ridiculous (we did a lot of annoyance to notice the other movie), and some scenes cut out everyone out a owl riffs, like a random scene of this totally anything ... Nothing was done and then only one sentence was mentioned once "as you heard what happened ... Enu been there "). In some places they look nice because it's the only reason I have given a 2 ... that. We have a sneak preview (here in Holland we have a fantastic system of sneak previews because you pay less for regular films and you do not know what movie you do not have in theaters). If you really want to watch a good Dutch movie Watch Temmick or Zwertbuck, I have my advice to stay away from this film.
