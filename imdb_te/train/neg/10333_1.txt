The fascinating and simple series of Fox has come down to Tripeek. <br /> <br /> In the first season, Dark Angel was not on Jessica Alba's list, but was listed on the "must watch" week. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the power of the fox - the better tune "storyline, within three episodes of the season opener, they have completely lost me as a viewer (not even Jessica Alba!) I have added new roles in the second season to be more ridiculous and unpredictable The continuity and reliability of the new storylines exhibit a thin stretch. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (never Hollywood): If it worked, do not screw up with it! br> azjazz
