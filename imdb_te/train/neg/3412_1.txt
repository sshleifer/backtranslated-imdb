First, IFC runs the town and country, and now it is. The difference between that stinker and the pink panther rip off is the town and country watchful. It's not. <br /> <br /> I do not think this cast was signed. Belushi is particularly irritating. His scene with Candy (doing a Z-grade Dome Delux) is a torture. The real "crime" (along with the green light) Shepard character: a Monte Carlo Casino's wife for half a million bucks! If you buy that, I might be interested in having some marine scenery property in Arizona!
