Well what can I say, there are B-Grade movies and B-Graded Movies and it definitely comes into second. It's also clear from the film's makers that it's not a reliable image (take a look at the closing credits) from which it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> This plot is mainly murdered by a psycho killer. He accidentally meets some experimental acids combined with his genetic material and then falls into the snow. Killer will now take in the form of a snowman - if you believe it. Snowman, Jack Frost, placed him behind bars after the country's urban sheriff. In doing so, Jack Frost ends with killing half the city. <br /> <br /> This film does not have any real fears and reminds me of the 50's B-grade films alone. It alone is worth watching for a smile. Time to pass away is a picture.
