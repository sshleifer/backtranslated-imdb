Wow. I have read about this movie and it's terrible to see, and my gosh, I smell in St. Louis. Where did I start? National lampoons attempted to win the animals 5 years later, but they lost the mark completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Regert (Boon from the Animal House). Apparently, he does not work again, so guys in National Lampnus are probably saying, "Hey, we're shooting a C ** pp, would it be?" Peter "Well, I'm not doing so long, why not?" <br /> <br /> He played a great role in the familiar house, but he could not get this little sorry for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Specialist Jason Cooper (Ryegert) leaves him for his wife, and she needs to find herself. It's so strange that they are in a truly happy marriage. So he chases her, where she goes, and Cooper is responsible for the child. This, of course, leads to burning the house for him, losing a number of kids, and sleeping with an assortment of New York bimbos (including ever so young Diane Lane). Then the wife returns, wants the children, and the film ends with a coin flip, which determines the fate of the child. The idea is actually a little clever, but the director is hard. As they fall asleep, the characters appear all over and they are doped. Sorry Boon, your legacy is in conflict with this defeat. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br Pretty girl, recently graduated college, is not sure what to do in her life. So she becomes a slut, sleeping with some mega wealthy people, they will not take their money when they die, and she will not stop until she is the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Iyos, I United States). Once again, it may be funny, and I'm not afraid of Corsair (real life on Dusbury), her performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Rookie Cop Brent Falcon (Robbie Benson) with famous Stan Nargers (Richard Widmark) here Falcone is the youngest, Nagurski, really, just gave up caring.He sees muggings, attacks, you name it, and never interfere. He also claims that if he is anything, he will even succeed, even if Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi) takes action, the police call him, a crime, but his lawyer to protect him. <br /> Once more, may be funny, Deliberately campy, but goodness, no power, Henry Jaglum and Bob Girly have their names in this volume Should be ashamed. I am writing, I think it is not bad, but there are ideas, but the implementation has been removed, as well as the Iranian hostage crisis in the rescue effort. I have to be a part of this film, I think it's clear, it's horrible. <br /> Then again, I saw. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this worst is that Dr. John Fill has scored (repeat "going back to the movies") and the movie is more than an hour and a half. Show the movie in the movie classes under the heading "Never Do When Movie Production". This script needs to remain on the shelf because it's bad.
