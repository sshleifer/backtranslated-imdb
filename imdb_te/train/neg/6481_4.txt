<br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (A) is the finest animated feature of all of the finest quality, a grand music. Score, and general audience. In contrast, the Little Mermaid 2 is primarily targeted at younger children because it is natural, reflecting the child's self-esteem, music bouncer and less dramatic, and the end seems to be a recession. <br /> <br /> The Mermaid 2 starts when the baby Melody is on the side of Ariel's family. Immediately without any visual instructions to help play, a large tentacles attracts the baby. I laugh, wait a minute and it's not funny, the baby is attacking! Okay, I should stop laughing. <br /> <br /> Throughout this feature, Melody feels superhuman, and I imagined how many children were themselves. <br /> <br /> This feature, in the role of Melodi, fought with Morgan on her face in the end. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melody has many aerial problems except Rivers. The Queen turns herself to her father by limiting herself from the Ariel Sea, while King Triton controls Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody rebelled against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music is for the first time more mentally moving. This sequel has a group of songs, but most orchestra does not work. <br /> <br /> The ending in the first film was strong and stimulating. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. It's definitely more targeted for children, because instead of imposing the end and leaving you flee away, this end leaves you thinking, "It's time for recess!" In the end, this film is fun for kids, so we should let them enjoy.
