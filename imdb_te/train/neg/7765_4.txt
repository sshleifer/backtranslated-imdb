Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about the movie. It has since 1975 and Chamberlain and Kurtis, and so can the bad ways of bad acting and storyteller's kid's time be forgiven? <br /> <br /> If some people get sentiment about this book because they read this book. (I do not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never think that viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Do I feel sad about the fact that the English speaking actors behave as their French counterparts?
