We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crash. We have a killer stop motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay, so let's call this movie CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots named Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". We did not really have a damn thing in this film and had no sheriff who had no hesitation. That's worse, we're over half of the film and we've inserted the bad guy! No worry, he stole a shop to indicate a bad man and indicated to him a bad man, where he popped him somewhere near the lake and followed the woods with his sole purpose, dinosaur snack food. It should work. <br /> <br /> Complete, clumsy mess, this movie. Its logic changes your mind to force you to laugh at you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as "stop motion supervisor". After this, I guess when he bundled with Charles Band for a number of years, in the nineties and earned money to pay the money. Dinosaur effects are lovely and the whole picture is pretty horrendous. Unfortunately, it is only said about the good thing. <br /> Good badness? Yes. There must be enough reason to keep in mind the mind-bending logic list. Otherwise, Arnie & Mitch is going to be trick. 3/10 and 8/10
