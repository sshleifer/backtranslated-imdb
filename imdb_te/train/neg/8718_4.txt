The third installment of the "Cornosoret" trilogy, Keelon tries to kill two cousins ​​of the Cops-Quality Army Commandos, two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I told 4 diners of sympathy and my relationship. Certainly the worst of the movie trilogy, it can not really take seriously. More importantly, looking at this film I can not help but notice some interesting parallels between "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogy. The first installment of the two franchises is a dark, disturbing picture that turns into a fictional classic, the second one "foreign" repo, and the third tongue-in-cheek, almost slapstick (deliberately or otherwise) film rolling on the floor you laugh. Similarly, such as "Extreme" franchises, all "cornosaurs" films are entirely related. They only take the name of the franchise to raise interest in "sequels", I guess. Obviously, "Cornosor" and "Extro" work here, but if you see three images of two franchisees you can come back and forth between the two.
