When it was released, I thought it was one of the greatest films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese and some other filmmakers like him, there are more linguistic movies than this language, but it's a pretty brutal attack on a deaf. Hey, I'll take a lot, but this is ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard an untold number of verse use plus f-words in the name of the Lord in vain. How many people have gone from the theater watching it in 1990? <br /> Surprisingly, Jennifer Jason-Leag, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Ricki Lake. From this movie, Stephen Lang appears to have improved his film, at least in "Gods and Generals", "Stonewall" plays the role of Jackson. The Long character here is just the opposite: the character in the movie is probably the worst trash guy and a fall in love with a mutual exchange. <br /> <br /> The disappointment, apprehension, semi-pornography, repulsion: These are some of the few used features - some liberal critics - describing this story, which is even worse in the novel. In fact, some well-known critics praised the film, all serious lips. However, they are the only ones. Many critics have faced criticism, and almost all the paid people. <br /> <br /> Do you like this? It is an average, unhealthy image: one of the worst of the "modern age". That means if you do not enjoy the abuse of children, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, and only two straight hours of inhuman and pessimistic people. No thanks.
