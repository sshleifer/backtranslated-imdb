Vendors are great with million dollars. I do not know how he came with this film! Spt11 and the American Society's perspective is hopeful, giving it to 2 in ten. But this is not a movie. A great idea (west-east clash). The most important things that happen in the Middle East and issued on the screen of MAC * An American girl's fingers are actually at the level of stupidity (because she's just ignorant about the facts) are not well-shaped. The important thing is the idea given by religion is something funny to me. The ending scene says Lana is just quiet and try to hear. And background music "I will pray" .The thing is not really about religion but it ends. If you close your eyes and pray, you should see the truth. The lights are already shining on the truth. This is no one can see. PS: "My home is not a place, it is only 10 people out of 10 people." But the film's production is backwards. (By the way, the best young American in the US is not the best of the "someone" mentioned below, they are simply "poor" and "helpless" the Army government needed for the good phecks they signed for the army!)
