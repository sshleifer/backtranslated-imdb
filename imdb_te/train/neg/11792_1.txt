This is the cheapest movie of the 21st century. It's all the way low quality, but ultimately it comes down ... everything. <br /> <br /> Under all actors, particularly the main character, Anne Fletcher (Simone Mackin). Anne asked: "Why are you looking fussy?" The correct answer is because she does not work. <br /> <br /> Anyway (the world is going to be destroyed, her friend dies, she is being eliminated), she is the same stupid laugh in her face. <br /> This is the picture, the B-character. It also has a back cover description (at least in Finland). The text describes Locke Gray-Wessel, Capitol-Wassel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, having two characters Fletcher and Sea monsters
