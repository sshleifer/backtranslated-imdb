The storyline is ok. Akshay Kumar is as good as ever and good thing about the film. Kareena Kapoor appeared badly. Her size was zero and lonely, but she did not appear to be a good lean. Anal Kapoor does not know why he was raped by such a bad character. There is not much to do for him in the film. As it is Yashraj's film, it does not mean that an actor must accept the role. Ali Khan's delay. Indian directors and producers start to think about Indian customers. What are we Fools !!!! What they think, they show that 2 men teeters take on a SWAT team and we believe them. Indian police trying to arrest some criminals are stupid ... they take up a full 100 guild squad and there are no people around the palace. The action is worst and I have never seen such bad action. Akshay Kumar fired at him in the middle of a 30-40 police circle. Though no one touched the police bullet, he killed policemen. Crap. <br /> <br /> I think the combat director who thinks about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not watching this film.
