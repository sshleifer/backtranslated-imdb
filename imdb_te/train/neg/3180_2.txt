No boring image! In sum, Nana Patekar defeated her daughter Karisma Kapoor and tried to escape from the village, her son. Can anyone tell me boring ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was poorly executed. Some of the Canadian local and village scenes are well portrayed. However, the whole cinematography has come down. This story may be great, but the picture is just like that. <br /> <br /> The song "Ishk Kamina" was only five minutes in the entire movie. Besides, the film is the worst piece.
