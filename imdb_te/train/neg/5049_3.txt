We really liked this band and really hated this movie. We are ready to forgive the fact that our favorite character is not Joe (it's not like the writers / producers can not do anything about that). The writing is poor, the script is sub par. What really irritates us: 1. When they both realized that dating was real two friends, they simply did not put up stupid (ultimately humiliating) competition - but because they were macho competition guys, they really wanted Natalie because they were not really. 2. Although two boys can not pick up before reuniting, Natalie suddenly decides she really loved one and is now ready to marry him? (And that he was really a good man, the writers were next to a coin and then spit at some convenient moment in her film). 3. Blair talks about the idea that she does not want to have children and that her husband wants to have children, and she agrees with her happily.
