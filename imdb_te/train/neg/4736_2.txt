The film deserves 2/10. Since I was less than Azimy 1, the girl was 1.5 stars, (I'm sorry I think that pretty girl is a highlight of movies), and 0.5. I have 1 seating in Azumi 1 and 2. I was surprised that I could sit by it. <br /> <br /> Talk about the plus points in the picture. That girl. Ueto Aya is beautiful. It has everything to save the whole movie. If the main character is actually male, I'm sure most people (including me) are touching all of the film. <br /> Now talk about minus points. First, with our and repeat scenes, it is a real drag. Nachi and Azumi's scenes are coming back. It seems way more like shooting play. Simple Japanese dramas also love flashbacks and this movie. Secondly, the film is very unrealistic in historical setting. I do not mind dubious movies. But this film is like a poor way of showing creativity, thrown in the work ninjas like bears and spider webs ... It reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover, the director of films to die of "i-dont-no" in the film's effects on how to effect the effects of the death of all people (literally) all ... cut people who do not recognize their head ... etc. Etc. ... most of these show up the show. The anime effect seems to be strong in this movie. It greatly reduces the presentation. Third, Azumi should not be considered a murderer. As she is a woman she looks like a guy-army to me. I do not think you are killing the assassins in the army camps. When I killed Kiyomasa Cato at Azimi 1, I thought she was "a murderer". Finally, the plot was fine in both. Its simple plot of development and surprising.
