The next part of the Broken Dark Horror Fest III. Not a slasher or filled with gore. This experimental thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis has plenty of broken glass and glasses. A successful radiologist, Gina Macquay (Lena Headley), was dirty with control of a strange world in her life. When her father (Richard Jenkins) attended the party's birthday party, the mirror was not surprising, as the guests were not miraculously. It is really strange when witnesses see her spitting woman in a single car driving a London street. Gina is keen on her Doppelganger apartment and finds her photo with her father. She goes away and gets involved on the head. Then secretly her boyfriend is not the same; Her friends are not easy for the perfect family and to believe her. Gina is next to her? Is she in the parallel world? Her nightmares are more terrible ... she is broken. <br /> If you can identify this difference ... it's not easy. Editing is not the hardest. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melville Ppard, William Armstrong, Mitchell Duncan and Ulrich Tamsen.
