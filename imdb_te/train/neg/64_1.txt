This film is terrifying. The end is definitely terrible. There is no plot for the movie. The film is good about the film by Robert DeWall and James Earl Jones. Their performances are fantastic! The only problem is that the film did not do any justice to their acting performances. If the script is close to capturing a half good story, it will be worth watching. Instead, the performances of Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted in the awful hero of God ... or lack of. I'm only waiting to wait around the film ... I'm not just a dialogue dialogue between a finished movie ... This is nothing more than a normal dialogue that will be back in time. There is nothing special about the characters. Robert Dwall is a rambling, aging, drunk, and exclusive to the role of Old Man. The whole picture, including the end, is worth nothing. When the movie is over, I'm surprised ... I'm waited I'm waiting for the whole movie to wait for the movie's value. It never happened! The characters of the characters suddenly seemed to be clear that this film was really over and I realized that my life was not watching for 2 hours of my life. It's not a story too. The whole picture takes place in a valuable time one day. That's it. It is a day in the life of some southern (and death) in a garden. What will happen in one story in a single day (other than the movie training day)? All actors' performances are awesome, but they have lost a movie's disappointment ... You can also say that it is a movie.
