In these years I saw WrestleMania match card, I was stunned because I was stunned and could not control myself. <br /> It starts with ... it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, because I'm angry with hell for how much money I need again. I mean, you'll see WrestleManias 22 (my favorite one), it's going to be a classic and you get the same expectation and the average waste of every now and then. When HBK tap out I have a moment in the total show it's ruined !!!! HBK's very moment lost to John CENA !!!!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / peacemaker. He triple H! After seeing WrestleMania I could not see WWE. I'm starting to see (fortunately) again. The WrestleMania 24 WrestleMania Wrestler (WrestleMania 24) <br /> <br /> "It is perfectly designed for" Mania 23 "and we've given us memorable moments. <br /> If you see someone in Restmanyus before you, as a fan of me) please see the same mistake I made and leave behind WWE. And if you look angry and start watching again and see WrestleMania 24, it's completely classic.
