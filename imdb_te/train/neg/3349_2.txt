I read the novel of Shirley Jackson, some of which I have come to understand for some time. I said I was less than this film. On the other day I remember jumping once when I saw it, I could not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. But it is not. I saw in the role of the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film because there was nothing else to see. Lali Talor is the character of such a lad. I do not like a bit, about whiny people. Moreover, the man in the film recalled me about his voice and face cartoon Dudley Dorothy. I do not relate to all of the characters. Quigon, lyricist Liam Neeson made an admirable job of trying to get some performance through the film. <br /> <br /> In half a quarter, the film scream on the film! There is at least some entertainment value. At least if they do not have any story filling them with Goths deaths or attractive females. Nothing to do with it. <br /> <br />
