If the amazing team of Shonda Rhimes is somewhere out of the outsourced outsourced version of offshore, is it probably a median home? The "PP" reminds me of some of the most difficult ones, the first of the 1 episode of David Kelly Flicks (picket fences, Alley McBile and now Boston Legal). The silly cases they get are very extreme, they are just sympathetic or sad. And it's really playing good medical dramas - dramatic situations you fear, "this may be me" sentimental. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, but the plot lines are dead and can not bring back to life. I'm a doctor, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays a very unreliable, ineffective, unethical, uneducated doctor. Who wrote the moral and transformation / counter-transformation courses at Stanford. Any one should give the Ethics code to read them (part of the nose-bleeding wife and the doctor's involvement). <br /> <br /> "A very old-fashioned, 40-year-old woman looks weird, and this is not a talented actress she does not believe in it And not very well delivered - Addison in her youthful invasion towards the person she likes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
