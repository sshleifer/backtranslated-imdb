Jennifer Cassie (Gina Phillips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to her upbringing house, and she inherits her sister (Fay Dewey) from her deceased sister, still unknown. Jennifer decides to sell that she is a terrible necessity of money for Granny's eagerness. She also begins to have recurring recurring nightmares of a secret crow. There is no one really involved in this film. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, quiet, and eccentric, the grandmother seemed to be hateful, sad, and even eccentric. <br /> <br /> The film is good and well made, but I am hard to find out what happened with them. <br /> My grade: C-
