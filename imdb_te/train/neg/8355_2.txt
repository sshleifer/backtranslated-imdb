Wanda Nevada is a real fantasy film using circa thoughts of 1979 about having sex 13 years old. Script, motion and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences are confident. Characters are commonly spoken with a simplified picture, which is common in films intended for 10 cm, but there are also several sexual references, such as the Shields character and graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy at some level, but it is never funny, adventurous movie, but plot and actions are poor, children's film, pedophilia and child rape introduce as real opportunities. It is also a buddy film, age film, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual film, a journey, and a Western. The overall effect is huge stupidity with a dirty twist. Wanda Nevada is a waste of time unless you want to see many wonderful shots of Grand Canyon. It manages to do well.
