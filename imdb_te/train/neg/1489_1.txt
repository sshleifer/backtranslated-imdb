This bad beginning, worse, and eventually the girl attacked the old woman at the end I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed it and that it would kill C ** of death. Avoid this film of good cinematography and some nude shots, and I'm almost convinced if I was 14 and Jenna Jameson did not see a million times naked. If anyone thinks that this film is necessary, I would recommend to spend a lot of time with your time, for example, I tried to cram a Lego home in your boom, which is a good start. I heard that the film is not an original version, and this cut version is clear that all the plot, and clearly nakedness is very clear, I want to see very original, I'm coming back to my life with someone close to Christian Will!
