Fury Flight General Torm Burns (Angus Mac Innes) starts with an unofficial test flight of X-77, a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to be literally invisible. General Burns is doing well until his top pilot Colonel Ratcher (Steve Toussaint) job and the X-77 disappears, Rather is more literal than Barnes flying to Northern Afghanistan and Black Piston Stone (Vincenzo Nicole) plans to fly X-77 into the US airspace, It kills many people. General Barnes is suffering from losing his plane and is trying to get it back in one of the army's John Sands (co-author & executive producer Steven Seagal) and kill all bad people in the process ... <br> American, British & Romanian -The third film directed by the producer Michael Kishch, in which the horrific Shadow Man (2006) & Attack Ors (2007), after which he was directed by Seagal, and an unsuspecting public, thanks to the work of co-operation between the two, no more have escaped. Clearly Fury's Flight, a nearly-scene-word-word-word remake of Michael Thunderoff's Black Thunder (1988) to share the same Threorg with the same name. I have never had to change things like names though I have never seen Black Thunder & therefore both are not comparable. Fury Flight is a terrible film, poorly designed & written waste seagull is unique these days. Although it is not slow, the character's poor, it's totally cliche, things are random, the plot is poor, and there is no argument behind the events and it is a lazy product until it always persuades the viewer that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or following proper military policies. Action scenes are dull and there is no enthusiasm in it, the villains are thrown into heroes and it is the worst seagull made. <br /> <br /> The Fury's flight is mostly designed stock footage which is not well matched, the background can change, change people's clothes, area changes, the quality of the sky & cinema is very clear, Seagal also never goes anywhere near a plane in this. The action sequences have shoot-outs so badly editing those who are edgy & of course who are breaking the hands of the seagal people. The whole product is very inexpensive & very small. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb has a total budget of around $ 12,000,000. Although it is set in Afghanistan, it looks like a battlefield torn desert flight of fury that portrayed my local forest, which was originally shot in Romania & did not make an amazing Afghanistan in the Romanian rural areas. <br /> <br /> Fury of Fury is a horror action film, boring, amazing and yet another scene of another movie scene. Another really lazy & poorly produced thriller from Seagal, I still have no sadness?
