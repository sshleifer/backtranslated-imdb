Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (like Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop". He is a father of a young immigrant Danny de la Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants to be the best man in his upcoming marriage. Savalas are tough, but the owner Eddie Albert (like Commander Moffat) may be tougher. You should stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (Chico Suarez). <br /> <br /> When you hear that "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" are criticized, you need to know clearly about the "border". Otherwise, you may not have a stomach for the scene that killed "real" cows. Although it is not very valuable, De La Paz and Cecilia Kamacho (as Lena) stole the show. <br /> Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny de la Paz, Eddie Albert
