Mick Mike was probably a mistrotropic comedian, so he was interested in seeing what he was doing with creative creativity on the cinema. Unfortunately, although it is not ridiculous, because some of them (I can not say much), and Mr. Mike has done a good job of translating his mentally unbalanced screen into visual papers. The problem is that the quality of technology (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name) is so awkward of God, the film is inexplicable. It receives a credit that produces some outfits called "PKO Productions", but it does not produce; Mike stole one of the cameras from the Microsoft SNL set and made a whole afternoon of the afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal is to torture the audience, but it also deserves some basic standards, such as watching, listening or understanding of the things that are surprising. However, the DVD is not in vain: it includes Bill Murray's homosexuality for Dodgown and three "Mr. Mike's Loved Love Bedtime Stories" from SNL. Plus, the movie's "Cat Swim" section is a great scene that has caught you looking at freak out of someone. 3/10
