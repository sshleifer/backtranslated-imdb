Watching this reality show, which is being screened on the poor movie of police police officers. The only reasonable suspicion that a "stop" can lead to a potential cause leading to the completeness of the circumstances that lead to "pot down" outside of the foot, and then why it can be clarified. The officer went into one's pocket and was forbidden from extortion, scene, because it was not, although not many places were arrested and they were supervisor. A warrant's report on radio does not have a warrant's original existence if there is an actual warrant in the reporting. If the distributor reads from a computer printout, it fits the arrest, but it is not mandatory. Because I did not see a de-claim from CBS (I'll lose it), CBS comes into trouble.
