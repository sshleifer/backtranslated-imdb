The film has a lot of silly plot holes. He will die in his practice, watching his master's practical Kung Fu first. That's good for me. And at the end of the film, he sees the use of Kun-Fu, who still finds his master when he was kidnapped. Is it possible? <br /> <br /> This show is perfect for Joy Chau fans, and the depth of film development, cinematography styles and the unfolding of the plot. Anyone like basketball team captain (who forgot his name) and the idols player Li Giio is similar to each other, so you notice that they are the same person? Long hair, sunshine boy look, tall and strong. Two of them looked as if the young ladies came out of a collective production factory designed to parse the products that make the wild chatter in orgasm. These two actors are not worthy of contributing to the film industry. <br /> <br /> Jokes are lame and not funny. <br /> <br /> The scene of Jay Chow's 4 Masters returns to help him in the basketball court, reducing their rivals Alla Royal Rumble style into a nonsense point. For all, when the 4 Masters won the fight, the audience began to encourage, the match continued. Is this really a WTF? Moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, thanks to Jay Chow's excellent Kung Fu skills. <br /> <br /> He has captured the kung fu skills because the show shows him the skills by observing his owner. <br /> <br /> In short, it is Jay Chow-Flick (instead of the usual "chick flick"). . Jay Chow see your fan only. If all of the flavors in the movies are one of the top 50 of the IMDb list, this is not for you.
