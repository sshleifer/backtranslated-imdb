To play a widow to take revenge on a man who betrayed her revolutionary (for example) she is driven around by a dumb manservant (?) Sutton; Savalas was initially the bloodiest insurgent to the film's main antagonist and did not send his own cousin Letter at the very beginning of the film; The villain in the film turns into Landa, the first scene in the film is our epic hero-turned-priest Shah! Fernando Ray, who plays the role of a blind farmer, is the only person who can recognize the rebel shock, and finally he is not just a front, it's nothing more! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and gets stranger from there!
