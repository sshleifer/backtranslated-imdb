<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. Production values ​​are very low, which makes it fun to look at reality. I remind myself of a robot monster made of a man in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In a scene, suddenly the victim is cut off their hand and leg. The geezh, hard belief but the Black Night scene from the Holy Grail is more realistic. The victim kept wondering why "no one would pass the shell" and "shouting it was just a meat injury, I was worse". <br /> <br /> "Gladiator / ghost" is also a stitch. The ultimate outcome is the crazy between the appalling inexpensive apparel and the guy's unusual behavior on it. <br /> <br /> A bad image to be honest. <br /> <br /> Slow motion auto accident as seen in the movie. <br /> <br />
