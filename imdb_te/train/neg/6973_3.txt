I also know that the film did not exist until I found the old old VHS copy deep in my dirty horror closet. The title "insects" in the box and the illustrations behind it make it clear that it is another small and poorly built 80's horror film. They certainly do not expect a pleasant scenario and, of course, is fun, as long as you're not bored by seeing a huge amount of cheesy make-up effects. The horror film that is considered to be valuable is the essential ingredient in "blue monkey"! The plot is humorous and most unrealistic, the acting performances are painful and the total shortage of suspense. After the always-famous trend of "big-bug" films, "Blue Monkey" organizes a new and unknown species of species, removing doctors and patients of remote hospital. This gigantically over-sized critter producers are not even more avoided about the original source! We know, it is not from the outer regions, initially survived from the tropical plant. Except for this, this new type of pesticide suddenly comes suddenly, there is no explanation! As I mentioned, your hopes for playing a brilliant screen did not come. The first half of the film is a little better gore and a couple disturbing characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcohol lady!) But the second half (when the entire hospital is put on the quarantine) is fun enough, horrific boring. Moreover, "Blue Monkey" begins to paint the old (and better) films exuberantly. Climax arrives, they clearly out of the budget because the lighting is very weak and the guy is no longer a camaraderie in the suit. "Blue Monkey" is worth a peek if you really get bored or want to see every 80's horror movie you've really made. B-film fans may find John Vernon ("Outer Space from Killer Klowns", "Curtains"), which serves as Roger's short and meaningless role clinic.
