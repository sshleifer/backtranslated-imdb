William Shutner is patient with small dosages. Unfortunately, his role was dropped as a little embarrassing, and that moderately entertaining, seemingly fit to expand his character and surpass it. As was the case in the original Star Trek series. I guess the American humor never understood, which often goes to the top of the message. Vote with my feet. I can not see that presentation, it's insulting, the rest of the cast is good. Shatner's exaggerated role also affects James Spader's performance. But to demonstrate the way the majority community is going, I guess. I do not travel in the same ways. Frank
