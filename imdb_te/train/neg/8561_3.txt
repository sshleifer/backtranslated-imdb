Cowboys could not leave you a little sore in the saddle. Johns certainly is not one of the best movies. There is no mistake for me, no John Wayne's move has always been good spots. And this is a fair share. But it moves slowly than all the pictures and does not fit the desired aspirations. Bruce Dern again works as a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the film. The children in the picture are average but well cast. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for eight to fifteen years of age. <br /> You will have a good family mobilization with your kids. Just get to know, there is a couple of scenes you may want to consider before you let young people see it. But many children I love have seen this movie. They can be children by seeing their children grow up.
