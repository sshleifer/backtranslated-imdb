I can not believe what honestly goes for entertainment now. Yup, I absolutely sounds like a child's image - not sick, drugs, drug abuse, dangerous parents, the hell out of hell, African Americans, the police and the fat people in the middle of the night! Changing a dead woman into a house and a house and keeping her beloved husband in prison for more than 20 years, and scaring neighbors - how good it is for children. <br /> <br /> "Today this picture might live some of the scenery - why rub in their faces? For adult audiences - It's just not boring, contrived and predictable - and the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking / wife friends. What a great thing for kids - does it sound like a children's film? Even computer animation and good voice work is not enough to rid your heart of this, save your money, save your time and save your children's minds - Ice Age, Monsters Inc. , The Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - any of them better than this horrible movie Spielberg and Gemkis - you are insulting both for the billing of such a disaster and child / family film!
