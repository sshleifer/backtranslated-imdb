This is one of the few films I can do over a few years before w / something happens. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not really good. Alec Baldwin is very good, but the plot is the weakest of the best. The cast is pretty good in what they are given, but again you are not as good as the script. Baldwin was directing this, and he did not direct it all, I read it or baked the shoots very well, but he definitely had some potential. Although his work in "30 Rock" is not the smallest of intellectual, he must keep him busy for a while. I hope fun is a La Seinfeld show arrows, but perhaps even that period. 9 years it went on. So if you want to see that you have not seen much from the movie, it really does not really hate you for it. Last time I finally did not remember the last one, the final release of the film was only released on DVD. Alex Baldwin is good to see & again since Anthony Hopkins has seen their amazing yet many people "The Edge". Take some fantastic picture for some real fun now.
