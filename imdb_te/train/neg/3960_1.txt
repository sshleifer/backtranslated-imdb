Hi, I'm not a theater major or a sophisticated movie comer ... because I think this movie is "boring" and "dumb". <br /> <br /> I've rented the movie due to Charles Bronson ... but what time waste the boy ... just 2 guys sitting in a treasury and talking to talking ... The DVD on the DVD is so "DARK" ... I have it <br /> <br /> I realized it was a 1968 film ... but if they put it on the DVD then they would have to do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> I am completely amazed to see the high marks on the IMDB for this film ... I said the other people who commented on this film were not that I was sophisticated.
