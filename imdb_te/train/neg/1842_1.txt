It was my first film review in IMDb. I had to register after seeing this movie. I can not be in good conscience to avoid this film being reviewed by me. <br /> <br /> "My Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weiss, Christopher Walken, and more, I hate the film, there is a plot, but who cares when there is no script." No, and not plain, conditions are provided, the flow of events is slow and somewhat unilateral, the characters are unreliable and inadequate, and the story, the good m Ranga, stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of money, do not get the picture, it is not worth looking at your watch. Please ... Do not look for it, I beg you!
