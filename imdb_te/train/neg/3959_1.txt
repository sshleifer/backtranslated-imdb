This is one of the biggest pieces of the trip I have ever scene, the camera is trying to be elegant at work but it really just looks like the whole thing red shoe diaries, but without sex, the only reason I bought this is that I wanted to try dvd and this is probably my life Buy the worst, and never find that dvd ever put you on The soundtrack is really inefficient and the film is made with endless repeats from the first two films, I do not want anyone to be so cute in this movie and I try to do the original movie, I'm very sorry for this review and they got the right to reproduce the items from the first two Then edit it again You can repeat the film, which is about 1 3rd footage of the original, which concerns the standards of film school students, do not buy the movie. If you watch the microwaves and the shining lights in the microwave is the only entertainment this dvd can offer! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER UNBABLE GARBAGE! Voting system only allowed 0/10.
