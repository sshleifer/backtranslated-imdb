As many have said, it's a terrible picture from every aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Many complain that it has been filmed on 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was filmed in the video, but not 'cheap' video. <br /> <br /> Lighting, White Balancing, shooting technique, editing are very painful. <br /> <br /> Many product and editing techniques were used as a product mess. <br /> <br /> Without a white balance in the restaurant kitchen, harsh, inconsistent lighting, hand-held shooting (so Woody Allen), choppy editing (another Allen technique) scenes are embarrassing; <br /> <br /> We do not have any experiments in this film. It's worth looking at how bad it is to be amazed.
