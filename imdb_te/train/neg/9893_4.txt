I only hope that scientists / ancient historians have seen "Cleopatra" or they made it smile. The film is not just horror than "gladiator" (which is less pronounced by historic deficiencies and the least written script). Octavius, a senior heir in Seesiar, is very worried before the death of the guilty: at the age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton is more than James Bond's reference to him, while "Cesar, Julius Caesar" Billy Jane is a ludicrous Mark Antony. <br /> <br /> Leonar Verella seductive Pharaoh (she does not look pretty in her real life) tries to be trustworthy but unbelievable. <br /> This is a warning for all these historians - this movie is not true to life!
