The film is seriously awful and rape is rape. On the surface, it may be a brave movie about rape but if you take it under the surface, what is the most positive message about rape. Aishwarya rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim because he can not bear her to act as a woman. She needs a man to help her. When society makes jibes about her and she throws comments at her, she does not stand up for herself. <br /> <br /> Director (Satish Kaushik) went to the wrong way by filming a weak and compelling mass rape victim. It is more effective to paint a strong woman who rebelled against her enemies. The director is well known for being the Devil. His films are usually filled with weak women, but try to hide them in controversial roles. <br /> <br /> As the character is controversial, it does not mean that the character is stronger. <br /> <br /> When Aishwarya is raped, she is the most disgruntled scene in the film 'Cleansing'. She is delighted with her father who feels dirty now. Although he appreciated the Shah forbidding the victims of rape in such a shop, he would not show whether his father was wrong if his daughter was to get that kind of thing. In this way we are left in a messy message about rape. <br /> <br /> There is no need for a funny movie. Even so, comedy is not funny. While Ash Kapoor is engraved in his role, Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout. This music is normal except the title track, which is pretty portrayed (the brightness of the film). The character of Sonali Bendre is despair and meaning. Overall, what a great image to remember is that there is a terrible mish-mash that gives some spectators some terrible indigestion.
