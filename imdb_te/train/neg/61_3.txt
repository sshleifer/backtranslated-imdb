There is no drop of Sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys", this allegation makes the title of comedy Neal Simon's unique contradictory moment. Simon, who received the script from his play (which went to the Anonymous), compared to the old age with irrational behavior - and the worst, clumsy, gourfing, average-enthusiastic irrational behavior. Walter Mattau dropped out of acting as an adult instrumentalist who spoke to a former television comedy partner George Burns (which was said to be a band for 43 years, how it was.
