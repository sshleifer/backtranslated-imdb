I saw the movie and I was surprised! Robert Carlyle was not Hitler, but unfortunately he was a Hitler. There is a movie, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler did not hit anyone, he did not beat his fists, but the fist of the soldiers. Mean ?? Another thing: this is very clear, Hitler is the scoundrel, more intelligent than what he has shown in this film. He did not accept Germany as leader, because he could see that he was bad. <br /> <br /> Real Hitler did not show people his evil side. <br /> Do you think any of you have seen Yankees "Der Untersegang" or "The Danfal"? These amazing actors, a great movie. Its German film. This theme of Nazi-Germany, Germany can not be portrayed by people who do not know anything. People! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a great time for people to think about it. Great image across the world.
