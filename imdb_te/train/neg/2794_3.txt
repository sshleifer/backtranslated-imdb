Well, I thought I'm a musician because maybe I'll watch this movie on the TMC, nothing better. So far one of the most deadly mistakes in my life, and it's only half working. I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. But I did not get that pleasure. Even "musicians" are not very good. I hoped for some to laugh, but it's not exactly they're trying to throw it in a liner. Now I have to sit and relax before Pulp Fiction begins. Or perhaps something good. And now I sit here and I have 10 lines
