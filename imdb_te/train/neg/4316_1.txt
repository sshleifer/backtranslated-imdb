I was not generally exaggerated, but after honoring the two decades Academy Awards, honestly these Year Awards were a poor example, total cruelty, and insulting example of the perfect stupidity I've ever made. Misfortune to bear witness. I'm not talking about the awards- generally, who won who won, who lost, and who was not even nominated, but it's always like and it's just fine. Responsible. <br /> <br /> How did he "play" without Keats and Harvey's "stars" and "non-stars" al Pacino in the last few years in the last few years about 45 seconds saying he was "boring" And the emotion statement is behind. Nevertheless, they do not pay the honor of showing their faces when reading their names, to the shepherds who stumble on the cattle, silently silence them when they lose, thrill the podium to reject them, and force the readers to read their statements with their backs. All of those items were "non-stars" -and without the artists, the movies are not present and most of them get a chance to face their companions and their audience. <br /> <br /> The stars can not do much better. It's more than funny when it's a few extra seconds for the winners of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood's talents to beg for their lectures. Chris Rock, as host, the Academy is not as flimsy and controversial as he hopes, or even if he is so funny. His opening remarks for Sean Penn are almost (but not quite) offensive, and his comments on the show are more than just threatening. In fact, he can hardly be condemned if he knows that he is small in any host. Ultimately, Chris Rock was never before: a non-entity. <br /> <br /> Even musical numbers can not be performed properly. Beyonce sang well, but there is no reason why she should act in three of the five songs. Despite Drexler, another example of totally disrespectful to the artist proposed to George Drexler's Antonio Banderas is not clear since singing his own song based on "speech". <br /> <br /> The efforts of Keats and Harvitz to perform less and faster programs have worked in degrees. We can not tell people we know about self-complimentary quality. But this night is not theirs - not ours. To celebrate as a celebration has become an insult to the people celebrating the people. Cates and Harvitz, frankly, should be ashamed.
