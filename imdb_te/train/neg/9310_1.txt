Okay - I adore this film ... I'll credit this film - alone - for me such a die hard horror emotion. I did not see this film alone. I heard a lot of stories about its impact on its audience in the original release on theaters. Incredible artwork ... terrible, psychological things terrify me off pants .Oh bless their hearts, who made this wonderful movie. I loved it. I thought the entire movie was good and interesting. This film is very scary - it's a terrible movie that I have ever seen in my life! What is going on in the film and not enough film to be afraid, but what ever happened to me - Brendan's amazing performance. Best horror movie ever. Never be that scary. Halloween view in its evil.
