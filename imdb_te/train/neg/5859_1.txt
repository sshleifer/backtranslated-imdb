Turkish movie is a big problem. Directors are not interested in world cinema. They want to be local and folk, but international. <br /> <br /> The Turkish language has been translated from Turkish to jokes and there is no point for non-Turkish audience. <br /> <br /> Players, Ferrin Sensei are also worse than average. <br /> <br /> The figures are shot in Cuba, but there is nothing about Cuba. So Cuba is considered as a banana republic. <br /> Waste waste, waste time.
