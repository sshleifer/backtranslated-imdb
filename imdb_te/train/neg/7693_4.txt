Is there anything happening in this film? I'm not. Basically the cliché after the movie cliche and really nothing surprises. The film is very imaginative and because the film is in serious tension. So for a thriller it's long enough and unpredictable but a play it's a failure. Because the story of this movie is very rare. The events in this movie do not always happen in real life as well. So this movie has a real suspense and reliability issue. <br /> <br /> But this is really the clue kills the movie. It was cringing stuff at times. Everything is in the picture. The predator is a naive youngster, a boy whose heart is depressed and a cold, emotionally, almost emotionally portrayed by the victim, who can not see anything. Everything in the picture is very clear and all the things happen. 'Predator' in order to correct the broken 'car' of the victims. One of the old cliches from the book. I know what film I have achieved after that movie. I tried to see that the eyes of other people around the teacher and the students were in mutual mutuality. It was very accurate and cheap, and I wanted to stop watching almost the movie after that. <br /> <br /> The film may be referred to as a cheap porn movie, but it is actually a full-fledged TV movie. That is slow and the film will develop its role and spend some time on unnecessary sub-platforms. <br /> <br /> I agree with Elizabeth Berkeley's pretty good performance in the film. Some of her stories and events are also realistic at times. She is so good after her appearance in the Hollywood career Paul Vershine film "Showgirls", so unfortunately she is still seen in movies and television series. It is not worth his talent and she certainly deserves good. All of the other characters are disappointed. Corey Sevier Cliché plays the role of the 'untouchable' Rich Boy and the role of the main character's husband is much worse. He appears to be a sexually frustrated predator than a true predator of the film. He tries to have sexual relations with his wife in each part. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he slept, he wants sex. He gets home, he wants sex. It may be a real thing but I do not know, it's not exactly for this film and the story like the story in general. <br /> <br /> Why do not anyone ever watch this movie anytime? It is predictable and there is no suspense and liability. Not a 'horrific film' and it is definitely a watchable, but all the weaker and cliché elements of the film are also recommended. <br /> <br />
