Beautiful picture to this end. Finally, only a more unpleasant attempt to increase men and make women stronger at their expense. The girl refused to listen to logic and logic and eventually used her active / aggressive nature to control and impose her interests on the person who had control over her strength and relationship with her. When he prayed to her and asked her to keep on asking her, she was not in the back of a driver's wheel in her car. The film is a success for all men and women who want to have control over their relationships with them. It's an unpleasant movie for that reason.
