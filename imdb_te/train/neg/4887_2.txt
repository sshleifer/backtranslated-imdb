The first picture is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The footage from Criminal Insen (including opening credits and the title) is very recycled. The new footage filmed in the video is really stupid as it is done poorly. The scenes do not have the proper lighting, sometimes the sound is sometimes unheard and there are also video disruptions like film rolling. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, this basically repeats the first story. <br /> <br /> ETHEL kills everyone who shares her where she lives, often associated with those who want to feed her. <br /> <br /> At least the first is the same for the DVD film, which also includes the Black Wedding. Not too bad Death nurse movies though.
