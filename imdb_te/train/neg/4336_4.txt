I saw this movie and the original Carlitoose Way back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that the prequel to people is made in a small budget but there is no connection with the bad script. Now it's just me, but I always thought I'd go to set up a prequel to the other movie, starring key roles and probably filling in a bit about life that we do not know. Power Rise is just a movie with Carlito. There must be at least some roles from the original film, the end does not make sense of the original. At the end of the film, he will retire with his sweet heart, but how to get out of jail in the next film? And his woman was not the only woman who spoke in her original love. I am slightly appreciative of the film, but with some good bits, it has grown to a bigger brother. Do not wake up at night waiting to see this matter, and see if you really need a hit again.
