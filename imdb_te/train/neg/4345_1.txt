Fraudulent Advertising ... I saw a business for Carlito's Way: Let's see Power Rise to Rights that says "From Scarfus and Carlito's Way Producer" ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact for the room assistant 'Scarface. Not to be avoided by Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he must have a slightly different class. When I say, I think I can talk for the masses ... we are unquestionably lying. This is best when the movie goes on. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. However, Louis Guzman should be shy to work on this film. Overall, the film did not fill in boxes for Carlito's Way and did a good job. This project is clear to attempt to make a good image rather than a quick buck.
