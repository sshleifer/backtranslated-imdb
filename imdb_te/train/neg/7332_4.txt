Although a 2001 film, the direction refers to a 90-year art style, which was "old" a few years ago and has expired. Cheesy cuts and effects are painful to see. The script is good enough, and some scenes attract me (the taxi driver brings her to the bridge during the night). But the hero of the detective heroine was murdered by her and it is just plain terrible that he is engaged in suicide. The performance of the actor, who played Selma Blair's married boyfriend, was very distressing to me. I sit through the whole thing, though, is rare for a random kind, no-you decide to find and watch this movie just on TV.
