<br /> <br /> In America, animators are producing a cartoon with 5-year-old sloth-donkey. Drawing style (Kappa Mike) or some cheap Japanese animation rip-off. (Usually messing up classic characters) anyway anime defeating American cartoons! <br /> They are no longer trying! <br /> Oh, I heard about this last night; I live in the UK and I got this show first came out in 2005, well, when I discovered the UK did not seem to be up-to-date with current presentations.
