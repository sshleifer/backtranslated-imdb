After the success of Scooby-Doo, where are you, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own appearance. But unfortunately, they added a new role that they have permanently ruined the Scooby-Doo success. They invented a new presentation with new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Do. This is a scrappy-doo, the program was a complete failure, possibly with adults and children. Scrappy is a stupid brave puppy who has always looked ready to beat anyone. Scooby and Shaggy villain are scared, and they are also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not require any minor annoying bastard puppy nephews. If Scooby-Doo is more successful, they should never be killed or scrapped. It's just weak, maybe your kids will like it!
