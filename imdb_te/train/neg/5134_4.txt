The overwhelming horror meets the supernatural picture. A group of thieves will remove the paramilitary-like exploitation at Camp Campellon in California. The cargo plane they kidnapped the high-jack pilot and the demands of his daughter to go to Mexico. Also a greedy pirate decides to stimulate the money landing in a cornfield oversees by looking scarecrows looking strange. These are not run-of-the-millis fire ... they can kill. Acting is no better than a terrible dialogue. And humorous efforts are not funny. Dad Vernon, Michael David Sims, Christina Sabron, BJ. Turner, Phil Gentler and Victoria Christian.
