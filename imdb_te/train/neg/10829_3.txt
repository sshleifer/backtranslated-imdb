Magnolia, throwing, guilty, offended, wall of the hysterical twists as a wall of canvas. PT Anderson is definitely a gifted filmmaker but should probably find someone in the balls to leave him writing or at least tell him he needs to modify this overlapping mess. <br /> <br /> You can tell me that a look at the cast is awesome, and they are. <br /> <br /> I would not want to do anything in the scene either for the sins committed or the pain they committed, <br /> <br /> Create story with parallel with the bizarre tables that unluckily opened the image to Anderson. Early sequences were excellent in showing people how and what they could do. Even a cosmic expert who pulls our strings will get caught up in the most optimistic belief. But those stories do not have any of these early fables. I waited for some form of cosmic convergence, but instead of the morally challenging characters we have gained from the waves of repentance to their earlier ones and now seek redemption. Get out of the left field biblical plague at the end and all Anderson devotees that you end up are surprised in his intellect when he really proves, he actually read the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> I am great for music by Aimee Man and I will say I'll be looking for the soundtrack CD. In short, if the actors are closed or reduced, it is a good picture to watch and listen (music, it)
