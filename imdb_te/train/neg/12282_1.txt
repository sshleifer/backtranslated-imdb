This is one of the most boring "horror" films I've ever seen. Nightmarts involving roaming souls in alcatraz has a college kidnap. "Elm Street Nightmare on Elm Street" and a standard 80 Pia music video is trying to provide a standard vampire fare in the form of this movie that is completely shaken by a bad acting and a shaky slowly moving story. Such a nasty and often ridiculous movie (take that thorns and terrible dialogue), it's a good thing to grieve for the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Silver Scroll Award by Academy of Cigence Fiction, Fanataacy, and Horror was the winner of 1987, or contributed to the Deo Soundtrack or a role for Tony Basil. Although this is a big disaster, even though it follows a small tradition (see other IMDb comments for this image).
