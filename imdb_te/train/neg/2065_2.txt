Last night it was rented. Early (2001) WAAAAAAAAAY ran for a long time. There is no benefit of the hitcher scene. Some skits just dropped. I know in advance, the Chevy Chase is less than 2 minutes away. No matter what. <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of the good thing of a movie of 75 minutes <br /> <br /> I would like to give you some advice: you can spoof the Muslim movie of TV and movies If you want to do, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want to do a little thirty movie for TV and movies, "amazon woman in the moon" or "uhf" <br /> Do not rent. You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Picture STILL "Modern Problems"
