What is this hell? "Cookie play"? "Lawyers in Looney Tunes Land"? The world's miniature, very duck actress (more duck-face and anorexic than Michelle Pfeiffer) crossed her bony but made Cretinus Grimages one of the best animated animated TV series to make the bugs bunny shy. <br /> <br /> All men work like pansies, and I'm also sorry (small) bunch Delta-male-like for refusing to believe that the hip is big city shies all. Wes Peter McNicole is more frustrating than his counterfeit Hollywood "Shishush's" speech: Calling the "S" to be "S" is the type of fake-inefficient, Shetwart and Christian Shalter, with enthusiasm. Looking at the MacNicol talk, I wonder always wonder how to dislocate his jaw ... Human facial anatomy never intended to support the pronunciation of "sh" noise more than three times per second. <br /> <br /> This bad idea and written legal drama / comedy hood has also included some 90 PCs. It has a political editing written with huge, neon letters. Is there anything more unreal than some of the lawyers who have high ideals, ethics, and moral fibers? It is a laughable way, but it's the way the defense lawyers have been filmed in Hollywood. After all, what's more great than a murderer, a rapist or a thief? When it comes to addressing the US to implement a TV series hosted by "Ally McBike", it must have time for Paris Hilton to become president. "Ally McQueck" is a product of the recent and large-scale Western thumbing-down and its criminals. <br /> <br /> <br /> The imagination of "extravagance", such as the relatively annoying musical numbers, is awkward unfunny. It's not monty python. If they do not have the talent of this garbage "new", they have failed with respect. "Ally McBeek" is the most commercially ventured TV venture, which is indiscriminate UPP, bored housewives and bipolar advocates. It is another dull "objection your Honor is continuing to be able to call witness" legal baloney that American audience will eat with taste for some strange reason ...
