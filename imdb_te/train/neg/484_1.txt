I was bored in this movie. It's not graphic sex scenes because it has destroyed Godmother of Artemia gentiles. The film is not so much about her and her art. This shows her an art form (Judith Behding Holofernesses), but was recorded as a witness in rape trial, not a single year after her trial, her first Judith was not painted. <br /> <br /> You probably do not know if you understand from this film, Tussie is not a great role. He crossed Artemisia. It is not love, it is rape. He did not agree to accept false allegations of rape to stop her from rape when she was raped. <br /> When he says "this is true," according to the manuscripts, he never says that she always knew Artemicia (a sexual relationship). <br /> <br /> I encourage you to go all out and learn about the true Artemic and really learn about her. Do not rely on all your knowledge on this fictitious image. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has interesting story behind him and some amazing artworks. <br /> Do not look at the movie, but find the true story of artemia.
