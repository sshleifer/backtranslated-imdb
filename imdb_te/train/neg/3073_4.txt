Ellen Page co-stars in the film behind the DVD box. She is not even visible after she is less than two-thirds of the film. I do not consider it a supporting role, but rather "bit". The plot also has many unexplained elements. Some examples: Why did the main character refuse her son? Why does her young son head head into the train? He said it was a "sucker" bet, though he did not say anything. Naturally, the screenwriter's definition of a sucker race is unknown. This movie is not in my opinion the rental price is desirable. If you want to save your money and watch it, it is free to watch on TV.
