I saw the opening weekend in Australia with anticipation of striking performances of Leather, Edgardon, Bloom, Watts and Rush, that the precise story of Nedel Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite the striking performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot paper is thin ... It does not induce me to read "our sunshine". There are some other plus points, especially the support from Edgardon, the Irish Migration to the beginning of the 19th century to produce a genuine feel of a guided directive from Jordan (confirming his talent in the show at Buffalo Solzers), and a real feel of confusion to the Australian Bush. But I did not help myself feel that I missed another opportunity to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or he?) .... I sold the discount to Hollywood and sold the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and producers do not agree to Universal just lose the beards ... <br /> <br /> I'm expected to have content with me with Kelly Peter's amazing "Secret History". 4/10
