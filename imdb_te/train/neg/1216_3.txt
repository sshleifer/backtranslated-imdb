The genre of suspense films really takes a dive. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you need to create difficult situations which cause the suspense and the feeling of the period of what's going on next, but this film is very predictable, and just is not believable. I see more of this film type, telling the actors to direct more and more from the accident. Being in constant stupid borders is a continuous bad decision. If they take the time to earn more realism, I'm a bit enjoyed. Saying that it is better to stay away from this.
