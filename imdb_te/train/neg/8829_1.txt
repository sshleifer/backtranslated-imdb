This is an endless part of telling the story. It is an hour in the film before it's too much thought to be about; The characters are often ineudibly mumble; Activities often have no relation to each other; No one actually knows about who killed the girl; A pair of swimmers go swimming into the water that feels threatening, but nothing happens; The Irish man is punched in the face because there is no clear reason for one of his friends ... the film becomes boring as to continue. Half-entertaining element landscape photography; But anyone can recall a camera in the Australian Outback. Overall - daunting, absurd, naked - and annoying for the viewer's time wasting too much.
