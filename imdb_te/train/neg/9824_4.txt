When I jumped up on my in-law's cable, I do not get familiar with television stations, first I thought it was a low budget sci-fi movie, and a few minutes later I was screaming on the worst attacks of a christian fundamentalists, and it opened to me - good grief, these people are serious! It's been a while since I've seen something unhappy. I was curious about writing this review that I am scared of the criminals, but I have seen other reviews and hey, they can take it. Strict philosophical confusion: How do you criticize the film without criticizing the movie and criticizing it? Answer: Only people who appreciate you will be able to express the hatred of the images you criticize. Some of the liberals (Um when you say: spit!), But I do not mind - it is very darn! I can not be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those viewers who are not obsessed with J **** C ***** myth!
