Vixen (Erica Gavin) is a novel that she has a Maury's husband ... but she loves sex very much! In this movie she gets a lot of men on her bed - including her husband and brother! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> It is well directed and Erica Gavin is just too big (what happened to her), and it's very colorful ... today's scales I'm now surprised to have an NC-17 rating - no hardcore sex and it's not only women and There is no male nudity (it's unfortunately) pretty dull and in the end the politics is more inexplicable (and pretty crazy), which was supposed to be astonishing in 1968, but still worth it to see if I had a cut version (it had a R rating) I heard only a few moments and not there. <br /> <br /> The generation of the mayor Beyond the Indian film "Beyond the Valley of Dolls" is good and well, instead of that catch.
