This movie looks great - unexpectedly funny way. I can not stop watching, I'm laughing too much! This is a romantic thriller's parody, not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul Ellie Wendell, Luca (Cory Seavier), plays a dowry teacher who is hardly working for the hunky and mysterious drifter we learned in prison, Severe culprit, though bad acting! Mind you, he is worse than other actors. The actors have the idea that they are really a horror movie. They're playing it straight. The film is bad about: acting, script, romantic scenes, pacing, tales of stories, musical choice. Clocky landscapes are just ridiculous - first at the church in the shootout, then Ellie's Luke's last words - I'm so excited to laugh. <br /> Clearly, Luke's jack has a high weight and Eb Crunches, and we have come to see his naked torso. This is probably the highlight of the image.
