Okay ... this is the third in the line of carnar. Let star with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the film you can see the cause of Dino when calculating the body, you can see Dyna's eyesight, pretty smart to hide bad puppets! And a special team team named Rons as Scott Valentine 16 minutes before the team goes into the warehouse and then finds the body parts and body after the Dino Rampage, with some big box falls in the team and you can hear a velociterptor scream, pretty creepy !!! And then a black girl runs forward and found a blooper now! It's a rapper hand out and her face is slashed but if you pause when the rapture comes hand you can see just one person with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is very simple. 1. Although some trucks cause some of the terrorists' attacks, it is to wash some weapons there. 2. They have a ten-ton rapper and there's a giant t-rex interrupted where the dead is wrong! How does t-Rex fit there ??? 3. Rons and some intellectuals kill dinosaurs! Sadly some stupid elegant girl to capture one of them = = (4. Holy jewels raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. There is now a boat in Dino's Pacific.T-Rex hees a strange thing on the neck? The picture is good if you want a good laugh.
