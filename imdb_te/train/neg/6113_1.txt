Looking at this movie, I was shouting at my head because my first film was always enjoyed at the age of 13. I'm very bloody and I'm reminded that it made me angry. A few years ago I saw again in the TV. Big mistake - acting is not in the woods and plot, and the 23-year-old T & A you have to go is not the image merit ... 0 / ****
