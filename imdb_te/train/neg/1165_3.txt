<br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little film that appeals to some people, but I am almost shocked from it. The roles in the film have made little of the likes and the timeless story has become so cumbersome that I'm totally out of interest. As I said, I know others have enjoyed it, but I can not find any "Alive" of the song - a nominal, very boring drama disguised as a thought-inspiring action science fiction film. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, Do not be wrong, I'm always waiting for a good idea man picture, but this is not sure. <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
