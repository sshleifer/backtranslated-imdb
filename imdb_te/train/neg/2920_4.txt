Wow! I was surprised to learn that this is a small world and we are all interconnected. 88 minutes waste. John Dunn is better placed in a sentence. "No one is an island." Performance is not bad. Children have given everything they gave but sometimes the thread is very narrow for me, I can not follow it and the only true "hero" in the movie ends in jail after a meter worker. I do not know. I can not get it. Oh! Good.
