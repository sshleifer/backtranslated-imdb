What a terrible picture. It gave a good rating to Rotten Tomatoes. Do not be fooled by positive comments; It's not horrible. It's not funny. It's not clever. It does not even have your attention. Watching this worst-fest I wasted 2 hours in my life. The computer-generated monster is curious to see the first couple of times. After about 15 minutes it was no longer entertained. The conversation is horrible, the translation must be something. Idiot Americans are another negative. 3 were filmed and they were all character, intelligence and judgment. Now I'll send two lines to have a couple. Because the employees at the video store cut me off to bring this title to the counter.
