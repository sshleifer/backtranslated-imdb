I had to watch this movie for my work, so I did not pay (in contrast, I paid), but the film was more than average. Jokes are the two main actresses who use the "First Wives Club" Division of Women's Ages in Hollywood, ... well, in their "hot chicken" era, their "district attorney" is no longer in age. I was very angry about the film, in which "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​("Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(boys boy to kill all dudes to "kill her".) All in all, a bland piece of rubbish.
