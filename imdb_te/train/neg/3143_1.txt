The tragedy of the Doomade Titanic has inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology has always attracted human imagination. The latest film about the tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous filmmaker James Cameron. "Titanic" is the story of two different characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from different backgrounds (a hobo-artist, one of the folks) and their love of social barriers and the sinking of the sinking ship. <br /> While using the historical name, Image history is too small. The plot is built around two fantasy lovers, French diamond and treasure hunters. More than a thousand deaths were taken on a great luxury ship in its time. Many historical facts have been forgotten. Where is the radio operator ignored iceberg warnings? Why not mention the Titanic vessel at a distance of 5 km, but was not protected by its captain's failure in identifying the mask? The abolition of these facts is insult to tragedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole plot was rather unpleasant; The great is equal to greed and corruption, poverty is equal to compassion and heroism. It is contradictory to spend about $ 200 million on how to make money on corrupt people. There is no human scheme shown in anti-leaders. Billy Jane seemed to have played a role in the ghost. Casting is very poor. If DiCaprio is 2 inches less than Winslet, she is the standard for her child citer. The length of the film is unnecessarily extended to 3 hours. The first hour and half were ruined in establishing relationships between the characters known to the audience before they went to the theater, and the conversation that made it so bad. "I'll see you" and "The ship is on my side", as the hard lines are heard, there is a lot more pain than the screams of the sinking people. <br /> <br /> When some of the "Titanic" musicians played, some were moving in the moving scenes, but they were drowned in the ship but there was nothing original. <br /> <br /> Although the film does not have the artistic value in the whole sense, it is impossible to block the sentimental story of all the people. Romeo (DiCaprio), and the film was successful. Now it is safe to say that the industry is less likely to invest large sums of money in a single movie, so "Titanic" has something to do with something.
