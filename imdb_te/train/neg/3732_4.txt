Because I was very young, I looked innocent and foolish, because this film was due to my sleepy nights. I did not see since I was in seventh grade in a Presbyterian school, so I do not know what effect I have now. However, I say that this has left an opinion on me ... and many of my friends. It fulfilled our intention, at least until we were old enough and wise to analyze and create our own opinions. If I did not receive the mark of the beast, I was afraid of the newly altered post-rapture Christians. I can not spoil the film for those I have not seen, so I can not tell you about the details of the scenes, but I still shot on my head ... it's 19 years old.
