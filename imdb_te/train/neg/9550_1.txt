After Highlander 2 (which I refused), I felt impossible to make a sequel that tears me because I was such bad. I made a mistake. I liked the original Wargames, however, the film is incompatible with the details of computer details and original images. At least some hacks are actually working for actual worms. Anyone who wrote the film knows nothing about computers except the word processor. I suspect he or she also looked at the original film. Acting is not even convincing. See the movie in any case. Channel is hard on TV and I do not care if you can not turn off the TV. This film will ruin your life.
