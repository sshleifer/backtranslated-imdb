You can often say that the use of a storyteller is not necessarily the same as a movie. This whole movie has this device. Richard Jobson is not entirely content to add credits to his credits by directing and funding some of his funding of his own semi-autobiographical works by some of the funding foundations of the film, some of which are misleadingly edited, which misrepresents the real art house. Kevin McGid is in a good show. Everyone else is okay. <br /> <br /> Budget barriers show that all scenes are portrayed in the daytime, many are clear at night, although they learn intensive alcohol consumption when they work primarily in the day a tactic of reality. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of the film is one day old when he is 20 years old. Without changing his clothes from 18 to 30. Bless.
