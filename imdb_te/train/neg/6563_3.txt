Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole when trying to make a picnic in Florida. Wherever he meets a small picnic, he tries to save him from Eskimo. These little trials and penvin are adored, but ultimately it's lighter in the laughing segment. Eskimo is not really great of a foil for bugs and other shorts have seen quite a lot better when I have other bugs bunny cartons attached to other unknown enemies, frankly. So I can not recommend this one with good conscience. But it's nice to look in uncut form. This cartoon is in Disc 3 of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Grade: C
