We were amazed at Lethal Weapon to see this film hoping to see some flashes of Jet Li. Unfortunately, many combat battles are very obvious, and it has also brought that experience. Flying kicks is great if he can not see the wires holding you flying through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks in the air. <br /> <br /> Many cartoon and very frustrating.
