Although this outing does not live up to its ancestor, it is more than unforgettable moments. After my personal favorite, laying waste to a city block with his "Videodisc canon", we see a close up of Nimoy's face. When we eat a single tear from his eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The director can not help but pull into his emotional crisis and we can not understand that his previously flat effect is only a fa√ßade. Absolute brightness !!! Sexual scenes are not a carnival, but romantic, to display a nice balance. Later, I felt like I had a pretty good understanding of how Magnavision Videodisc Player worked. Very bad people did not produce them in 25 years.
