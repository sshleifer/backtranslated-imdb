Yes! ... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about an emotional film. The film is a surgeon's scalpel. For an arrangement, it has some stone pillars, some rocky seats, a couple rocky crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this film is Hamlet, and a terrible masterpiece of Hamlet literature. Dubbing is not actually all bad. The throat, the dark, the discouraging, the life-tempered atmosphere took place. I have seen this version of Hamlet three times in the fantastic Mystery Science Theater 3000 and every three times, even though I'm MST 3K, I'm on the edge of the TV stopping. <br /> A wonderful product of a drama that deserves a very well.
