<br /> <br /> The third remake of sleeping with anemium after 1995 (1995) and AG Nasakshi (1996). <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI is a good movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good but the handling is not as good as it is, the heroine is very regressive and the climax is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Rishi shares his role with YAARANA (amazingly remake of SWTE) and his main character is too fat and Juhi is good, Arbaz tries to make it harder He can handle many scenes and his voice is terrible, Johnny is very loud
