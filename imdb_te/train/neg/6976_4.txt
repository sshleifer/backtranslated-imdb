Robert Altman's downbeat from Newton's book "McKebe" was neglected during the release of the New-Fenged Western film, but in the last years it was a critical critical step. Unlike the entirely complete Boom-Town scenario, the characters do not have much interest in it, and the movie (intentionally) appears to be hilarious and unlikely. Beard Warren Beatty is a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur, settled somewhere in a struggling community on the outskirts and helps maintain the first brothel's home; When the profits come, Beatty is menaced by city tuffs who want to be part of the action inherently. Altman creates a majestic wintry atmosphere for the film, which provides a sense of time and space for the audience, but the action in this pardoning little town is limited - the story is made up of much of the story - and Altman's trajectory is deliberately slow. An announcement (in fact, actually) is rare and ignorant actors look at each other. This is a self-defeating picture, and yet, as Almanman-Quirky, it wears a proud defeat. ** from **
