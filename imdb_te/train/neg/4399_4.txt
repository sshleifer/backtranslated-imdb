A scrappy, occasionally fun spoof in the music video business can be perfectly funny little, and stars are ineffective in the swing of the involuntary chaos involving John Cusack and Tim Robbins. They play two semi-savvy security forces in Los Angeles, making their own company happy videos for video aces, groups, parties and a dead star. This is the time when the filmmakers are running (a curious politician and the smokers who are associated with his colleagues, the last 80s of the culture of music that do not do so, apart from the film's primary strength). Furthermore, Cusack and Robbins have created a genuine couple here: hipsters or posers rather than dancing but loose, street-smart, these boys have the same nutty wavelength, and they never down each other. They are the real thing in buddy-comedy films. **** from * 1/2
