From the perspective of the plot and movement, this film is terrible. After 80 minutes, I saw the clock in the theater that I would end up and relieved after it was merciless. Typically, the five characters appear in the film, A Son & Father, son girl girlfriend, and two male characters at the age of the son, and then appear to be missing without context or explanation. The film and sequences suggest homo-emotism, but nothing has happened to reveal this fact. There are some scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son girl friend appears in a window outside his room and they will join in an odd conversation. Gave an incredible vulnerability to the interaction between photography and acting, admitting she had another "old man". That's the end of the story.
