It's a good picture, I actually enjoyed some kind of. But the end is very sudden !! Absolutely not closing and it leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert What happens to her boyfriend? Will she hook up with her grant? Will she be beck on the next semester? About Angela? Apparently Holly's performance stops Angela from some of the stalls, but she has nothing to indicate how she responds. There is much left in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if it's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but I think it's a terrible ending and it really makes the movie joke. I was very disappointed.
