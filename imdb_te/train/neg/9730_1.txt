I have rented this movie because Brad Douroff is in this movie. He is an outstanding actor, Brilliant in all ... except for the film. And I think that's how stupid this film is, and that's not a good performance. This film is a random comedy. Some lines overwhelm me. And there are some lines that do not have any meaning at all, and it seems to throw hooper lines without thinking about the story. Oh! BTW Plot BAD! But it is one of the films TAHT bAD that really looks cast. Since the plot is pathetic, I would recommend BIG Brad Dourif fans or other actors fans only.
