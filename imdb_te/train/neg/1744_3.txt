I saw the Malayalam film "Boeing Boing" which was molded in 1985 (probably inspired by the English name of the same name). Groom Masala's primary story is the same - but it is in a tragic manner, classy jokes (perhaps this director made the taste of Hindi audiences) that can replace the usual ones appearing in simple Hindi movies ... <br /> I did not see the English original. But the reality is that the Malayalam movie (made by Priyadarshan) is really enjoyable, which is a partitioning comedy. <br /> <br /> Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (played by Cook's character) acting is quite natural and natural. <br /> Maybe I am also in the Malayalam film, its Hindi remake. Akshay Kumar and John Abraham were defeated. <br /> <br /> Paresh Rawal did a good job - but did not reach the pubescent.
