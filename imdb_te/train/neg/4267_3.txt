I saw this movie at Rotterdam Festival, as well as all other voters. Director was attending and working very hard and very determined on top of the project, I will explain the above average reception and remember it got it. It is very similar to a feature length episode of Aussie Children's favorite "Round of the Twist" but the ransom feature is also very intense. Since you can not think of another Fijian film, if I'm trying to visit all the Cinematic countries, it can be seen in the movie, but it's normal, much less (but by an amateur cast) and subaltern food. The local islanders of the story seek and try to beat each other, but for a long time, if there is a good white governor, all problems can be solved (abandoning the island).
