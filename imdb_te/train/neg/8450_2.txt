What's going on for the ITV drama. First, "losing gemma" is the worst TV play I have seen in years, and now full of bad sounds from the beginning of "Perfect Parents". <br /> <br /> In most drama / thrillers, there is a need to discourage some kind of belief in developing the platform, but "Perfect Parents" have taken this new level, and I thought I was forced to lick the "magic mushroom" lorry, Eric Morecambe is a great piano when playing the piano While playing, "religion, education, greed, fear, murder, pedophilia, two serious problems with the" drama by numbers "must be in the correct order". <br /> <br /> For your next script, I would suggest that you read some more books on script development than "Script Writing for Dummies". <br /> <br /> The cast is not the fault of the actors who act as the top lyricist due to lack of tension in the ridiculous script and direction. But when all the actors involved in this memorable piece of play try to release their script from the next postman ITV drama department, Letterbox must be silently shut down!
