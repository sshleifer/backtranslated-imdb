After watching "The Triumph of Will", the film also measures historically less "standards", the film is far worse. Naturally, it is completely fictitious and unfortunate. It can predict the 1930 German campaign. Unfortunately, the quality of the performance is also, hacked and cheap. It is also ridiculous that even contemporary Germans leave the theater holding their noses. In a genre known for its primary appeal, a film that is not realistic and inefficiently wrong-headed, does not qualify as "bad". That status must be substantially improved!
