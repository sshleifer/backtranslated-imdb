First of all I say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and the CGI is rational. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The earliest scene we can see this movie is anti-American, I can not bother me (we get enough from Brits Hollywood) but here the Americans are not subtle about making morons of dead brain dead. <br /> <br /> This sad scene was very poor, and some of the film started going downhill. <br /> Here we introduce you to Olympic medalist Aunt and drunken Uncle, who walk in memorials, blame the father of his daughters and then fall on the ground while they play. <br /> <br /> Turning the whole virus back is ridiculous. If Americans do not have a virus, why are they investigating time, money and resources? The US government spokeswoman is a cross-eyed American, who looks badly (or stupid) and has a humorous effect, without the drawing of an innocent Korean. <br /> <br /> <br /> About movie monster predators. US and Korean special forces were allocated to find life, although they were not visible images. In Korea, the only one who hunts the monster, at the end of the main family and some random tramp days to save! Naturally, some US / Korean agents try to stop them. <br /> <br /> This sister has been able to play a key role in the end. It's clich√©, you know it's going to happen but it's worse than that part that makes her haphazard! And my last frustration, how did Hell survive that end? This monster swim underwater underwater under 5 minutes! Why does the monster not eat kids in the first place?
