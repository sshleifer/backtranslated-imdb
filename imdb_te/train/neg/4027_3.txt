It is one of the most overtered Spanish films in history. The lack of micro tests and complexity and its total political correction is that it really is made up of slaves and good / evil characters. The world is not like this, good films show simple movements with opposite motions and confusing. Nevertheless, I am quite hated as the father of Bola's friends about this film. The director tried to teach us a good lesson: shaved headed tattoo artists are not always bad guys, in fact they are better than the father (wow, like this ... philosophy or something). Thank you, Achro. I proposed the Nobel Prize in Literature.
