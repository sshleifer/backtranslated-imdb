There is a definite improvement in getting there in Rome. I found it very predictable, memorable and slow to reach there, and to this day I still considered Olsen's twins worse. However, when it was not a horrible film in Rome, it was not great. If I wanted to edit it in one word, I would say it. It's good for teenagers, but I think the adults do not find much to go. <br /> <br /> When you have good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually pretty good actresses, certainly very beautiful. I agree when I am 10 or older, and I really like them, and I usually like them. I enjoyed some of their movies like Passport to Paris and New York Minitt. Again the target, the two girls do not have that bad job, in fact they are very attractive. Plus to die for their outfits, and the scene of Rome is entirely inherent. <br /> <br /> However, the film is in the fall and script. The script contains most of the clich√© and references of Deja Vu. Similar to Mary Kate and Ashley's films, the plot is very imaginable, and other features of the Olsen Twins are well known, some of which are uneven. The characters are very thin, and do not learn much about them, sometimes the pace is uneven. <br /> All of them have good points, and are definitely worth watching. However, for my taste, it is the harmless and predictable teens fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
