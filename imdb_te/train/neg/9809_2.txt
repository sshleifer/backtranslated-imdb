Why are some of Mrs. Murphy's movies not in this regard? This is because this film is completely snap bleet. Disney is not the right studio to run this film. MAYBE touchstone (well, they're own Disney, but it's more mature). The film is very kid-ish because it is not a book series. Casting for the characters is all wrong. Characters also do not work in books. Why is the taker changed to a person? He is a girl in frigging books! Is it for boys to appeal to the film? Sheesh. And where is the Purur, gray cat? One of the most ridiculous characters in the book is not from this dirt. Rita May Brown was a good writer, but Disney misbehaved her work. Perhaps an animated film adaptation of Don Blatt's artistic depiction corresponds to the improved Mrs. Murphy film. Overall, I give it a 2, since at least Disney made a film from a acclaimed book series. But I did it well. In any case, I have my books still entertaining.
