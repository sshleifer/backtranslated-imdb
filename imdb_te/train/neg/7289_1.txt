An immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (which is not a part of me). I went to the preview of this film without knowing what I expected - in the end it was disappointing. A fiercely neglected (often clear "twisted" history) Hungarian Jewish family is not my tea cup. This epic saga should really give its viewers something ultimately. In the end, such images are about humanity - the picture has lost its meaningful dimensions without any new light.
