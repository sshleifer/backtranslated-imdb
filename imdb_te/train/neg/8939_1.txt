Yes I saw tough cuts. Corrective sex scenes. Terrible cut scenes. Almost almost for awful acting with the film 'The Need'. Bad movies, bad acting, bad effects, bad positions, and bad deeds have all been bad. <br /> <br /> Lap dancers appointed for the best actors Vampire Extras in this film. <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, who is known as "Sachin actor", makes someone else look like a talent here. He is definitely shook by people in the bonnet (see reflection on the wind screen), his inability to turn left, his amazing ability to drive the car seriously. Do not forget the oh and sex scene. Plus his important use of a toy gun, which the boys do not even get to hide as a real gun. Other actors on the screen can not deliver their lines.The half they are waiting for a line that does not exist there! <br /> <br /> If you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again good luck and do not give money to unqualified people.
