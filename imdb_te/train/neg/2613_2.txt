This sequel is completely unequal, absurd and ralling in the "Plot" (if not really), and the Models (funnier, tense and character is more than 21st century style songs) and good creatures.) In his film, the actors are the second to childhood conspiracy. Glenn Close (and she's pretty cool) is sweeping through the film, as the original de Ville and she is humorous in the lead role from the Sunset Boulevard! It is also not a good image to watch. It's a good example of a bad and nonsense sequel. Basic Instinct 2 also features a plot, character and acceptable acting. It's not. This is bad.
