Definitely my bonus film I have spent my money. It's a mistake to make these great stars waste their reputation. Boring! Boring! Boring! Each character is portrayed insignificantly. No acting talent was shown - correctly reading a piece. Alec usually plays realistic roles, and Gwyneth appears to be an ugly look for her displeasure, and Annett advises how she chooses to make her films, all of which show these talented actors who are depressed and have a talent to be skillful. "Scissors Running" can lead people to imagine a great performance in a film that experiences teen and deep emotions. There is not one moment when filming this description on the cast screen. Perhaps it's mistaken for the director - as a matter of time.
