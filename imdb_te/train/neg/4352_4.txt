If you see friends, the script is very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same funny settings. <br /> <br /> A group of people involved in the program, older years). Now, they are in their mid-twenties, and they meet again with class combination. This array starts. <br /> <br /> A special episode deals with multiple stories simultaneously. They are generally not connected in any way. Each story is divided into multiple categories, which are displayed in a mixed sequence. <br /> <br /> The sketches are where my problem is in this series. Like friends in the following seasons, it is often a preparatory setting that is difficult to believe in situations. One of the main roles makes something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is still exaggerated, it is not enough crazy. If you are into this kind of humor in your face, then you'll like this series. <br /> The reason I started watching friends was the first few seasons. There are interesting and most reliable story lines, in which you will root out roles with some characters. Class has nothing in this regard. The characters are just too forceful and the stereotypes are too far away. <br /> It took at least a few seasons with friends before it came out of steam and the character traits were involved. But in class, it seems to run out of steam before it even starts.
