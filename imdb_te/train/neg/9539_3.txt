The children's group set up a theater with a horror movie marathon all night. However, as night goes on, one of them will kill one of them. Who? And why? In 1991, I saw this again in the theater. I'm looking forward to it - but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some of the pros, such as Dee Wallace stone on board ... but it will not work. This story goes halfway through (some big edits before the film's release), murders are relatively bloodless (an R rating goes over me) and ultimately boring in the pursuit of the killer <br /> It's very bad - the film is capable of. This great horror film with enhanced script may vary. Although it is largely forgotten and the actor looks impatient by it (I have not heard about this stone). I give it a 3 and it's for the cast.
