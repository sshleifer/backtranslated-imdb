The role of Demi Moore in this movie is how she looks to SEALs. It was a bad start and went from there. The plot is completely unreliable. The purpose to do in a tough military unit is not enough. <br /> <br /> Women and men are pretending to be insulting to everyone who loves the predominantly intellectual. The differences between the sexes are life interesting.
