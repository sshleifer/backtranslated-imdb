'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is the television sequel produced for the film 'The Omen'. Satan, instead of having a young child, has a little girl's body adopted by his parents, shocked at school and takes revenge on her wrongdoers. It seems that the film is struggling with any horror stuff, and many events that are happening are just frightening and not just frightening, this little girl can hardly believe in Satan and all the events surrounding it. Compared to the original image of this film, I did not seem to worry or be scared.
