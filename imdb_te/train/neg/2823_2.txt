Well, Angelo Jolie has recorded it because of Tivo. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed good. <br /> <br /> Even from Angelina, She played at the age of 20 and 16 years old. There are three characters in the Italian character. All Italian-American. Local Italian voices are good, I thought. The young male cheetah is beautiful, my wife said. The fat woman is Italian woman. <br /> <br /> When Dick Van Patten plays as a Randy Doctor, I know this is a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Two couples resemble four Italian stooges that chase their children. <br /> My wife does not go to the remote. Hopefully she does not take makeup, clothing or makeup tips. It is a sick and distorted combination that is bizarre and sophisticated. <br /> <br /> Cutting off my left ventricle is not enough to turn away from the pain of watching this film. If this movie is displayed on your TV, help your head through the TV screen instead. You will be happy. The movie which had previously been seen as "Hamburger: The Movie". Or perhaps "deadly friend".
