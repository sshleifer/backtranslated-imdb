The Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC hilarious I've ever seen. There is a way for simple comedy programming that allows the oldest most aggressive audience of 85 year old farmers in Saskatoon. Jokes are all imaginable and I can not believe death. The performances are very painful and starring, but I can not blame the actors because CBC has demanded and demanded a kind of dimensional stereotyped characters. The most dull performance of bad jokes tried to be "controversial", with less than controversial of other boring CBC comics such as The How 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Force and Rick Merseysourt Report.
