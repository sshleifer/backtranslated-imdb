I really wanted to really like Julian Poe. I feel that many of the supporting players are better than the slaughter being underestimated as an actor and given an opportunity to perform in this film. It's based on the short story I read. So, when the errors of the film began with the story, I saw the director / story writer who wrote it. The maze is fantastic, and I loved voiceover, loving tone early narrative attacks. But then ...? Nothing! Explaining the suicide attempt, Julian asked the points of interest. He can argue that he can not answer because there is no one in his business. But there is only Julian, who only undercuts the token, openly blurs his intentions. Julian or director / writer, despite the tape record journal for the record of God for Julian's role, does not want to offer anything beyond Julie's life, much less important information. He says he is a bookkeeper. He said that his father's job was when he was around his family when he was his child. What is that? There are many interactions with locals who intend to illumine Julian's purpose. Julian this dopey locals think they are like aliens from another planet, the ultimate (and only) sane of them, but none of them go anywhere. If Julian Poe has any defining characteristics or anything to reach any knowledge it can serve as an illustration. He is close to revealing anything about himself and he is in the scene where he intentionally insulted the mechanic innocent, religious wife. The scene is not what Julian is intent on. I can only see Julian's role - given - selfish, small, and totally hypocritical. Sort the half-baked, contrived film director's attitude. And poor Michael Parks, one of the most promising actors, will be given nothing to do here.
