I'm deep at the breaks of Jack Blocks Nacho Libre's character is absolutely cheerful but it's not. <br /> <br /> When you become a wrestler, playing a slimy, slimy Mexican nun, dreams of becoming a wrestler but this film is just a total misfire in one department. Just by the idea of ​​cinematic thought this is "funny" and "Is it from the right person of Tenacious D?" The truth is that this film does not offer anything. At all! It is a lousy script with crappy characters and really naffing and directing. When you think of something that's funny, you'll see endless moments but it does not. I was stupid in 10 minutes but it must be taken. It's not. <br /> <br /> After 90 years, I have been able to prevent a gas that has been a painful one. <br /> <br /> If you want to see anything with your favored actor, they are popular early start pop, and you'd be embarrassed that the actor is actually in such a load. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Jack Black's previous films like Shawlaw Hall and I really look forward to watching the Pick of Destiny, but I'll come to the man. If you do this for us again jack i'm gonna come round there and hammer your knees or something. <br /> I know it's complicated for me. <br /> I'm a cliche, but it's a lot of the worst films I've ever seen ....
