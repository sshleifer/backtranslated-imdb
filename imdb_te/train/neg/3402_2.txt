Here's why Jane show does not work. Once again, Canadian Bonehead producers and writers can not create a sitcom without putting different spin types on it. I guess that these people can not see most of the TV from the United States, which has a pat down sitcom model. No, here we have to do something else, the story is totally irrelevant, and then it must have a meaningful B story to do. Characters are two-dimensional and story lines above the way: forklift species ??? I'm frustrated. Here is a little suggestion for program authors, do not write in funny situations, find funny in situations. And remember, you should really be born with a sense of humor to write funny stuff, not just an improv monkey.
