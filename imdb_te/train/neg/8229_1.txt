<br /> <br /> I saw many good indie horror films, such as The Hamilton's, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever. Unfortunately, I thought I did not get the five Across the Eyes in this category. From the very beginning this film is suffering from an amateur acting that is echoing from the poorest script, "Why not come out there, do not come out, you: If she gets you she'll kill you and you're dead if she kills you" <br / > <br /> This image displays very little character development and I do not care to be honest Pain and torture have no effect on them because they are just a group of ditsy college girls who do not redeem what they can not redeem. Cry and whinge throughout the whole movie they are doing and if the girls are crying their argument; When they speak, things are completely random: dating boys or girls are recently burned to the father (things that you are pursuing a mental killer). <br /> <br /> Sound camera is also terrifying and sometimes it does not appear in the image. The director is limited to a digital camera in the whole movie, just because I have small or budgeted. I think this is an attempt to keep the audience as close as possible: feel and enjoy the girls experience. But the very moving camera is so close to Grinny's picture and action that it's hard to tell what's happening in the action scenes and is just a haphazard. It is one thing to do the movie objective, but it is one thing to take action on the screen as the viewers do not understand poor cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that the five Across the Eyes are the lowest budget indie but do not forgive the very poor quality. The film does not have any redeemers: bad acting, poor scripting, shady camera-work and story. Because I was disappointed in the light of all this, I decided to give the film 10 to 1. I wanted a meteorite to hit a sweet relief. Its 94-minute stupid college girls shouted, argued, had conversations with random and running random conversations. However, how many times have you seen the girls falling into their hands and threw the cyst on a chasing car's windscreen.
