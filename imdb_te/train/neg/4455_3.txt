Where to Start? Correct, ridiculous - does not include the start to fight for the film. If it is a patch in the fight club, violence, blood, and gore are very clear and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factor - it's quite realistic (and Danny Dyer makes Nicolas Nickelby look embarrassing). Fair enough, the storyline is very good and the action scenes are well choreographed - I can add a good end. But the picture on the whole is poor, seriously poor. While people are saying the accents should not spoil the image - I agree - a general casting error, or lack of coaching in the film has caused irritation - which has played some American / Giorde from the scene. I can not get it wrong, the pretty-looking guy, looks great on the skin's head - but not a football hooligan. The 'fake waitress' situation - how ridiculous I am for football jokes. Also, when the GSE is playing north, they only go on a 3-way waiting train - no sense - gangsters and thugs are a real company, some of which are the basic cult of Mickey 5 people. In terms of accuracy - West Ham and Millwall have been together in the Championship for the past few years? Hmm, ten years old. And I'm sure 'trouble' just waltz into a Milwall company pub. Basically, they are a very poor movie that people like if they have some idea about real football and hooliganism. If you really like football and are responsible for rape, the film seems to have insulted your intellect. Ross George
