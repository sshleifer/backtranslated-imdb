I spent eight years running cinema theaters in the 80s and 90s. Until now, it's the worst picture ever shown to people. One thing that made it so bad is that it tries to be a great, exciting movie. This terrible piece could not even save the drivel from the Gregory Peck far smaller than the great. <br /> <br /> Jamie Lee Curtis clearly demonstrated that she has not yet learned to act in an early horror film (she is still trying, but it is not good). <br /> Sorry, and here is the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament It's never going to be because it makes little kids afraid to play league baseball! <br /> <br /> Nick and Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to convince us. <br /> <br /> You do not have time to waste it watching on cable TV. It is not worth a movie rental price; Your dollar will be spending more on the other package you choose (which is better than this) in an additional package of microwave popcorn.
