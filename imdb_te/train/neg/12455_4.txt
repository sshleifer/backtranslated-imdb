When I was 7 years old, I saw this prime time. I was a huge comic book reader at that time, and something great about superheroes. <br /> <br /> "Emma Peel" I learned about the stories of Diana Prince, as Diana returned to her Amazon form when they ended up recently. However, there was very little action that I was bored throughout the film. Final costume is an interesting idea, but it looks like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> In my late teens, I saw the film again. It has not improved too much. Kathy Lee Crosby is well known, thanks to that incredible, but her performance is not good. <br /> <br /> 'The story is well, and the show is built into more epic climax. It crossed the superhero story of someone who never saw a comic book. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers return to the drawing board and come forward with more loyalty and have a bit of camp and low budget, which succeeded in compelling the film. . <br /> <br /> If it had only a comparison and historical document, it would be nice to have a movie available on DVD. Even Superman 4 is available, and it is nothing (except Chris Reeve and Jean Hackman). It is valuable for a curiosity and a bit of inspiration and warning for future versions.
