This idea is a long lost flick sometimes available on the web. I bought a copy for myself. Well, of course the acting is terrible and the story line has childish but his movements. I searched for it and knew of its previous round. This was done by Grindhouse Movie owner for the lowest budget. But he did not necessarily damage the goods, but it was made. Make a good image that is well made. The zombies are watchful and gore are intact. The only problem with such films is the quality of Pelicole. It's not terrible, luckily on the sound but sometimes it's very dark. So you have to see clearly to see the gore. In a funny way they really tried to sell this for frustration with little things. When a voice overtakes a beginning and a person with a green discovery, there is a gore on the way there. The course did not work, made me think of the cnipal girls, came the annoying hour that the red stuff started to flow. They had original idea, Cinnamel Girls made a year ago. Do not go for the storyline, go for the zombies and watch for a continuation mistake. When the girl and the guy take love for the first time, she broke, then they love and suddenly withdraw her lingerie ... try to do that, or I'm getting a bit offline ...
