This film is not completely understandable. For no reason why anything happens, it's got half-bored and "How do I wind up this?" If a young child is written. And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they make a bet? I can not tell the plot, I'm not sure I'm too frank, but not registered. Jared and his bird fell on her stairs as she was going to Ireland, as you would. They go home with a very troubled little girl, meet Christopher Walken, who dug some of the oldest women preserved in Pete. She will bring back her life for other reasons than to continue the story and she will be grateful to him immediately after making him icing. Since then all gets a bit crazy. A few days I wanted to get back in my life!
