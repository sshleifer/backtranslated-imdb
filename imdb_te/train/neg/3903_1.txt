Emma is well understood despite her flaws, so readers will forgive and love her, and she is warm, crazy, romantic enthusiasm with her warm, familiar and respectful and delightful Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley is the perfect man, and Emma is as close as possible to an independent, clever, confident woman at those times - remember, she was just 21, and she grew up and grew out of flaws. Who can not be Emma? Who does not want Mr. Knightley says? This version of Emma reveals nothing about the things I like about Emma. I could not finish seeing it, and I found it very scary. I can not see Emma's warm and generous side, which leads the reader to love her: the patience and warmth she has shown to her father; She and her Taylor's marriage were forwarded to her by her equal companion in her home (she agreed that she would like her more than her friend's pleasure) and the intimacy between her and Mrs. Weston. <br /> <br /> In this adaptation, Mr Woodhouse's character is just as strange, just as strange as aging, aging and trying bits. <br /> This adaptation has failed to bring about the relationship between Mr. Knightley and Emma in particular. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection: Mr. Knightley is interested in Emma's minor shortcomings, not to allow her intelligence and virtual care for others to go through her terrible way; And Emma sees him, but fun doing it hiding and continuing to use his own judgment. Dressing down is absolutely overstates the argument between those who give her the right at the start of her show, and the ruins are all the more likely that I portray the nature of their relationship as described above. <br /> <br /> Mr. Knightley was not even able to bring sexual emphasis on the lives (or to stimulate audiences to the audience). <br /> What really feels terrible? I did not really understand why someone like Emma liked this novel, and surprisingly, I changed it only after I changed it.
