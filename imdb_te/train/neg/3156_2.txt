I want to do one thing clearly - I love Michael Watten! But this film really lets him down. His performance is still amazing, he is still as good as ever, and he still looks great. But the image also loads the worst! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say, Bit Manny comes ... You are constantly looking forward to running with his little friend with good scenes. Myself and my family (who are sitting with me) also reached the film through soundtrack; Sometimes the music does not just match what's happening in the scenes. However, this is a very frustrating image, not the worst aspect of what I found. I can forgive the buddy-ness of the famous woman, I can forgive the strange characters that threw the mix, and I was able to forgive the poor choice of musical background, but its choice was to cut the middle section of the entire picture and straight through the end ??? It's definitely planned from the beginning of the end but it gets lost. If you leave the Michael Vaughan fan out of this film, replace yourself with a poster.
