This may be one of the worst movies I've seen. How can I describe it as a horror film, or a thriller? It's like a narrow drama. Scary music was awesome but it was a good idea to use it for everyday activities such as dump taking or stepping down the stairs because there were no horrors. This image is very probable. They have beautiful cinematography (interesting) and interesting characters, but the writers seem to know you already. They may have extraordinary activities without explanation, or even a clue on what they understand. This is just one thing about it and it is one of those movies that tells something completely different.
