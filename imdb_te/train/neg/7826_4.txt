Special hangouts? <br /> The script? Terrible. No Plots There is no depth. Do not understand. Superman is the hero of the movie, which is a hero without any motivation. In the original film, he suggested America in the Cold War. Here, he represented nothing but Hulk. <br /> <br /> Definitely the actors are good. Kevin Spacey is a good choice among others. </ P> <br /> If there is nothing in the picture, it does not solve the problem. Superman is not able to see anybody who is meaningful from this film when it comes to Superman, but also in the minds of people rather than comics, every day is a meaningful hero. <br /> <br /> Just a few moments: Lex Luthor is world corporatism, political superiority, tyranny, and on. <br /> <br /> If you look at the Dollar Theater, wait for it to wait.
