I am a big fan of the original book and this simulation is just bad. At first, it was a kid's toon or an adult one that caused some strange violent scenes with a silly little duck that puts a strange mix of the story and giving the "funny" moments at the start, which has the issue of the problem. /> <br /> But it is very important, the film is just boring, unmoving and the original story is not real. <br /> <br /> The second revolution? Have they learned anything? Who is Napoleon after? Benjamin? !!
