I am obscure about my potential faulty comments. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are enough canned plot elements, which are pre-damaged. <br /> <br /> The film comes from a Southern classics to Kill a Mockingbird. <br /> <br /> When you notice this, TKOM has received its ideas, no matter what "Oh, it's a repo". To entertain these mock movies, you have to identify the plot element after identifying whether they are actually committed to it or to try to revolve around it. This is not a lot of turns.
