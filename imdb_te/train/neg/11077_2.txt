The only reason I chose to shoot this shot is because of the presence of Oscar winner Ernst Borgin. All I say is, it's a great waste of good actor forever. As far as I can tell, Borginine is the only actor. Other performances are so uniformly terrible, I'm surprised that the studio will actually be the "showcase". These twin coins for the talent in the acting department with a story, I thought my eyes were about to start bleeding when the credits were wounded and you thought you had a perfect film disaster. Naturally, this film is better than the original programming of the Disney Channel and similar children-centered networks to appeal to its audience. Honestly, I do not say much.
