The film tries hard, but it's not fun of the 1960s TV series, I'm sure I'll remember with a fondness. I was 17 years old, and I saw some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly, this film is doing little to this series. <br /> Special effects are very low and it is flat-camera-operated. The script is also dull and there is no surprise and sense of humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Badly executed, started to evaporate very quickly, and for this reason I'm honest to enjoy this family. <br /> <br /> But I was so angry about the movie that it wasted Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah's talent. , All very talented actors. Jeff Daniel removed some good performances before the Daniels, but he did not have a clue what he was supposed to do, and Elizabeth Harley's character came across with remorse. Daryl Hannah was a lovely actress and generally neglected, and I liked the interest of her love, but you saw very little (Shawn as a government-type government worker) Christopher Lloyd took herself and I liked Lloyd as an actor (he was in Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in my favorite films and I like Back to the Future) but given much less work to do, <br /> I like this movie, I'm unhappy. Instead of being fun, it came to be nonsense, and it has a lot of awareness because it's very talented actors and good thinking, but poorly executed. 1/10 Bethany Cox
