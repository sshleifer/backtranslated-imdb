The probability of the first five minutes of the film was shown. After that, it's good for some sort of illegal comedy. The best part I can not think of thanks to Supertroopers for Joey Kern. I will see this film, learning how to do the film. There are many scenes in the film, it only stops and the entire cast and the band are surprised to stop taking care at some point. I am very surprised about the film, which grossed $ 22 million at the box office and earned only $ 1.5 million. For the ability to pull off one of the compliments to the lion's gate.
