It was always one of the worst films. Kate shows up and with a bunch of Zed boys and they all start clapping ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene that appeared to be examining the shape of the pavement was when Kate was running his hands on the pavement. Andy's performance is bad in the film - I can not connect with them or love one another. The other 2 women were very good and overshadowed the Andes. Anyway it is such a campy image. I like this kind of movies but I can not come into this film. Very unlikely conditions and again does not help the film for Andy's performance. Also, she is all gums. Lancome put her makeup with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in commericals.
