It's the only worst picture I have ever seen. <br /> I'm saying it again: this is the only one I'm looking for. It contains the earliest marks of a very bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad product value, bad music. I thought there were a couple of horror movies. First you need to have enough suspense to scare you. The film gets in this category and F. The second point is that if a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we will take care. The film comes with an F. <br /> <br /> The first story, drowned by wolves after a woman feared that she would happen to her. The next story, an OCD person dies from being cautious and talking to his dead friend. Oh, and then there's a bad roommate's horror, nail-bad story. Are you looking for a bit more interesting and less simple than staying at home, being sexually abusive, and having a sibling? The hallucinations, virtual reality uses a self instead of who changes all of these stories where a doctor stimulates. <br /> <br /> I will explain something, enjoyed the horror movies of the movie. I can not do it with this. It is very sad to sit and see. Let's see this film in any situation. You regret it.
