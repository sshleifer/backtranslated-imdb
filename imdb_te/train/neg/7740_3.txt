This film actually manages to be mindless for 2/3 of travel. Sadly, the picture ends up very confusing. When I know the standards of some of the 'Buddy Cop' films in plot contracts, I've taken the characters that brilliantly lost one's character, but eventually the film chancholically relies heavily and I lost interest. /> <br /> The filmmakers did not only get the letters and did a great job with their own work and we got to see who they are and how they are marked with two cops at the start. <br /> <br /> What about the movie Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford)? <br /> His real estate contracts 2. His affair with a radio supernatural 3. He was investigated by internal affairs. <br /> If you add to Casey's anxiety, he will act as an actor and a revenge Father's death Now some of these things come together and come together <br /> <br /> If all the plot elements are long and curious, this bogus chase will come across and I have time to break my ennui and give you the worst about what happened.Imazing screenwriting stunts can not be overcome by bad filmmaking <br /> <br /> A funnier chase sequence is not enough, It has different sections and is close to half an hour Joe Gavilan Fields calls his real estate deal when pursuing a criminal with a gun. This extra curriculum stories and jokes mean me to attract the criminal. <br /> <br /> When you are murdered, they can destroy a good story, I'm not. This is a very enjoyable formula image but it got very big for its britches and it has become an unnecessary waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did well and a small performance by Gladys Knight. <br /> <br /> If this is not better than the "Hulk" and "Lara Croft II", this is not yet done. The picture is fine. I heard Harrison Ford only made the idea that Ehez's idea was making money, and I'm not sure if it's true. It is true that getting a great box office does not require you to be a great movie or a great actor, the film does not have the main characters. Harrison Ford will be my advice: stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.
