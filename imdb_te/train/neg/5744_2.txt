This film is terrible, just put. <br /> I have registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> I am a campy horror movie expert. I saw "Red Neck Zombies", "Psychotic Women of House", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many other people. I know my school. <br /> <br /> People who are frightened by the three hundred people in this film walk from one side of the screen to another. When they walk, they are emotional or induced, but sequestered lines are cluttered. When the actors are acceptable, the direction is broken. There are too little angle shots that are too jerking; I found that I have a 3 foot stranded leaf junker. He called "Leaf Maniviver" several million times: zooming from an enthusiastic item like an enthusiast. Apparently the film crew was not enough to start a sunrise film, so they shot a sunset ... and played in reverse. With this lazy in the direction, you are really impressed with the scene of the late Gothic. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) movie film, "Riki-Oh" or the first five minutes before the first eight-five minutes were filmed to rent the foundation. "Dead Alive." <br /> When you ask, are you looking for too much? <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time to die!
