I do not really have anything new to add but I felt like I got this sack yourself. Here goes: <br /> I was running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I watched the hoggoblins for the 10th time. It's really painful but it's next on the list ... You can see that there is a small kernel of a true kernel that is buried under all the so-called "hoggoblins" but it is not able to. Everything about this film is the 4th rate. Story, acting, effects, women, "action scenes", that ... will not forget it. I can not see a tearful piece (such as Dr. Z's Blood Waters (aka "Zaat") (I really like it, later this month on TCM - October, 2009) but "Hoggoblins" is Natier Ballgas all over. <br /> The worst part of it is now 12 hours after the end, I sleep a good night with coffee and some powdered bread, my medications, and Amy, red shorts, and Newman arain of the "New Wave" dance music, were standing in the room. The pain that lasts for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck,
