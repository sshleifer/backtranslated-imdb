<br /> <br /> I recently said that I'm RC I was given a chance to witness the Renaissance. <br /> <br Sharif's play "Journey's End" theater was staged on stage in New York at the Belasco Theater, directed by David Grindley, along with Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gains, Jefferson Mays and others. I'm not exaggerated, I stuck. In the tumultuous and most claustrophobic depiction of the soldier's life during the Second World War (which I guess), almost two and a half hours after the life of the soldier brought life to all, and I came out of the theater with all of them <br /> <br /> For reading, I can not easily shock , Or I'm very sensitive. <br /> <br /> I'm a theatrical actor and director. So emphasize emotionally, emotionally, emotionally, and pressing buttons to achieve some effects. <br /> <br /> "Aces high" is a movie based on the play and screen, but there are no emotions, Sharif himself with RC, shortly before he dies. <br /> <br /> Screen adaptation takes place in France on skies. <br /> <br /> The unique plus of the film, which comprises of the air combat scenes dating to their special effects compared to today's standards, but still quite valid <br /> <br /> "All West Front on Eric Maria Remarque The Western Front ", which takes place in trenches, and not in the sky, <br /> <br />" Another Journey to the Journey's End " And it's a "great movie, if they are left alone and intact. <br /> <br /> While the DVD is on widescreen and 16: 9 TV screens, the film's quality is also a movie theater. <br /> <br /> Another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love to enjoy and enjoy it, <br /> <br /> But I'm going to leave for others who love good drama and drama, but I alternately refer to "Van Richtophen and Brown" as an alternate . This is one. Buy the game. <br /> <br /> If you have a good revival near you, let's see the play, but keep it as an adaptation. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just too weak, <br /> <br / McDowell, the most talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all due to the weakest performances and lack of skills, <br /> <br /> There are many spaces in it, foretelling It was as suspicious as final. In the original drama, we do not know and sympathize, stay alive. They all were killed in a lethal and wasteful mission. The film is the wing commander of the unfortunate bunch to survive, except for Malcolm McDowell, to die for another day, and three more pilots to die for another lost cause and die. The end of the play is rare in the total darkness. You can hear artillery roar, machine guns rattle, and grenade effects throughout the theater. Suddenly, the whole peace and silence. Curtain comes. Lights. And here they are all. Steep and upright standing. <br /> <br /> "HC" is more interesting and very shocking than the phenol, which is pulled by the hair. <br /> <br /> For me, if I make money and acquaintances, I will develop and play the game. <br /> <br /> "The film and some action scene here is to think about going on in" the nasty spaces of the street "in France, just" outside "horror and killing" men, "but then, what exactly is going to happen <br /> <br /> <br /> You can not do it.
