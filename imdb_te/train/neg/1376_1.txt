All movies (and I'm a film graduate, if you have any value), this is the worst picture I've ever seen. Perhaps I know some of the worse things I have not seen yet, but I have seen it, and this is even worse. A friend and I have rented a night because Denis Richards was on the cover. Talk about youth and retarded. She is worthless! Her character is unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover? IMDb is not even listed in her filmography. This image is very bad, we wrote a short note to the video store when it came back, and dropped it inside the case. It will save your more customers from having to view this completely and thoroughly evil image! " Read something like that!
