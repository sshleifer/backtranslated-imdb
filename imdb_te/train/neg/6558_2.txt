We rented five films for the New Year's Eve, and we first saw it. I do not have everything to go, but after watching it. It is meaningless and indecent. Harvey Keitel's script should be easy to write - just say every three words as a curse. Andy McDowell is surprisingly good at a character role, but there is nothing to recommend this film.
