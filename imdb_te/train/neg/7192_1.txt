In this film I am suffering 5 minutes hypervitalitizing, shaking and pain. And not in a good way. The story is a good idea about a team of idiot children making prank phone calls to a mental one. In the 2-minute time he turns out that the psychos does not like suspicious phone calls because he is at their door to killing the poor William's mother and father. Well 15 years ahead and guess what? People who are still calling a call are called. Yep would have thought you are turning them off from doing that again with a terrible murder. So after two hours and after many scream riffs, the film gave me a serious desire to take my life into a terrible flavor in my mouth. This piece of garbage does not even have a smiley value in the production of "acting", or the rozor hurs career decline. I love the crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece I have ever seen. Just do not.
