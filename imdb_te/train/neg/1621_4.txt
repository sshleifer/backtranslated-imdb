'The Fox and the Child' is a new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary 'March of the Penguins'. <br /> <br /> Here is a little girl (Bertillo Noel-Bruneweye plays amazingly) and her friendship with the fox is focused on friendship. <br /> <br /> Here are some really mesmerizing foes; Mucking about badgers, a link to chasing the fox through an icy jungle; A scene, especially when foxes are suffered by a pack, is at a very serious and frightening time. However, most of them are not enough. <br /> Pretty shot; Cinematography is dazzling. The look of the movie's Bubley type looks fantastic. <br /> <br /> The English version is commented by Kate Winslet, but there is little dubbing of what's already there. The score is very smooth, or at least for my liking; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Those attractive moments that focus only on our furry little boyfriend are immense. However, again, it is almost insufficient. <br /> Visit www.mybluray to keep up-to-date in the movie, including reviews, news, discussions and more. com.au
