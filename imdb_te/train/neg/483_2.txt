I did not think that French could make a bad movie, but obviously, very wrong. As mentioned earlier, the film essentially uses its title role as a point of exit; Her life and person's portrayal are not very few or nothing with the true Artemicia Gentles. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, In addition to some very good set designs, Valentine's Serve's physical beauties are the primary property of the film, and the filmmakers also know from the very beginning that they know this, they do not waste any time in contrast to various "romantic" scenes, These are titles, rather than plot or character development Unfortunately, it is not easy to see the movie as a beautiful young person in a romantic situation, and the performance is unrecognizable and the score is quite simple, even though it is an interesting string or two. More freak out for the film  న వక్రీకృత-లెన్స్ ప్రభావాలను ఉపయోగించి కొన్ని అందమైన హాస్యాస్పద క్రమాలు ఉన్నాయి. ఏదేమైనా, ఈ స్క్రిప్ట్ ఆర్టెమిసియా యొక్క శరీరంపై చాలా తరచుగా నివసించే కెమెరాను విడిచిపెట్టాడు మరియు ఆమె చిత్రాల మీద చాలా అరుదుగా ఉంది. <br /> <br /> Complete failure of everything. It's not intelligent or sensitive to being serious, and slow and serious to work as soft-core pornography. So the French will fail, after all!
