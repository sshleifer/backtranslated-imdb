Seriously, I have everything for Goo's romantic comedies and it's easy to miss Miss Congeniality as Goodfellas ... but this film? It does not make any sense! And I do not even make sense of the confession of confession that does not make sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at least, why is she not a British voice? She is absolutely cozy with her father and is surprisingly sorry that she has been around for the past two years. (On that topic, no one ever makes a deal with her for so long). And what's with Goofy outfit at the Bachelorette Party? I'm not even going to get the fact that Escort paid for falling in love with him - could make it through better filmmaking. I am unable to fit the characters, alignment, and plot to create a somewhat cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, the filmmakers have sued me if she is - the steady use of filmmaker of Deborah Messing's nose very unsuccessful angles! Honestly, honestly, all women are who I am, but why, in the seven loyal years of Will and Grace view, how does her nose notice very unusual odd? Oh! Because the producers are no better! This film, like my other favorite film, Armageddon, filmmakers, is not wrong, actors. Messing and McDermott were able to see the characters, with a better author, director and producer. <br /> <br /> It is easier for me to get my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on. I'm glad a friend gave me his DVD, so I was wasting all the time. If this review is a way to make ZERO stars, I like it.
