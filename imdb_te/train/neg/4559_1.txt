I am surprised to be responsible for the production of this series. If this script is written by someone who failed in the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers Union, it's pretty unfunny. If you want to get out of your turtle, but there is nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett refuses this trash. I'm surprised that the rest of the cast is lacking in acting or humorous ability, the last of the first episodes - the correction and past tests. All I can say to those who are vigilant to be more fun. And it is clear that the production costs are â‚¤ 100 per episode. And just someone thinks I'm commenting like an alien unknown with English humor, I must add that it is actually English.
