<br /> <br /> 'Vampire bot' is of interest, one of the earliest genre-horror films of the 1930s, but a bit too soft for any real appreciation that is taken alone. <br /> <br /> Some murders took place in the 19th century in the village of Europe, where suspicious locals have caused a vampire. James Wale's 'Frankenstein' has a similar view and introduces the role of Dr. Neumann of Lionel Atvil, who completed his misguided ideas for scientific progress. <br /> <br /> The Vampire Theme is used as a red herring by a suspected and battered-loving village, Sympton Herman (Dwight Fray), so that a target-commander mob can go to Rampage - if one is needed. It is one of the earliest horror films trilogy, with Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starring ('Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum') and their other collaborations, the film suffers from bad advice. Comic relief and horror from mainstream Trend that could be far from the thriller thriller. <br /> <br /> "Vampire bot" is still weaker and derivative. <br /> <br /> All the poor-quality Frankenstein simulation we have left with a device for hoodwinking dracula fans entirely of vampire items. But the film for the title is also worth stating to be considered a horror and the director Frank Strauss is doing a few years 'Blondie' movies.
