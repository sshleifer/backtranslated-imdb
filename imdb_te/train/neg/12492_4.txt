This is an awesome video box that is one of the movies but the bad dialogue is that the camra work and wired unknown actors. Killings happen so you can hardly see it plus it's hard to understand the picture. Only the star of this WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (before Tigers shrinks in WCW) and she is a good actress. I prefer the low budget movie especialy because they are fun to see but it is not one of them unfourtunatly. This movie is not a blockbuster to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but if you need something new then watch the rental rental.
