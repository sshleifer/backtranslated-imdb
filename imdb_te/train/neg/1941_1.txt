I believe that I have wasted my life for five days in this trash. This is the most enjoyable of the previous five days submitted by the author and I'm really looking forward to this. But most conversations are completely incomprehensible. Suron Jones acted as the main culprit because she was scrambled or hardly tried, but the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions Bernard Hill and Anne Reed, the older stenagers, whose behavior is excellent. Did the producers hear before the producers had to make sure that the conversations were heard? As a result I thought I would lose track of what was going on and I soon lost interest in the authenticity between Muslims and the rest. The end is completely anti climax. A perfect trash.
