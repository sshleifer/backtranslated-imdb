Yes, I'm sure I can be a living. . . Four of them are at four corners of the world and the other two moments cloned a few billion times. Man, I'm really glad to see this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting. I'm a big fan of George Romero movies and he's pretty sure that he probably rejected it when he saw this movie. I mean, what are raccoon girls walking around like zombies and Charlie's devils? It really argued about the music composer Zombies Gong on the background with their killer, which helped a lot of crappy fashion show music selection for their killer, they walked up to the most part they went into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop / police / apartment / flat / whatever room, and the live woman closed the furniture shop . I could not tell any nationality of the killer, and his voice suggested that some of the countries did not help. Oh, what can I imagine from a film that they can throw in a random fighting scene without any good reason in a warehouse? So, if you like the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or any of the bad C movies (C for Craptastic), this is a picture for you. . . Or not.
