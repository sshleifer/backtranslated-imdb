I can not believe that they cost US $ 17 million in the film. Your average PC, unbelievable plot contracts ... Would you be able to get a major job at a novice UnWANT reporter with amazing speed acting, enormous scripting and effects? What? Not only that, but this image message is so unsubtle that you get out of feeling if they've tried flour on the full size crucifixion head. I will do all this movie, teach the singer and smile at laughter with all the laughter. If the filmmakers really wanted to bring people to Christianity and wanted to show what they really believed, they used the money to help people who really needed it. Now, that / some people may actually be swayed by listening to them.
