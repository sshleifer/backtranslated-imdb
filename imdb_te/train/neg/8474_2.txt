The opening scenes are converted into liquid like a frozen velvet. Dramatic conversation attempted to control just fast forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or magic nuisine. This vampire tries to get his hunting by mimicking a lost puppy. I normally count a body, so a cat (which is not counted) is a bum, a girl in her who fell out of the sky with a knife (about that thing) and that plot. Folly artists use celery to create a broken hand touch, but using a bare sound in an apple for a vampire that causes a victim is just plain crazy. I liked Warlak, but this film was a bad thing, we stopped it and again and again and again and again.
