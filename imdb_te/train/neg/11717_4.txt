Many of the stories or plot parts of the tales are in Lyon, and then the other episodes feel like some other movies, I do not know, but the whole movie is well-known. It's kind of good to watch, but it could have been wonderful! If the story is more original. The theme is the little girl, the evil murderer from Leone, just a little tweaked. The early scenes were really good :-) It's fantastically that people like to fight in the kitchen :-) My big problem is parts of Leon, parts from Nikita and where they're French or American version. If you do not see Leon, it's a good movie. If you like this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> Best prayers / Rick
