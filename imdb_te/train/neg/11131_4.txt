For the first time, I agree with Mr. Chomsky's escape a little bit. His subject matter of interest- actually delivering, which makes the man successful at the university campus circus. He comes across as usual, simple, practical. He will not present the current political style (abuse of bias) and he is far away, as well as on the right hand, seeing him, punishing both and keeping his eye on good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is even worse. In fact, I will also call this documentary, but not a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different from watching the speaker in a 3am taped segment in CSPAN. Camera movements, no modifications, no stylistic touches. <br /> Technically, the product is fully committed. The audio is terrible and unstable; Sometimes we can not speak num, and we can not hear questions given by those who attend other times. When we rarely speak, when we give a quick shot of his wife, we are allowed to see the audience reactions, every time we look at each of his speeches and rays every time we see it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and say that it is better to check your taped lectures on a cassette or CD to hear in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 stars in 10 stars ... I have generous feelings these days.
