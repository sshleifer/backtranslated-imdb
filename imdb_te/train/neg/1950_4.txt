I grew up with Scooby (wherever you go) I hate the scrappy, Daphne loves, and I'm not finished with the whole gang. But this is sad, Scooby-Doo comedy-totally spy's jap anime is not a bad secret. They like "what's new" and give Daphne a makeover that is at risk :( and try to lose the * sex * drug jokes for most generation, but to attach the name of the Scooby to get this "Clue." They also make some lumpy punk stuff with theme song Now I'm gonna go to watch my DVD of Scooby Doo where my eyes wash off the filth of this new series Edi!
