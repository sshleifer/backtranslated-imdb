I thought this was "provoking the thought" of the little gem people reviewed this. I love indie movies and I think it's a lot to dig. <br /> I have revealed this. I do not know about these things. You like it. I personally feel like I thought of pee'd or cutting myself so I thought it was the worst. Bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad direction, bad editing .... I have gone. I do not cling to why a critic is doing why he or she is making a political point by giving a picture 10 It is misleading and ignorant. Voting for an image in the IMDb is not set! Let's see if it's just the worst bomb as long as other people are in this controversial period (not this film, it should be very hard but fail). <br /> <br /> You're wrong with the movie that in 15 minutes you all your main characters will die scary. Unfortunately they die, but not in painful compliments, to give the viewer justice or coercion, they have only seen 2 hours garbage. <br /> <br /> I got this film in a bargain bin at my local video store .50 and feel ripped off!
