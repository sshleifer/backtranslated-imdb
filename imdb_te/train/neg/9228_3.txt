The CQ is very slow and I'm a David Mamate fan. The film is a young movie producer with a very barrellla-esque movie. Then the movie lost me. Deep and deep? Not really. The film "Dragonfly", made in CQ, has no endless problem. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / And many other great movies. I'm also looking forward to the show of Jason Schwartzmann. But it's not an easy image to get. If you are not in 60 science fiction or slow movies you do not go there, skip it. <br /> <br /> The CQ feels like a student film. If you want a recent science fiction-esque movie rental Donny Darco, do not sleep.
