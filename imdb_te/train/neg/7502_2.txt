I've always liked Spike Lee movies, but this is a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I guess more about Sam's Sun, and instead came with a 1977 series of minor murders. Talking dog is ludicrous (you're in trouble when all film audiences ignore the smile). The whole picture is very confusing and is not very interesting. Plots of sexual scenes can not kill completely. I do not oppose sexuality in movies, but it's a point (except for a XXX movie). All in all, we are very disappointed in this spike lee effort !!
