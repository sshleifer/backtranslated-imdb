My first question after watching this movie, "Why is the title of Liam?" If you have a motive to tell a story from the boy's perspective, that does not happen well. The boy's scenes of course included camera angles formulaic use, but a very crucial action was taken out of his opinion. <br /> <br /> The lack of "mainstream" character (clearly refers to mute, childless) stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simple morality and conflict "as" dramatic or other literary work ". The definition fits to a T. When the audience hits the head, the volcano and throat are from the Catholic Church and the money from the Western <br /> <br /> Many movie is speculative ... See Teresa's scratching the toilet after her mother tells us "My daughter said my husband would scratch another woman's toilet!" If it worked well then I liked the British reality Kazakhstan. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
