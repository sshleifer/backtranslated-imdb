Barbara Shelley (originally her first in Britain after working in Italy) was the first character to be made when she was 24, and she made her debut in "Cat Girl" in 1957. While Blondes and Brunet attract many attention (I love Yutte Stenggurg), the lovely Aberdeen-Heardian actress with a deep voice is always intelligent and vulnerable (for example, "The Damned Village" in 1960 is much less than her character's husband, George Sanders). Her only reason to see this pressure update of "Cat People" (her beauty is a good performance) .Her character is clearly naked and she is awakened (she was exposed eight years later in 1965 's "Rustup - Mad Mank") An amazing strapless is awesome (I do not see any of what I wore to wear, but I 'd certainly like) All in all, Barbara Shelley, a poorly written role that will beat most actresses, is a positive proof, increases her subject and makes the film consistently watchable, in the 1960s when she quickly appeared in the Hammer's studio at Bray Star Power Real Test.
