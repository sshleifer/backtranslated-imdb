I restarted the film twice. I put in three machines to see what's wrong. Does Steven Siegel's voice change? Would he dub the sound with the guy who died during the filming and the studio did not resemble him? Or the sound on the DVD was destroyed? After about 10 minutes, finally listen to the true voice of the actor. <br /> <br /> Many people seem to have recorded in the bathroom in this movie. <br /> <br /> If I had a copy, I was ashamed to donate a copy to Goodwill. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before renting more of his movies, all (or more or less) good films. You know what you're doing when you watch Steven Seagal's movie. I guess I do not have anything.
