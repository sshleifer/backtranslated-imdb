The film started well. It was damaged by a glowing green meteorite, which was used by superpowers (telekunes, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, dogs, supersphere, heat view, and plants grow bigger and faster), and crime fighting. <br /> <br /> The meter man spends a costume from his mother, fights and frustrates with residential gangs <br /> <br /> It is not uncommon, even if two fighters do not like watching competition when they are hitting each other. <br /> <br /> Even though this is not a nonsense, the film has good points. If you try to take a gang alone then they will come back to you and tell you that you are hurt. These gangs & communities have their true enemies (the big bosses who use their own ends to see the honest people in a ghetto presence). It also shows that a community does not need superheroes if they are willing to destroy the predators who destroy them. The only message that has been voted is that voters are not their crooks (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H.W Bush).
