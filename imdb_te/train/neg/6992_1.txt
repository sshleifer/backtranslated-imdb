The plot is about Anna, a female nurse, in the midst of chaos around the world, growing meat-eating zombies and taking on the world and attacking life. She escaped into the streets and rescued a black police officer. So far is it all! I usually enjoy the horror movies, but the film is not eligible to be this piece horror. It's not just ridiculous. "Flintstones" or "Cookla, Fran and Olly" make you more enthusiastic. It's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards is the ability to get into the shopping mall by more alcohol. Leaders who lock themselves inside shopping-mall are not good at preventing the outside of the hoodlums. Even though they do not seem to be drunk, they give the impression that they are mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending this money!
