Evil Breed is unfortunately not good. The launch of the film is expected to promise but overall it's a disaster. Conversation is very bad but not as bad as acting. Acting is cruel and inexplicable. The characters distribute horrible lines there and do not work because those characters do not work. Some killings were innovative but it took a long time to get them. Half an hour after the film, we will be smoked first in the next five minutes (unlike the beginning) and then almost every other character. The film is characterized by innocent characters, dubious karate fights, and a scene from one of his intestines. It's just ridiculous in his * sscrack.None.This film is then ultra-gory and ultra nonsense.The characters of most characters are also clasher for slasher standards and the Ter is left on the counter for 5 days.These breed fails even in the main work. See no Evil for Chainsaw Mascher, Just Before Dawn, or any real slazer .
