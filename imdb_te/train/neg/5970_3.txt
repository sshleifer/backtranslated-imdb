Coyote ugly may be very effective but the PG-13 rating is what all the studios want these days, we end up with a picture: a movie-makers made it a R-rated guilty pleasure / robbery film (with plenty of nudity) The PG-13 "tease" film is not allowed to go anywhere until the movie is gone. <br /> The script takes about 15 minutes before it is easy to guess what happens to the plot point. Acting is enough, but the letters are paper-thinner, they can not do anything. <br /> <br /> The film's unique assets are amazingly beautiful ladies. We want to see them in a very tight and beautiful look ... but only because of PG-13 restrictions. Very well choreographed and dancing, having some well-dancing dance figures, but lack of nudity or sex to talk. Tyra Banks (which is more beautiful with her age) is also in the film with a very small amount. Sexy newer piper parabo is also very easy with eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some real acting probability. <br /> <br /> I am not allowed to watch the R-rated movies by the three who are facing this movie. The audience can get much more from a retail item, but the adult audience is frustrated and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: Image-Women-10
