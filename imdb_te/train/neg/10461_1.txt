It's interesting to read through the comments by the audience about the Omega Code ... TBN broadcasts almost the word for words from the broadcasts ... If the video goes directly straight, the acting Rapture series made by some other religious groups in the three 70s. Do not remember this? You should remember this in a year or so. It's the first film I think is your religious obligation to go as far as Tickets as possible to save the soul ... It's very insulting ... It's you're a televangelist son, you can also play a high roller Hollywood producer with Lil Ole Ladies adopted with money ...
