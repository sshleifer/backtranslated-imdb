The truth is that the film based on the Harold Robbins novel does not win any awards. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B film in the budget, cast and execution. Technically, it is designed for a TV movie. Acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly terrible. Anthony Holland is a trouble. As a critic tells some of Catherine Hepburn's, she goes to Mr. Zedora from A range A to B. The remaining cast is solid (and ruined in their respective roles). Lloyd Bouchner and BB Bessche are good. Still, the whole thing is a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way. In accordance with Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. Are you looking for some fun ... and you're not very smart ... this may be for you.
