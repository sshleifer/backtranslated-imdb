That's good. It's bad. Then their sentinel, a bottom-barrel political "thriller" in the worst movies I've ever seen. A Mole Plot in the Secret Service is a good one, but with a very proximity a picture is always butchered. Clark Johnson has directed the ham-hand "Edgzynine", which seems to be working on every actor in the film autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas will be bored here. I can not say honestly, in my life, I saw another film with a very dark story. The twist assumes from the square, and the intentions of the character are totally ridiculous, so that the laughter has evoked laughter from the audience. Avoid all these costs. This is a catastrophe of an image that has no ransom value.
