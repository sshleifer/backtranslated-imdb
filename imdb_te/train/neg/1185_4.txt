Another contrast and improvement beast in La Betta (1975), the story of the famous and beloved children who tried to imagine the beast (in the graphic and dangerous and worrying but actually in the crazy and humorous way)? I amuse many reviews and comments seem to be very deep in this movie. I can not say that it is a serious and dark search for such things as sexual despair, longing, fulfilling, or criticizing the Catholic religion. I call it a horror-romantic movie. <br /> <br /> It may be some shocking moments in all parts of your memory, even though it's the parody of all the genres that touched it. <br /> <br /> The distant (long-standing) feminist and supernatural horror between a noble young man but the most ridiculous I've seen in the creature of the movies with really impressive ... well set anatomy, scarlatti's clavichord music and is crazy. My husband and I laughed loudly at the encounter details of the two encounter. The moral of the scene - aesthetics and defeat the monster. Question - Who are the target audience for this film? For a romantic movie, it's too thick; For an art portrait - it was hit by very mad mad inspections and I'd say a sudden end. IMO, the film creator is not for it a serious play. As a parody of Art House / Horror / Emoticca, it's funny and absolutely original. Try not to look for a good laugh and some deep meaning. Interesting beauties and vicious beasts are not recommended to watch this story together with kids. The opening scene that moved out more than an anonymous scenery of the animals could be successfully used on the Discovery Channel for an event like "Horse Riding and Horse Rites" in the animal world.
