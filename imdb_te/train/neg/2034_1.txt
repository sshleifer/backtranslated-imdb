Really, really bad. How is this bad image made? I waited for some ransom, for the interesting camera work, or at least some inappropriate nudity, but I did not have anything. I saw the cabin fever and thought it was a ruin of the train (except nakedness and pancakes), but it looks like intellectual compared to itchiness. <br /> <br /> The only thing that goes for "this film" is the ending. </ P> <p> I was thinking about this movie and got a headache trying to write something. Oh, no! I'm happy I paid it for only $ 5 and soon it will end in a landfill.
