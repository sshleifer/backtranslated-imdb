After a thorough release of 4 very good European titles, Redemption Barrel's managed to guide the Bloodsker Dance leadership. NO Bloodsuckers found anywhere in the film. <br /> The story is very simple. A sweet noir invites many actresses in his castle for a little holiday. After some sexual abuse, some of the girls are guilty of decapitation. Who is the killer Who knows? <br /> <br /> The Red Herring is on Friday in the local fish market. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pace is cruel. The story is not all stunning with either silly and skin scenes. <br /> Give this a miss.
