Trying to conceive something uninteresting like the Sentinel is pretty difficult. There are a lot of problems. The result is horrible and loads with plots holes. <br /> <br /> Pete Garrison is Michael's Douglas stars as a Secret Service Agent "took a" for Reagan during his life attempt. Years later we find Pete assigned to the White House family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.Aride's Confidential). We face Pete's intimacy with the Lady First, and the Troubles look suddenly at risk against the president himself (David Rasche, United 93). If Pete fails a device test, he becomes alone as an unsuspecting agent by the investigator David David Breckinridge (Keefer Sutherland, 24 TV series), who runs out of Peet as a presidential murder plot unfolds. <br> His own people. His only belief is the First Lady, and she would like to tell someone else about their love (hence Pete failed in the first place). But Pete is really na√Øve? Or is he just trying to buy time until the president can kill? How can he prevent the attempted murder while running from the Secret Service if he is innocent <br /> <br /> One, big, high problem with this film is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. What do you think about this film? Think so! But the killer (s) wants the viewer to kill Prze. Oops. Would you like to forget to keep it somewhere in the script? <br /> <br /> What is with the new partner of David Brockrichidge (Keifher's), Jill Marine (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? She seems to have put a piece of $ 200 - the Candy is definitely piece. What is her benefit again? <br /> <br /> There are many problems with her funniest premise in her Sentinel's premise. The action is much easier "what?" Responses say that the film is bad enough to see.
