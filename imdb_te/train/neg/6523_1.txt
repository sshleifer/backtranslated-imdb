Take a minute to read my full review. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this film to two stars too. <br /> <br /> Here is how: The scene for the epic film adaptation of the Tolstoy novel "War and Peace", the courtesy of the Red Army, and the most reliable, novel scene with historically accurate war scenes is worth sitting down by seven hours - <br /> <br /> I'm trying to see the Rascio DVD version - it comes in the box Considered the best version of which comes from the time and restores scenes taken from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But it is one of the worst films I have ever transferred to the DVD. The film is muddy and staggering, often strobing. If you crank your brightness, color and image level, it is almost tolerable ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> Sound is also inconsistent and can be heard among others. <br /> <br /> It is a big problem for English speakers. There are some good actors in the dubbing choice, and some of the really horrific ones are thanks to its performance, and the parts of the film are just for all <br /> <br /> The subtitle selection is not much better. The subtitles are not visible under the image, but in the right side - some beauty in the scenery (or the ones remaining) are unclear. In addition, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame that the script is pressing to stay close to Tolstoy's original words) and the subtitles are falling in most episodes. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the color, brightness and image settings to the maximum level, turn on the volume path and select subtitles and * English dubbing, you are still going to have a picture of annoying. <br /> Can you overwrite its content? Maybe someday, someone comes and restores it - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece - but now, I can not just give more than one star I was able to stand up looking first about% of% of the 12%.
