Unless you are twelve, this film is not really worth it. This is certainly not a good-budget movie with B-actors, and sometimes a good genre like fantasy that does not require good CGI work. I know it's bad when I rent. I enjoy laughing bad movies. But I do not know how bad it is. It is bearable, after 2 hours, until it really starts to burn. Combat styles occur between physical laws and general struggles adhering to wire-fighting. No original description for transitions. It's a plot, but once again, it's definitely a kid's image. There seems to be a clear moral lesson on the day that Sesame Street or something is known. It's bearable. If you are very well, tell the nine.
