I have seen tonight this night? Or I've moved to another channel often to see infomercials when I'm not looking for long. This is bad. Really, really bad. Not bad is just "flat is good". How was this funded? Who thought it was a good idea? My actor's friend tested that he was not good enough to play the bad guy but I thought, "Save Ranawe from this steam pile of you and @ # $%". I gave the remaining cast option. Judging by acting fake American climbers is hard to judge. Shooting is dulllllllllllllllll. The action is awkward and stilted. The dialog is inactive. The most outrageous thing is the ship. In the real life Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and it does not scrub well in the picture. Trying to make a new group lining around wiping polls is very successful, I can not make you a kid, explain the script or change the script to celebrate in the evening. Dumb, dumb, mute. Do not watch this movie, it's not a joke.
