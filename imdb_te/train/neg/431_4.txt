Accepted, I realized that Al Pacino was guilty. He was a good actor until a woman's perfume, where he clearly broke into a way he could not recover himself. I hoped this film, which I'd heard almost nothing growing, would be a nice little gem. A neglected, forward-time, intelligent and attractive city-political thriller. <br /> <br /> The City Hall is a film that draws its story with many stories, names, and "realistic" citywide problems, and its widest range is widespread and influenced once, if you find the truth, it will dispel your mind. In fact, however, these subgroups and excavations are ultimately the trademarks of rare and well-known urban stories, corruption of power, the twofold politicians, mafia police relations etc. As a result, this setup allows for some thrilling tensions, none of the characters are safe, and fear will happen! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the upcoming issues are very predictable, and a lesson in the ethical ambiguity of the "real world" of many "confession" politics and society that are modern and modern. But after 110 minutes names and missing reports and spider-web lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually a bit more satisfying. I do not think we are left in City Hall, but if it is a full movie, it does not find it absolutely wealthy.
