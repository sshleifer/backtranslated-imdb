I know the answer to that question. For money! This film should have something good that we almost believed that we broke into the hot advertisements and the crib in the gasket. I agree, I thought the trailers were bad, but I still had to give an opportunity. Well I went with my instincts. This is the full episode of the Hollywood trash. If you prove that the average person is once again encouraged to believe that it is good, it is good. On the other hand, the 80-minute length is only from the movie's insulting truth, which is definitely a moth eaten script. It's a full-fledged endeavor at the fraudulent humor, and awful pastel scenes. It jumps all in the universe without destination or direction. This is then the compound, ............................ Yes I said, BAD ACTING! I could not help but every time Mike Myers opened his mouth I feel like watching "coffee talk" in the SNL. Cat was meant to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer does not have the Breslin and Dakota Fanning Prize, but Mr Myers should not be seen below another rock while he is ready to make another Austin Powers film. F-, no stars, 0's scale 0. Save your money!
