Strange people who live in a town live their lives. Mickey is a man who dumpster diver, a man who wears as she looks like a body that she takes home to live with herself, is a crazy girl who wants to cleanse girls with their bad ways ... This shot in the offbeat serious, black and white image better. The monochrome home film takes the edge off two steps from feeling. Like a Troma movie, this movie fits and starts but weird for its quite a lot and as soon as you see the setup the crash becomes bored since you can see the kind of assessment where it's going from time to time. But for that it should not be fun. (Even though I did not see cleanliness coming). If you do not see anything else, you're awaiting the next set of golden girls from a shot worth and Netflix.
