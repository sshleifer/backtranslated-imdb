Mind, my friends and I have seen only the title of this film. Though it's clear in the plot and direction, it's nice to know where the film takes place in the first five minutes. My main controversy with the plot is that it is stable with patience, however, they never explain a lot of things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, overworked dad, emphasized sister ... It's a bad family, but there is no clarity from occasionally referring to sister. I was also confused as the scene with bottles ... it looked pretty random <br /> <br /> The writing is a second concern ... The kids are not bad actors, but their script wants to leave too much. Unfortunately, a pretty niche film could have been put aside for any single, bland special effect, dull scripting, and a clear clear plot.
