The film we feel is very slow starts slowly but after 5 minutes all of us are frustrated from our minds and let us see what kind of film we are going to see. We do not recommend it to anyone, because the ultimate part of the night comes back when the alarm and lights come back because this project failed because we thought we could go home. This is one of the films I've seen and we are bored and many people in the movie finally open the doors, which is very bad. I was shocked that no one walked out than before. Make sure you go and make sure you do something to keep busy.
