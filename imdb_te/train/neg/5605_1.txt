I was disappointed with this film. I have evaluated more of Thlema and Louise's female friend's criminal film. Instead, the woman's jail fled in the film and does not have any obedience to another. <br /> <br /> They defeated each other and made another double-cross, and Lesnas, who committed lesbian rape against other women, was very vulgar. Plan to run away and find hidden stash of money, women flee very selfish and vicious, to trust each other for long. These women are not free from the positive sense. They just hung up as a bunch of loose-cannons, lack of respect for themselves, or each other. If you like 70-year-old female crime keeper movies, you can cross the bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which will run Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
