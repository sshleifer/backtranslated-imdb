I hate this movie very much. It's also not funny. It is not worth it to make any film that relies on counter-sex sex jokes and racism humor. In the first half hour, Rob Sinderer was drinking carton's milk carton. I thought he was "fine" for such a bad image. Do not waste your time or money at this time.
