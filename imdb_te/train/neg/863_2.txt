I've come to realize from seeing the euro horror, movies made by cult courtesy Jess Franco that you can not predict a plot that makes a lot of sense. However, the Franco Over Board has gone with the film; And despite a surreal atmosphere, and the reputation of the director's best sucabas, the movie is unfortunately a really awful movie. I had to admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs about 76 minutes; But unless it's just the logic that is cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just boring. The plot consists of a woman in the neighborhood; S & M practice and worst talking, and it's really boring. No gore and sex is dull, and most of the runtime boring conversations and even though it is a small movie; In the end, I made it harder. I have to say that the positions look good and Franco has done a good job using his surreal atmosphere; But the positive conclusions are there. Jess Franco is a talented director who has made some classic trash movies - but looks like he's made for money, and overall I'm sprinkling it and seeing some of the director's interesting works.
