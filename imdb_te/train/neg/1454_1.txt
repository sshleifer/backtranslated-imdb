I recently saw this picture twice, and I can not understand why I will do it. I mean, yes, it gives the impression of Hitler's environment, and they mean Austria in the late 1890s, the method of reproduction in the WWI and the Inter-War period. I do not mean why they portrayed Hitler as 100% pure evil, mad, unbelievable, and mentally unstable. After a very intelligent, loving and intelligent man who has his dark sides, there is no doubt. But why does the heavenly name describe him this way? All of his positive conclusions were removed from the scene, but not just the most prominent model of the man who had the biggest impact on modern civilization, yes, he threw Germany into a devastating Second World War. Yes, he was a racist, and yes he was unstable at the end of the war. Truth. But again; Why did hell make them plain lie to people? <br /> I do not think this film is a warning. The real danger of Hitler and Nazis was that they could come to power during the movements of extreme global weakness. In fact, this nasty reality is recognizable, almost every German alive (not telling the Austrians and other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, in fact Hitler is not such a 'Weirdro'. Makers believe us if that happened - I believe that the people of Germany have deteriorated. In this movie a man has never got a party leader - Reichskuszler did not say. <br /> <br />
