... but I am not one of them. Karao diario was a must watch for at least two quarters, but the boring and self-centered third part of the film gave us a taste of what's going to come in this extraordinarily self-staggering chaos. Moretti says he feels he needs to make this film, but the viewer feels he should stick with, but really does not want either. A film about Italian politics and election will be lovely, but this is not a movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outside the Communist Party headquarters and are discussing the interviews they are preparing to deal with party leaders, but we can never see the feature of the film. Moretti's political adventures portrayed events that led to the birth of his son, and then the child with his child and later the baby Piotro (the movie is over many years and an election period). We want to see some definitive order or sentence argument, but they will never come. For a doubt that I might have to endure and go through Nancy Morretti's film again. He succeeds to appear as an eternity for an hour and twenty minutes.
