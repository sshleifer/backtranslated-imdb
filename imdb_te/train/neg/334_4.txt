Exactly the movie is good. It's a ridiculous fantasy with very poor special effects, one of the scenes (one for example airport) and a real unfunny time too. (Charles Dance) is as bad as a bad man and he is very good at (The Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing non-comic hacking, and I have already heard that this is drowning, big time success !! Why can not I ever understand why? In a TV interview I (Eddie Murphy) regretted in a comic mode when she was nominated in Oscar 2007! <br /> One of the comments (hey ... it's the 1980s!). Well, not my friend. This is a stupid movie made by the 1980s or 1950s and all of the RAZZIE movies in all the years! <br /> I have two reasons for this film. First I should never forget the long tan lovely legs especially when she was on her bed before the bad guys attacked her home, just the blue shirt and OH BOY camera has to be the narrator about her naked legs. But how odd! I saw her in movies later and she's not that beautiful again? !! The second reason is that I have ever found this movie title in my worst 100 films list! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad Movie, Griyate Legs.
