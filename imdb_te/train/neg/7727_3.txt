I am commenting on the story of the first novel readers of this drama. And from that point of view I can honestly say, but I can see that it has never been republished anytime. More importantly, there are some serious issues like this mini: <br /> 1) It's terrible. Actors who played the younger generation are at the age of 15 to 20 years old. Ali Macgra (45 at that time) had to make Jastro for 26 years. 22-Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) playing Byron Henry, who reached the age of 22. Other Henry kids, and Pamela Tudorsbury <br /> <br /> 2) Acting is definitely awful. Ali McGraw a few times this mini miss is undesirable. In high school dramas I saw more convincing shows. <br /> <br /> 3) Directing is minimal. Ali makra's good dealing, bad acting and character development is probably directed. Played by Hitler. His character appeared and acted in the same way as his cartoon villain than the intellectual Herman Vouk, who is always attractive, sometimes fascinating, but always diligent. <br /> <br /> This mini is very dated. Other characters are identical (Berel Justo). Hockey music, acting story (which is the junior high school history article), and it's almost joking in the mini's all-time lead time soap opera. In addition, Byron and Natalie are often expensive and appear to be in 1979 rather than 1939. <br /> <br /> It is not the 80s in the late 70s, but the premiere of the soap opera "very serious" instead of the modern American classics television version . <br /> <br /> Older films and sometimes happens to be less, but this is probably the case that a creative and inspired director produces the most spectacular, memorable, and critically acclaimed. A resume must take a long time to work longer (15 hours) or longer, and I can not see it just does not get a little sense of the current American audience.
