This film is not as good as all the movies of Christ I have seen. And I am very surprised that Pilate wants to complete Jesus in this story, while the Scriptures (as well as other movies) are in contrast to the state. It's also not the most important thing: Resurrection .. None of the other movies skip this very important part: all of us Christians have faith in this very event. Paul said that if one of his letters was not "out of the dead, our faith was not in vain." The most impressive scene in this picture is the remnants of palms seen on the streets when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and against my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus is not a myth. And actually, he is also JEW. There are many papers (insulting and temporal) that prove the existence of this extraordinary person (actually, to become a person) actually transformed mankind. I strongly advise you to read about the 1st most intelligent Jewish commentator, Flavius ​​Josephus (who gave him a historian). Century.
