It is important that the lack of logic or general knowledge and those who have "gray matter" can not be disrespected. I agree that this film will not work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Problems hit the direction, cast options and depth in character building. Comedy is the hardest thing to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. <br /> <br /> The brother and sister are better equipped in their 30th stage. They see a full stranger in a park and Heather Graham's character drives her and the most seniest questions are also run by a half-sane person or at least one police officer speaks strongly. He walks over awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and she comes to him. After a date they all go out together and he decides to be in love with her and get married in Vegas in a week's time ?? Are hello anymore stupid? He is going with thousands of women and meets a man who tells the 10 words he watches on the screen and wants to marry her. Not just chemistry, it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahn (a very shallow character) Heather is now playing a major role with her, kissing or kissing more. Heather apparently was the wrong guy for this role while I found the uneven and unfunny and many Heather did not work to feel the reality. <br /> <br /> Sue Kramer is the first director in the film and it is very much for me to chew. The film produces and IMHO a lot of craft to make good writers and actors and directors.
