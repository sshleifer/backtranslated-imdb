I will explain that story, it happened somewhere else. When we recommended the great Clive Owen fans, and our Netflix film, we were amazed. <br /> <br /> It was never a surprise to us that this "movie" was a BBC television movie in 1992. Hence poor production values, grainy image, jerky camera work and poor sound. <br /> <br /> However, you do not really care about mechanics because the story is slumbering. It is an interesting human story, but not at all comprehensive, and what is rarely done. You do not really care about the characters as their boring as boring as watching your life this tedious movie. Save time two hours and make time to make it more worthwhile.
