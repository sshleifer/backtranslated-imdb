I'm just rating 3 for this movie because I am trying to be worth it. I love to appreciate a great movie and I'm not biased towards "males" movies. Legally blonde is a wonderful picture. On the other hand, Georgia's rule is a worst, weak, poorly written, spectacular example. At the end of the film I did not take care of those who told lies or did not get any solution. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is the good story. This story is weak and never develops (the subject is deep, the story is not good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is the one who experiences a major character change, and the course of the film is primary for that change. In the Georgian rule, the character changes were sudden and did not develop. Secondly, ATTEMPTED has a lot of dynamic characters. Removing a good dynamic role takes a tough job and time (you've only got a couple hours in a movie). Many dynamic characters have little attention to their personal changes. Even if I ignore a poorly written story, and weak dynamic characters litter, I can not even tell anyone. Each character is a mess. If you're writing American drama it's good but you're not trying to dramatic comedy. Georgia is a terrible mother, her daughter is a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan does not have a terrible need for a human being (she is not sexually abused because she happens to everyone, the worst for all and we all take responsibility for our own actions). "Dudley du Wright" Mormon Kid should not compromise his religion and commitments ... and Simon, I seriously understand what kind of person he wants to be a little bit of a 17-year-old girl actor or politician). It is worth watching this movie to remind you how to make a good movie!
