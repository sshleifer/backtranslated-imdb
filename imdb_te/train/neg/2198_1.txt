He is driving his scientist and his girlfriend, which causes his car accident. He escapes safely but she has a decapitation. He saves his head, brings his home and keeps it alive (!!!!). He continued to explore models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. <br /> When you look at it, it's pretty intelligent, it's a big smoker, but I have a particular affection for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local TV station showed the film about 20 times every year (no exaggeration). Saturday afternoon TV - they were always shown without cutting. It's great if you look back on TV! Open blood and gore, and worse sexual harassment, including a gruesome monster - is not it good? <br /> <br /> I realized how many people have been there. <br /> Acting is definitely lost, there is no product values, the script is pretty dumb and (more gorgeous, even gore). There is also a lighter cat fight between the two women and the great monster who has passed. Also add tons of loose ends and add in one end. On the one hand it is an interesting example of the 1960s robbery. Other in its worst trash. However, this is not a good movie, but a must-see-for-horror (only one time) and fascinated fans. <br /> The laughter of the head is pretty creepy. Note the end credits of TITLE error (which is called "dead HEAD")!
