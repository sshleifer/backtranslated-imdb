How they can do from Jo Dowan Baker (like Buffford Pussor in the first sequel) to Bo Sawson (as Buffford Pussor in the first sequel) .Why do they do that. They have to be the first to play for Buffer Puser, and they are still one of the things I want to see in the second sequel because I gave 7 to the film. I can not do it from 10 to 1 but I gave it 3 to 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly look at this cheese I do not allow anyone to see and suggested that instead of the first sequel.
