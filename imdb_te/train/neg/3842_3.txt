Our teacher showed us this picture in the first class. I have not seen since. I saw the trailer. Will this be your first grade movie? I do not think so. I was horrified in this movie and I could not see it. It was mainly chirping that little girl in Shirley McClain half, and then the boy with ketchup! I've freaked through this movie. And now, 20 years old, I probably did not think that way. My experience and opinion can be shared, little children should not see this movie, even though it is PG. Learn about the possible outcomes of these children. I can not remember anything about it, just enough!
