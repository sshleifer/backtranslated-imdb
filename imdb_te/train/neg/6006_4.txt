I did not agree with theology in the Left Behind series, but I gripped the books and I read about 12 of them. Undoubtedly a good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have much expectations for the film. The main Hollywood Hollywood was to carry a Christian series and did not produce a big-budget film. So it's done independently ... I really seem to be watching a long TV show. It is not just like an image; If anyone knows what I'm talking to, it does not have "experience" for the film. <br /> <br /> On the film, I think Gordon Curie is painful as Nicol√≠ Capradia. Book Reading, NC My opinion is that he is a lovely, dazzling, amazingly beautiful person who speaks English with an almost zero trace of an accent. I guess someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil-necks to be the best employer of the month from the best buy and gave him a really bad fake voice. So I lost some stars there. <br /> <br /> The main villain does not take the film when he does not appear to see or need to be sounded. <br /> This act is okay, but there is nothing to write home. Some scenes - one of the conversion scenes (which can not remember) - the real seat for me was read. And Christian rock music, or whatever it is, with the kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom, some scenes really took place. It was a bad movie, but it did not do that for me. The book stick, folks, it looks great.
