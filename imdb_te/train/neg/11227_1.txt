The film is bad beyond belief. I saw this at the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. The theater's owner came up before it began and the audience told us how half the audience night before, which was "world premiere". I do not think anyone at the theater understood how good the film was at that time. In the end we understand. <br /> Even if it is a documentary, it is not sold. Dark Angel Betty Piage is a bad biography and misleading, in which only half remakes of old Betty piagi movies. This image is 90 minutes long and 90 minutes content is a subtraction. One view is that someone is "very dear and can not make another movie". This was followed by a 5 minute Bettie Paigi remake, which was almost ridiculous (and more boring) of the film. At the end of the film people had another remake of another Betty Paigi reminiscent of laughter. It's ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in the theater, but people are not laughing with the filmmaker, they are laughing at the film and its poor content and structure. It's very easy to say that a lot of laughter is considered serious or revitalized. <br /> <br /> I know movies are very expensive. I've seen some of the most expensive films I've made, but somehow the cinematography and quality of the film have kept me apart from what I've seen. It's made for $ 12. The lack of cuts, grain, and a sensitive plot made this a memorable experience. This movie "Dude, where is my car?" Look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> I have left the theater feeling that my friends and I have been paying $ 8 a loss. The only redeeming part of the experience is that we really got this movie made and laugh about the fact that it felt better. Apparently, the previous night, "World Premiere" was a director / writer / producer at night and was seen to laugh at people and to walk in his film. Batty piage films have been destroyed. They must also destroy this picture.
