Well, I have rented this movie due to the director ... he has done some interesting pictures in the past (you can not ride a fun if you do not see the Voxcore). Anyway, I have doubts about this film first, but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. Poor. What's wrong. If you do not see the image and the spoilers are not read better. First of all, the old saying, 'This can not judge a book by cover'. The box jill for the film indicates that the long hair is a rocky fox with highlights. The back of the box has a cold shot of red-leather jill and some other shots. This explanation is because you want to rent a movie. You start watching, suddenly the film takes place in 1977 (unpredictable). Jill is not a girl on the cover of the whole dog. This film can not be imagined as you can imagine ... it's not good. The characters do much stupid tasks without any basic excitement ... impatience to see. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another woman had sex for good reason. Also, what is the point that the dolph have to kill this other woman in cold blood who has helped him. Anthony Hickoks director should see a stinker when reading the script. It's good to have it set in the underworld of the new salenium and made half intelligent characters. There is no point in setting in the 70s and there is no bearing on the story. Avoid this!
