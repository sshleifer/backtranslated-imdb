It's the worst movie ever seen. Did Avengers manage this dubious honor? But no longer. Performance in "Jill the Ripper" was harsh and only obscured by the plot. This film is intellectual like Telletubbes. It does not know whether it is a S & M movie or really bad thriller. Just looking at intense anesthesia or if you run the bed and need a distraction that wears a leather dress. This script has been rebuilt into a romance, it is not too much effort and has more half an hour life. A romantic, even a bad romance, Duff's Lundgren's career is not the way to have this picture.
