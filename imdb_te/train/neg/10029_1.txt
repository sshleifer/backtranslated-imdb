Tension trailer is not only about what I have seen before about the film when it comes to promoting the trailer. I asked my friends if I knew about it. "It was directed by screenwriter Vijay Krishna Acharya for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim is his first film in this film and a child in his flashback". <br /> <br /> When I look at it, I understand that it is not a good trailer, because there is nothing in the movie. This story is rare and may come with a 10-year-old child's good storyline. No action is rare and the camera stuck in every possible sense there and who's hard to figure out who's killing who. Also the action is daft & dubious. Eg. <br /> <br /> Koilala: Amrish Puri in Anil Kapoor's ferocious English Koil. <br /> <br> Joom Barabar Jhoom: I do not even have funny laughing comedy. <br /> <p> I heard the budget 40 crores, Dhoom 2 is the same amount and I do not know where all the money is going. <br /> <br /> Dil Hara & Chaliya are two songs Maybe good films are being shot in Greece.The worst cinema could also save this discomfit of Anil Kapoor's terrible English.
