I do not like this movie, but I do not recognize the character in the development and the confusing and controversial story, although most people are appreciated as a "master", though it is a lot of the book, although it is more fun than the fantasy's first ever attempt to fade in the mid-80s than the "Road to Los Angeles" Unpublished. <br /> <br /> "I worked hard to correct many errors in the book, but it did not save my money." At no point in the movie The Dust, when he tried to stay confident in the book. <br /> <br / > In a word: forgettable.
