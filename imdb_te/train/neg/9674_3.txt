The film reminds me of really bad science fiction films from the 50s and 60s. It's not horrendous or interesting, but it's frustrating, cheesy and stupid. Special effects are ridiculous, all actors are ridiculous and the ending is just horror. You have to waste your money, rent or buy good money. I give 10 to 3.5 (this stupidity is very fun because of this stupidity).
