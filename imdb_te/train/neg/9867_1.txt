A screen shot of this before the last year award season, is not really clear why they gave them after the end of voting, but anyway, maybe for the exposure, at least, but the film is a convoluted mess. Certainly, some were fun on the way to black humor, but none of the characters seemed to me real. I can not connect, I think it's a failure for me. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very irrational towards Scientology, Wow! What a great idea ... let's see if it's already dug to the point of futility. Total fire testing, lighting, casting, screenplay, horrific visual effects (it's deliberate, I can say and not everyone else, no one laughs at you) feels fake. Anyway, I hope I'll do it at least on the DVD, and I do not want a project that does not make a lot of effort to most people. But it's the way either trip. Boring trip at that.
