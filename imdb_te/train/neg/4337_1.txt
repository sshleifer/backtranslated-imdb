This is only Busheering of an amazing story by Edwin Torres. The film did not follow the story. <br /> <br /> Film author also has a lot of disparity with the original image of the surprise mirror. <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) is an opening for the original. Here, Carlito retires to his woman in heaven. <br /> What happens to Gail from Lorraine, Ohio? In this phase, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires and marries some more. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? <br /> <br /> In this film, Mr. Guzman played a totally different role. He is back in the days of Pachonas. Now, he is a murderer from Nacho Reyes, Cuba. I'm reminded that Nacho Reyes has a big role in the book. <br /> <br /> "I'm just a picture of myself I really think Torres is glossy over the tensions in Harlem, and the group can not get the treatment they made in the book and they are also wiping out in the film. This book tells a great story, this movie is a great story, it's just a big disappointment. Nci use.
