I saw this film last night and was a bit disappointed. There are a lot of "time facts". At the beginning of the film, grandfather made a comment to the grandson and his friends how they felt when Grandpa was 9 and 11 years old. The film was expected to take place in 1994. Moreover, one of us wore Eagles Donovan McNab Jersey. He has not yet drafted. The storyline is great but the facts and realism of the time frame is so small that the film is cheesy. An avid reader of my boyfriend WWII books and memoir. I believe it is good. Acting is very early. The dog is beautiful. But the way the film was made was to make me happy, I paid 50 dollars and it turned 50. I understand that I have not understood any of the people who have fought this war, but I hope the facts and time frames are closely monitored.
