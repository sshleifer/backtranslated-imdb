First of all, when you look at the film, start an opening with a friend: "This whole movie is daring, dude, I can never make movies." With this film, they made a great effort to get the title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of bits stolen from every B-horror film ever made. Actors, I guess, are in college. And its parts (especially in the beginning) appear to be in high school or middle school. That does not mean it. The scarecrow that killed people is not at least bit of fun. (SPOILER: In the end, when they are the name of the chanting Lester and when he is back, black man and scarecrow are both bored, perhaps at their last scene and cheesy dialogue.)
