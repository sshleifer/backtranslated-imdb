Warning: It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene it is a bad image. (See example 300). This one ensures lemma on top. The second scene has a spinning center of all actions. We will ultimately make the image of the known movie. Furthermore, the story goes far beyond the other plot. And it's more frustrating. To compensate for the limited absence of suspense, we learn more about how inconsistent the characters are. And oh yeah, they have a lot to show. For example, Andy (P. Hoffman) is a drug addict, more?, He cheating on his wife, plans to exploit his father, his wife cheating with his brother? Do not repent to his frustration for his mother's death, and yet? He's a serial killer, and more? etc etc are not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he has a top job. And why his wife did not leave before him. On the other hand, I enjoy a lot of actor Hoffman's performances. <br /> Here also PSH will save the rest of my 7 $ for this absurdity. Why absurdity? Since this does not make sense, why should I take care of the despicable characters? Another broken lemma must be a sympathetic to a movie (at least fun) character. <br /> <br /> It is a great pity that we want to work with the widow's pain without knowing the parents before the crime.
