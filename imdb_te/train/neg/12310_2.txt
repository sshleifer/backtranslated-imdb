Steve Martin should try to make remakes of classic comedy. He certainly does not fit this part. As the painful remake of Out of Towners, the film comes flat on the face. I thought Steve Martin was also able to come up with Jack Legon's fantastic performance in the past and this is also true for the film. Don Ackroyd was able to play well with Billco. Martin is great when doing his own characters, but attempts to rebuild the classic work of others. This is a sad statement when the film's humorous section of the first line of credits has a humorous part of the film. The line "The United States Army is grateful to the producers of lack of total cooperation" is the only line that I just laugh at. If you want to see the real Billy, hold the original parts of the Phil Silvers show. You have promised to laugh without making any mistake. I put this movie in the same category as the remake of the aforementioned lemman classic and psycho. None of them happened.
