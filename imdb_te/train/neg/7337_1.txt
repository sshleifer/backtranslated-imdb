Painful. Such a fun and interesting Shakespeare play is the only term to describe this awful composition. I gave a shot but was terribly disappointed and did not stop watching it. I am grateful to you and your boring brain to the man who wrote the novel of Much Ado's Twist. Your acting about a young audience will be lifted without vengeance. Please do not bother this gut wrenching, disgusting need for a glossy Shakespeare play performance. You will be forced to induce vomiting and the command you have to close with the television you choose to see this trash, because the involuntary defect is done.
