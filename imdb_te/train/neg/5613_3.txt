In my opinion, the film has progressed to a new idea. I look like a spear for a jet without looking at the side! The director seems to have an agenda! Duh! The alternate scene does not seem to me that I'm not rational. I'm usually heading towards Nasser but on the street it's reliable, depending on the man's / woman's miraculous observations. If you really want to do cr5eate as a trust substitute for 2000+ years, you have come to do more effort by allowing your beliefs to the other side. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film it was an attack on the Christian faith, I was not an atheist, allowed the beliefs of others and did not want any mockery, but to understand and tolerate.
