One of the earliest reviewers wrote that what was seen as a love story for Love Story; Someone likes it or hates it. But there is a distinct distribution of opinions from 1 to 10. For me, this movie is rated 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Oliver's father Ray Milland is a great worker. But the film did not specifically do the compelling task of telling the story and this story is not very impressive, not least for me, multiple views are not guaranteed. I might be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neill - I still do not see Barry Linden - because most of them, but not all, because of her being ruined by me. The only exception is Wack Up, Dock, in which his continuous performance is perfect for the character of Barbra Streisand's gopple - and not coincidentally, he makes a shot at Love Story for a good measure! <br /> <br /> McGraw and O'Neill try to move their roles apart, not to move their characters. <br /> <br /> The film opened in a good career: This is Tommy Lee Jones's first film.
