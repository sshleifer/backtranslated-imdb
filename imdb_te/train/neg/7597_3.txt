I love the depiction of 30 and 40 in the film. I love Salma Hayek. I'm ready to love this picture. But. . <br /> <br /> ! !! ! <br /> <br /> Nothing is good about it. The only entertaining factor for me is Colin Farrell's role as an unprotected writer and screenwriter, audiences reach audiences in an ABC visionary special special, while tackling the juicy matter of racism <br /> <br /> He did not say "acting" as Sutherland and his minutes there. <br /> <br /> Tired approach to tired story.
