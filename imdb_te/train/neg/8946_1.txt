I think the shots and lighting are very poor. For the first time I thought I was an old version (1956). I was shocked when I really found the real year of the movie. I do not know that such a bad film was made recently. Really everything I want to say. The film has a good story, you can not lose anything if you read the novel by George Orwell. I told you about what I said earlier. I can not believe that the film will receive many awards and nominations. I gave this film a terrific, because I thought it was very bad. That's all well. Too far
