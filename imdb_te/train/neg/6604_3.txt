The first is the best. The dialogue is horrible because the second sucks. However, the storyline is not so bad (actually, good and bad for all the articles). Throughout the film, I've turned off a few times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert, but not a good actor in Rush Hour. Chris Tucker is not good too. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (but based on her script). All the characters are not good there. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 are always action and low sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan is not good for him.
