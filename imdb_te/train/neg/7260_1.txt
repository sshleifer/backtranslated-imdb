"A Town Called Hell" (a "Town Bastard"), a British / Spanish co-production, was designed with the triumph of "Clint Eastwood" in Italian with the "Man with Name Name" trilogy. The most common of these films is the designation of notable American actors, whose occupations have deteriorated and their voices are dubbed. This film is not exempt, they have also used some British actors. <br /> <br /> The plot is difficult to summarize, but it happens here. This story begins with the rebels or stories headed by Robert Shaw and Marin Landou, killing a church, killing everyone inside, including the priest. A few years later, Shaw's ability to fast forward to the town has been nurtured as a priest. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of the town (Telly Savalas) is a ruthless leader who does not think anything against his gun. <br /> <br /> The alvira (Stella Stevens) killer who is looking for his wife and his wife. When she dies, she finds herself in a coffin for God to die when she dies. After the mayor was murdered by his follower La Bamba (Al Latori), the town was attacked by a Federal Canal (Landau) to search for the rebel leader (sorry but the name escapes me). Kelanel took up the town and began to dictate the urban areas to force them to disclose the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Even though they start side by side with the film, Dialogue Landau and Shah characters know each other. A blind man (Fernando Ray) states that the rebel leader can be spotted by touching his face. He did so and .............................................. < br> <br /> <br /> I'm sure the filmmakers are worried about it. It's just plain awful and well deserving of my terrible "1" rating. Shah has spent most of his trademark on the way to make it perfect. Landau also can not save the film. Beautiful Mrs. Stevens is also completely ruined here. After last year's peekinpai's "The Ball of Cable Hub", I seemed to be missing in this movie of this movie. Many of these paintings ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express") were made before Kozak's predecessor. Michael Craig is nowhere to be a character known as "Paco". <br /> <p> Fernando Ray has appeared in these "Western" films, although he is going to play a villain in two "French Connection" films. Al Lettari was born in 1975 with a character in "The Godfather" (1972), and went to other memorable roles before his premature death in 1975. <br /> In all lines, I see that the version I have viewed is 88 minutes longer than the 95 or 97 minutes listed in the IMDb, but I do not see the additional 7 or 8 minutes difference. <br /> Avoid it.
