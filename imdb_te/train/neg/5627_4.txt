When I see this movie, it changes the blacks much. The film spends its time, showing how powerful a black person (protecting the heroic moment) is. For most of the film, other black men (and black-skinned blacks) are in the background. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams's character is strong and sympathetic. The viewer is easily recognizable and sympathetic to her. There are some very clear and three-dimensional supporting characters that are easily skin and some white characters of some warmth and respect. But only 99% of black men in the film are missing men. The invisible shadows in the background are no consequences. Such a terrible error, but anything in the mainstream media is unusual.
