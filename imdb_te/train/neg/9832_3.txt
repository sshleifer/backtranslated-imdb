I looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and I picked up the time changer because I was in the mood for something like that. <br /> <br /> The film describes some biblical topics and time travels as having one but I did not expect the fundamentalist Christian film! <br /> <br /> This film has good special effects and it is very difficult. From the 1890s, our bible professor of bible travels to the 2000s and modern life is filled with bad influences - Jesus is not found anywhere. This excellent technological orientation can be accomplished with the help of a fellow biblical teacher who manages to find some functional HG-Wells-style time machine. The film starts to lose some credibility at this time, which is very unfortunate because the film is very early. Earlier (or soon after, get a recall), the appearance of our hero, the professor teaching a science class, where the Bible says it was dhrvikarincabadatayani saripolinatlayite scientific findings. ఎవరికీ స్పష్టమైనది ఏమిటంటే ఇది వైజ్ఞానిక పద్ధతిని గురించి స్పష్టంగా లేదు, అయితే చిత్రనిర్మాతలు తమ వాదనలకు మద్దతు ఇచ్చినట్లయితే, ఉపయోగకరమైనది మాత్రమే సైన్స్ ఉపయోగపడతాయని అభిప్రాయాన్ని కోరుకునే విధంగా ఇది కనిపిస్తుంది. <br /> <br /> In that case, the belief is absolute and correct. కాబట్టి, ఈ బైబిల్ ప్రొఫెసర్స్ కోసం జీవితం యొక్క వాస్తవాన్ని నేను అంగీకరిస్తున్నాను, అప్పుడు స్పష్టంగా ప్రొఫెసర్ అయిన సమయం మరియు యంత్రం కనిపెట్టినట్లు నేను ఏ రుజువులు లేవని నేను భావించడం లేదు (మరియు ఎవరూ ఇవ్వలేదు) బైబిల్ లో సమయం ప్రయాణ భౌతిక. <br /> <br /> Professor later convinced the leap in the future, the modern technology shock is very well maintained. Cases. It was a perfect year (he was reading a newspaper in pdf, hit by a car horn, let him bhayaparustundi date: the exact year in which it was pasted there is also a lot of fun.. * Hank *). The shock went a long way, though some. For example, one of the first to encounter when he arrived, and two days later he was invited to a church movie night and took a ride in a van. He sticks his head out of the window like a dog, headlights and scared the initial engine etc. He'd like a few days there by this point and the traffic from the city seemed too busy. In any case, it is very easy to ignore. టెక్ షాక్ యొక్క మిగిలిన బాగా చేసాడు - అతను ఒక పిల్లవాడిని చూడటం మరియు రిమోట్ను ఉపయోగించడం చూసేంతవరకు అతను ఏమిటో గ్రహించడం లేదని ఎందుకంటే ముఖ్యంగా TV తో అతని మొదటి ఎన్కౌంటర్ ఆలస్యం అయింది. Unfortunately, he is from the past and he is an elder because if he is an all-life and religion he meets our hero who actually starts to teach everyone. చివరికి అతను స్వయంగా చర్చ్ వద్ద స్పాట్లైట్ లో ఒక క్లుప్తంగా క్షణం పొందుతాడు అతను కదిలే మరియు జ్ఞానోదయం కోరుకుంటున్నాము ఒక దీర్ఘ ప్రకటనలో వాటిని క్రైస్తవ మతం తన భావన వివరించడానికి జరుగుతుంది, కానీ ఎక్కువగా కేవలం అదే ఉంది. A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this man (film go) and examine his name. He eventually decides to be a time traveler or a long dead biblical professor and decides what to think. <br /> <br /> Before the return of the professor to his own time, two men are waiting for them. In an attempt to imprison him or prevent him, he will act as soon as he is coming soon and when he says that he is a prophet they are acting madly as they hear him. <br /> <br /> At this time, it is no wonder if he whisked away and one of the husbands was probably rapture he'd heard a lot about this <br /> <br /> This sarcasm means that the professor is a self - proclaimed (and very sore) Knowing that the Prophet is near the Rapture and the Prophet is sent by his fellow Biblical professor and he is given the knowledge Boot), while he was sent by God. <br /> <br /> First 2080, then 2070, etc. Clearly he was He is trying to find the exact date of the end times - he is not ignorant! In particular, each episode of the movie will cancel itself because only because they are persevering over their religious beliefs, Suková find something! Mantle of the whole film, the whole thing collapses and the end of its own credibility anagadokkatanto is basically worthless.
