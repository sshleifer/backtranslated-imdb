"Hack hop", or "black mask" (in English) is a disappointment. I was told a sort of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film is very bad or does not have much time with a soundtrack film. Another thing is the conversation is pretty bad. The English version of the film has little idea and has appealed only to "nonsense" style. It is not a movie I want to see again.
