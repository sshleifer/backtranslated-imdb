This film is almost impossible to sit. It looks like I was filmed with a video camera and the film seems to be coming in at the time, but the characters do not change clothes once, but acting breaks the 4th wall into pieces for me. I worked well in 4th grade drama. The plot is unrealistic. If a person suspects the man, he turns to him. I was also disappointed that all the dictators were doing guns with guns. It was not a copycatcat, but the officer told the astrologer that he was not killed by using a pistol. The name of the book used to identify people who are not diagnosed with mental disorders is another thing that really hurt me that they are unpleasant idle disorder DSM 4. Overall, this film is not a low budget film, I think they're at least or they have good actors or more gore. Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and the low-budget Easy Rider used the horrific actors to make many people into the low budget.
