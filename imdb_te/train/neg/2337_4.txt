If not, there is nothing to absorb the audience, there is no story, there is nothing to think as some people say, Ividha stories ... it's Anderson's 'Magnolia' in the rebuilding effort is very good, but it's ... Well, it is blatantly failed to see the light and very easy, but it's a lot of movies. Maybe you write a story before you first write a story ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
