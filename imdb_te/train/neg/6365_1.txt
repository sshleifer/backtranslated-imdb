Wow, I know this film is bad but this is not bad. <br /> <br /> Roddy Rodie Piper helps everybody - helps everyone - Post-up lobotomy killing the patient and squeezes his dead son. His eldest son returned from the "Special Ops" of the Armed Forces, and he "saw things" because - by painting his teeth shifting if anything said about the past. <br /> Once upon a time cleaning the streets from Piper and his dead son (who died of the dead lad dead) and another man who was learning from his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love interest is that she does not have any reason to jump into the bones of the former army block of a beautiful young woman. It takes 2 minutes for 1 scene. <br /> <br /> You can save this action, but it is worse than storyline and acting. This has been done before, and it is all the better (ok-bak is a prime example). </ p> <p> Check out other images of director David Worths and why they put these 2 films, as soon as they are 10 years old You can comprehend when you are young. <br /> <br /> "Classics like Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - it's really true. <br /> If you do not watch this movie, I will give you Â£ 10. PS - sorry for the names of the character does not know, but it tells you something.
