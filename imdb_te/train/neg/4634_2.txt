Apparently some talent added, Maria Bello is always great. But it's just a daunting time, it hates every role and has made others a movie in an 'interesting' story. Well, I hope they came out of their systems. Unfortunately for the audience, there is no understanding, no sensitivity, no context, really humanity. It's no joke, horror, no matter what and no matter what the story is trying to tell, except everything is fine. Bad things do not happen, you sit and see, you do not care, so what? 99% of time, based on the true story, is a warning to the 'words' audience. This means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and attracted by some of the events they heard about, so they simply turned off the screen and expect the true nature of the story to feel some audience without the audience. I hope to have a great time making this film. It's going on ice.
