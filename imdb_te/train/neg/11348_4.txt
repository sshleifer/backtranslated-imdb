Six GIs left home about being abandoned, drunk and sacked at a cult meeting in Asia. Hooded figures are surrounded by two male dancers pretending to fight. On the back of them, on a altar, opens a woven basket and a man is drawn to the paint and eventually begins to imitate a snake, biting one of the dancers on the neck. Simulation snake is wearing some scaled looking body tights. (Certainly this is a female simulator.) Cult member who overcame them for a secret conference has repeatedly warned that the rituals should not be interrupted and most should not be taken photos or they will be hunted. Down and murder. Naturally, the GI takes a flash photo and sends anger to an angry connotation and steals a "snake" basket and drives it in the Asian night. <br /> <br /> In New York, the old news is visible to all of them. Men settle in their civilian lives, and their relationship with another. Their jobs come from a bowling alley organizer (David Johnson) Graduate Research Student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also in the neighborhood. Richard Long is a good elegant girlfriend girlfriend. Kelly is somewhat careless woman. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, obscure, secret woman (Faith Domargueau) shows and Marshall Thompson loves her and kills her <br /> <br /> Imagine what will happen. The first Jansen fears shadow at the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly gets a visit from Durger. Fearing him badly, he falls through the window and dies until the trail fall. Long and Dobson begin to suspect that the audience already knows what - Dargeg is associated with the deaths. They may even switch to a cabra, considering it. At this point, Long and Thomson are thoroughly exploited, especially if Thompson learns that he is in love with Domagerue and that he is also attracted to her. No matter. One of the six original criminals is not - and Thompson should throw out the snake window. On the pavement below, the body turns to the domain. <br /> <br /> "I told you about one of the things that I passed in. Anywhere from New York to Domager Who paid for the fare of the hotel? Who paid her utility bills in the hotel? Who paid for her amazing wardrobe? How well did she speak American English? What 's going to happen? The authors and directors are clearly the Wall Leon For example, in Lewton's "The Cat People", the woman was converted into a black leopard, but with a small exception, the threat is always in the shade, and it becomes more and more awkward Here are some of the transitions too shadows <br /> <br /> Leon's first "bus" is a literary one, a powerful victim through the dark tunnels of Central Park He walked alone. Something or someone else is following her. She froze with fright under a street lamp. The branches of her upper branches are raging something. She looks upward. Your hair is loud and breathing to stand in the end. It is a bus using its air brakes to stop for her. The filmmakers used at least two "buses" and none of them. A man is distractedly walking across an intersection, for example, and there is a truck's sudden rumble that hits almost. The shot is not set up. It impressed with a shoe horn. <br /> <br /> I do not take much care for the stereotypes of stereotypes that are sensitive, bizarre, poisonous, and folks permanently photographed. In fact, there are no snakes, very dangerous, and many unusual. In addition, men are more feminine than men in their supernatural movements and surpontinous manner. Do you want a repetitive symbol for men? Try racers of six trees. This is a very fast lizard. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some fine, low-budget horror imagery, do not be bothered. Find one of "The Cat People" or one of the other small pieces of Leuven, which is a clear copy.
