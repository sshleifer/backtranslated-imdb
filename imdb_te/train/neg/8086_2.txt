When I heard about the "solar crisis" for the first time, I got a load of cast, and I never heard of the movie ever before with a bigger cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very horrible and claustrophobic symptom for an image that I have outer space, sun, vast deserts and an expanded metropolis; <br /> And the effects are good, pretty unnatural, it seems everyone is hunkered close. If a team of scientists and soldiers can not ignore a deadly solar flare we are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet. <br /> <br /> "Heston, Palace, Matthewson, Boyle and others are doing this movie, with no feelings <br /> <br /> It is the last time, but it is the least in this attempt. <br /> If it is noticed in the movie, perhaps " Solar crisis " <br /> <br /> Two stars, mostly lost opportunities and bad career movements. <br /> <br /> How does Alan Smithy do his job with such waste?
