Ah, native Mexican t.v. Channel 5 every day, at 2:00 pm they broadcast horror films from the 70s to the early 2000s. This was aired yesterday's film "Return to Cabin by the Lake". <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin by Cabin" is often the most popular low budgeter and is well-received. The problem is that this sequel is not terrible, even unintentionally tries to imitate the funny and original. The Hague. <br /> <br /> In some cases the film appears to be soap-opera due to absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <Br /> My advice: Avoid all these costs. This is a film that can not be viewed. <br /> <br /> Not for the participants in the usual film making. <br /> You are threatened.
