What happened? What we are here is primarily a rich and acceptable mantle and a good and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses. Actually, it really does not. We are a little emotional to learning that Angie is not really pregnant, then she knows everyone has been informed, but it is. Steve Martin, a very talented person, usually brings a lot of film to a movie, is terrible and his overall role is not only for a long time, but also for a long time. I really like to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and unfortunately it's not, but there's a play with comic elements. It was a lot of fun if the film was made. Actresses are so much fun in their own ways and sitting here I can think of several occasions.
