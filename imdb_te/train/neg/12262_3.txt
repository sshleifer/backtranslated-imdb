Famous movies of the movie crew have to cope with a lot of late movies. Skipping the red blooded surf, the redundant disturb the list of pulp-horror titles. With the success of crocodiles exclusively, we strive in our way by directing the unstable 'crocodile' (the disappointing tab Hooper directed) and 'Lake Plasid'. Blood Surf is every bit bad for these other films? On it It's a wonderfully exaggerated. The saltwater-crocodile is 90-year-old, 30 feet tall (!) And it's killed as fun! During the film, he amuses himself devouring a group of absolutely stupid surfer-doods & dudes who come to seek new thrills by surfing a shark-narrow area. The only beautiful item about this film is the tropical place. Though the film is completely inappropriate, logons and nature are fantastic. Every other item is just as dangerous. Gore is quite a bit but all is fake and ridiculous. Conversations are clearly painful to hear! You do not believe in some lines that these actors say! I expect a psychologically booming team of surfers but I hope for their own desire they are not stupid! In the beginning of the film, one of the characters Jaws is referred to as a 'mechanical toy', where at least ten times less than Crock Spielberg's great white shark. Visual effects in 'blood surf' are enthusiastic and fail to impress collective hearts. I can not say much about acting from both of these actors. As the girls walk away from the beast, the girls are damped with a moist shirt and their breasts happily bounced. You are guessing right: Blood Surf is very bad image. So evil becomes fun again. 'Funny' meant for other reasons than James Hickoks.
