It is one of the 5 best movies ever made. The plot looks like a secret passenger 57. But it worked very well with the next picture. The plot is made possible in the worst possible way. Some of the awful movements in the film are standing on a flight attendant 747 flying door, trying to close the door while closing the door, 250 miles per hour! Flights from a distance of 8,000 feet a few miles away, which is impossible for thousands of pilgrims per hour for 747 pilots. When the runway (sure of course) directions to pull her flops, HUH !! On the runway you will come in flops to ensure that the recession on the engines can be reversed and lowest speed by giving maximum power! I made small and big mistakes in this movie, but my answer is the size of the English dictionary. It's a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
