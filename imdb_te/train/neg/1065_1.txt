Depending on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized - all of us all hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches to finally wait for the end. Half vignettes are nasty, with minimal entertainment value. There are some scenes in Paris - for example, I look forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I did not really recognize anything. The scene is in the bar too. No one was laughed at or in the theater. If you like bizarre, laughing, fake-intellectual pictures, do not miss it. If you are down to earth like me, you have to see that sorry.
