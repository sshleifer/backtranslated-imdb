Christopher Durang should be taught by a memorable awful monk, because he did not let the concept go. The play, "Sister Mary Ignatius It's For You For You" - at least in Hollywood - is in a similar tone in Diane Keaton's speech. Sister Marie is an exaggeration, a lumpune, a serious believer, the theorist and the bitter sarcasm of the most discreet nun - and as Lynne Redgrave has played, she is happiest. But the film emphasizes that we are taking this exaggeration seriously - similarly, maintaining the same ton in the scenes for "everything". These two approaches head Lang and the last twenty minutes, the movie goes from the track, drops into George and explodes. There are no survivors. Their encounter scenes with four predecessors, and sister Mary, are similar to Marie's scenes, which can work. Or sister Mary's scenes more realistically. This does not just work.
