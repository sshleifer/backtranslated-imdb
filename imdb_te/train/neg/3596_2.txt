To be honest, the Devil's Playing (or Weill of Blood or the Vampire Extesee or The Curse of the Black Sisters)? Is the movie a good mantle behind it ?? The resurrection of a long dead vampire who is inherited by a group of women wearing black dresses? But the punishment is terrible. There are great moments of screen when not literally anything. The characters are just standing out of nothing. There is no secret, no suspense, and no plot to take care of. Acting is just endless. Acting is a part of acting less than women dancing naked in the camera. They do it repeatedly. And the small plot looks to be designed to be less than naked attractive women, so they can join the dance. It's not so bad or meaningful as it's an act of a dancing or dead, it comes closer.
