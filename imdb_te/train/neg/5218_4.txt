Dialog biotechnology techno-bubble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood acting, a horror last 80 'cassio score, and science-fiction channel's programming schedule, since 1993. "Metamorphosis" begins with a very promising, although the film is bland inertia and MST3K-style cheese, Clark Kent Warnab 'Doctor' Peter Husman (Jean LeBrack) is his secret projects. But when he tests himself in his vague experiment, he becomes a vividly defined creature (which is a parallel to Dr Freudstein's "House from the Cemetery"). FX work is a very good low-budget product (although I doubt too much will be kept in the shadow for a reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" does not leave behind a bad retro in your guts, despite its hopes. I can not help but acknowledge with a closed note of a character: "(It is) a nightmare from the past!"
