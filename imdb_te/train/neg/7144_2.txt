It's almost as good as sitting through the terrifying "movie" of this whole god, I know that I will never experience a bad feeling again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fighting scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (from Cheddar Bob gets one eight mile), Nadia Buzorin - 10 (she is not an amazing actress). These are the criteria I used on average one two. I lost count but never believed in the film clich√©, never, in the film. The driver who killed her father with suspicion was competing against her while competing against him, from where it made the previous statement. Plus he shows up for any reason. He did not say before. I do not know what to say here. Look at it in TV in two years. At least that will be adjusted to commercials.
