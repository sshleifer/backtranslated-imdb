There's a good picture lurking here, but it's not. The basic idea is good: to explore the ethical issues that the group of young lives of the Apocalypse face. <br /> <br /> For example, our four leaders are suspicious of actually catching the epidemic in the mysterious air wiped out by humanity. Yet they are surgical masks a few times, not others. Sometimes they are fond of being wiped out with any bleeding area that touched the infected person. <br /> <br /> When these new killing or killings have taken place in a few weeks or months of the world, these people are constantly innovating. They are not accumulating the proper equipment or food. They are running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not take basic care when strangers meet. And after wading through dripping corpses of the entire human race, they are a minor subject as shelter debutantes. <br /> <br /> Have you ever wondered if they ever get out of this length? And if they do, someone wants to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> These hatreds are impossible to detect the moral dimensions of their actions and their spirit exploitation. Their actions have to make some kind of less. <br /> <br /> Above all, we have to fight with Chris Pine's dubious acting capabilities. The young James T. Kirk, who is confused when looking alone, can play his role. But the carriers he plays exactly the same note: arrogant and boneheaded. It is impossible to suspect that his total dramatic scope. <br /> <br /> In a positive view, the movie * looks fantastic. It has a sharp, saturated look that matches the southwest US locale. But can not really save the weak writing or paper-thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the ultimate world style, you must save the worry you see in your careers.
