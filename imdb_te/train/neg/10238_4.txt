Initially, this film could be good, but never imagined. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical for Asian directors) but does not know how to create or tell a good story to go with it. The story was broken and appeared to go in different directions throughout the film, finding a solid, detailed, interesting angle. In fact, the image press releases never fit in the description. But acting is very good. All actors have performed well, and Jude Law is the best of all. He chose to be such a weak film.
