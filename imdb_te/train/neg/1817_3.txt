Before the start, it was Sam Sherman's film than an All Adamson film, because credits roll, "Sam Sherman Production", appears to be bigger in character as a characteristic credit. Furthermore, Mr. Sherman collaborated with the screenplay and his recent idea that Sherman would contemplate the old Hollywood era when he was 69 at the age of 69 was his idea of ​​being a male actor in a movie starring Western Living Bob Livingston, a recent success "Swinging Stewards". <br /> <br /> Why do you want to be an old man in your old age who is now considered to be soft core robbery? This explains the explanation, but Sam Sherman is for you. His invasion with Old Hollywood depicted many films for Independent International Pictures, and he and Al Adams often tried to act as actors for their films (eg J. Carroll Nish, Russ Tamblin, Lone Chaney Jr.). But Bob Livingston? Tell me that this is the '40's second rotor for drive-in depot; It's ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Again, "Naughty stewardess" is a good film for them, so we can not write like this Sherman fiasco. Still, through any aesthetic standard, it is an involuntary mess. Al Adamson wanted from this film, why it's easy to watch. First, it does not have any style from the super soft core (Tats and Donkey / Simulated Sex only) in the middle of a kidnapping thriller (Stailler's "Wright Pfin and Arrow Boo!") And in the middle, Stevardes traveling around Vegas to Sparrow's Hawked Museum S painful boring scenes or a photo shoot in San Francisco Ai Richard and Connie Hoffman samedli. All the worst, we are trying to sexy with a blue jumpsuit to get Bob Livingstone like Jack LaLanne wannabe ... Gag! <br /> <br /> Kenny Hoffman has removed his big sex scene, but you can catch his dirt on his DVDs in the special features section. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible, terrible movie, but I give three stars for Greater's photography and Coney Hoffman to create a "folding" Livingston. "Naughty Stewards" for al Adamson completists and / or extortion film scholars as Sam Sherman's commentary provides the information inside the information. All the others, beware.
