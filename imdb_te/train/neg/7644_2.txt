This is a very long time since the film was very bad. It's a lot of acting, the story is terribly boring, and I'm losing words for the death penalty. It's totally unrealistic. Oh, and this is too much comedy of a pregnant Schwarzenegger by Clint Eastwood! <br /> One of the first scenes (one on television show - where hell are you?) That's right. If they are hoping for the resume of the career, then I think this has never happened in their CV! This script had a probability, but it was removed by 80% of actors or director (actor and apparently committed to being an actor). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
