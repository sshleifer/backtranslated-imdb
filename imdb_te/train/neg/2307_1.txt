I'm true of Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. I saw the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea about the film. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their good efforts. <br /> <br /> It does not mix well. It is very choppy, and less comedy. I was disappointed. <br /> I was waiting for months to see the film based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> If you do not fully earn money, watch all the pictures of Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. <br /> This is a very small way to spend the evening.
