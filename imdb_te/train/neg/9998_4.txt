At the end of the film, I felt very technical. I felt like I was in a class looking at my Navy's rescue. I saw the fire exhausters for engines. I guess I guess I would expect it, but I never thought about it. It is not strange to use 747 to transport valuable old paintings with much lower security. Acting is pretty good because they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you're going to get up to what has happened so far, it's more fantasy and comical. Everything was taken very seriously. At least the film is Felix Unger pilot, Buck Rogers, Night Staker, and Dracula on board. The film is filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood is exaggerating a bit for the play, but the quality of a film does not hurt when a serious subject is made into a satire. That's why I'm more ridiculous. My pet prince with movies about airline travel is just about everyone moves about. They walk around with drinks, arrange them, take them out after 5 minutes, if they have a building or something, and maybe tumbleless does not exist. Also, I know a catastrophic film, but do not include a 30 second crash after hitting something with suspense. However, the talented actors and actresses put this weak script into the film that was placed after the first film show. I liked Le Grant, but enjoyed watching a moody person ... :)
