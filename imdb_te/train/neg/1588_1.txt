This film has seen Billy Jane so far. The film is primarily to show the newcomers, they are new to everyone, but the film is not all that believable. <br /> <br /> You feel that the police intervenes to shoot all the guns. A coin deaf is also stupid in the scene. <br /> <br /> Sean suddenly discovered that coin bug is not real. <br /> <br /> The film was shot together fast. Poor job. <br /> <br /> There is no calculation until the end. It took a long time to fight. And it is no coincidence that every time Billy is going to explode the scene, he is out of bullets. Once, I believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character is geeky. At the end, Sean is stupid because he is asking him. It's like comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
