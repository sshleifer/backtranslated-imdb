There is no doubt that this film has impressive actors but unfortunately the film does not help with major side effects. Why do directors ask actors / actresses not to use their voices, they can not convince anyone. Finnes can not just make Irish and Fitzgerald is not better in Russian. No matter how good the actress is convinced if the voice is wrong. The main problem .... the plot .... is there? I thought it was a sort of storyline, but it was quite full because I could not wait to finish the movie ... it's ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and watch this movie!
