As with a hero and a high school writer, 'The Art of Seduction' failed to deliver romantic, sophisticated experience, which tries to bill himself. Two main characters are interesting - male and female mainstream "swinging singles (or engaged in female mainstream case)", but 'Seduction Art' did not even try. Sharking from the Frank Observation of these two characters, 'The Art of Seduction' bypasses anything of the substance to the thin, lean stereotype. <br /> <br /> 'Seduction of Art' is insulting - insulting for its roles, insulting men and women, and insulting its audience expectations. We will take all the terrifying people we know, and they can play their painful interactions when we expect them to worship us. Ji-van is an immature, spoiled, hobby bitch. The viewer would like to forgive her and her mistakes because she is beautiful. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. There are no good people. The "humor" in this film primarily revolves around the tremendous efforts of G-von and Min-Jane to overturn each other in the respectable art of lying and manipulation. No character develops, and we have never learned about the existence of G-von and Min-Jun. They just expect they to take them, and do not ask questions - they're cute, and that's all things. You can tell the film, if you're in high school, you liked grease or you're a yellow fever victim, you might like this film. <br /> <br /> Despite its "romance" tag, this is not a good date movie.
