"Giant" is one of the most boring, over-the-long Hollywood contracts. Most scenes are completely fake and powerless. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean were wasted in this large Hollywood production. The central concept of the film is that a run race can never be excavated for its oil on the ground, it's absurd, because I know from Houston that I know it. Some scenes, especially Dean Coffee Taylor coffee, radiate this kind of boring image. See "Hood" (one of Paul Newman's greatest performances) or "The Last Picture Show" for a more accurate and interesting depiction of how the modernity of Texas has changed ranches.
