The passenger: "Sure, I can drive for a while." (Once pulled, the driver starts to catch the passenger boobs) the passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "It's OK, everyone will do it for a while." The passenger: "Ok then." <br /> Now, the last time I checked into the pornographic section of the Hollywood video (unless you enter S & M, you go elsewhere), and this should not be exactly the main videos in the blockbuster. Do not get me wrong; I'm absolutely not one of those people who hate romance, if I'm looking for a movie in the main streams it's just right and definitely I want to see it, I can only rent it, I'm not renting this one It should be purchased only for public festive celebration. If I give a 0, I'll do it, but I'll give it only 10 *.
