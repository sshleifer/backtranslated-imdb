<br /> This happened in 1974 and it starred Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> What do you think about this film? <br /> Make it a Movie. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slavic may be an innocent naive, or he may have just wanted to change. <br /> Whoever has or does not decide in Slovic history is a film that deals with the ghost when it is struggling. <br /> <br /> When the slogan, Slavic's position, the plain, is not about Waiting for the Vietnam War, not the WWII, And simply saying. He has a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous condition, and believe me, if my nerves have completed my fate, my nerves have lost my duties, failed or lost or KP functions. If you believe in the telephony, Slovic has no criminal record, There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> The viewer is up to the viewer to believe. <br /> <br /> I have learned a lot from the decade or so of the decade films in the service or military dispute. <br /> <br /> 1940s and 1950s will serve your country. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s and 1970s, disgrace your country. <br /> It's history. <br /> <br /> The whole picture seemed to me Hollywood. <br /> <br /> He is emotional, he shows emotion. <br /> <br /> This emotional tension can easily serve its purpose in declaring his nervous condition, but apparently <br /> <br /> I am not a Catholic, but hid by nude betty is a recital of Mary and I am about to die He is suffering. <br /> <br /> In the end, Sheen heard that with the prayer of the Lord, they were trying to see what they could say faster. </ P> The Tricky Dick is aimed at Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it is valuable to anyone who has chosen to follow Slovque and his example.
