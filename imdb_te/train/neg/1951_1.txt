Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most common, successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world. So, what happens after you're everywhere and everything with formula? Did you change it to the right? Wrong. If you want to stop the product and rest for a decade and then succeed, run it again. That is, for most part, tell the stick with the formula and add your special flavor to it. This "New Scooby Doo" work is a "Scooby Doo named Pup" that only wants to go back to the classic classic Scooby Doo formula, but most of the original was not tapped from the original "Scooby Doo Where Are You". <br /> The first sign of weak submission (me) include additional characters; There may be some fanatical memories from the last sleep but in general "Scooby Doo" may not be thinking about film-flam, scrappy or Scooby Dame. Even worse, the exception of the other major members of "Mystery Inc." usually refers to a group of productive individuals who do not understand from the child's point of view how the show works.

At one point (I think the first was the Scooby Doo series) she was called "the accident occurred". The authors used Daphne to combine the unrelated incidents of the accident. She often finds some other details that can help me secretly find the door, objects or the gang link credentials. Finally Scooby represents us, participating. He was always at the center of events, he was not a man and the television viewer was not really involved because the rest of his gang was still and disabled. <br /> Maybe I'm thinking of things, but in my life I have seen Scooby Doo (30 years old).
