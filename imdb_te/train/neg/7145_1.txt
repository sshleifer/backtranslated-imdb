Clearly Hollywood is just a camera and the ability to speak is to give money to anyone. The film is unpleasant in mind. The cast was terrible, untold, and the story was filled with holes. Script? Who needs the script? I was surprised that the film was not as foolish as I thought, but I had enough lifespan for T & A's of the shots. The story wanted to hear a 19-year-old street racer, which decided to buy a car instead of telling a story. The two brothers loved the first. The scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film, make me think of herb: completely loaded. This is the kind of film that Grindhouse has changed for himself ... just the authors feel intense.
