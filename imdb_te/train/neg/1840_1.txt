It's the most ridiculous and unlikely "comedy" I've seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken do not laugh me as a crazed homeless man? Something's wrong with this picture. This is the only film I'd like to go out. I used free passes, and wanted to return my money back. Two films I've seen sincerely worse than this film are House of the Dead. The. Only. Worse. Image. I did not quite laugh at the merry-go-round scene, and that's it. If you spend 2 hours playing comedy, you have to get more than one laugh. I do not know, I guess filmmakers think that "Flan" is a funny word, or something. Literally - and the other running joke is really beating the dead horse.
