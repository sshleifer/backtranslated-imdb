I caught this film in a small screening by my college gaming club members. <br /> It is said that this is said to be the "reaper madness" of gaming and the movie is more than the distribution. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays the role of Robbie, when the young man began to resume his college career. "We are a viewer when the film is moving forward, and Robbie is a player of the role-playing game called" Majzes and Monsters " A game in which a gaming band introduced him back to promoting him <br /> <br /> This film has many levels It's ridiculous.It's a grouping group that has "gaming through candlelight," which is perhaps the best way I can explain, because most gamers are familiar, it's not terrible, because I'm sure this is a "culture" in some of the most pressing sessions in well-lit rooms , Usually can be of some cheese-tohs and soda. <br /> Not the Oscar-caliber, the author It's one of the first characters of Tom Hanks, and one year or two years in Bossum Buddies and Bachelor Party and Horizon. <br /> <br /> Mainly, this is "TV's Movie", " Dangers "for a TV-designed movie. See if you and your friends plan a bad movie tonight.
