Among the ten actors who played Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe appears to be the most personal, but in this script the audience is predecessor to the famous detective. After all, Jackie, Douglas Walton, vacant in space, was definitely hypnotized, and I said something like "I should ride and kill", and thought that nobody took it after he had been killed. Police thought it was suicide because he said he would do this! After killing the hated horse owner Jean Lockhart, Freuda Innscott will do the same, telling her that she is going to be killed and a bus was damaged. Lowe eventually "I had to," I laughed if it was a revelation. However, the criminal party was cleverly hidden and a substantial suspense was created when he began to hypnotize him to jump to a roof.
