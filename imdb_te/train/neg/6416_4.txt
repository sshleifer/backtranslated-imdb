<br /> <br /> Why are they cut in the crowded dance floor while going to the bathroom when they are ill or ill in a club? <br /> When someone enters their room they hide under the bed in their right minds? <br /> <br /> How often do you have a stranger on the door and if they do not answer you right away, you open the door and walk, start shouting some hello and start learning their stuff. <br /> If you know someone who killed someone who is killed, what will you do? Silently off wood and under a wooden platform or to hide between metal equipment? Silently of course, run a ratty old barn or other weakness structure? <br /> <br /> I'm talking about a thriller that has come over the last few years, but I'm talking about "The Return" because this "The Return" page. I work in a movie theater and make a point to perform all the "horror" films because it's free. I thought this one was tolerable ... from well-worn clich√©s. Sarah Mitchell Gellar is truly wheat and is part of the "huh" type. The details of the film are slowly circulated by slowly cinematic film and this is not nearly enough explanation, which I lost almost 2/3, but <br /> <br /> If you're a die hard thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater, if I really want to watch the film, I will evaluate a ticket worthy. You make it like an interesting movie made by the trailer and you can not wait ... if you wait.
