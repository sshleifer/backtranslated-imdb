Yes, Madison's role - talking to a woman from TV station - this is correct: LAPD corruption, violent and racist police. And this film is nothing about it. Well, here are the good police, moral cops, a black man, wow, a Christian, martyr. But this is a fairy tale, accept it. Reality is not like that. Action fans are very important: shootout boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Not much more. Play Counter Strike, then you will have at least anything. The only moral of the film: LAPD is now good. It does not have more bad cops. If you make critical and subscription statements for police and military service, see this movie. It's the tall commercial I've seen so far. (2 points for camera and editing).
