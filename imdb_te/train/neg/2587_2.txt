OK so nudity is there, but hey, for the likes of whom it has free sex on the internet. And they are just silly about how they got into the tits into each frame. I understood that it was not from nudity but from the farce of producers / writers of this piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny at all, its all very funny and very predictable. No plot, no dramatic content. This way the other pay-movies are worse and they're great either ART :) This might be acceptable if you really buy 13-year-old who is drunk or perhaps bothered one, otherwise. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
