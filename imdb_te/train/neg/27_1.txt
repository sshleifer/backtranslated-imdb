Terrible picture. <br /> These lines just filler. The movie is bad. That's why I do not know that stretch. It's already waste my time. I warned others. Avoid this picture. Acting sucks and writing is just moronic. Everything is bad. The only good thing about the film is the breasts of Deniz Akkaya. It was destroyed by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> First I wasted my time watching this lag. Then I felt compelled to alert others who created an account with IMDb because I want to write a friggen article in the movie to say how painful it is. Absolutely unnecessary.
