I and a friend had rented this movie because it was very good. But we are wrong. Acting first .... Wow ... Acting was worse, the effects were bad, it seemed to be a film made by a college boy. The plot is pretty good, but it's done. Most of the actors have destroyed the movies. The main guy is always the worst actor ... I'll also call him an actor a shame ... The only good thing about this film is that it's so funny that it's funny ... You see a good laugh ... but rather than .. Stay away from this distance. I normally B list movies and such love, but this is ... I do not even know how to put it in the video ... I know this is the worst I have ever seen .. and I have seen some bad ones.
