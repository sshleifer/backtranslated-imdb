"Wild Tigers I know." Make sure it's shown only in big cities. It is one of those films except SO RTC, Director, so far no sense! I hate that! <br /> There is no plot, no story, no moral, no chronological, and no fun. Or touching. For me, it has scenes with scenes that are not related to each other and everything for "performance" to show how to get "artwork" and "visibility". This is another team that is ATTEMPT in an Anging film, but we have lost the mark to each level of human level. Then roll the credits! I look forward to hearing it! I'm waiting for "good part". There are about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, most of which are called "Art House" films. This is not one of them. You are very angry to watch this movie and are purchased on a very low DVD.
