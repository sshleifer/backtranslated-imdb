Honestly, I do not see this movie because the actors are not, rather than the plot, because it is rated 17 in Luxembourg and the film should be really cruel or obscene. During my lifetime, I have seen the most horrible pictures (Ichi Killer, Badman, Helraiser) but this film is the most disturbing and brutal film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is plain stupid, directed and awkward, acting is a simple copy, also known as "Horror Soundtrack". The whole picture is not a brilliant item, and some scenes are really hard to stand. (Especially the scene, you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries - terrible). I do not know why this film was rated 16 in Germany, where the standards are usually the hardest (eg killing-bill (which is cruel but it is also enjoyable and has a great hint of Asian cinema and has an excellent direction) 18). It is not called horror film because no one is more gorgeous than people are afraid ("Creep's face" in the middle of the film is a very bad decision); I'm just a mad director living in his disturbing fantasies (forgive my expression). In some scenes you will see violence, it does not have anything to do with the plot or explain it. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to getting feedback on my thread and I love to be happy. <br /> <br /> "Livin" The Baby, Livin The Dream "David Eames
