Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; The Meet Meet the Bad and the Beautiful in St. Louis. I am looking forward to this film with great interest. But a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some look after the scenery of Going-Goor Felicelism Running Going. Sinatra is back from the war that convinces her disappointing masterpiece project, living in drowsy dudes as a grieving thief, hanging him in a frustrating floozy hanging, hanging him in frustrating family relationships. The film is in a large dramatic ending with a disappointing villain with Sinatra and McClane and something disappointing. This sequence tension is intended to be filled, but not Minnie Hitchcock; When he gets distracted by the pretty colors, he does not notice a sculpture clich√© on the scene and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed that they do not care to get ready. (Most notably McClane) but the real cinematography in this project. Otherwise we see constipation letters standing around bars & living rooms to get each other nerves for two hours. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film. After WW2 the return of soldiers back to displacement and apathy is more subtly handled in 'The Live Years of the Best Years'. And the two grocery products, 'Grass in Springer' and 'Picnic', are depressed in the dead-end town, more fraudulent.
