Blonde and Blender unfunny.Basically, it's a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumbler, but less funny, and they have used very background sounds and music. You have a lot more background music and music I ask you !!!! It's very frustrating and it starts to be totally foolish. It does not take pace anywhere, and I'm more disappointed with this nonsense. The only thing that saved me from giving a picture in this movie is the last 30 minutes. It's somewhat entertaining and interesting, But this is only part.Also, I'm Pamela Anderson and Denis Richard The characters did not help me a little bit. Even though this movie was a laugh it retained my attention. I do not have to tell you to remove the film completely, but there are thousands of good movies to spend your time and money over Blond and Blender.
