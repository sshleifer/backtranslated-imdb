What do you say to anyone, the word "possession" in the movie is "just the green light on the image?" Religion does not do anything with it, but it makes a general sense. That means, if your head is clear and you have the sound in mind to make a decision <br /> <br /> Where is this movie entertaining at most levels? Star? Story? Unique idea? Children with a dinosaur and a black woman My goodness! I can say this is an "idea", it's good. But somewhere in development ... anyone who does not translate a piece of entertainment can not be prescribed, no one wants to see or pay ... They are totally confusing unless they are too deep in the influence of alcohol or drugs. <br /> <br /> Who asks the plot (what the plot?) and others? Whoopie got a cash check, but I would have been struggling to take it. I'm sure she has removed her agent / manager / campaigner in this career. Not obviously, she went to make more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
