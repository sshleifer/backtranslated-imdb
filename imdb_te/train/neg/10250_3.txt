The flawed, cheap sci-fi thriller, with almost full faith (full control room for other devices that can be used to separate messages from external sites and runs through ONE only, and much less nightly protection), and campy sound effects. Christopher Lee not only wasted, but he gives some of his some of the "I definitely worth the money here". (* 1/2)
