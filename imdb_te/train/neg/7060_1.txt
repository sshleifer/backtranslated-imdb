This film is terrible. The characters are completely unreliable and wildly different. The plot is awful and some classes of scenes make for a stark-worthy and uncomfortable view. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and classification The film is written by high school students, because the school environment is not credible, in fact authors probably never go to high school. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if any actors are able to see the film even though it is very weak in most cases, although it is down to a poorly written script and plot. <br /> <br /> The sound track is okay, and the cinematography is good in places (editing is poor).
