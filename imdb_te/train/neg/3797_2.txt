Since the years spent in Alex Rain (played by Oliver Gruner in the first film), a war broke out between humans and humans, since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and now we have the daughter of the loser Olivier Gruner's character (she only half of her acting ability) This is the lowest connections to the first films , But when she created a superhero she hides in the 1980s, but a bounty hunter from the future hunts her this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis is a cult hit and I can see why people liked the movie even though I was a cinema fan. Nemesis tried very pretty with the idea of ​​different ideas, to develop a beautiful look and provide tons, which is almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have the ambition, which is the original selling point of the terminator's cheap split and action sequences that do not have the explosive scope with Olivier Gruner as a master thesian to be seen as a master thespin. I admit that I'm not an original fan, but it's better than that. The film also has good cast including Tim Thomson, Kary Hirouki Tahawawa, Tom Mathews, Brian James, Thomas Jane and Yes Jacky Early Haley. <br /> <br /> When I saw this, I was actually motivated to add half a star. <br /> *
