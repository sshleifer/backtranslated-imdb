Yes, Death Tunnel is definitely better than my view. In fact some deaths are pretty original and Gore is good. <br /> <br /> When discussing horror movies in the kitchen of "Children" (high school or college?), everything says almost perfect coat scream (1996). <br /> <br /> Do not Raldi burn out from the screw screen? 3.) Besides the fact that it happened in October, what should be done with what Samhain the film Hale? If you ask me, it's pretty unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 4. Wow they made a Sam Raimi tip !!! 5.) Why is Gary and his sister in this film? They do nothing with the characters. And he could not see his own death Hey hey? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at that time, deaths were just Tromma-Leoise) how can she hear her crying while she was standing down but did not hear them while standing outside the door? <br />) Gary's sister commented about haggis - not primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So you're like Shay and no pleasure or smile the entire movie, would you be the one to live? <br />) The mutants were pretty good, but they were like walking in chili con cany's dishes. <br /> When they were in Gary's sister, Steve Hodd was wrapped, and he went? 11.) Is not more than one killer? <br />) What does that other people have with a flashback? Half of them do not know whether they are dead or alive, so what is that? 13. Why did they not kill Gary and his sister? 14. Who has not been called by police? And the people who lived in the woods knew what they did not carry out the attack. 15.) As far as I know, they are not zombies or vampires-so why is she "united" at her end? I'm with everyone on the giant "huh?" <br /> <br /> Death is a better way than a tunnel, but still very sloppy. They do not even understand why Ireland is still placed, considering Samhain is nothing closer to the plot.
