I'm not like Love Sick as Image.

The film was intended to later express the romance of romance to audiences. <br /> <br /> In my view, sexual life is always everywhere complicated, and does not feel any special impression and effect from the film. <br /> <br /> Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother are the neighbors' neighborhoods of love. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why this film did not like me was that they told us how they started falling in love? Alex sounds in the building where Kiki lives, and then the two girls fell in love. It does not make sense at all. Instead of a male, a girl falls in love with another girl. Too many fragments, you need to connect the stories and those stories through your mind. Second, there is no scene of Alex and Kick's sexual intercourse with the whole picture, what is it that I look forward to? However, it still deserves some parts recommendation. The "ear piercing" piece is interesting. Alex Cook likes to experience ear chair pain to congratulate the love. A touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, they have fallen into the scene soccer field, their conversation is honest and emotional.
