I can not understand that this is a very impressive picture made in Hollywood. Acting and story is awful just in curiosity & direction. I can not see any logic behind this trash, unless the director did nothing. I took ten minutes to waste my precious thirty rupees. This troubled me filled with worry that I was going to waste some time in my life. I'll be less than a day in the movie. I do not know what category it belongs to. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, bang on your head on the walls or do not go for this film.
