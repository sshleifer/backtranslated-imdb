I did not like this film and I gave up on a scene where the British lured a credible gang. The film has effectively blamed NI's people for their own problems. 25 years of war The British divide of Ireland and the dominance of its history, NI Britain was not created without the wishes of Ireland in 1921. Although I hate a trusted paramilitary, even though they are fighting for a reason to maintain their artificial rights in the Catholic community, the characters are described as unsuitable fools. The fact that British intelligence worked with the faithful during the war, there is no doubt that Catholics are kept at bay and discourage republicanism. <br /> <br /> 'Magic' and 'nineteen' values ​​of males are depicted as part of a suspicious Irish mind that leads to Belfast and violence until the 1970s. The stupid song from the woman in the club - Old Ireland in the green fields ..Blob ..Blaw .. - A formal trend is given, ie, poor young fools fighting for an impossible reason. Tedious, prehistoric, cheap and evil trash. O'Sullivan made a personal announcement on the controversy over the controversial political analysis.
