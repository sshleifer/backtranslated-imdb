OK - helicopter shots are excellent, and the director uses good uses of certain parts of Barcelona. Otherwise ... In the first few minutes, the value of the product plunged, and the rest of the week seemed to be a picture. Ellen Pompeo is beautiful and pleasant to watch, the Abel folk is the most deep and most effective, and William Baldwin ... well, William Baldwin. He is bringing his martial arts training to good use and running-jumping-enthusiastic action figure. The remaining cast is well carved, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's an image postcard with action twist, and a healthy dose of El Greco. Otherwise, skip.
