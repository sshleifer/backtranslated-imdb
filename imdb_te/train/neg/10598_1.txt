This is a piece of s - t !! It is t.v. Looks worse than it is made for. Image. And I continued with the shutter and the sequel was also shaken and the results ... it was much more beautiful than the war. Jean Claude Vaughn again made insult and wonders where his career is now. Script, no story and time should waste on this. I mean. 10 to 1 is too high, the path is too high. Goldberg should be jackhammered for this. Van was not a shame.
