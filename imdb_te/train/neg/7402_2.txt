This is an example of trying to make their first full-length film for technically highly talented directors in video clips / commercials. On the one hand, images, camera, lighting, CGI and sound are also well polished and have a real "expensive" look. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors in this movie also demonstrate the likelihood - the best acting can not hide a bad story. <br /> In this case it is not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialogue is "what is hell?", "what is it?" And "What the hell at that?". In any case, the characters or the audience did not give any answers. Most of the other conversations do not have a conversation book and the actors have always been free to develop a platform that has not been explained to them. <br /> <br /> Sky Bennett's performance may be very good, and she does not allow these awful terrible dialogue lines that other actors face, as her character is an autistic girl. Thus she was able to show her acting talent and the other cast did not get close enough. <br /> <br /> Ben: Is this true true? Emily: Stop. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh? Zone: Anybody has to control this situation. Ben: This situation is not controlled. You can not, not someone. Emily: You're not either. <br /> I got goosebumps. But for horror, for the terrible endeavor. <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
