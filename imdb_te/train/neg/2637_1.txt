Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's like someone has given a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third grader and says 'make me a picture of the secret service'. Compilation is ridiculous, cinematography is better at random, every letter of speech is completely reduced and directed ... well, is there also a director? Everything is just pointless and lame and meaningless ... and random .... and dull. <br /> <br /> Here's a spoiler for you; This movie is a dunkest thing you will ever see. <br /> If you like this part, you will also enjoy it; Deuterons, dark blue, and partial frontal lobotomy.
