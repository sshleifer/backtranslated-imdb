<br /> When judging by some comments in the IMDB, I'm an action movie - perhaps a dramatic or a sly or a simple one or a comic one, but surely an action movie. I see, it's not exactly like an image. This story is simpler and straightforward (attempting to make the mood look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) rebels 3) team of assassins. <br /> Get rid of them now (they will never appear in the movie). Then just kill the murderers, the princess, let a revenge trip become a rogue. Combine a rebellious love-interest with guilt conscience. <br /> <br /> But they could not change the story or film yet. When trying science fiction on a low budget between some random action sequences and some odd visuals, what the null concept you are left behind. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie feels similar,
