(English), it is very small with the devils and wants to do more with the hungry ruler and the main character (& blood of the virgin) with the power of Philips's Stone. Jacquito Molina plays Gilles de Lancrei and has a slight problem with the people he killed while he was threatening his position or when he needed virgins for their blood. He is the love of his lady and he is an alchemist who has done the job and it is evident through more greed and madness which feels his problem rather than supposedly (unfortunately) possession. There are at least somewhat exciting episodes like men and grown men trying to knock down each other with big sticks, and the film is at least a little bit about this otherwise, although at least it has a good look. Nothing is afraid of Morina and Naschir's film and it's very unusual, not really any random comedy. Therefore, from 10 to 4.
