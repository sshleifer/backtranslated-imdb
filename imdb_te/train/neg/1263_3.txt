Fighting on a desert barren is very fond of giant robots, robot wars will deliver. Sure, acting is lousy, dialogue sub par, and the characters are a dimensional, but it has huge robots! Special effects are very good for themselves. They certainly can not be polished as of today's standards, but it has at least computer graphics and uses thumbnails instead, so it is very old. It is easily neglected for its shortcomings in small films and contains a specific tongue-in-cheek humor in episodes that make it much more enjoyable. I would recommend this to giant robots or cheesy sci-fi fans.
