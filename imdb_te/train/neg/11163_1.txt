We loved the School of Rock and Jack Black. We can not go and wait to see this movie. The film is very small in my life and I wanted to go out. My husband hated it too. There are only funny parts in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money. The writing is awful. This is a terrifying style for the Hispanic people to be completely ruined. This film is not too long but for us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater are very restless and silent. I was sure that there could be some ransom parts because my husband had been there, but it was not there. Save money and save your time.
