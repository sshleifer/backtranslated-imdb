When robot groups start attacking major cities, who will stop the madman behind the attacks? Sky Captain! Jude La Joey Sullivan, Ace of Skyways, faces an inconvenient inequality along with his embarrassing reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and former flight partner Captain Frankie Cook (Angelina Jolie). Sky Captain and tomorrow feel the world's exciting movie but it's really dull and under-hell. The film's time is 106 minutes and it's too long because the film does not have material. Visuals are very good and the film has done a good job. However, none of these amazing visuals are available. The film has a very difficult and unnecessary story and has interesting characters. I blamed director and writer Kerry Konrun. He focuses much on visuals and spends less time in the original story. The film is like a girl with no personality, just a little later, it's kind of soft and tired. Sky Captain refers to a beautiful girl who has no personality. <br /> Acting is surprisingly average and they are not their fault because they can not work. Because of Angelina Jolie I have seen this movie the main reason. However, the statement is very misleading and she is in the picture in just 30 minutes. Her performance is surprisingly polite. Jude Law will give you some odds that you will have so many hopes from him. Gwyneth Paltrow is just average, no special. I really liked Lingu's performance. She gives a pretty good performance as a mysterious woman and she is the only interesting character in the whole film. <br /> <br /> This film is not complete. There are some "low" and exciting scenes. Not enough of them. The film just hook does not really remember it. It's really bland and it's not all too engaging. It's very promising, because it's in a good campus. In the end, Sky captain is surprisingly less than average and is not really worth looking. Rating 4/10
