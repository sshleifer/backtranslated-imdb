The Holy God is holy and holy. This image is so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In bad path ... the role of the character is the poorest thing I've seen for quite some time. This image is similar to G-strings, the Lord of IMHO (that is the real picture). The film appeared on a very awful green screen. My favorite part is when they're in the carriage, and there is no horse. They are fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a fast jog. Then it turns out to be a ridiculous CG horse. And generally the CG 1992's Mind Eye's Beyond is a sub-par. I mean, come on really. Like Hercules terrible episode, Kevin does not save the day without sourbo. The worst. Movie. Ever.
