After stopping through the image store to find something to see, we stumbled on this. It looked at least from the summary, so we tried it. And here is the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's really enjoyable! Oh, wait, talk very quickly. <br /> There is nowhere, the film took a disgusting turn into the basic, right-wing Christian brain washing. I do not know exactly what is going to happen, but I think the screenwriter was there somewhere, writing this script, and it's time to edit it because he has a KKK meeting to meet with his friends from Westboro Church and his hood. <br /> <br /> They warns is able to? I can not support this religious inertia. <br /> <br /> There are rating systems as video games, movies have some sort of icons: there may be a small cross in the lower corner to show us that a movie turns out worse. <br /> If you do not share your mind with the sentiments of this story, your bible will open in your lap and you will change your neighbors and do not waste your time. It's some of the worst junk that has come in for a long time, and radical religious grains no longer require funding.
