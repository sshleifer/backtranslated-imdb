Sam Merovich should never touch the camera again. If he was to be arrested on the spot ... at least for the children. Any person who has rented anything in his trash must also be sued and replaced. This is my first work on his "work" innocently ... and it will be my last. <br /> <br /> When I return this shop to a garbage video store, I personally ask for it to be removed from the shelf. Homosexual activist supporter, I was angry and angry with other acting credits in IMDb) and a curious compilation used as a bore and a big kid (covering Jelly Bret Gabel, both covering and packaging) "Movie" will market as a rental. Trust me, there is no place anywhere; It's not just a movie in any sense of the word. Such hazardous, irresponsible waste, can only be harmful to promote and support the gay film (Hell, homosexuality rights!), As excited to be able to rent this cover, you will be disappointed.

He and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, keeps such sleazy crap) are terrible. Mraovich is deliberately pretending to be the complete number of talents (in all sectors), to disappoint him to catch any "loser" attention. He is mad.
