Director F.W. Mourinho quietly relaxed with filmmaking and he is well aware of covering the story of the life of native islanders in the South Seas. The documentary style works well for the first half of the film. Landscapes are beautiful and the island's daily life activities are interesting. However, two doomed lovers began to focus more on the narrative story. The storyline is simply never interesting, though well maintained by Murn. The Academy Award for Best Cinematography, however, may be the best scene. You really can not really credit the DP to shoot for a beautiful spot.
