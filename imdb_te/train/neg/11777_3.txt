Years ago I saw the Godfather and it made me a lasting impression, the first class of the film's atmosphere, acting memorable and storyline is a classic. Recently I looked eagerly looking at Part 2 again after looking at the trio and seeing Part 1 ...... I was proud to spot the beginning of Part 2 again that I follow a fitting of the great Godfather film, and again everything is just perfect and I can not wait to see The Godfather III ........ wrong, I wish I stopped at II. The storyline is not good, it seemed to me as a story of a story, the characters, especially the daughter, are weak. Pacino's protease is a weak character who is alive in the godfather 1 or 2. The first relative bits of the pistol, the daughter and a board across the helicopter machine gunning ('away the goodies' and the killing of all), the bolds, the tougher shooting steps of the killer, killing the murderer on the sunset, invisible and meeting with the full plaque of the Catholic Church. ... for orange juice for diabetics (his intelligence and the sin of a man to sin Not ready for surgery?) ... It is not good, and I will never see again. But I see several times in 1 & 2 years.
