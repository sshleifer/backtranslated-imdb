"Abbad" is not a simple action movie. It's pretty bad. One person walks the other side with machine gun blazing. Another man dropped a round and dropped the man with a very fire force without a nick far from the hail of rain down the main. Guess who's a good guy. Duh. Through and through such "ambud". If they know that they are doing well, it is not good to take good actions, not a good film, not a good image, it fails at all levels, B-film veterans are moving through mechanical movements. <br /> <br /> <br />
