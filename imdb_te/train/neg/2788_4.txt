<br /> <br /> Purple Rain, a clear "quinn-needed" musician has written a lot about Bio Movie, but I'm here to tell you that this is not a great appreciation for the film. One thing is that the Prince is a great musician and music is in the area where Purple Rain excels. <br /> <br /> The score is mesmerizing and if it is completely portrayed as a concert film, unfortunately it is not a great experience and such a film has some problems. <br /> <br /> The first is horror acting / writing, Prince's character "The Kid" is needed to come up with some kind of mysterious loneliness of some words, unfortunately it just comes out as murky and dusty. A good lone character is at least slightly gimmick, unfortunately the role of Prince is rarely on some of the dialogues in the movie and he believes he will get this girl. <br /> <br /> It is rare, because it is very unclear because it is a terrible controversy and a very complicated live-life character, but we are not allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lives of Prince and Morris have a rear seat for the seemingly acting events, which makes sense from a business perspective that I do not expect, but it has a 2-hour film where the character's return on the stage is half the stage, especially the character's return stories. It's compilation: it's not a good movie.
