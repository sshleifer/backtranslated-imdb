Recently, the movie has seen and has high hopes. The earlier cinematography did not rely on the director who did not release, but based on its cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (Body Double, the main character in Brian D. Palma) are all featured in great films. <br /> <br /> This film is unbelievable, very predictable and cliche. This is the only thing that can be appealing, the selection of scenery locations. In my humble opinion: Do not waste your time.
