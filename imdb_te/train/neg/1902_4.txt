<br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe in which there has been a dark, experimental, controversial independent film in 60 seconds. Unfortunately this is a sleek, vacant, testosterone-fueled Maranfest featuring Ganci ... Nicolas Cage. <br /> If he is not really worth to go, he and his large numbers are four days to steal canies, only one of them is fifty expensive cars. The band consists of a funny-shaped person who is rumored to be a new Superman; X-Files Managed by Power; There are a former professional footballer and two token black men. <br /> <br /> Bilborough from their enemies Cops, rival car thieves and crackers, his Manchester voice is now flattening and expanding for the flat American audience. From Daphne on Frasier Angelina Jolie, who has no role; Avoid being a possession of men's sexual desires. <br /> <br /> She and Cage have the longest 135m running times in the film, but do not have any basic old conversations with basic basics. <br /> In fact, someone is a "moment" "violin" plays in the background of a violin "emotion". It is no spoiler to reveal only Vinny Jones (his famous Paul Gasagine reminiscent of the "hand ball" maneuver and is too menacing when silent) reveals; His inability to talk is perfect for plots, but because of his dumbness of the dubious morality of the film after the dumb discovery is funny. Charges. After he fought in his "correctly-acting-non-acting" London drill, Cage Quips wrote, "I've always thought of you from Long Island." <br /> In fact, the funniest comedy from the police to the two token black characters is quite a joke, humor. It holds Hollywood's biggest content; Why does a black man not appear in a major film without his skin tone ever known and see it forever? At a young age, a large-scale jiv-discussing young man declares: "We do not like the cold people of black people ... we are tropical people." Then he expresses a joint and watch roots smoke. He mocks the black image, but what kind of funny? His old replica did not speak of himself, so his color, the third person. "My black donkey" this is, "my black donkey". Does anyone actually know black people like this? <br /> <br /> Film soundtrack is almost uninterrupted and volume hikes, some tracks - "Do not Stop the Rock" in particular Apollo 440 - much more loud than they sound heard and dialogue. The surrounding system will also drive two different films together. There is no musical concept of background here, which is the equivalent of an attempt to see one of those behind the cinema, with their stereo full blast. <br /> <br /> It is not the worst movie in the world, and I have enjoyed many ways. It is imaginable, lazy and intelligent, with little effort in its construction. Box office expectations have dropped significantly in the film. For many years forced to begin to wake up the general public after the federal waste.
