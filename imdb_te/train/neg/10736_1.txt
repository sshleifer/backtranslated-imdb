The film is very interesting, three people are drinking and a small talk in a bar. Both of them are doing a bit horrible stories. As the film unfolds, the most terrible story becomes true. Nevertheless, it is not interesting to see in the movie the scene in the bar and the main secrets revealed. This revelation is only about half of the film and does not appear clearly. The rest of the time the director denied a Russian village filled with pious and creepy women. Sure, these are lovely and a bit shocking pictures, but admiring them goes too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. Another feature of the film was the lousy or lazy movie making, I tried to create an interesting story, instead the filmmakers looked at the strangely attractive pictures and left the spectator to identify all the imbalances and ends in some of the most unrelated stories (the story of the meat merchant). On the surface it has a form of arts, but this particular case is not more than the lack of talent.
