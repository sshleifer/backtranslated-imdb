I guess this film is not nearly a bit. These are some seconds of brightness in some idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy hallucination-fest. Most of the acting was mediocre, but it was filled with pregnancy disruptions in the 1970s-style matters. A photographer and a sample forests are some strange going-on witnesses and soon this same goings-on victim will come. Flying saucers spotted, more people disappear - but aliens or cover-up guys are our own government's ultra-secret group? Soon, the reporter and "UFOlogist" (clearly based on the role of the writer-director) draw into this unraveling flop and they target ultra-secret agents like menacing as improbable and witless. Then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The film is supposed to be anticipated as an average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be appreciated to take it seriously. Camera work for a low budget movie is okay, pacing is pretty cool, the script is crazy and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are pleasant to look for. What are the seconds of the brightness I mentioned? Honestly, I can not say much about writing a spoiler. The ending of the film is enough to say that the fast-forwarding value is not enough in the middle of you.
