The final Tarzan film ("Tarzan and the Huntress", which was surprisingly aged for a year), starring Johnny Weissmuller, is bad, but thanks to all the thanks. The country's best actor (Andrea Palma) and the multi-award cinematographer Gabriel Figueuro, shooting with a beautiful scene in Mexico, RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller, and the prestigious composer Dimitry Timonkin score. Although it is less costly for filming abroad, the series appears to be more expensive than any other RKO film, taking advantage of the real pyramids as Acapulco Beaches and Aquarium and impressive decorations for all the scenes of the Baloo Temple. Especially the outer part, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Newman should be the director's director, instead of Robert Florey it is very slow. Newman did good work with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Women" and "Tarzan and the Huntress", and directed his classic "The Fly" for the year before his death; Florey became a great television director, after some great films career. Weissmuller is tired of biting and unrealistic tastes, the worst character Benisja, the rude character (rarely a Caribbean air, African and a vicious posture that sings horrific songs in Mexico!), It's a sad farewell to Weissmullers Tarzan .
