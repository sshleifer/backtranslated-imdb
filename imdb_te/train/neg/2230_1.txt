If you want to see a retarded homophobic karate expert hit the little bit to try repeatedly hard wannabe Mexican gangsters for a hr, then this is the image for you. Then if you do not choose another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only space belonging to this movie. Acting was terrible, and I had to force it to see it eventually. The cover is very cool but it's just another cheap, b grade gangster film and key along with lines of 2 grade, bloody streetz and evil. If you've stoned and plotted, this film should not be taken or rented unless you really care about editing and acting. This is really the worst film in the history of mankind !!!
