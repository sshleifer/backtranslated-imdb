In my time I saw very horror horror movies and it was not the worst of the bunch, it was definitely in the low half. The script will start okay. A young physician becomes an intern in the hospital, hoping it will hunt him and his future wife for a better job. Beautiful huh? The movie will go straight to the toilet after learning that the film is killing some patients. It seems that there is a monster in the basement that causes people's spirits. This is the job of 1 security guard, 1 nurse and 1 central guard, to pull this mental patient downstairs, just to cut the tongue, and then allow the ghost's haunted house to prop up special effects of magic and steal his soul. At this time the movie is very ridiculously stupid, and I was fitted for it. There is an hour to go. It seemed to be "stories from Christ" about half an hour that some hour and a half spread into the worst-fest. Playing Nurse Ratchet, who spent the past with his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) band of short lists for his best John Coffey (Tracy Skaggins), the film fails at every possible level. I gave these two stars for only two reasons. 1) His fianc√©e is pretty hot, slightly painful at the end and 2) the film is actually better than the current trend of horror films made with Walt-mart quality home cameras. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, "As a bonus drink game, you and your friends every time you talk to Matt Stacy (Dr. James Bishop), you will be drunk for 15 minutes in the movie.
