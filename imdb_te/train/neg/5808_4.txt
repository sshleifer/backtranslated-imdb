When Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a hypocritical, hot-tempered, high-powered Hollywood twin, they portrayed the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali mogra's Action-Thriller Scene-Rebuild Remake. This is the first time that McQueen has had such an important presence on the screen - quietly and tired, quietly, his clock is confusing, his cage magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his attractions and is a versatile actor - if not, it is not a performance for his features. Bashinger is doing well and is definitely cool, but James Woods is artificially guaranteed in the role of Moff-Magnet. Baldwin's former partner is unbearable in a sub-plot '72 film involving another couple hostage and plays badly here. For action sequences, they're pretty old hat, which causes a surprise: why the original remake? ** from **
