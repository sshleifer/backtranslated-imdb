I'm not talking about the other review. This is not exactly a bimbo image, in fact, I do not think I was watching a good girl out there. No, it's cheesy, poor work, ed Wood-style science fiction sculk. And it's bad. I can not even say how bad I am. When I look at the midnight cable, I'm in shock. The fact that the film has always been released is insulting us all. Actors are the creators of the producer or mentally retarded, special effects a joke, and the pace is very small. However, I have topped all of the music. A monkey can write a theme with a toy geolophone. Do not rent this item, but if you ever see it on the cable, see it. You will be surprised at how bad the movie is.
