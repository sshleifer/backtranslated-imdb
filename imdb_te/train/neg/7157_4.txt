1st watched 5/26/2002 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Wired story about a druid witch who seeks to capture the eternity of the heritage of her grandchildren. At least I think that is the relationship. Unlike Stephen King's The Shining, this film takes a strange quality throughout. The difference is that the film is not all in Nicholson's performance. It's taken very seriously until all the ends when some lame ones do not work at all with a liners and attempts to hear up the mood. The shows are not a problem here, but the story. Everything is very smoothly come together and the viewer does not have much information about the pieces of information and what happened in the film. The Moon's uncle is a very low-tracked performance by Christopher Walken, which gives him the best billing in an attempt to sell the film. <br /> <br /> Do not buy into this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
