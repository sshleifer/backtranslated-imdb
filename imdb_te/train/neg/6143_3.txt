This is actually a very strange film ... First, we have a former US gymnast who is trying to turn the actor (or something), and this is the only character he ever had (I know anyway) - and good reason. Although he has taken enough role to retain some interest, it is a very sad and flat performance. Second, the sound effects that we have always used in the film! I'm not kidding. This film alone makes it very funny, but that's annoying. hehe and third, we usually have a good acting support cast (including the necessary hot chick!), a really not-so-bad bad story, and some cool visuals; Dialogue, gymnastics fight scenarios (happy!), And the amount of plots are weak. The film was rarely a network TV movie (not too bad fox around 1985). It's just one of those movies that is just bad, yet you have found it to be the perfect permanent home for the TV and cable accustomed to the night, now you can get used to it and stop watching it once.
