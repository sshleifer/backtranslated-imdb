<br /> <br /> A strict Harvard Dude is a tough radicliff for his hardhearted father (Ray Milland). <br /> Syrup, Sugar and many 'class' Rich-Kid Ryan O'Neil brings to the library's home to be ridiculous to his snobbies. Ali MacGra is a socially degenerate social slump, where John Marley plays the role of his devout-Catholic father, but no one is worse in the film than his whimpering role as O'Neill as Harvard's Champion UP. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8 years (!) by 'Oliver's Story'.
