It is important to understand what the "Noise" can do. Tim Robbins plays the role of an involuntary New Yorker who can not deal with the city's unsatisfactory sounds, particularly car alarms. It's an odd idea for a movie that has a very creative credibility, "Death Wish." It is brilliant at points; Especially a scene trying to read through our hero Hagel, "I'm very stupid to understand this." He reads a paragraph in the chaos and reads again, we read it and can not get it. Only a car alarm will go. This film is a continuous intervention of total alarms and location sounds. However, all of these are very small to help in understanding our heroes, allowing them to destroy his marriage and dig deeper into his personality rather than distracted by the plot. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking does not care much about the problems of its own sound, shady editing and visible boom mikes. No, "Noise" is not all bad. William Hart is at least colorful. At least not on the end floor. Overall, this is a transportation point of the house, you probably never thought. At least I'm not. In all, ninety minutes, it did not end soon. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies you can watch at the film festival, probably not for distribution. If you're really partial to those involved in the project, check it on DVD. Otherwise skip.
