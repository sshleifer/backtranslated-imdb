When I saw the film in Fearnet, I thought it was a horror movie. Clearly, it's not. I do not have any clue about how this film was shown in the film. Site Fayer Net that shows horrific horror movies <br /> Acting is excellent from all actors. I hate the story. The story is stupid. The movie stamped it with a stamped stamp that starts the man with a scroll. He breaks the seal and some accidents occur. Water goes to the blood, the oceans die, the moon turns red. <br /> <br /> The role of women is also hurtful. Many things she did not make sense. She's looking at a date with a piece of paper on a date. Incidentally, the date she wants to give birth to her baby and she begins to focus on it, and begins to research and seek out the religious people. <br /> * Spoiler warning * Two worst things in the film run mentally retarded, killing his parents and telling him to transfer his soul after God gave birth to his baby that Demi Moore died and died. <br /> <br /> What happens here. The mentally retarded person is shot dead and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore comes to a hospital in the middle of a huge earthquake and gives birth to her baby. She touches her baby's head and transfers her soul to the child. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly change his heart? When the throat woman allows her child to transfer her soul, she becomes angry when the governor allows her to be mentally ill. <br /> * End spoiler * <br /> The film is pretty stupid. This is another religious conclusion in world propaganda. Demi Moore and Michael Bean and acting from everybody is amazing. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 out of 10 stars. Nonsense too acting!
