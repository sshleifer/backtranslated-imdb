<br /> <br /> The film is a less cultural story about the boy's life in Kibbatz, but the deliberate demonization of Kibbatz's life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the male man who is the governor of the cows raises one of his calves. And this is all downhill in terms of the letters that refer to the usual "kibbutznikim". In addition to the two main characters, the medically depressed woman and her youngest son, everything in Kibbatz is quite disorganized. <br /> <br /> The story is about how a knife, like any kind of worship, slowly fills the mother and son with frustration. There is no joy, joy, no laughter in this kibbut. Each character / situation refers to a dreadful human vice, such as hallucination, deception, violence, culture, repression, etc. For example, a 12-year-old boy when critics look beautiful European His elder brother is a typical Kibbat youth with his "Jewish" physical appearance and ruthless personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than his dying mother's health. He sees these volunteers as truss. His younger brother asks him to visit his dying mother who has not seen for a long time due to his military service. "Linda, take the shower and come in two minutes." <br /> <br /> Is there another "good" character in the film? A European alien who plays the role of mother boyfriend. When the animal's son attempts to hit the mother's son, the relative will leave him on the shoulder of the rapist. He was arrested for "violent behavior" against one of the Kibbutz members. More impersonation: The indescribably annoying French lady who plays the school teacher gives the account of the true act that sex does not happen before the age of 18, or without love and feel funny for the audience but is really just stupid. Of course the little kid is screwing the kibbutz head in the fields who screw the mother rolls when her turn is a turn for worse for her mental health. <br /> <br /> Motion picture is portrayed as kibbons. Children take their beds out in the middle of the night and carry some rituals, where they obeys Kibbatz elders under the supervision of the elders. Mother is clearly not kibbutz "escape", of course, someone / they are always selected and are free to go. This is the boy's father's death, but you can rest assured, Kibbatz "led him" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartfelt and wretched characters weighing on the mother and her son. <br /> <br /> The essence of this image. Looking at a dimensional characters, dramatic, powdery displays and an artificial message trying to touch him on the head of the audience? kibbutz life is degraded, "unsuitable in" for those who are painful and even deadly. I forgive the person who made this film? Apparently he had a bad experience growing in a kibbutz. But he took up some kernels for the kibbut's life and I think he has transformed them into huge molecular twisted bombs.
