My sweetheart and I wondered how bad this film was. After 15 minutes we have left the film and it is definitely interesting to see that the film can be taken. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise given this film. <br /> <br /> The worst performance that I have seen in this writing is very clear. </ P> <p> <br /> One thing that I am especially angry about the film is the unnatural interval between the lines. I understand the puzz to create such an embarrassing feeling (in Happiness). It's not that kind of break - it's just bad direction. <br /> <br /> The film may indeed be better with subtitles and possibly the overseas market is the best of the film because such surprising dialogue and bad acting are not observed. This kind of small quirky movies (Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but it has failed at most levels, and I thought it was one of the worst films I have ever been in the past few years.
