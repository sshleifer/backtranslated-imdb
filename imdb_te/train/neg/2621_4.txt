I do not bring a child under 8 to see this. Some of the phenomena events have a lot of suspense for the entirely small child out there, dangling off listening to squirming and scary laughing of the scary laughs by buildings where the buildings are dead. <br /> <br /> The live action gives more ominous feel than the brilliance of the brilliance and there are moments that can have very few worries including a sex transcendent, long time moments that might be anxious and scare small children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Disney folks are thinking but neither the story nor the acting are their normal level. Puppies are beautiful but this film is spotty at best.
