Kubrick meets the king. It's pretty good in the spring of 1980, I'm reminded. <br /> <br /> The film came out, and Kubrick's cultures are confused with King Kongtists. <br /> <br /> King Culture took the Stanley Kubrick great horror story and destroyed it. Kubrick's cultures do not refuse the story of Kings. They talk about steremyms, tracking shots and camera angles. This is an image, they insist on it. When this happened, the two camps are correct. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If you see it entirely in accordance with the King's novel, "The Shining" is actually a series of stories of a failure, wasting, and sorrow. <br /> <br /> I'll sue Kubrick's hero. Writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, El 'Affair, Le Divorce, etc.) is the novelist of social affection. Maybe her mutual relationships or family dynamics were chosen for her subtle grip. But there is little blue-collar sydewander, Colorado in any of the Francofilth universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Anglophile is perhaps the most suitable for her. He is, of course, a real movie. Unusual psychology, rationalism, supernaturality, and speculative reincarnation - will not stand for its logical analysis - considering its own merits for "The Shining". I would like to examine Kubrick's "shining" in his own terms. I'm also ready to take it other than traditional horror-style film. But it did not succeed as a naturalist study of solitude, naturalism and madness. <br /> <br /> Is not the horror truth of overclock hotel? Or are they in mind - was Danny Torrence's principled nightmares, his father's hallucinations? Whenever there is a point where Jack Torrance is talking about a "ghost", he is looking into a mirror. The hotel's frozen hat-hedge maze is a reference to Jack's stunted, muddled mood. Very deep stuff. <br /> <br /> In fact, if the "ghosts" of over look are fully manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing insanity, then Jack is trapped in a hotel's dead-bolt walk-in closet room <br /> <br /> Nicholson's tuxedod The party describes a black-and-white photograph (labeled "1921") with a face. Going out of the left and going to the hotel-ballroom wall in the end of the film? Are we sure that Jack Torrance 's bad craziness is confusing from a sort of "past life" experience? <br /> <br /> "Perhaps the film seeks to provoke the horror of the horror, however, the movie tries to hedge its fictional bets - in both ways, The story is a mess, and the film is not improving with age and it certainly does not improve with a recurring focus. <br /> <br /> Fear, claustrophobia m Yu's simple movements are scattered throughout this period, long film, but Elevators Blood Blood, Danny's Dreams, are absurd and ridiculous, and Jack Torrance's infamous tag lines ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "JOHNNY of Heiears !)) Only the dramatic tension of the fake film and the power of its story spills. (I know: I Finally, Kubrick is completely in the ocean - or absolutely cynical - when her husband attempts to peel his son, the scenes that are wandering around the blank hotel to silver, . Is the mummified guests sat in their party hats, who are dead? <br /> <br /> When Jack Nicholson's brilliance has been over the years, he just wanted to see eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scene-scratched performance. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duval's performance ended with silence as a type of female version of Don Knots in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken". <br /> <br /> This film is not successful - it is not in its own words, as a follow up. It probably would have a qualification of 10 to 3, but I was given 1 on this forum because it was highly rated GROTESQUELY.
