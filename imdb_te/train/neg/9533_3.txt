A text prolog warns us not to allow evil to enter our home, but I have a more appropriate term "entropy." <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassel) is alone in his San Francisco office and his most expensive house in Tiburon while his wife and baby is in San Diego. Two girls (Sonora Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) repelled the door on her door. Well, it's raining, and they're shivering like the two stained pitiful cats, and are not sure what the address they're looking for, and with one thing and another, George invites them to come and pizza through fire. Three of them are closed in the gorgeous bathtub and have approximately five different nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and detukkepul exposure. They spend the night in one night and the breakfast the next morning to settle him. George's guests gabbily put everything on their fingers and pour cuttup and syrups on all linen - because "you're like animals!" George is surprised and falls outside to get them. In his dreams. <br /> Now I'm not wrong. Sondra Locke is an unusual looking young elegant with bounces around like a superball with cobalt blue eyes and colin camp. You can not help after the first five or ten minutes but they are notoriously unlikely, from Losy from Locke, from a deserted monster in Shelbyville, Tennessee. But when the girls are gruesome, so does the movie. The film is then bathed in a garage green light. The couple put on horror makeup and creates face-to-face with amazing faces. They are a delivery boy brain and then dip him to confirm. They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture. Two people sit together and smile at the food, and then one of those scenes when one of the bones is tossed. <br /> And George? They are the first to have a garage (in your kitchen cabinet there is nothing missing in the small red bottle of McClhina's sauce), knead him, pour the dough and milk and put him in a Tolstoy-type semi-execution, clap around him, Dress in luxurious costumes, then destroy him and his realistically Esina upper-middle-class home, take out, delivery van sent by Ex Machina. <br /> <br /> As the actor tells someone of the jurisdiction, "If you treat these girls as a courtesy, then be afraid when you are committed." And the girls: "The first acting shy, if someone does not like to impose on, then the crazy work." That's it. <br /> <br /> Photography and location worked directly outside the 1970s porn movie. I'm not sure I would suggest a lack of expertise. It takes effort and talent to move the San Francisco ugly. The score gives us two leitmots. George has some pop tune with songs about "free" and "giving". Jackson and Donas are an impressive rinky-tink thing called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> I have accepted the moral lesson behind the story. Even though you may be like fun at first, there are some things you just do not give. All are very educated.
