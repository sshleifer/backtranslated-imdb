I was caught in an arthouse film club this Cuban film. It was shown after the Ajay 1935 Silly Symphony Cartoon compromised with Symphonine Isle Jazz Isel. The scene was synchronized with a referendum to the filmmaking engaged at Helms Burton's idioms, as the recent death of Reuben Gonzalez hangs the Cuban flag from hanging out of this old movie-ballroom and stuck rocky motifs. But the film started. The film's peel color is gradually becoming more interesting than the grotesque mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nada mass storyline is very promising. The boring armor-stamper at a Cuban post office of cars. Bronte's exhaustive emotion was the only one who had been thoroughly exchanged, transcribing the primary manuscripts, closing the letters, rewriting them, and enthralling them. <br /> <br /> Marx Brothers Slapstick and - especially during the overwhelming editing trick - Defending a school on the face of a character Celluloid scratching. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of unilateral characters. Kunda, the boss at the post office, is a humorless dominatrix-nosferatu. Her boss-eyed partner, Kancha, different points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. Sealer, Metalhead Dalt and Romantic Interest, reveals the hidden masterpiece, Carla leaves Miami. A chase scene (in the OH-so happy fast forward) is thrown out for good measure. <br /> <br /> All these were made in Morta and Faymon comic strip, but with black-and-white-zero-fx fly hybrid preferences, with Ahem. <br /> <br /> Nada Mass 'Amirie's Quirky-Heroine-Match Max-Strangers' and Posino's 'poetry-like great-redeemer' theme. Like Amale, its heroine is an unusual white woman who struggles with an upcoming spinstrom trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not flinch from continuous recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mass has failed to capture the image's smoothness and smoothness. <br /> <br /> There are two things to watch tonight at the TV Stupor tonight. The first is Carrar's initial overhead shot, which is on the checkered-tiled floor, cut to the crossword puzzle she works. The second is to be seen as a warning example of Nada mass: our post-bouena Vista social club invasion with Cuban art production often tends to concede any embarrassment that has Bongo in the soundtrack. The film does not need a global release - such as Waiting List and Guantanamera will successfully cover such background lands.
