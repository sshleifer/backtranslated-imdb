From director Barbet Schroeder (Fortune's retreat), I saw a part of my Media Studies class and I recognized the famous actress, so despite the critically rating I tried. Basically the cold kid Rich Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) see a random girl killing them to challenge them and find the police to avoid them. Investigating the murder is the comic Detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Maverwer (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), the scenes appear in the scenes are beautiful, e.g. But related hair. Cassie and Sam are very quick to believe that Richard or Justin is suspicious of this project, but it is just a question if they can keep them away. Lis Mills, Agnes Brukner, Chris Penn Rey Feathers, R.D. Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verika as Astast. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see the same feeling of murdering Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope with a rope, but this film makes it very silly, and a reasonable good bullock can not be slow and predictable. Not enough!
