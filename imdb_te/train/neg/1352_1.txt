Iten Fox has made many interesting films, such as "What On Water" and "Fantasy Picture", "Yosi & Jagger", as they look towards the Apologist in Israel politics. <br /> <br /> In the "The Bubble" he took this unproductive and unjust approach seriously. <br /> <br /> This film was not silent and I was silent. I manifest the anger of justifying racism, and racist bullying (and terrorism) such as ridiculous one-sided cinema to translate self-preservation as racist bullying, leaving silently; This suggests that the Arabs are suffering from ill-Israeli illnesses because they respond with a steady stream of one-sided Israeli upheavals against them and they are not responsible for their actions. This film is not worth the money I paid for a ticket (in fact, I thought I would re-demand my money), and basically an Israeli of the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, you really need to see the film as it really supports such a belief system. An Israeli director and yet worst, such a talented Israeli director is a crying shy. <br /> <br /> When the Israelites believe in such anti-Israeli propaganda and beggars, they are surprised that Israel will be treated as one side by side.
