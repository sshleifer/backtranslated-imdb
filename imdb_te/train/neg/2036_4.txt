The film is a young man, Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decides to kill his clients' relatives. At the same time he decides the model for his murder after the Zodiac killer of 60. He is closely associated with the author of a book about the Zodiac killer and they create a friendship. Michael has a pistol (apparently a single gun, which seems to be in the hands of other actors, not just shot as a pistol) and he comes out of a killing. Original. <br /> If you like B movies, this is a great movie. I thought the idea was good, but editing and acting really drowned in the plot. I thought the 'blood' was very fake, lighting was terrible in some places, and the dialogue was very standard. The film is shot in the video, but it's OK, but some of the 'Plan 9' scenes shot in the picture's editing. B-movie artists are not a bad image, but if you want something with a little more polish, go to something else.
