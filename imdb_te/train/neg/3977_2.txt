The same twin sisters Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, "A Kind Two", have become famous and have never seen anything before, but I got an idea of ​​what to do, but it's so much worse. Mainly Hunter sisters Charlie (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship program, but soon they face immediate difficulties when they start their jobs. But Derek Hammond (Julian Stone) is the owner of the company who returns their jobs and they slowly prove themselves to be useful assets and talented (fashion) artists and a man company. As well as Pollo and Enrico Tortoni Matt Patresi as Jamie Leslie Danon, Ryan Derek Lee Nixon, Dari as Ilenia Lazzarin, Nobu Archie Cayo, Heidi Valentina Mattolini, Michelangelo Tommaso. You can tell that this image went straight to the video, the camera-work is not fully matched and does not help you when you want to worship Rome's scenes. In fact the background is only a good thing to watch, both of the most annoying celebrities around twin sisters, I know beforehand looking at whether they're not interested in me (not their beautiful too), the worst gash of this worst movie. Pretty poor!
