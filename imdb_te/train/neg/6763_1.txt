God is a terrible thing! Oliver Stone is probably the experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and images here) but really wanted for what? The whole thing behind "natural-born killers" seems to be a "wise" look that makes Medias a thoroughly worse, but unfortunately the film becomes worse. Please, Mr. Stone, use violence to get higher rates the next time you want to criticize the fascism of the TV and do not do it in your movie! Much more intelligently about the film, Michael Hanek condemns fascism with fascist cinematographic methods. How true ... only you forgot to tell us about the huge headache to get after the sitting of the overload is loaded by this overload!
