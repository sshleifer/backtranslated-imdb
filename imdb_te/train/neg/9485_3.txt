Since others have gone through the problems of shortening the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. Spoilers are here; <br /> <br /> - Because of the low budget of the film, the creature is very good at designing. It's really good to see a live-to-video horror movie that is not slathered with awful CGI. Unfortunately, the digital film is very noticeable in most areas of wheat, and well-lit white rooms of shelter. <br /> <br /> - This is the feature of the film's Rydiculus lighting design Plugs, time passes. I understand that the director is trying to imitate dementia, but in this order it is essential to establish an effective time stream. <br /> - Plot turns are many but consistently predictable. <br /> <br /> "Quibling, but the characters in this film do not reliably fail to implement any general conception." First of all, all of the control commissions are a patient and employee Deaths are unilaterally a mental health center that is induced by cardiac arrest.Why is head psychiatrist capable of carrying out autopsy? Why this is not the point of impressive qualifications , Or the introduction of the experiment of his basic religion? What is the theme? We want to care about this? Also, in their proper mindset, we see that it is the best place to continue living a resident position. <br /> Let's play the role of the film to the mysterious purposes <br /> <br /> Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
