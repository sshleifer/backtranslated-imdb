'Can I do it until I need glasses? At least one picture proves the point of doing anyone. Talent is not observation. This vicious pile does not have talent, taste or intelligence for everyone who has hit the womb of the world. The target audience is recently loditized, and contains infants who play with their own feces. There is a lot of world knowledge to get a snicker from this film. It includes a series of sophmoric skits in which punchline does not even extend clear. It ends at the funniest. Primary school children say that the types of havoc (usually intelligent or sexually related) do not know the meaning of all the words they use here. Do you know about Daddy's car and mommy's garage? Acting, writing, directing, and even such creative "minds" never heard. Behind this mess. It should not be indiscriminate, but those who enjoy the film should reflect their intentions on this earth. <br /> <br />
