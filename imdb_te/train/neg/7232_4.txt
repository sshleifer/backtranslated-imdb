I was surprised when I saw the trailer for the film, and I learned that it was directed by Bilal. But the film is a major disappointment. Visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty architecture of the original masterpieces, and the story is poorly understood. <br /> <br /> Bilal has opted to focus on the more intricate aspects of the graphic novel, and he can not do much good. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel is the friendship-hate relationship between Nicopol and Horus. They were both in their right time and place, and they forcefully forced the situation, but they were funny and loved. Not here. Nicopol has no significant personality, and Horus is a white whitewash that he simply wants to wear. Although the film is French, Horus is not there! <br /> <br /> We all enjoyed watching movies, but not for everyone, for some reason, is not recommended for everyone. I do not recommend anyone immortal, except as a warning not to exceed your talents and resources. Bilal Master Storyteller, but clearly lacks a major role in every visual media.
