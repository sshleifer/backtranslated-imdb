I try sometimes ... Try and try and volunteer toward all B thru Z Grade movies out there, but once a certain image tests your patience until you want to kill one involved. "Bat People" (I've seen under the title "It's Lives By Night") is just a picture. You can not really see it as being an episode in "Night Gallery" and not thinking that one is good. <br /> <br /> Film has something to do with a doctor who is dissociated by a bat and consequently begins to be altered into a verb-bite that is human blood drinking. Although he is a real batsman, he likes eating mosquitoes through a gas bucket, but this cheap, sensational horror movie, the blood of the word.) Although he has a hat for almost every night, and a grand-mall in the block-out episodes, his friend And fellow physician, Dr. Mastache Aspen-Extreme, he is simply a 'allergic reaction to rabies shots Insisting that I have. Meanwhile, the worst and stereotypical county sheriff in the world suspects the doc of ruthless murder and exsanguanguination responsibility of many local girls (and a wedge). At the same time, the doctor's wife denies a river in Egypt and alternatively protects him and makes him distinctly naked. <br /> <br /> Acting is not good - actors are doing professional level choices, and sheriff is trying to bring some juice and life to the script. (Well, it's very bad, but it's bad in a clich√©, timber, professional way). Everything about acting, scenes, costumes, dialogs, script and storytelling, sets your teeth and wants to slap you all. <br /> <br /> 1) Director Michael Pattaki, an experienced actor, needs to be defeated with a chair. He agreed to ACT, and not only accepted the Dennis Weaver Channel. <br /> <br />) He also discovered the script that discovered a whole part of the "Bat Bites Human, Who Our Too Bat" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) He played the role of a doctor who finds a bit physically unreliable bit on stage for his 'episodes' instead of Little Mannames Golden Book from Little from "Little Has a Caseur" <br /> <br /> 4) To correct his whole wife, she needs to be more intelligent, less dark and waaaaay more noticeable. <br /> <br /> With the help of Mike and Bates I can not see this picture volunteer again. It's bad, but it's not crazy, humorous or interesting. Even better than "Battleground" or "Waterworld".
