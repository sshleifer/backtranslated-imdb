I agreed to speed up this poorly transmitted DVD after 30 minutes - nothing happened and everyone was already described as "plot". But anyone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher knife is stabbed by a wig and it is scarce on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing it's bratty kid, it's never explained. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film that is pretty daft and not a badly written or thoughtful film than what we have left if not a "wise" film. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a cleaned version, if there is any missing footage, I would like to see if it would like help. Otherwise, if it's by fast forward it's a strange little picture correctly!
