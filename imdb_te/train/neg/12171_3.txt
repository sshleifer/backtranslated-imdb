As a slasher movie fan, I will usually settle in to see every slash picture that goes over my retinas, which makes my brain more harm than good, I will say. While the channel was surfing the other night, Sleepaway Camp II had to cross the paths with me. However, I heard about Sleepway Camp franchises, but I did not see any of them (for shame, I know). <br /> <br /> Since I can not see the reality, I can note that my criticism is not very serious, perhaps because I think it's wrong because the franchise's own design is totally intended. The Sleepaway Camp's franchise may be a joke. Hell, even the name comes off a wants joke. Are you sleeping from the camp? It's fine. I would like to congratulate the film that wants to have something for the pure camp horror value. Acting in the film is the 13th look of Macbeth's composition with the original Friday's cast. Campie needs bad acting, but will come. Pamela Springsteen has acted as a reality killer from the outside, and has done a good job of killing my interest in the whole cast. <br /> <br /> As ridiculous, there are a few times I was thirsty, but it is very small. <br /> Finally, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really want to sleep in the camp. Deaths are clearly displayed and are duplicate, you can not just congratulate them. If you are looking for a slazer movie comedy with good camp, I recommend club dread. Take your surprise to your channel surfing, check and see what's going on.
