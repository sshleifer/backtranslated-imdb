There is only one problem with this website, you can not give negative ratings. In addition, this friend rated it as a DATE grade movie. I think he is very good. The actors and the car used to build the film carved the concept of being used to launch a fire. This is terrible, 2 hours of life will never return anyone suffering from this untalented bloodbath. After watching for 5 minutes, is it big enough to be a huge amount of fun now? After half corto and a bottle 151 I eventually found some of the remotely funny acting on this G grade. The director is insulting on this entire planet, so that anyone can get more benefits from this, he must go and buy a rope. And the actors in this film, I hope you got paid well to be in this joke because you suspect it will work again. In summary, everyone in this movie is 100 grand and 12 dessert points from your acting license.
