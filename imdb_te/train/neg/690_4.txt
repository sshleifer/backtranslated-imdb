If you look at eighty bones, there are not many reasons to see this. Originally often not one of Slaser Cinema's strong points, and this film is something that is not seriously defective and really can say about most pranks, so I'll make this quick. The film is one of 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and my only reason to see it. The plot follows a bunch of kids who are behind a dorm of Christmas time. When they are in a slasher, someone decides to pick them off and this leads to one of the dullest secrets seen in a slasher picture. The film is strange in the video Nasty list because, despite some ghoulish scenes, the film is rarely corrupt or oppressed, and is banned for more than this (Greater 13th, Friday). But again, the prohibited films are much smaller than this (for example, the watch who came from the Sea, for example). However, the ending of the film is a great thing about it, even if the audience is unable to pay attention to this unfortunately; It is well done. Overall, this is a frustrating and tedious slasher that makes it even better for fans to miss well.
