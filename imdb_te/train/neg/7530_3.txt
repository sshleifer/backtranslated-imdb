I did not realist the real ring for the whole story, as the story ends with a boring, monotonous and very difficult, unbearable "upbeat". Following these roles in the weekend of horrific events, it's not my idea of ​​negative attitudes and bad news as a watchable, interesting film, and I would be very tired of its "a note" theme - and almost half of it actually stopped me. The whole movie was just meaningless and wandering, and although acting was good, the characters were mostly disappointed and disliked. A small picture with small ambitions and small appeal - sorry, but it's not for me, I love the good, the smallest films! It's not just a gel, I'm watching and believe it's believed. I was disappointed, especially two local reviewers on their "Top 10 Best of the Year" list. I'd rather recommend looking at "House of the House" - now has a good, small picture!
