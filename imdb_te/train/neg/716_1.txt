This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The storyline is not perfect, there's nothing else that makes this film worth retards and looking for gags only. In the whole movie fray (Oh my god what a funny name ha h) do not ask himself once he came from a plane to the middle ground. There are plenty of stupid and completely unfunny characters whose names must be funny sound. Eg: Gandalf is known as Algange, Sam Pupps is called ... and so on. I did not smile at the whole movie. IQ seems to have been made by those who are negative. When someone is caught in a coat door (which takes about 5 times) then you probably laugh at this picture. Another funny scenario: They try to imagine the code word for the closed door (do not ask why do not ask why in this movie) and the code word (heck): dung. So if you laughed these examples, you might like this movie. For everybody: go to Youtube and see "weed off the Lord": it is very fun.
