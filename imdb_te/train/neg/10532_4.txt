Madison is not too bad - if you do not know anything about unlimited hydroplane racing, normal, non-risky, "family-friendly" fare and, more importantly, if you like it. <br /> <br /> Like me, you grew up with the sport and your leaders have names like Musson, Munsie, Cantrell, Slovak. <br /> <br /> Professional film reviewers have a tendency to use the book's principle nature and the use of each hooked sports clich in the book. I do not repeat what I say. <br /> <br /> In the "Festive Years" I thought of the real zeal of the hilarious racing. <br /> <br /> Yes, the old classic boats have six times overwhelmed the course, although it is clear that restored versions (the caps for volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) are nursed at low speeds. But where is the sound? The thrill of the old Hydros is a mind-numbing roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin flight engines, until the RPM's designers never imagined, pressing the right line in front of you. If you do not hear it, you'll get it done. Real Hydro buffs know exactly what I am talking about. There's no one in Madison. Instead, each racing scene is buried with a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> Then there are close shots of the drivers, in the cockpits they are relaxed in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases, how to prevent a poor home town leader may take time to smile badly. Or, in a distinctly ridiculous movie, Jake Lloyd takes time to give a "rocky" salute from a bridge peer. <br /> In fact, some unlimited drivers wore flack to reduce the slammed boats in rock-hard water at speeds of up to 150 mph. <br /> <br /> Finally, after another user has brought acornis, I will add one: Seattle establishment displays Shot Kingdom and Safeco Field. None existed in 1971
