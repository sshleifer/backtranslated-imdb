Wow ... I can not really believe how bad Zombie DOOM (aka Violent SHT). I heard the rumors and read the reviews - but I have to make my mind for myself. Well, let me tell you - it blows it !!! My grandmother would be full of wasted frivolity and ridiculous gore FX, an intuitive plot, "cinematography" that appears to be made out of no joke - tin-foil <br / Three boys Weirdus a little bit plastic and tin-foil Ttulu get stranded on an island with a run around and goes on ... /> <br. The captives are freed along a rebellion of the island's freaks and they are given a day's start before hunting the "tribe" of the rest ... it's pretty much ... <br /> << I honestly - this is one of the WORST movies I've also had a bad luck to me. The budget had about $ 200 (and may not actually be a bad idea ...) Gore FX was fully spent. There is nothing other than the humorous bloodshed scenes watching DOOM with lots of terrible dubbing dialogue than the other. Other budget costs like Premus will make this film: Look like the Living Dead Lord Titanic. Some can rank ZD in some "very bad-it's good" segment - if you want to see alcohol or high and some friends with MST3K-style - I saw it. But not me. I hate pretty much about it. ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally scary and included as a "bonus" in ZD's shock-o'-rama release) is an indication of Andreas Schnas's other works - then he has to make a film again at the penalty of death. An amusing Kung Fu War in the half of the film, and a lot of blood - I'll grant this a very generous 3/10 - do yourself a favor and skip this.
