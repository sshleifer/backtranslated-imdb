I think this is a good film and some parts are right ... But overall it is B film. The same about the plot, the components are OK but there are many holes and oddities that do not add up too. Acting too much, I also saw it very bad. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the sand, the driver is never improvised, but it's not too much, because the driver is never "cold" but some of the small dunes (slow in motion! <br /> If you are hired, get another and use it as a warm-up. Keep the expectations low and it will work for you.
