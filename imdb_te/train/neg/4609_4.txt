This is a spectacular picture, a whole lotte non-sense and a lot loose-ending to count. I saw this movie because one of my favorite actors (Ron Livingston) played a guest role in it, and as a girl, I continued to see it because I loved any movie that I had a naked nude for change. Next, I think the storyline is more ridiculous, and every time it comes ... more ... is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sean Crawley has never seen Chris L. McKenna Duke Wayne (George Wendt from "Cheers") who looks good - but he does not like his little nude scene). Sean agrees to meet Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin, playing a bad man as a stereotypical) thinking he is getting more work from the Duke. Ray is investigating a City Hall Accountant (Ron Livingston in a guest role in love with "Sex & The City" from "Office Space"). The obviously disappointing-cash scene to kill Ray accountant is $ 13, and Sean accepts the job. His wife (Kari Wuherer) is attracting herself, hit the finish, and leaves - Sean whips to the client who takes the information of the information up to him to ray with him. Sean learns quickly, that Ray does not have to pay him, and Sean uses the file as a leverage to get his money. <br /> <br /> At this time, it's an archetypal picture ... usually worth looking at. But soon after the filmmaker Charlie Hegson snapped from a 10-day work hangover and desperately needed to figure out how to shut down a series of unsustainable messes he created before a deadline or something he was immediately kidnapped by Ray, Duke and their staff. Let's see if you're kidnapped in every single single, without a description of the film, you're looking "confused by the fame ** K !,". Towards the ransom. <br /> Finally, most loose-ends are left in the film, and you are also starting to worry about seeing it. <br /> <br /> It is the only image that can be seen on cable. Must have enough beer and friends to mock the full value of the image. It's a psychological thrill, and McKenna is a good actor, but it's harder to have a "shame" and "Baldwin's brother" when you're doing a dirty work. Guys loves the violence, blood and guts scenes, and completely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. The beautiful scene of the beautiful scene of the girls has been enjoyed by the grateful punch, which has almost always been removed in a movie. Personally, I am the only actor in the film to have more attention than his acting (Ron Livingston).
