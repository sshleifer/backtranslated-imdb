Movies like this know that you are going to get regular jokes related to ghosts. A ghost Eva is pretty funny. And other actors do a good job. It's direct and trivial. If the jokes work better then it is discarded. The problem is that there are not many jokes. Certainly I laughed twice. Unlike the parrot, there is no ounce of creativity to be observed in the film. I can not use the director's full potential. Eva did not necessarily show more of the funny skill but got the chance to do so. Overall, the film is ideally on Sunday afternoon. You can skip thoroughly.
