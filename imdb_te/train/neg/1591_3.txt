This gawd-awful trip tape for me after seeing a number of "Next Action Star" reality TV EPS TiVo. For some bizarre reason - and I only have to reproach myself - hoping to be something * unique in the whole film, I've seen the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" is very good with Action Dreams, he may want to make sure that he bones on his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, Billy Jane, the only redemptive value of the whole film, and he did not miss Slipshod's writing from Chippewa. Zen's performance is confusing through 2 / 3rds, but he seems to be unaware of what else he does not see. <br /> However, he can not be blamed here. Writing, very frankly, sucks. Let's take the ideas from "Rat Race," "State of Enemy," "Terminator," "Midnight Run," and any bad gambling you think of. <br /> <br /> Sean Karigan, the "man's bell" of "Next Action Star", is reported to be broadcasting all the strengths and weaknesses. The directors mentioned in the entire run of the series. One-note Joni, Sean plays a well-dubious role, but struggles to cope with the film's weight. Most obviously, we never cared about whether he liked most people or died, because Carrigan failed to give him a reason for audiences. <br /> <br /> Carrigan, like a timber, is strong in comparison to the rigid curine van Rick de Gruut. Do you know Howard Fine really pretends to be a terminator for the first half of the film? I do not think so. I wanted to quote Arni. Her role is "acting" to "Freddy Got Fingered", which is comparable only to dramatic depths, although not nearly as well advanced. The camera loves her in the dark, shadows limosas, but her attitude in the harsh light of the day makes all the energy on the screen. <br /> Lastly, Sean is tough to give a good lead in an ensemble cast, but this should not be left to make a solo. This is a big deal for him. "Next Action Star" colleague Jared Elliott may not have much better luck with some more dynamic characters, but Jeff Welch's sloppy script is difficult to say. Someone needs to take Welch's iMac away before he or anyone else hurts. Eventually, Van Rick de Groot just went out and ran out of this way to run in full order. <br /> <br /> Joe Silver should be ashamed.
