I really have to say that looking at this film and looking out for finding some new life on it that is distinguished from very dull and overly engraved Mexican movies. I do not have any idea but I have believed in sex, pudor y lagrimas, to put a fresh and loyal to our existing industry. Perhaps this was because of the dramatic ability to include new images (albeit Diemen Bichier, who always liked Mexican film directors) because the soundtrack was different from others (because I heard before watching the movie), because it was shining with modern social behavior in the script in the script, perhaps illuminating the photography seen in the trailers instead of theatrical vastavikanga Would. The film has attracted the main audience, and the main disappointment. Serrano actually deals with "all men in the same way" and "why all women ..."; Blah, blah, blah. It's nothing new, it also uses the most common ground and cliche, which eventually makes it without maximizing any valuable reflexion in the female / male position. Complete simple tramps on audiences as safe clothes as I spoke before (Always worked, always) and screaming performances (It's a scenario well-played movie) .. and I rarely understand, verbally. The first more comprehensive roles by Monroe Dione and Demihan Bichier are more curious as Serrano is. I totally disagree with Serrano, that they should not only treat him as mereiones for his lesson ... He received this message and completely destroyed his characters, the story may have been. However, it's a very fun movie feature, and it may be best for you to watch it (if you agree that you are not irrelevant).
