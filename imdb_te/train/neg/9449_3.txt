Dr Susse is definitely mad if he is alive. The Cat Movie Productions in Hat shows how to make a classic story and make GoPO a mindless pile. We're Mike Myers the innocent child the hat-in, big mistake! Myers prove that he does not act in the film. He works on his sleeve as a sacred show girl with a thousand tricks. Children in this film are somewhere between desperate, disappointing and annoying lines. The story never adjusted to the original story, as originally as many movies based on a couple of tweaks and other stories! It is a bad idea to bring the queen in the bad neighborhood. A villain villain who never gets anywhere in life. If you think about the film, it is like a comic strip rejected from the newspaper. The film looks perfectly inadequate! There are a funny adult jokes like where he goes off the cat cuts of his tail and sensor before he says a naughty words, a little funny. At least Grinch Stutt, and the picture is really good! The film is a brightly colored snooted piece with bright colors and bad acting. Is Mike Myers actually in the film? And another thing, fish. What a stupid fish there is! The first time you see him, he is a real fish. The next time you'll see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dow! The film's overall off target devastation. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I have a good joke like a jet of water park, that's fine. If you choose, please look at Grin instead of this mess.
