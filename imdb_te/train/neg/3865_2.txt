This is very bad. Poor actors. You say that they are trying very hard, but we do not know you. The writing is very clear and easy, it is sad to see them try to sell them. <br /> <br /> This humor and speed is very hard and it is hard to believe that any of these good actors signed. <br /> <br /> The difficulty of looking away from the screen is terrible. We just need to know if this trainwreck goes. But we were caught on TV. If we actually paid for it, we would hate it. <br /> It's at least entertaining / mentally ill 2 stars. And the laughable remembrance of Scooby-Doo's episode of random music (as opposed to the effort-very hard indie soundtrack) ... but not good.
