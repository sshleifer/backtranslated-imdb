I have seen the worst pictures, but I'm so upset about the badness of these bad horror movies. The killer monster thing really is really bad, the green body suit is a person of its kind. B acting is far worse as long as the movie looks, but the second is the star and hell. It actually has a plot with the substance, but it is still very stupid. Usually it's just a low-budget budget horror film. But at least it's not as bad as its Titanic, that movie sucks the balls, this one just sucks. Blood in this movie is really a duplicate. A complaint blows me looks stupid, having all about the horror of the new Millennium, the low grade gore. The scene of a very gruesome death with fake blood is stupid. There is at least a nice shower view
