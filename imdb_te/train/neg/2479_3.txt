After Calling Your Name in the Air - Akon Schwartz's "Scary Stories" books I've learned Wendigo many years ago - then you drag into the sky and drag into the sky. While it's a pretty bizarre feeling, Schwartz's story has become a very coherent idea. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is not a movie. This is basically a horror film cliche: the family has a new home moves and strange things, which asks the vulnerable ones, and everyone listen to the old Indians. I have seen this thing many times, I'm not worried to count anymore. <br /> Avoid anyway. Patricia Clarkson and Eric Per Sullivan (Dewey "Malcolm in the Middle") did better.
