I have no idea that Sam Marwick believed that there was a valuable plan to do this, on Earth, or beyond. Ben and Arthur is one of the worst films ever made. In fact, I found no reason why the bottom 100 should not be in # 1. For example, super babies: Baby Genesis 2 (during this publication # 5) I do not see, imagine that the film is better than the injury, because at least in the fetal vulnerability the Baby Genesis 2 is professionally made. By contrast, everything, and I understand everything, this picture is totally immoral. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to attack the Christian Rite's imaginative satire and hatred on homosexuals. And I will emphasize that "intended." When it fails completely and completely at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly spot. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic image of a gay couple's struggle on a society, they are more likely to oppose them, creating a tired, cross-normalization of each party. Ben and Arthur, where the couple got married, both raw, romance hunger, and the films filmed as helplessly as romantic cardboard cutouts are when marriage laws allow them to do so. This is the Christian Benin brother Victor meets with the opposition, like all Christians (the film is believed to be), loud, secret, stupid and violent. Ben and Arthur are trying to kill him after his colleagues are removed from the ministry. Like in real life. <br /> <br /> Here actors (?) are able to destroy the credibility of the film. They commented on the YouTube Home Comedy video. But Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando have also been able to save the clunker, even though they are not the title characters, because there is still a thing of the most grotesque and laugh-inspiring conversation filled with every minute of the film. Each scene is at least one awkward or wrong coat. For example, in one scene, Victor attempts to complain about having a niece or a nanny because of his brother's homosexuality. Instead of apparently portraying this idea, he was stupid, totally confusing, whiny-sounding excitement, "You know, I have no men or women, okay, because you're so f *** <br /> Yes, I know this is not the Dark Knight, but amateur filmmakers have a few basics of special effects and compilation For example, the six drops of red cake are not suitable for real bullet injuries, do not get tired in the middle room where people take the shot and when the shot does not fall! <br /> <br /> Ben and Arthur do not waste your money, 17, or 107. I do not care if you're gay, straight, bi, or not. I do not care. "I do not care what you need to be tempted to buy this dung-heap.
