Anyone who wants a good idea like an "invisible man" is good and that it would be a great deal of exclusively special in special effects, but this is not the case. The story, characters and finally the last 20 minutes of the last 20 minutes of the movie are fresh as a mad-scientist movie. There are some great moments, especially the idea of ​​an incredible special effects and an invisible man who hits the streets. But alas, we will soon return to the narrow confinement of the underground laboratory, the rest of the film is not imaginary, but uncommon. <br /> <br /> Many ancient reconstructions have featured movies or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their attractions. But the ol's classic idea of ​​anxious nose as anxiously like the Verhoeven (who has his moments) has become vivid and clearer for each image is a very bad one. It is obvious that money is the most important issue here: the time and energy of the scripture is not anywhere near enough, and as a result, "Halo Man" is weak by clichés, relative characters, speculation and depth of absence. <br /> <br /> However, with special effects I'm really impressed by a catch-up. While preparing this type of image, modern producers take care of the children allowing them to see them. Thus, the language (and sometimes, violence and sexuality) have been reduced considerably. When the whole world lets up, the good guys are "Oh darn!" And "Oh my God". "Halo Man" gratefully overlooked the freedom to say what kind of hypnotism and roles falls most naturally. I'm not saying that a very natural response would make a slight mistake - but it would be more reliable if some actually did. I think thanks for Verhoeven for that.
