I grew up as Superman II Theatrical Version ("S2T") and a small child, because I had more Superman and three Superman-type villains, and I liked more than part, which started with a bang? ? Best Clark Kent for Superman Transfers and Rescue Scenes The kids are no longer seen on Superman's screen, I'm part of it. As an adult now, how did I fall with the powerful S2T (see: my review.) The story of the hero's director Richard Donner reveals how unfairly and unfairly he has been removed from Part II. (For example, 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3.) Unfortunately, I can not fully recommend Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD"). Gone is the greatest superman change scene, the whole Paris Rescue, as I am the amazing revision of the S2T. In fact, all of them wrote these words: "In the past Superman?" In S2RD. Special effects are not great in Part I or S2T, but the S2RD, are they most obviously ridiculous? Like Lais fall from the Daily Planet window. I agree, some new scenes have worked and some people leave, "The Honeymoon Suite." Overall, I grew up in S2T, I loved a child and I was not sowing as an adult, as it is almost a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler Apprentice) Unfortunately, the worst change comes the last: also 'I.' It is not just a lazy and unnatural coat of the same S2T from the exact same place as S2T, but if the events actually happen, Clarke does not make sense why he goes back to that diner. And he will continue to "re-time" for every stir?
