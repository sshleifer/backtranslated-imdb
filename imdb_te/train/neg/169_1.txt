Recently I saw this movie because a friend brought him from NYC. 30 minutes later, I said to him, "You had to be funny, was that kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I thought it was one of the strongest films I have ever made. "What would it have been?" I asked. "A promotional film made for children?" The plot is stupid. Look at this sort of acting trip and it's obviously a lot of people who have something to do after life, love or life and which can provide a very incredibly idiotic view of it ... help. Please, if someone tries to stifle this thing on your DVD or video player, it is thought that a virus has been installed on your computer ... it will not destroy your player but will destroy your evening. If they made Razhs in the 40s, it was a success in each section. (PS is also in the dubious composition of "Sterey to Heaven")
