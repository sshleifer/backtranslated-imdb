If you do not see Jorbie Bloodbath, you do not. A contest that 'produces your own horror film in a day' will not be an insult to any audience than intellectuals of intellectual intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot the plot, plot, proper dialogue, people needed some BASIC acting talents and the credit lighting designer forgot to show clearly. It is the record on the crummiest of handsys, and copied on the garbage material. Make Effect Effect for Black Mascara for the Jones and Yughurt into the People of the People to the Art to Art to Skinish to Art Skills. It's not more than a home film, and even really bad. It's fun watching friends, family and neighbors who are ready to show for filming. A product is not meant to mean that this joke is listed on any serious movie magazine or website - my wedding party home movies are good and interesting. Time, money and energy total waste. The sequel Zombie Bloodbath II is the worst thing.
