Scary Movie 3 is hard to put in such stingfest words. <br /> <br /> The original scary movie is good, one of the best 90th spoof movies, coming from a great team coming from our band earlier. There is no threat to South Central when you drink your juice in the hood. But what happened to hell? <br /> <br /> After the tragedy of Scary Movie 2, I thought the cast and crew would help change things, but it was still worse. <br /> <br /> Within 20mins, I smile twice. A smile, jokes recycled and realism is clearly no factor. At this time in writing, most people on this site voted for 10/10, and I was physically ill. <br /> <br /> In fact, when a great deal of schooling of rock, which has gap * funny jokes, anyone wasting their money on their trip was seen by their head. <br /> <br /> Any stars / ****
