The really terrible, pretentious, endless image. Director Belocchio is very interested in his actress Demeter's beautiful face and person - and who can blame him? But perhaps, it is better to focus more on the good, the better, the more attractive film. I hate it when sex film becomes "art film" more and more "honorable". Often, the occasional hot sex scenes are the only cause of the film's existence. Whether they are sitting by the rest of the pictures is not worth the taste. (*)
