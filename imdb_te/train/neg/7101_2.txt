I gave this film ten to zero, but I will give it to both. The reason for Shahrukh Khan's appearance in the film is not really a reason. The queen is going to appear in this movie called Lost Point and a smile with Kamal. I love the queen too and she is respected as a great actress. I am not surprised by Kamal's kissing movie, but it's not a big deal. Anytime the movie is fitted with the bedroom scenes that you can see, actually talk about the movie. Is it good or bad? I would be surprised by its totally worst movie. My Fantastic Reviewer, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my other name, I'll have a great taste. If the film is not entertaining and it wants to hit the film, there is no courage in the film. Its partial image is not a true story and it stabs. Kamal was keen on kissing these actresses.
