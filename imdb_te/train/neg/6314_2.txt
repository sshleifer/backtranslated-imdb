I love Seth Green. His performances in the Thought 70s are always worth watching, but last night, I felt the feeling of a change in appearance. Four new single boys inherited a New York City apartment that many of us die. The grandmother should be the heiress who has such a place for the first place. So I thought that the need for realism was eliminated. However, the plot of four good friends about this apartment is not reliable. I was amazed if I had to go together with one of the greatest humor and dysfunctional parents about the formation of the show. It does not seem too humorous. I'm just looking at it because my winner comes before my name Earl on Thursday night. I want to go back and scrap this series and start. We need a more family series. Sath and his friends were fired at their location, with their incomplete parents moving in the neighborhood. Dabbie Coleman's father and Christine Estabrook can play and play mom and dad siblings. The list of possibilities like Seth Green is endless and the network blowing it up.
