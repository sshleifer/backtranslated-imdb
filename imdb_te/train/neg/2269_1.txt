Everything that's happening in the program already has and basically allows a movie about a talk show! If that idea is not intriguing, it must be, stay away from the roundmaster. I was displeased by seeing this theater and was actually able to sit in the cinema of the film. I guess Jerry Springer would not be able to play himself as he showed from the cheap items for his performance (yes than the real real Jerry Springer show) and he is the only Jerry in the film. While living with her mother the plot (if you are called) decides to start sleeping in a daughter's mother-in-law. So the mother's brilliant idea is to call Jerry Springer Show to get it with her daughter's boyfriend. (They are no coincidence in a trailer park). Meanwhile a woman in the US finds a woman as a woman. So of course call the American doctor Jerry Springer! I'm talking about the rest of the film but thinking about the movie now gives me a headache. Jamie Presley, who plays the daughter, is not entirely unattractive in this film. And remember Mike Dudikoff Kick Donkey Karate Master from the American Ninja Series? Well now drink a white trash and take a look at him. The thing is really terrible and out of the call shape it's really in touch with his horrible ... If your idea of ​​fun is to sing a country song sprinkled with his own show or boys transwriters with Jerry Springer ... well ... just watch the show! ... at least Steve It's smart enough to stay away from this film.
