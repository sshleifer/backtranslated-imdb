I was scared by this documentary. I'm deeply embarrassed and so ashamed by Puertoricans. This documentary is not about the culture of Puttarkians. It's about nuocores culture. Puretoricans and niocirians are two different cultures. Many different cultures and the general population of Puerto Rico do not. Rossi, before you make a documentary, you have to do research. You should make sure that your sources are reliable. Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they can not show the documentary, which has the class. I am very happy to see when I see in Marsea Stewart and see Rossi and Jimmy on Rossi. I also learned to my parents that they love Puerto Rico. After the first five minutes I can not believe how the documentary America has been tightened and how Puerto Ricans did as a group of guinea pigs. You can visit Puerto Rico and visit Puerto Rico as the 3rd world country where 50% of the population is in poverty. Restaurants, theaters, beaches, hotels (ritz, hilton, etc.), casinos, churches, agriculture, auto expresso, and many other places in Puerto Rico, such as roads, cars, shopping centers, malls (the biggest Kmart and JCPenney's I've seen) Restaurants just name a few. Poverty? Not 50% of the population. The Puerto Rico culture is trying to avoid family, music, food, celebration, and backwardness. Oh, and new cousins ​​just do not pop out from where. It's not a matter of Puerto Rican, it's a ghetto thing. We are not bastards. The parents of the Pettetikan family who want to teach their children about Puerto Rico can invest in a tour of the family, and see first of all Puerto Rico. They see its beauty, people and culture. Please do not show them to this documentary because it just clouds their minds negatively. Oh, and please do not tell your American friends to see this documentary, because it will only make people of Puttikiconic people feel ignorant. <br /> Yes, I was born and raised from RICAN before the island. You know!
