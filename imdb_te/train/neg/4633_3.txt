As is often the case, films generally do not make good drama about self-hate characters. 'Downloading Nancy' is no exception. <br /> <br /> The character of Nancy (Maria Bello), who married the character Albert (Rufus Sewell), is based on a true story about the woman who murdered her in her own plea. Albert is a successful software developer. He developed the golf game, which made his company successfully market for various bars and bar / restaurants. Unlike most humans, Albert has no positive qualities (except for the ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a terrible and door expression on his face. He does not have any sympathy for his wife. When his wife asks for sex, she sees her presence and punishes her. <br /> <br /> Nancy is a note similar to a character. She had only one unmarried 15-year-old marriage, but she was sexually harassed when she was growing up (fortunately there were no heroes behind that movie). Her self-hate is the form of self-mutilation and the result, she came into the treatment. <br /> In the end, Nancy will be annoyed by her for contacting Louis on the Internet. He is sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money while walking a huge amount of boot pain. Louise has two children, but can not see them anymore (the mother of the child is no longer needed). <br /> <br /> The Nancy scheme first involves painful sex with Louis and kills him. There is a distinctly unpleasant scene that has sexual relations with Louis Nancy. These scenes are known as Louis, Louise me and hit him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a two-fold plan to see Albert: 1) Nertie has bartered to treat him and 2) he is hurt. It takes a little while before louis vuitton outlet of Nancy, and he forces Albert to compromise his dog, so he does not care for anyone in the future. Nancy's duty was that Louie had eventually been murdered by her, but showed some skepticism as she had clearly stated she had some feelings). <br /> <br /> We will soon find out that Louis was in prison for Nancy murder. <br /> Do we really want to remove Nancy from downloading? Are we sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? What is the main thing of this film? Will Nancy sympathize actually guarantee? I do not think so. The authors of this film created a grass man in the role of Alber. Nancy is a man who has been cut off from his emotional responsibilities to the decline. But are people so dimensional in real life? I'm not. They were disappointed by Louis, who lived by causing pain and bartered Albert to ignore Nancy. In addition, his love expressions towards Nancy (before he could kill him) had to show his 'sensitive side'. Finally, the filmmakers have different characters in the film whether or not they are with their sympathy. Nancy is nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft porn movie, as they repudiate their audience with unsatisfactory violent scenes.
