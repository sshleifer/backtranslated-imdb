How did it come into existence? I usually love Science F / Bigfoot movies etc. . But I still guess them written without too much cheese like this. The effects are sad, the lines are difficult. Avoid all costs. I rented it because it was in the wrong case (I'm looking for a Saskwatch movie with Lance Henricsson - it has not yet seen). The idea of ​​cinema is really good. There is so much power to make a great little film here. I do not understand how something like this will end up like this. Talk to students in film / arts / english interest in any high school and you'll see people who can write a good script.
