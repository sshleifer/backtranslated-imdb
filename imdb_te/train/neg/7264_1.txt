Another film that stolen unsaturated frontal male nudity; The horror acting, plus the love-sharing scenes are the most obscene I have ever seen (and I love the two young people, I do not love it because I'm homosexual). <br /> Again, in Mill Nubes de Paz, Julian Hernandez makes enough argument for a short film about five minutes but it directs a very pretentious film with a story that manages to make a 2 hour movie ... And this time, There is also a racism and commodification problem in the Mexican Gay community to talk about! God has shown kindness to us!
