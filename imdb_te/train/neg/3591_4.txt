In advance, I said that I had great confidence in fanfeed stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good performance after being canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of good efforts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> ST: HF. Well, the first good things off. The enthusiasm is any reliable performance and most likely, the band of different ships seem to have a good time with their characters. Later, the effects are not bad for home-brewing effort, you really do not have to do anything to win. Stories are not too bad. <br /> <br /> But, even if it is very clear, advance off. </ P> <p> There is no reason why they can remove every other science fiction score ever made for Star Trek footage, backdrops, music and effects. Starship troopers from Aliens rears the orchestra head at everything one point or another. Similarly, footage from most other movies, certainly make CGI'd look different. Gray warships, for example, Star Wars were clearly visible to Star Destroyers. And the station is also clearly located Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Similarly, animation effects from various Star Wars films appear in space battles between animating the footage. <br /> <br /> In one scene in the first or second season, I also think that two TIE fighters are flying in the past, which does not prohibit any refusal of your refusal. <br /> Acting is hideously painful to see what is reasonable. Everyone is improving as seasons progress, however, expecting a lot of the screen, especially in the early seasons. They've also done some interesting acting options. <br /> <br /> In this presentation, tell the food implants permanently set to "cake" and stop it. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects are usually very effective on the whole. But they must really try to kill a club who faded the ferry and cardigan masks to kill the person who decided for anything other than the background use or "passing" shots. They are unrealistic. Every time I saw one (not much laugh), I was a bad guy who watched the gun and wore "It's a stick-up!" In one scene, "Cardian" actually speaks and wears one of these. Only the lips are not moving, but there is no mask for the masked mouth. Anyone needs to be stuck hard for that. For goodness, they can not take a craft knife! <br /> <br /> There are also some good things like Hermann Munster, but unexpectedly making things funny. <br /> <br /> While writing, the writing is not new. As a continuation of the DS9 instead, there are many ships that ships from the DS12. The new enemy, "Gray" is not too menacing and the plot line involving them will effectively rework the Borg thread. That is to say that Gray is the most powerful to meet with Gray Gray, and Starflett just starts to explore ways to fight their enemies through technology and the enemy. Conversation bone conversation. Star Trek writers have the ability to write "insertion technobble" into the script in the long run. It refers to a description of the latest technique to combat the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolistic allegations". In other words, it is a nonsense to say that they are in the case and that there is a clarity. <br /> <br /> Words are just really hideous. There is no problem in this regard, but ST: HF is here to add real world comments in this regard. <br /> <br /> "We need to reconcile", but not the trilogy of existing characters in a group. And when asked about the situation, the strategic officer replied: "We count the three warships". Is it really necessary to count them? C'mon! When asked the question, "Are you sure?" Or "you can double check". <br /> <br /> Captain: "We can establish two lines of communication. <br /> <br /> Comforter officer:" No, <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> "Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, improving 3 improvement, but 4 & 5 starts making it noticeable. Season 6 seems to be quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with their choice of medium for presentations Quixime is very clear and screw Some of us do not really take our downloads and do not peer in a small QT window on a good computer screen .Quixime makes this complicated, but does not scan 320x180 resolution displays at all levels.It actually makes the performances look pretty unwatchable, they are tenth- Generation VHS tape copies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this program is promised And I like some of the characters. But the 40 episodes, so I can not say a lot about the development of the role of the character. <br /> <br /> What do you say, it's free. <br /> <br /> PS: 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as 9 or 10. Do we see the same presentation? Or are you 19 years old?
