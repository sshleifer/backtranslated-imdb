I am surprised at the many women voters who give good marks to this film. My idea about this film is that the target audience is adults and men. Wounded and tortured women, merciless haggard and high body calculations, are specialized ingredients that were introduced into the history of the history by the Spaghetti Subganger. Early and hand-smashing DJANGO Rip-offs. But in the SHOOTER style eg. Django. Score, acting and cinematography are mediocre, but if you look for the ingredients listed here you are right here. <br /> <br /> There is no Italian pronunciation of actors. <br /> <br />
