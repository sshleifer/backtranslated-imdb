I did not see this movie for the first time in TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the Beholder Clich never happened. This value is lower in this partial value. I am sorry with the infinite appeal of Lucy (Lauren Bacall). The truth is, Ms. Bacal is a beautiful woman, but her character in this movie comes off more mousy than attractive. I feel like men such as Mitch van and Kyle Hadley think that Lucy can be an immediate one with her. In the protection of Baal, the film was made during Humphrey Bogart's late illness and the weight of his dying health influenced her performance. Lucy is part of this silent style contrary to her navy Marley, which was hit and over by Dorothy Malone. Her father is seriously engaged in the best scenes in the film when she steps up the stairs to the heart attack. Although Robert Keith's brilliant portrayal of Jasper Hadley's fatigue with his two children's disappointing behavior, Malone's remaining performances go outside. Generally, though, I would just have to say just not a fan of play. The cartoonic behavior of the characters is a very unlikely story for my tastes.
