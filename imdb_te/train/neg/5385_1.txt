I do not know where to start. Filled with people who have never before or gone cast. Debraye Scott is listed in cover boxes, but not in all of this movie. Writing is also bad for college films. <br /> <br /> Characters are very typical for college films - coward guy, tell me smile, black guy, tough guys, mom, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. Featured teacher about what you'd expect ... The middle age is a huge set guy who gets sidetracked. <br /> Be clear from this movie that you can not watch a college. It's too bad, it's not even funny.
