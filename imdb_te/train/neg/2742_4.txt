I was stumble on this movie surfing. My first reaction is, 'Oh God is not again!' Nowadays it's hip to play a retard, which has become a revenge and apparently despicable. For some reason, however, I stood up and could not see it. <br /> And certainly, Ken and Helena can work. Moreover, the film is well developed at the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter was surprised by her character. Jen has an average side used to keep her distance and pity. Then again she is looking for a soft side looking for love. <br /> <br /> If you have a success for the film, the film is not unique. You can skip looking for pure entertainment. It's serious scene! Oh my, it's a bit tough, it's a couple jokes ... but for escaping.
