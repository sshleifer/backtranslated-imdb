Though viewers view him as a wolf, the hunter's hunters see the person in the forest. <br /> <br /> Hunters can not recognize this because they appear to be normal when they shoot him, when they take control of him. <br /> <br /> A physician changed the eyes of a wolf to a person who lost himself in laboratory experiments. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, it seems that his wife is cheating on him. A smoke machine sends clouds over an amateur painting of the moon (with a fake tree in the foreground), he turns into a wolf! His torso grows bigger, strikes his shirt and grows big giant wolf's mask with red lights on his head. His pants will remain intact. <br /> <br /> Although poor wolf dress up, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, but the mouthpieces are robotics (or hidden arms) and that are well done. The film is also a pretty good decapitation later. <br /> If a person falls from a height, it is painful to act as a fake. <br /> <br /> A wealthy person is a friend of Cidemac, and he is unexpectedly an expert on the name of Andrew, a little man crusty. They try to help him a little bit. <br /> He kills the people who made him wrong. The murderers are investigating and attempting to press on the beetone because he does not take much care to the lesbian scenes. <br /> <br /> The most dangerous game is the most dangerous, but nakedness and blood-and-morassing story-mixing (sort of) arcock and wolf man's hands is somewhat entertaining. Available on its own, or box set screw queens vol. 1.
