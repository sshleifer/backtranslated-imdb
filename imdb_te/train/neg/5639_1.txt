Today, the film is now seen at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel, and after reviewing reviews, critics are expected to join Willem Defoe and his wife (director). It's definitely a slow picture I've seen with many ridiculous, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Defoe's wife and two-half of the other actors in Gayda have been pretty ridiculous with Defoe and I am terrified (they know how to take a piece of seller in a bakery). The movie is pretty simple and lavish with the laughter attempt on the wall. The only scene that reacts to audiences is obscene and comes from somewhere. Adding some kind of shock value to depression in the film. Sorry so tough, but really this film is valuable waste of time and money. I congratulate a good indie film, but this movie is not enough for audiences.
