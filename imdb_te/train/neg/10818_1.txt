After reading the novel before seeing this film, I was disappointed with wooden acting and producers' pride in the negligence of the plot. I feel this movie reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and instead gives a seal of a shallow love story. In a brief overview of the film's 2-movie film, the book has lost a number of important books, a book that is sensible and progressive, and some jumping themes with little evidence. The romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre does not have any kind of effort, so it's not like you do not dislike the two unparalleled rare interactions, but it is totally sudden and incomplete because they can not imagine their 'love' parables. For BrontÃ«'s novel it is unfair, jen's sharp cheek and courage you attract her to Rochester and his pride attracts him to Jane. <br /> <br /> Despite poor scripting, some of the characters have been shot much worse, such as Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall production is poor. If improved scripting is given, perhaps this movie will be more successful. Watch "Jane Eyre" (1970) for an amazing production with Gela Clark and Timothy Dalton.
