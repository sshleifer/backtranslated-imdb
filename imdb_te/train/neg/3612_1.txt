<br /> <br /> Do not believe me, <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this film is not just an art, but a title like Split University. Even worse than Splitter University is not desirable for the funest garbage. The publish U is very low - the story is unclear, the letters are throw-aways, and the whole picture is no excuse. There is no need to say that there is no suspense or atmosphere or scare. This dribble is not brave enough to throw any nudity (for the cheapest thrill of all). So this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of all entertainment (even cheap laughs) and just full bored. The bottom of the barrel them down - even hard-slasher fans want to think twice before seeing, let's pay for this movie. <br /> Out of the bombs
