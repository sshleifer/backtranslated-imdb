I was in SXSW with this movie director. Some people went out, and eventually the audience was able to get a respectable appreciation. <br /> In 106 minutes, at least 95 minutes will be too long. You watch the main character's failed and try to communicate, see the real time stretched. We get the PO - the same vacuums, mouth movements, kinetic and mutual words and letters and repeat over and over again. <br /> <br /> A site actually compares this work to the early Mike League. What drugs do you have to make that announcement? Frownland is a Captain BeefHart song, you'd probably enjoy the trout mask reflection on the huge rotation you appreciate this film. Unbelievable, this festival won the jury award. You can wager that the audience did not win the award.
