I agree that this film format is unnecessary change with all the Colombo fans. Colombo is a unique police with extraordinary police procedures. The film looks like the remake of any other common detective drama from the past. <br /> <br /> If Colombo is no ordinary detective, it is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The two parts of the film are witty to me. First, I can not find the title of this image. It's misleading. Perhaps the title is "The Vanishing Bride" or something like that. Secondly, Colombo hides a piece of evidence without reason (at least for audiences). <br /> I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I went back to normal Colombo with Peter Faulk
