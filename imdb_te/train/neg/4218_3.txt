This is not one of the reviews about poor special effects or technology, or just about people who have no money, but there is a review in the story telling us that most of us are really interested. The plot is a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members, and a German U boat, and two civilians (hero and heroine) who land in savage land of dinosaurs. /> <br /> The manipulation is not so bad by film scales, and realism does not go to high levels. <br /> <br /> The movies required for this film are trusted and loved ones. For a full-length image, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are rarely seen. <br /> They want to answer a riddle about the land of the dinosaurs they enter, but the riddle is a lot of time.
