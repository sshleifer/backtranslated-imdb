My personal vision of hell is locked in a room without closing my eyes or being able to withstand my ears and the film has a drama for perpetuality on every available surface in this room. The whole concept that Streisand plays the role of a boy / man is the only way to start scratching the surface of the film. The most important thing about looking at any film is the concept of "discreet suspension of disbelief". . . In this movie it is impossible to do that.
