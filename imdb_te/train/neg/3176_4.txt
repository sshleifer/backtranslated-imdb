The lovely Eva Longoria plays the role of Parker Kate, who after her Ice Age slips her with Harry (Paul Rudd) in front of "I Does". Two years later Henry was shaken and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloan) was very concerned. Chloe arranges for Cloy to talk with an attractive mental ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley Henry should contact Kate's soul to help get help in her life. When Henry gets emotional at the beginning of psychology, Kate's ghost blossom appears in the blossom. There are some funny situations; But if you've seen trailers you've seen the film's material. Also in cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Silver McLennan-Cave. I personally steal the show from Bell Parker. Also common pain in the Biggs. This film is still over-hyped.
