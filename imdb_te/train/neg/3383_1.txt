I first saw Live Music in The Denver Center for the Performing Arts and it's totally awesome, amazing and the best continuation of plot and dialogue I liked more than the music I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you can not see the face of the jach. He was in the dark, but his presence was powerful and led the whole production direction. I heard that I was doing a movie from it, I was hoping to breathe, but I was disappointed when I felt that I was cheating when I saw the movie version. The film does not have an attractive mood in direct production and does not allow you to stay close to each character. Personally, I would like to see a live version again and I'll be sorry to go out of your way to see if it's ever been restored. This is one of the most memorable experiences you enjoy.
