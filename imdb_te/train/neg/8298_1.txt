The film is not too ridiculous, it is not as good as the original or a Christmas Christmas Story. Try to imitate the characters before the characters (except the younger ones), and they fail. Hilbily did not come out because the neighbor was not part of the first film. It really is absorbed, may be better with the original cast, and the story is not again because the story is weak again. Skip.
