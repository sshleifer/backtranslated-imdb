Neat premise. Very unreal. The control of crazily out to go to the cabin weekend I learned from this movie is not the best idea after all. I loved no bargain without going to the car comfortably and down the hill! Unfortunately, that's not the same for his gas. Oh, and the police have never found a car or invented the owner. <br /> <br /> <br /> Get out of the scenes, including a plain stripper. Poor assistant guy and his bad useless hand. I agreed that I was curious to see the suspicious "thing" behind the door, but when it looked, I laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl really looked sadistically angry about the restored. Personally, I would really like a new body after an annoying experience like that!
