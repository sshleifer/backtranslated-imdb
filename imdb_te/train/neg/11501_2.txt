The romantic and thorough vision of unemployment from a mediocre class "artist" has a comfortable upbringing ... The writer-director is not directly unemployed and has no personal experience. If you have to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like young people, no anger, no fear, no frustration. All the characters fall down throughout the day by carrying pranks and smoky jokes. They never see work, refuse or suffer from pain, etc. While living in school is just a holiday from a holiday ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare them with the contemporary artwork from the likes of Ken Loach
