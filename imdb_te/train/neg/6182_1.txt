The Robin Hood costume for Robin Hood-Costume does not make it an Elf for Peter and all of the things that really make him ignore the features. This film makes silver an abusive idiot. And the poor captain hook the whole clown. And because each Disney cartoon had a character that had a lot of hits on the head, they made one of the Lost Boys. The tink of the single character that is not insulted in the film. <br /> Is that story then? Darling parents do not even have time to notice that their babies are gone !!! Perhaps one of the most important point in the original story and they are ruined! Also a wonderful piece of the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy - there are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story a unique one. He's also a wonder she lost her shadow and she helped him stick. <br /> <br /> Destroying a great story like this can be illegal for children to be happy. So now if you do not know this now - this Disney version is nothing but the original story - it's not really a child story but it's just a great story. <br /> This is not the end of me.
