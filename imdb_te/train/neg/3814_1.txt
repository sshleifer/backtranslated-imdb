I would like to see the little girls enjoy this show, but this family called the program is ridiculous. I was amazed that this year was very memorable. It is the most infamous and stupid show about his widow's brother and the widow's father with his stupid friend from the school, and others who continue the seasons. All of the plot lines usually have a mute lesson. In the midst of each episode, someone else is mad and each episode is made up and it ends in a light vague joke. Actors, I do not like them. Bob Sagat is a painful unfunny like dad with mom responsibilities. Dave Cowler is a note joke at age 30 when cartoon voices and kid acts, and he is awful. John Stomos was a very challenging character, but he was very hard at seeing him. The oldest girl in the show, the DJ, has never shown a true bad actress and emotion. Between the girl Stephanie is very cliche to annoying little sister. The little girl Michelle showed no bad actresses of the Olsen twins. You can always tell when they touch them. The plot lines are stupid to the lines of many stories, which is valuable. It was a "family" performance, which tried to replace any good material with cutting and love, and they exceeded it if they needed a program on a family. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible appearance. TVG is 30 minutes.
