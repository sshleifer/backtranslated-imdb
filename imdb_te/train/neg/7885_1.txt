I hope to keep religion out of government and movies. When I request a lecture, I go to church, but I do not want one from the movie. I do not care about some supernatural ideas (after all, religion is superhuman as you can!) But in this film I am really angry. Landslide reminded me of the witches who appeared in other films. He also had a bad man as having horns. <br /> <br /> And a silly conclusion is that the leader went to a meeting and called the elderly, and the spell broke. If only life is normal. When I stupid the movies, I think they should be delivered with a warning: Danger! The teaching here!
