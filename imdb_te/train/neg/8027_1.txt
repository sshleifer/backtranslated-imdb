I've seen this movie. Until the end. And it's not really easy. It is very boring, played bad and stolen from "Blare WITCH PROJECT" in almost every detail you can not believe manufacturers take this extreme. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a horror movie, "Scream" can be seen, but if you want to laugh and have a good time, some kids look at the dark area, looking at watching some kids running through the woods and showing their inefficiency.
