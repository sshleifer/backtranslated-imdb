A few days ago, I saw a documentary on The Fifty WORST films of all time and I heard this was the first of the best meltingman ever. Being a lover of Sculque movies, I try to find some movies from the documentary - not including the Incredible Melting Man. In fact, the Melting Man was the first "bad movie" I ever had since and I was disappointed. Before viewing this documentary, "Bad films" from Harry Medvedev all read fifty worn movies since I read "Movies." Despite this title, Medvedev never finishes this book before the documentary. From that point, I saw about 35 of the 50 films but one road - the rest of the movies are not available on VHS or DVD. First of all, melancholy person special effects are usually very cold and frustrating, and it's a professional (popular rich baker) involved in realizing this look, but I also have some cheap and cheesy effects The head of the floating plastic head and the monster has its own You can see this - the way round the shoulder slit after cutting out "hid it under his clothes! For the story, it's just stupid. The crew of the astronauts penetrates Saturn's circuit rather than crumbling. Then, they are commenting on how beautiful the sun is - look at its sights. This is odd since Saturn is far from it - it should not be seen this way - it should be a bigger scar. Regardless, we immediately told that the scene changes and one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What's the last scene and what's happening today? Yep, it's someone's guess. <br /> <br /> Now considering that they are running a psycho about what looks like a melting popsicle, do you think the government feels like he finds and removes all the breaks to stop? Wrong. A lonely doctor who found him as a normal! No army, no police - just a few dopey doctor. <br /> <br /> You can not even be surprised when you give the stupidity of the film. <br /> <br /> When a dancer is walking near the doctor's home, the doctor gives his wife a powerful relief and leaves her at home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a feminine man sees the door to protect her, she sees the door. If she does not have a door behind her, it's smart! Instead of just leaving the house and fleeing, she just waits! <br /> When the photographer and his model take snapshots, he raises his assistant and anx. Why? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Now that monster has killed a dozen people. br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie, but it is not a terrible movie as I had hoped for a few special special occasions, but it is good for a laugh but bad PLAN 9 from OUTER SPACE is near where and where is the worst Tripod is not included in the list.
