The rented movie in Norway is a fantastic picture of the film. This film is just awful. The quality of this image is much worse than a mobile phone is a teen bit and the plot is very bad. The main character is just plain annoying and the rest simply suck. Every person who is connected with this image should be ashamed. The fact that people who made the film have their name in their name is exceptional. And distributors; Did they even see it? This is the worst picture I have ever seen. It is an insult to humankind to label this comedy. I want you to support this movie by buying or renting this movie.
