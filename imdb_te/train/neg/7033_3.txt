Black candles are brought from "Vampires" and "Rest in Pies", among others not from the same director. I'll only see what I've seen. Nevertheless, we both have a couple in love, then fear a voodoo doll somewhere near the pin, then it gets screwed up, and the man will be on Kiev. Not sure whether they were good at that time. When reading the will, listening, or somehow, everyone else except the devil worship takes place. It's really hard for anyone who's confusing moments during the movie and who's a bit confusing at times. As a simulation animal with a black goat, it is a simulating topography scene (which was imitated by I imitate), until all the spicy things. The Hague. Sometimes this "Rosemary's Baby" reflects, because the minus baby, the hostess always gives a woman herbal tea and place reeks because the evil Satan herbs are also getting this commentary. However, the herbs are not the only thing that reeks about this film. The end is in the beginning again, and many viewers may be wondering where they're in the middle. It's not very good, it depends on what you want to see in the movies, and it's not unlikely that most of the things here did nothing to me. 3 in 10.
