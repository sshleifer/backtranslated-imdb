I normally act as a fan of the eighties and the ninety ninety film. The film currently has candles ... but this film is very unlikely. Dressing guys as being girls have been killed - but never pathetically. The performance of Corey Haim is simple, and Nicole Ellert is not improved. If the worst is the number 1 fan of an actor / actress in this piece, this has no vomiting features - stay away!
