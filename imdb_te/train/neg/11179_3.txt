As we love Al Pacino, it is painful to see him in the film. A promotional hack pesono did not make a part of the short term that was once a unique and idealistic career and completely damaged everyone with a bogus and unstable southern accent. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is not doing too much. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and astounding. They believed that they understood each other very much. There is no power there. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, tea leaves Leon on the screen. Her scenes with her electric and casino are most interesting in the film, but it is not enough to save all the trouble from trouble.
