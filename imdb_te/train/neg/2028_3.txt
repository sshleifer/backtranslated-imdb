On the surface, "Show Me the Money" must complete at least the full season. You have the amusing William Shatner as your host, in addition to the baker's dozen of beautiful league models called collectively "The Million Dollar Dancers". Many know the pop culture trivia, because there are knowledgeable competitors who know that you have interesting stories to tell about their lives. And got big money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The shape of this game has failed. A good game performance requires at least three things: very good rules, exciting pacing and the ability to play at home to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM is no longer available. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game are very complicated in any prime time game show in history. . <br /> <br /> When a candidate begins with a word or short phrase, select letters A, B, C (micro-plug for the network?). Each letter is linked to a particular question, starting with that word or phrase. When a contestant chooses one of the characters, they can answer that question or pass and choose a second letter. If they qualify, they have to view the next question and have the same option. However, if they get the second question, they need to answer the third option. <br /> When they answer, if their answer is correct, they will be put on a scroll on their behalf by 13 dancers. Their dollar amount ($ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and if the contestant gave the correct answer ... or the answer is wrong ... that amount will be subtracted or subtracted from their pot. <br /> So with me so far? In addition, there is a dancer called "The Killer Card". If you choose a dancer with a killer card and get your question correctly, you are safe and the game continues. However, if you are incorrect, you have a final question to answer. If you end the final question, you come out of the game. <br /> <br /> If you answered six questions or six questions were wrong or you could not earn enough money to get back to the hole so far. Found? OK! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I've ever seen is the complete absence of tension due to the game's design. The contestant has passed the known questions that are not known to them, and answered many of the questions they know. Then, they can still find a little dollar amount, although there is no question of it, it's still not "play". And the fact that they answer that the five questions are wrong and still a big mistake that is likely to win. And the speed of questions is a serious slow: Very often the questions are clear, it's ridiculous to try to create tension as there is no doubt about the most common answers. , The absence of any real tension at any time during the show and the very complex rules prevented the program from work, despite Shutner's Threshold.
