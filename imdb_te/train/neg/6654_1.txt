Generally, I do not think that I do not think it's the Hollywood Productions film. <br /> <br /> This piece of elephant manure is not even enough to be an image, so quotes in the title. <br /> Where do I start? 1. If it does not start the aging cast, it is definitely the essence. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone less than half her age, she is supposed to play an 18-year-old, and her two is firing effo! <br /> <br /> The terrible and stupid mindless character of Paris and France, we see cliche characters here: sympathetic crumpling shop owner, queen of queen of designs, fairy godmother queen of models, etc. The film is overtaken only by the Da Vinci Code, (The reviewers are correctly determined by the comedy). <br /> <br /> It is very well and totally ridiculous to have nudity in a place where time and nudity is the most common place. Terrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> <br And I was able to make these observations after seeing this trash for half an hour, talking to my friends about internet surfing and mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I've invited everyone to my list. :): P: D
