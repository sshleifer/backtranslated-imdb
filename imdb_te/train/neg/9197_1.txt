There are a few movies you know that are going from bad to fray. If you do not completely ignore Ed Wood's work, see the commentator from "Plan 9 from the Outdoors" and you will not see the next cinematography. When I see the first shot of the Uwe Bolls masterpiece "House of the Dead" with the guy who sits in front of the house and starts the interview when trying to despair as if I just come from Sin City, the movie starts with the first one - He said he would die. You know, you have to be spinning. Then he began to introduce the characters like "Thanksgiving of the Karma's Thanksgiving Fox Brown" or "Alicia .. the lines like my ex ... We recently broke up .. I read it and she came to the fence". <br /> However, this group of 20-somethings, which can not get out of the wet paper-bag, goes to the "rapture of the century", some tents to the question, a port-a-paty on a small island in the middle of the Pacific and a staggering platform . <br /> When the gang goes to the island, to make a long story short, there's a way to get there, but thankfully, there's a way to get there. Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Whoever wrote this script) Except for some bloody t-shirts, then you decide to run hell from there. <br /> <br /> With that scene, you come down to the picture and make it go further down against all disparities. Some of the rubber suits start running around some guys, some are tight and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who are between them 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back home. They are transformed into a S.W.A.T along the line. The team entered the matrix, started multiplying like rubber-suit guys bacteria and I started cry because I actually paid to see this. <br /> <br /> There are shots from video game every few minutes, including insult to injury, this depends on the rubbish and is a beautiful game-over cut scene for some utensils when they die. Seriously hate this movie. This is not enough in the title "So So Good This Is Good". It's just bad. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the zombies are terrifying, there are no tensions, the lines are bad, the actors are bad .. the list just continues. Fear of being awful. Not. There are bad movies that are eligible to be viewed. This is not one of them.
