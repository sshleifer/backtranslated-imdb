Expect caffeine kick, await you from a film that increases the power of warm drinks and coffee clans and shares its name. In fact, if the film is a cup of coffee, it is weaker and watery, filled with some undesirable drains and does not have a temporary bar. Plat-wise, coffee is a law-nurse and hard-law handed to her own hands-on-drug-inspired, lady-pimpin 'and mob-suckers that brought her younger brother to a sick state. The socio-political commentary in the US is the most prominent of black black wars in the US, the Afro-American minorities targeted at some of the more thought-provoking elements such as coffee crusades on political corruption and white racism. Unfortunately, timeless quality of the film and lack of attention are timely messages ignored. <br /> <br /> One of the plus points of coffee is the presence of the BlaxLoity Icon Pam Grair. Gary plays her role in her role in the role and in her glamorous act of brutal acts (how does she treat the hoods full house?) It's just a shame that the storyline waves on the occasions, as much as possible, are wasted on sexual exploitation.The low budget did not help, but for a blakesploidation film, <br /> <br /> With the lack of quality, the problems are decline, Fun and excitement are sloped by slowness and vicious movements <br /> <br /> The whole outcome is maid and wood We can not get a hip heroine but get the hip movie.Coffy has its moments and it's a key image in the Blaxploitation Craze It is a shame, it's just an average, no more than a moderate number.
