I rented a video of "piano teacher" excluding what was written in the video box. Cinemas winning films at the Cannes are usually very good or very bad because I have some trepidation. Unfortunately, this is the second category. Nearly one quarter of it I said loudly, "This film is boring." I'm talking about half way, "Where did I see this before?" <br /> Despite the fact that its literary origins, the film is essentially a reconfiguration of Robert Altman (1969), and is good, "The Cold Day Park." Although the details are clearly contradictory, Altman's work is more journalists and less character traits The two pictures are similar to the theme. There is no "new" found in this product. Everything is preceded: a character coming out of control with increasing self-destructive behavior (Aubrey Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" 1992); In an acting (near) death scene (David Kronberg's "M. Butterfly" 1993) is an unpleasant and doomed 'love' ending; Unusual wildest romantic scenes (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" 1986); And so on. So I thought that many people found this movie "shocking," "shattered," etc. The viewers feel uncomfortable, and some people are clearly successful. . However, because of lack of cinema-viewing experience, I have explained more of such reaction. See enough movies and you finally have, finally, saw it all. <br /> <br /> "I think I'll change my whole idea of ​​being a piano teacher". <br /> Technically, the cinematography without the film. There is some good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Hubper's credible performance also helps save time from waste. This is the first of Hannake's movies I have ever seen, and I want to see more of it as I belong to Ferrara: an interesting director but his genius can not make him. Rating: 4/10.
