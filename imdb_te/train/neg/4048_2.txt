Maybe not, but it's awful. Even the amazing cast cant save. OK, I admit I started off with a lot of fun but they seemed to have fallen downhill down as soon as the girls grew up those girls at home. Bill Murray is not just funny, it turned out from a quick-witted, funny guy to an arsehole who shout things out with people like street trying to be very hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV has passed away ...) and ends up as a national leader after another country has been attacked, and knows how many soldiers are there for a laugh that killed God. A good point is that the film shows the inability and inefficiency of the US Army, and they are no longer infidel and impulsive. I hated that this kind of advertising trash can really be released.
