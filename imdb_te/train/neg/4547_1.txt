Image Terrible !!! In the last few years I have seen. One of those films is the worst picture I can think of for the next three years. Thank you for answering that burning question, "What's the worst picture you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Believe me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and would be happy to see the film, but they ran the audience as we were randomized. There is a lot of story and story that is very difficult and coincidentally crippled. It is very bad that they can not spell out the nine prophecies and weave them into a story that is just fun to follow. They did not spend any time on character development and did not care if any character died. It was embarrassing one of the few people who were stuck around until the end of this boring movie. The book is very boring but enjoyed parallels you can see in daily life when reading the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and suggested that I did not see it if you wanted to continue the book close to your heart. Do not see this movie. Trust me
