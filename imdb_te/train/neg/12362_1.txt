I saw this movie in New York City. The next morning I was waiting for the bus, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It's raining, and the PORT can not officially wait. So I went to the street and saw the worst picture of my life. It's so bad, I chose to watch the whole movie, and then I did not see it bad yet. Year 69, so call me silly. I can not cope with it because I'm only one .........
