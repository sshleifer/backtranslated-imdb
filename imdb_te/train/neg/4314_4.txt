<br /> <br /> Host Steve Martin is his most attractive man: "I'm Teamsters Michael Moore in his trunk <br /> <br /> Surprise winners: No one is Adrian Brody Down for Best Actor (true appreciation) ) Or the best director Roman Polanski (the original jerce and bous) but they won <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony was very bad but surprisingly low And I Return (Felicheep is much better), but BBC coverage Jonathan Ross takes rounds of his Sinfactic members and they are happy at any time.But when I hear coverage for British TV I connect with Barry Norman and Mark Kermode Maybe   ు, కానీ బదులుగా జామీ థేక్స్టన్ మరియు షారన్ ఓస్బోర్న్లతో మేము ముగిసింది! బ్రిటిష్ TV చలనచిత్ర విమర్శకుల కోసం నిరాశకు గురైనట్లయితే (స్పష్టంగా వారు) నేను ఖచ్చితంగా ఉన్నాను బాబ్ మరియు మూవీ థియో రాబర్ట్సన్ రెండూ విజేతలకు మరియు ఓడిపోయినవారిపై తమ నిజాయితీ అభిప్రాయాలను ఇవ్వడానికి LA కి వెళ్ళిపోతారు. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is not too bad, but he's not Steve Martin if the seats kept in the city appeared to resemble a sports hall! There is not a very attractive field in my opinion. The main problem I had at the ceremony, the "little" Oscar was given to the winners sitting in their seats! The best "animated short" or "best costume" award is awarded as the best film or best director, as the "Minor" Oscar is not. All winners should be allowed to change to the podium. Any group of academic snob are becoming an academy and if this format is not insulting and is not a surprise, it may be the worst of history in history. <br /> <br /> The best supporting actress - Cate Blanchett. <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman <br /> <br /> Free Nun is one of the most popular actors in the United States. <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Fox. Night is a very predictable award. <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swanch. Annette Benning was surprised by the idea that everyone thought he was going to get into academic politics, but it succeeded Swank and gave the best speech at night. <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Everyone knows that Scorsese is going to be awarded to everyone, he has never been able to win. <br /> <br /> I am really happy about this because he did not deserve it for a taxi driver, rugging bull or goodfellows. <br /> Best Picture - Million Dollar Baby. AVIATOR's Hollywood friendly plot makes it a dead end for the best movie while everyone thinks that since another big surprise academy has been split into the best director and best movie awards, however, I think the MDB's controversial thing is that the voters are <br /> <br /> Perhaps this year voters decided to ignore Oscar politics And they have to give genuine awards to people who deserve something that they have done in the past, I mean a beautiful clock gem hit the felicity of the gem! And the academy can vote with their heads instead of their hearts
