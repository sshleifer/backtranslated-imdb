First, when I'm not an expert, I think the manner in which the trial was conducted insults your intellect. First, the prosecution did not actually prove that the 'simplified practice' actually works. The inquiry is irresponsible for both (because they can get an appeal) and this is not acting for acting. As another commentator suggests, the simplified practice proved to be false. Secondly, they used Terry as a translator with personal interest and to prove that it was just stupid in the trial. If the court allows him to give evidence, they have brought someone neutral, otherwise they are just asking for appeal. Thirdly, he never asked specific questions through the prosecution (birthdays, incident details, etc.) and did not answer when he asked for specific questions like defense. This is a proper doubt or not, and a competent lawyer should be acquitted. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, autism for the parental pressure of the child, but the trial makes this film completely unreliable.
