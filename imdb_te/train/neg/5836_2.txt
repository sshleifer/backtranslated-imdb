This mess of political conspiracy and murders comes from pen of Richard Kondan (The Manchurian Candidate 1962). The story, almost comic book is hard to swallow in fashion. All actors think, this poor effort is not entirely a cast and crew's fault: the novel is filled with the same low-comings. Sometimes the story mocks in a more honest work in the "Manchurian candidate". All counts are a disappointment.
