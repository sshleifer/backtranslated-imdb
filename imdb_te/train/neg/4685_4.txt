Until the last few minutes of the film, I would have given the score 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is terrible and "Hollywood", which completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Captain, Jean Hockman, his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch dates. The problem is to launch the captain and the 1st officer simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman was determined to launch, and eventually Washington retained the results in a weapon rebellion. Eventually, the error was found and the missiles were not launched. Cool. However, there is a piece that says there is no truth here. They go back to Earth and go to a review board, stir up arms to Washington and Hawkman (who spend half of the film trying to kill each other) and all the buddy's buddy! Ah! It's very memorable for me to make a worthy film.
