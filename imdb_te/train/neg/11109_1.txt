I'm surprised to get this movie this film! I have not seen a bad movie for years. Omg It's a bad movie. Publish, it is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes. If you do not like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween (2007) this is 10 time worse. <br /> <br /> The script is so terrible that I can not tell you about acting. <br /> Here comes the spoilers. <br /> This story is about the killing of all the people in the brain. We are talking about thousands of murders and nobody gets notice. The real people are simply missing. And there's a good man trying to solve the mystery (we do not have any mystery because we know from the bad man) and no one will ever believe him! What a surprise! In the end he kills the butcher clothes and struggles with butcher butcher!
