The film is also big in the form of typical fare derived by Bollywood. The performances are terrible. Boman Irani, who is always shining, goes to the OTT as a villain. The sound track is not memorable. And despite hard effort, male leads do not manage "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is capable of producing very good projects while Fareed Khan looks at a similar fare. But this lifelessness is also for his limited capabilities as an actor. Isha Deol and Amrita Rao are terrified of the wrong written clich√©s. It is time for Indra Kumar to retain his directorial hat. He always wonders another kind of glasses somewhere. Now the future of Hindi films is in good hands. Overall, stay away from celluloid waste.
