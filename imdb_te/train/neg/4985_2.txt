In 1993, "visitors" were a huge success in France. So, in this order is mandatory and unfortunately, this array is one of the greatest ever done. <br /> It is a picture that does not carry out his promises. In fact, it is supposed to tell a unique story. Jean Reno should go back to the middle ages of the Middle Ages in the twentieth century, so that it can usually follow its course. Clevelier in the twentieth century's world is fully sensed, and in the Middles' eras he is hard to recover ... Instead, the film follows several major stories, plot. Consequently, the film is sometimes cumbersome, sometimes confused. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from almost all actors' performance. Reno and Clivere come into the trap of the first chance they escape: they are up and down. Then why was Jean-Marie Poyre, a film producer, involved in a male lead role with Muriel Robin? He did wrong because he seemed to be mistaken and totally pitiful. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film will have some good moments with effective hypocrisy, but it is often obscenity and easy. Some scenes and dialogs are influenced. It carries the poorest back elements that have achieved the success of the first film because it is also empty. <br /> <br /> A young girl asks Reno to be a close relative of her family and not participate in her wedding. <br /> <br /> A laborious and frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is interesting commercially? <br /> <br />
