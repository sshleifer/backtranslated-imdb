I am surprised how this film really got with the 1984 film "Bachelor Party" starring Tom Hanks. Is not this film itself an official sequel? <br /> <br /> This film is not good or funny for this comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film actually has some good, original and funny moments. <br /> There is actually a much smaller story and a naked breast image than the script pages. Finally wait for things to start. There is a major plot line in nowhere but a terribly unreal and it feels more like if it's something that is so poorly executed in the picture. I guess there is a message and a moral story somewhere, but this film is again pretty terrible and does not work properly in the film. <br /> <br /> It is mainly a typical teenage comedy heroine who has more humorous and tasteful teens than the main characters, sexually jokes and nudity. <br /> <br /> This film will make many bad jokes. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered. <br /> <br />
