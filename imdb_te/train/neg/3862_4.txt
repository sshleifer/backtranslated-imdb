I see. A couple of laughs, but there is nothing to write home. He saw Jason Lee that he was enjoying it. (Length) DVD Gag reel has almost nothing to do with ludicrous laughter. Selma Blair seemed to punch the clock on time, but then again, her character was considered a stick in the mud, so I guess "well" Jim Brolin surprisingly funny. (Marrying Babes is not a picnic.) Soundtrack hip and eccletic. Julia Styles's father (ridiculous) starring Larry Miller, 10 Things I Hate About You Fanny. He is great, but the film's best feature is the cast of Julia Styles. I could spend two hours looking at her fold laundry, and I feel like I did.
