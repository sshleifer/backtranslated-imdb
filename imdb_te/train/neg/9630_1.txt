I can understand that Ben Stiller is going to get out of films or get out of this year, but maybe he's not about quality and size. <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is one of the worst performances of the year, which has the rank and rank. Stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. He is undoubtedly having a humorous talent, but he needs to find another schtick and take a break, which means it's actually funny. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, because it is good and acts as a good actress as a good actress. She has a proud career as she plays "The Good Girl" (in which she is wonderful) and "Along cam poly". <br /> <p> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the limp stuff she's doing, but it's a disappointing job for any actress. There is nothing funny in this awful movie, with little exceptions like Reuben's owner Sandy, Reuben's owner Stan and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Other supporting roles, including Debra Messing, such as Lassa and Hank Azaria, were also hurt. <br /> <br /> The campus of "Came Polly" is sure to promise. Unfortunately, instead of comic, instead of forgiving, you need an author who can convert to a good comedy.
