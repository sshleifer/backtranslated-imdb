The whole picture is entirely the worst performance from Robert Duvall, as William Buckley. His guarantee dramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this deliberate scene was stolen or accidentally, but I only remember from a really unforgettable film. An example of this is not to be seen in every amateur acting class. Thanks to God, Duvall went to bigger and better things and tried to influence the Sanskrit accent. He is a good actor but it's about it. Class is very good. His performance is mute and important.
