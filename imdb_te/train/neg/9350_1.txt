This film is terrible. The first half hour is like a lot ... well, apologizing for lack of articulation, but it's just a bad version of a clockwork orange. The first scene was almost photocoped from the first in the Clockwork! This is a tribute to the Clockwork poster on the wall of the hero, but the "repo" is the more correct word. The film was filmed from the Kubrick classics and was filmed in the eyes of the new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when Kubrick's work is turned off, the film is much worse. As another commentator mentioned, the film's deepest motion has lowered your voice. <br /> <br /> If a true character in this film develops, maybe the main character ramblings will touch a nerve. I did not feel absolutely nothing for this person. And I am a drinker, so if someone could feel it, it seems to me. Developing the horror character, dialogue and storyline. <br /> <br /> The title of the worst part about this film. For a film called "16 Years of Alcohol", alcoholism is not a cause for the film. See the first paragraph - it's a butchering of a clockwork orange I can not get over. <br /> <br /> "A Clockwork Work Around" was "16 Years of Violence" or better. If you ignore my advice, take it anyway. Trust me
