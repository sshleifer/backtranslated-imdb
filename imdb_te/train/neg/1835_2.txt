Get started with the script. I saw more depth cartoons than "jealousy". Anytime the characters repeat what you have already seen, and the first time is not funny, it's certainly in deep trouble with a film "jealousy". It's a good idea to go with a movie based on a joke. Here's where we are going somewhere. Christopher Walken wants to forget the bomb, especially because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller reminiscent of some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting with Disaster" and "Duplexx". Make sure "jealousy" is not a black comedy. Double meanings are just total nonsense. In the case of the matter, it stinks, because "jealousy" deserves to have a lower rating. - MERK
