Now for the truth, its very weak storyline - Walt Disney's total worst image. When Robinson appeared, there were films in places where I saw how bad it was. It's like the "Alice in the fairy" gone wrong! It feels like they are small on some ideas with some crazy garbage cloth to try and get away with it - and they do not. After that, I sat down for the finish. My brother lost half way of interest and was confused by the story. If the characters are weak and if you look at the Robinsons end up, you want to finish. Forget it a picture, and forget it quickly. If you've got some free time, do not ruin it.
