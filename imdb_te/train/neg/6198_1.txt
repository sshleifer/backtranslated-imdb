I was very interested in starting this shy and dangerous movie. These characters are often invented young men who seem to be bored in the ocean neighborhood. Robert is an outsider but his soul is in his music. Instead of making Clay Robert into a freak, he embarks on a journey of marijuana and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong horde. Clay believes in "Reaper Madness" and Robert ends up killing the film as a rapist. This is a miracle that the young director has experience in real life. Nobody can save the poor Robert. Clay leaves us the message that young British men do not control. Iraqi insurgents have a very incomplete link; During reckless graphic rape we are subject to explosions and war films. The male peer group has led to its limits of terrorism. Young bombers in London are parallel to Clay's hated description of modern men. Clay suggests that men can not help themselves without terrible acts of violence. It is a miracle that allows movies to be invested in the British film industry, which supports such controversial campaigns, and we are still moving in recent attacks in London. This clay is the first film, I will be delighted if it is his last.
