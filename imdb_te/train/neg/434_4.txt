<br /> When one of the movies receives his own documentary when one of Jehovah's Witnesses refuses? Or anything for that matter - someone's time to get their own. However, even though Paris Hilton (I'm not very difficult to know) is very intelligent, Zizek's mouth has a lot to do with her, just a different kind. He combines the worst from his professional world: psychological analysis and philosophy. Two sections conveniently provide expert b * lls *** osopher to create profitable theories, connecting the wedge and almost coincidences without a beginning or end, can only love one mother who connects the English language abuse process by creating a semantic. For example: There are three major Marks brothers, so they are a "great" idea to connect with three levels of human consciousness, id, ego and super ego. I did not play clip from "snowhit" and I am surprised by a similarity between seven dwarfs and seven levels of Guahana (Massellame Hell). <br /> <br /> It is like the premiere of Schumacher's "Number 23": Play with long numbers and connect with the ancient Greeks with Prince Dies, whatever may come with the doctrine you want. , TPGTC has a fun factor: The mood of introductory analysis as a hawk looking at a raving crazy cloth is quite fun though. Why do you see the "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other magical drama when you have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like seeing a fun train wrecked. <br /> If one or both occasions he is almost funny. This idea was given to Idiotic films like "Bird's", which is why this credit is probably the fat creator who laughs in his grave. The raw fact is that many movies have zero intellectual value, and some intellectuals do not need to draw a map to understand the spy. Except for a complete idiot. Zizek understands the layers and layers in most common films. <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed a bathing hole in the "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he would not say anything about galactic black holes. How can they get out of the stars like the bathtub hole Janet League sucks in blood. Or perhaps this hole can refer to Lee's vagina, which the blood flows into it (such as menstruation), this kind of "intelligent (jaimekian) sarcasm". Speaking about this, Hitchcock really is not the distracted, distant garbage of his movies, if they keep the idea for each scene (and the script). The similarities of these bathtub holes are to show how easy it is to "better, deeper meanings". <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Zizek utters funny things here (unexpectedly), he works with "work to work, work well" with Anthony Perkins Cleaning of Anthony Perkins is one of the most absurd ideas when cleaning. Do not laugh ... Hitchcock or "Psycho" The writer also worked well for the Perkins - not even obscure this view that the blood-stained toilet can be cleaned - the scene. <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's early ideas on Tarkovsky's awesome "Solaris", but he is a dog towards its plastic bone towards Zizek's attitude towards logic. "I want to play with it all day!" Logic has its rules, and does not need to be raped - at least publicly - with his will. He is the logic, proof, general-meaning, and the cause of enemies or just trail; To avoid feelings, distorted to the end-goal, or simply die out. Zizek LSD-slippery hippie, and all his favorite films are his own personal "2001". <br /> <br /> Zizek focuses on two of the most overrated directors - if any - such as Hitchcock and Lynch will only reduce his already low credibility. I was surprised to see D'Palma more prominent; Another lame director who wrote these useless scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lazych's incomprehensible "Last Highway". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Zizek is the only person , He also runs "bleedin clear", like all "social scientists" (an antagonist), to describe his most common "experiments" (if he spit up) and sometimes linguistically complicated blankets.After all, sociology is correct It works in the same way: It is true that we have heard all the things we know, but already in an immaculate way - it fools more listeners who are more disrespectful. <Br "I suddenly look out for men in white suits and a loonie-suit him up Half of the strap was expecting ... <br /> Slavoj Zizek: Soon a kid <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
