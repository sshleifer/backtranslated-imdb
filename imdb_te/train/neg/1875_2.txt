First, I really liked Henry Fool, which put me in a very small pool in the movie. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on screen today. But this film is a complete mockery. Hart and those actors talk extra about the film - full of pride, and the nonsense of star wars - stomach-swinging. It is marked by a maximum of HDNET. The true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Most likely I think Hall is spoiled by Henry Fool forever. <br /> Remember the hall, some people may pick up some people ... etc. The director does not have any place today. Sadly, it is a pure example of the lesson learned in the adaptation film. The story must be exciting and agile, or its box office hopes are really blurry. Never mind good story. For actors, it seems to be working on a straight jet. <br /> <br /> The score is, I believe in Hart's belief, tastier. Drum hits with all the dialogue walking. <br /> When I see the trailer, oh, they're trying to grab a new audience. But really this ridiculous ride. I'm happy to ruin this movie for you, but it's done. It was dirty. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long lived Henry Fool.
