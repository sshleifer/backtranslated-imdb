Chris Rock, who is clearly disappointed for a cozy star-vehicle, crosses his appeal to the white and main black audience, updates the hit 1978 comedy "Heaven Can Weight" with an urban agenda. He plays the role of a struggling comedian involved in a car accident that has quickly removed his soul from his soul - as a result, his angels must identify him with another body, and only with a white businessman. Rock's eye is in the box office when it is portrayed as a movie and sentiment as "Heaven Ken Wait" (which is definitely the most hilarious corporate action of Hollywood players). Why end up with an Evening at Apollo Why fight for something better or more memorable than a silly rebirth comedy? What a wonderful credible cast (typically reliable Regina King, excellent Mark Audi, Wanda Sikes, Yujen Levy, and the wonderful Frankie Fyson) can be done, but the rock is not as embarrassing and perfectly clear throughout. **** from * 1/2
