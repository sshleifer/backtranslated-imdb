The first scene in 'Problem Child' includes a baby in a nun's nun. For this film, it's witty. An evil, average enthusiastic 'comedy', which is believed to be at most levels. John Ritter was a father, a father who took child from hell, and a note of respect for him to honor him, continued the assassination of the annoying appearance and active humor. And what's hell's Jack Warden in this mess? The film is a very unpleasant experience, with the disadvantage of efforts to pardon Dennis Dugan, directed by Dennis Dugan. But never mind that all. Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and incompatible media actor who hit the screen on the whole thing? I believe that you like to move him in the mouth.
