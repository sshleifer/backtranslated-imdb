In fact it came to stop. Do not make me wrong, love the movies of evil monsters. But this is way too boring, regardless of pathetic music that never leads you anywhere. That moment, the clich is very clear when the actress is very teeth and she is associated with an animal. This film is entirely interesting to the cover of the DVD. Expect a monster monster from the cover, but you get this beautiful not as big as electric eels you can imagine. Yet another review went to see another movie called The Killer Rites. Deep shock is really the worst, it's a big shame to consider the fact that it looks very high budget.
