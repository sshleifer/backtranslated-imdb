I often do not hand them to "them", but if this kind of attention is always appropriate film, it's "gas!" <br /> <br /> This is the self-deprecating garbage that has reached some of the atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and flatly flat on its face. <br /> I'm going to Corman - the same plot in the original film version of Malkommermourmine and Elliott Gould, M * A * S * H ​​- the same plot ("Wives" - IMDb, http: // www. see here on imdb.com) attempted to reproduce the role of Gould's death. / Title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould "gas!" But there is not much. <br /> "Gas!" What's wrong with that? What not? No one can really play on the level of junior high school theatrics. Product values ​​are stink. Getting someone else here is the most renowned reproducible headlights in the car, and the lack of information is more than that. <br /> <br /> In this film, it does not ignore anything. <br /> "Gas!" In fact, let me sleep. It's not a precaution for insomnia, but really close. Cinematic Sleep Induction Scale, "Gas!" George Clooney's remake of "Last Year at Merenbad" and "Solaris" (which Mossmile was more frustrating than originally disappeared in the studio with the idea of ​​putting the audience's attention through a fairly compilation). <br /> <br /> Jusus editing decimated "gas!" About twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> Some images are very bad, they are worth looking anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not surprisingly bad.
