This "movie" is the end of everything that is bad about the modern film. Unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping / jumping / Somersents, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialog ... basically no need. (This is a word, well, it was found by the robot) <br /> <br /> What happened to the practicality? <br /> <br /> Card swipe at the coffee shop is the only tool to show a combination of futuristic and realistic performance (car garage, skinny spray). <br /> Has women been honored? (Ie Smith's role does nothing, but damages the doctor better, and she still "wants", where I am, is not good brilliance and admiration or simple field) /> <br /> What happened to a detective? Smith did nothing, but complained to others, was sorry for her and sorry for her, and when she told something that she raised an idea, he was out of sight. It's such a slum way to get the story from point B-C-D-It ... it's once perfect, but not many times in a row. <br /> <br /> "I'm snoring and do not tell you joke? Two times in the same scene?" <br /> <br /> There are only two scenes in Shia LaBeouf (Kid) in the picture, only A tool to encourage some meaningful and rescue scenes to the smaller parts of a picture, we know that A-he knows we can spoil women and B-he knows Smith. ..... <br /> <br /> What happened to Heroes? Let's forget that all people, women and children are attacked by robots everywhere and are only selfish. I have my opinion, I have a acquaintance and he had to ramp up his bike in the air, showing that the doctor could reach the same distance in a moment on foot. <br /> <br /> "I'm so stuck in the film for a long time. <br /> <br /> "Budget Action Images:" You Will Die "
