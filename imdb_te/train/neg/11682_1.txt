Not now? Looking at all the good things Danzell, Clive and Jodi did, the film has always been more than a terrible die hard / hystist movie copycatcat. There are only unpredictable movements to be a couple of jokes, no absolutely unpredictable turns, honesty, because both the director and the editor make stupid mistakes, it is an insult for them and wasting time for us. That's why they're safe on earth, hell rebe and they know that diamonds are in a separate cell on Earth, it's just my day, but it's spike ask us to take things so much that we do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... Relax and enjoy another studio contract film ...
