Wow, the unusual thing about this episode is the price of houses 40 years ago. I'll pretend that I'm not a fan of the stories I have said. Story / actors / etc. Their salt is valuable, reminding me of a large amount of narrative without being read, a cuff off-minded person and a dependent on telepromptors. The mental disorder is tedious and boring, but some kind of enjoy that kind of, it's not just my cup o tea.

There were small things like Peugeot's house, a seven-half-circle, and he kept his car in a standing tree as he was not seen on the road or on the property. She slips into the driveway as she pulls into the driveway (for the 100th time) who is sure who is 2 guys who look at the 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the farewell?

No loose ends, nothing can be explained or canceled. Most people do not notice, many have already changed the channel or are finally shut down.
