<br /> <br /> The only purpose of this film is to show love in a number of ways. <br /> Each story is only a few minutes, so the characters are developing and there is almost no plot. A plot is just a sketch idea. The writer attempted to build a turnaround that was intended to surprise the viewer. However, it did not work because the characters or the "jokes" could not seem to be just silly. <br /> <br /> Film about love can not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or more, I do not know and I do not care.
