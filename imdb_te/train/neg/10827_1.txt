This prestigious film suffers greatly from the great illusions of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Better material (Altman's "Nashville", loumitt's "network"), the elephant takes longer to get this garbage. Do not help things that mislead the gates (in the middle of an awkward music, a Bible plague) along the way. There is no unparalleled level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Mackie, whose character and storyline can be completely removed altogether; Julianne Moore, for her incredible interest. And how many times should we look at John C. Reilly's Sad Saw Shtick ("Chicago" and "Hours" enough?) Tom Cruise falls well by comparison ?? His missionist, foul-mouthedhead holy roller is entertaining. Foul notes stated that the script "F" was loaded with bombs, and they lost their effect at any time. Do not even talk about that awful soundtrack, which is shocking and annoying by Amy Mann. The beginning of the film troubled me, the expansion of a radical number beginning with her "One," I targeted the handwriting on the wall and saved me for another three hours, at which time I went to hell. A redemptive feature that I do not see in other reviews, by Melora Walters, unknown to the Claude character, is the best performer in the bunch at the coke foyend bent on the self-annihilation. Her loyalty has so far surpassed everyone. The film is also very serious and does not know when it will end.
