The good intentions of the gravitational and filmmakers of the subject, the main character of Bronson Green's flaws to create a film that deals with white prominence, makes the New York actor easily L.A. Fanny, which makes the story intense. The green, Los Angeles casting agents continually rejected (ie 80s big, blonde, and much more New York when looking for a dumb), where he was ready to mislead his images. Unfortunately, the new hair color and peaceful "surfer" attitude has a chance for him to act with Jericho's purse, which subscribe to the Aryan White's white teaching. Green likes to easily forget his past, and he turns back to his ten year old boyfriend, especially the new representative of the church. It does not make any sense, our protagonist is initially the principle. This sudden and radical change in the character is capable of combating villains with a sudden reversion in the form of hardened, Denoir-engaging (his taxi driver's character). <br /> <br /> The other characters are also very annoying and easy to find them. The mental distinction of the church leader, self-interested actress girlfriend (he is the first girlfriend Bronson when in LA), and the character's new blonde girlfriend does not develop much, she is, for the most part, a walking talking vacuum. We need to take care of them in silly moments, in which some random forces draw imaginations about the characters. But none of them is really developed. <br /> <br /> The other problem with the film is the time that God is part of a very small task. Concerns that introduce characters at the very beginning, later, L.A. Brinson's difficulties appear to be frustrating from the acting scene and continuous refusal. <br /> <br /> As a result, he has at least 30 minutes of wasted film at least 30 minutes, as he has agreed, changing his form and personality. <br /> <br /> The racist horrors behind racism attract attention, which is not enough reliability.
