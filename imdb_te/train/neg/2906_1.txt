- Might have spoilers ... But trust me, this movie is exactly like starting from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I will follow the high expectations in this film. This is my own mistake. I've put more stock on Steve Karel record till date. 40-year-old Virgo ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The Office. And I've also seen a 7.5 user rating before the IMDb erroneous error and the image. It was a very good predictor in the past, but there was definitely some delay. Last time I was embarrassed and it was difficult to see "blue steel" in the movie in 1990. <br /> <br /> The film reached its fullest starting point. The script is a soft material. All around the horror writing. "The murderer of love"? "Is love a potential"? Whoever wrote this trash from the same pain that the author (s) of American Beauty has been trying to make it very difficult. The whole film is filmed by thrice company 's moments, such as a terrible and contrived shower scene. Or a meaningless / confusing aerobics scene. Or awful laundry room scenery. When you think about something serious and / or happening true, they will toss in one of these horrible moments. <br /> What's with Karel's character? Does the person meet some lame at a bookstore and suddenly be the subject of love? Edurkondamu. Their conversation sucks. They should both tell their farewell after a few minutes. When you look at the movie, look closely to the early conversation .... Karel's character tries to say something randomly and un-funny (I'm the perfect line "I'm a kid at this time"), but both have a lot of coffee to get out of their noses Laughing loudly. The actors saw that they were laughing to see why they were doing the work they were doing. <br /> <br /> Back to IMDb ... Place a promotional team of a movie from this site that you guys need to figure out a way out. I know I'm impossible, but the first 20 or more ratings / reviews were posted at the age of 12 or designated by the studio. Family Stone's Rating Check ... If a 5 is between, this has definitely got a 2 ... and it's pushing.
