The film has traditionally failed to provide a new version of the genre that traditionally portrays the cultural romance that enters politics in the middle of the 20th century / British modernity and the oldest but honest and true Indians in the mid-20th century. Good. <br /> <br /> Without a plot of the plot, the act is pedestrian and bi-dimensional, and directed rather than dramatic play. <br /> <br /> This story actually needs to be flashed and certainly the characters and narrative are more depth It takes another half an hour of screen time to give up and some investor to the viewer <br /> <br /> All in all, Oh and Linus Roache just can not make tragedy - cross-eyed with emotional pain just does not work for me!
