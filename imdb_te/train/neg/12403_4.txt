Andy Hardy Mittens Debutin (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and shows the inevitable direction of it. The characters were in front and center of Andy Hart (Mickey Rooney) and Judge Hardy (Louis Stone). The remaining cast punch a lot of clock and collects their checks. <br /> <br /> In this series, Lewis Stone continues to play the role of Juda Hardy with a lot of sympathy. The rest of the cast will be less professional and professional, though it may be less and less. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney did not continue his role, because there was no technology. The reaction to Andy's condition is naive and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> After returning to World War II as a celebrity in Love Longings in Andy Hurdy (1946), he is the youngest child to respond to any kind of 'teapot tempest'. <br /> The picture is clearly illustrated. ANDY receives itself in many descriptive situations, with a simple explanation. This screenwriting device is called 'idiot platform'. Practicing poor writing scene. Perhaps it was Mikey Rooney's fault, director and writer. Most often George B. Sitzz has directed too much and Rooney's violation requires a lot of control. You are the only US to see our overview of the whole series. (1937).
