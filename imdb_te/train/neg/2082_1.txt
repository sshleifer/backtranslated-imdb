No waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - seeing the previews and thinking of it may be "funny". Wrong! This image is 90 minutes long. Actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can not come out. The jokes are weak and tired, and Wilson's nude can not even redeem part of the film. No special effects ..... not. I just half thought to see socks and wires holding Uma in her sights. They cover everything with a sophisticated whirlpool, which is obscured when the speed-bullet flying or the lack of accurate identifiable effects of the superhero's speed - hides the terrific effects very well. Wilson's sidekick does not have a chemistry for a man and Wilson Uma or his office colleagues. Sex scenes are not sexy and funny scenes are not funny. I guess I'm far from these actors. Nobody really sympathetic to the characters, so I ended up not caring a flying fig about what they were doing. Only memorable performances are children who have played the ladies Bedla and G-Girl - at least some chemistry. Overall, a super stingco film - I can not even rent a rental - it still gets a waste of money!
