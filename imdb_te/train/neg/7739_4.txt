Do you remember when Harrison Ford became the biggest actor in Hollywood for making great movies? <br /> <br /> "Hollywood Homicide" is not terrible, it is a simple and surprisingly boring bubble film. It's not particularly funny and it is a comedy that's not particularly an action movie that is not exciting. <br /> <br /> Ford seems to be enjoying himself at least in the past few projects, and he is able to take the film a lot of time. <br /> <br /> "Hollywood Homeside" is a reasonably amusing diversion, but it's just not enough, Hartnett is right, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford. Take Ford, it's not even.
