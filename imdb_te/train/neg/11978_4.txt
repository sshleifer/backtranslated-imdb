I would say that I am a little insulting for this 'cowboys king'; Created in 1948, the film got a decade of Roy Rogers' early films in which he had a major role. Roy's role comes as a bit clueless in the film along with his co-star Jane Froze, who transformed the faith between Roy and Robert Livingstone and played the role of the main evil guy Bill Reagan. The entire story appears to be missed with an amusing hour or beyond. To say that the man who was lynched was coming to midnight, for example, is the myth of the Hangman's hotel. With Andy Dwyn in the role of cookie bultfincher, the story is expected to get a little mileage of the story set. Instead, there are some convoluted trials that are nice if you are a Boyer Boy. It is upstaged by a nest that nothing is about getting a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gympiece who relies on injured poor old Genevieve, getting more screen time than a trigger of the deal as 'attractive horse in movies'. And then you are replacing the Suns of Pony's Forward Wilderness and his Riders of Purple Sage Bob Nolan and your Music Intermediate. I do not know about you, but it's already half way in the picture and I'm still looking for Pat Brady - oh well! <br /> <br /> If there is still interest, there is still a very interesting topic here, and it has become the athletic duty of Trigger's trigger while running from bad guys. <br /> <br /> Okay, it could be a stunt double, but I did not see in the hundreds of Westerns beforehand. <br /> <br /> Jane Ferrejee has other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame. In "California Stars", she was seen as the cousin of Andy Davin, named Caroline Bullfinger. You never quite persuaded towards what she'll do in this story, since she starts pretending to be someone she's not, and winds towards almost accidental good guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the older Laurel and Hardy movies I was surprised to see James Finlayson as the sheriff of SinTown. I admire some of the comedy reliefs that I have written in his role, but it's all loved. I had to be surprised, when it was all over, and why he and old Wonderpool (Charlie Coleman) were injured in a mine shaft with a cookie when there was no reason. One way to close that I was expecting was that I thought it was going to the rest of the picture. <br /> <br /> I hate this kind of hard work, but if you see Roy Rogers flick, you know that this is not one of his best efforts. <br /> Tell the santone - the same place where you grew up as a Sin City?
