<br /> The 50-minute episode of Outer Limits. Do not like items like the very superfluous material like the escape from the Phantom of the Opera and the main evil guy. The whole 'Night of Living Dead' sequence is very crazy and very unnecessary. After all, if anyone wants to be punished for the sins of the dead, do you remember to kill each other again?
