I'm a big fan of Fred McMarrie and Carol Lambert. And, along with them, Charles Butterworth (the most uplifting assistant actor) in the film ... so why am I not particularly enjoying it! Well, despite being a good cast, this is one of the "pictures" I wrote poorly and most clicked. For spending talent and money spent on the film, it is surprising how much the writing is a splash-shadow. I know that after the film began in the film, I was very bad in the movie, I guess exactly what happened - I was always right! And it's not because I'm not the sort of "movie monk", but because no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, the film looks like a tall string of just one cleais! Furthermore, Fred and Carroll are not as bad as painting, but I'm still a little bit bored, but it's real to the meeting and eventually she's running. Uggh! <br /> If there is a very tired and clich√© script, there is more suspicion in the lassi film ("Some people are about posing as a lash at the end of the fred film, whether he will bring people to save Timim or he'll dangling from Timothy?" It's pretty cool - it's very believable and does not seem to have been killed or slept in days Charles Butterworth's "Livestock" provided some minor comedy movements, but the film did not seem to be a bit different than the "B film", an insult, ... it could be very good.
