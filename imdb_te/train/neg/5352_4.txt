Honey, I'm not a big dealer and famous for Shark the Kids franchise. I love Honey, and at a very young age I shrink the children. It has the original story and such wonderful plot! The sets were very exciting and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Honey now, I blamed the kid is pretty stupid, I thought they would go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> In general, Adam is slightly higher and the mother is going to leave their husbands with their children to leave. But when Wayne's favorite item threatens for the worst, he keep short it, but he and his brother get in the way. <br /> When the wives have forgotten to give their son a few medals, they have left the children at home. <br /> <br /> The plot is silly, and this is a family picture that some might want to get a kick. Original Honey, I Shark the Kids is the best, I think everyone will agree. The third is not so bad, I would recommend this honey at least, I kid up the cinema, which was at least a bit fun. <br /> <br />
