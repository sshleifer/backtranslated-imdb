I believe how bad this film is. I also suggested a "movie". Acting flat, editing is terrible and the plot did not answer many important questions. On the premise, if oddly: OK: a small group of aliens are living in the US and are trying to slowly take humanity. But it degrades rapidly from there. How would a "man" convince them to accept an alien as his wife to require foreigners-human hybrid? They show a larvae alien but never show what it is. They produce a perfect looking skin on an industrial scale that includes a plastic surgeon. They prophesied with teeth and throw in a huge alien monster. The end is very painful to see. I'm more disappointed that Bruce Boxliever did nothing in this regard. How could he say a huge alien monster with teeth, a straight face "Son of a B * TCH get him away from him"? It has fallen far from his Babylon. Avoid all these costs.
