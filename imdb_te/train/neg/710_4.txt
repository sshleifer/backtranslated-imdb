I am interested in reading Rice's novel, becoming the most energetic figure with the story and the story of its heart-based characters based on historical facts. <br /> <br /> However, I'm just apologized to this deadly adaptation. The cast did not rely on physical performance, rather than acting (with a clear exception to Peter Gallagher, who was unable to move out of a black paper or wet paper bag). The frustrating and contradictory efforts of the actors who influence the French voice are fun but not entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is a warning to fans of this novel - stay away from this.
