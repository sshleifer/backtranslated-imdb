It's hard to criticize this story because I do not like the story and nothing good has saved. "Maximize Arizona" with an average streak. Acting is going on, but Jennifer Tillley is usually at the top of the "difficulties" and a satirical DMV employee (usually not enough to make this a good camp). The rest of the cast is added to the pressure of their eyebrows or continuously cut down from the stress of a frustrated exercise. Just a few hours of the film's true humiliation. Daryl Hannah is very hard to understand in the movie. I wish I could tell you how it ended but I forgot and walked out.
