This thrown fragile thing adds to the most ridiculous scenes together and finally it's a laugh riot of absolute pleasure. The premise is very bad (which is very often in Dullewood), but it enters La Lawland in the hands of this written author. <br /> <br /> Loew is in prison serving for Deu, who killed his mistress. Let's see him we have nightmares, and he's real bad about that. Then his cell mate will wear himself. Or he? Lowve has some suspicions, but quickly falls on them. His suspicions are very weak, the bad guys are nothing to worry about. So why are they killed? Ah, this story can be interesting. It drops rails, and decides to get away insulting attention to the next numb hour audience once it is off the rails. <br /> <br /> I do not remember anything. What is irrationality, but think about the ending. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on a train. That tape is their boss, and nail them because they want the tape he has. So the train comes with 3 cops, guns drawn and ready to save Lowe. Kill bad guys, cops before and after half passengers ... continue to chase Lowe to get the tape. Hello !!!! People will get you into deep doodo, hell with 3 cops killing tape. And as they were not openly witnesses, they were shooting at the mall, and eventually holding Loew, the evil man still tape!
