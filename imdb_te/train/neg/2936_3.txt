I was very surprised by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I saw a couple of foreign films and looked forward to three in a row, but it was not. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. If anything, there is not a plot high. I do not necessarily need a picture, but it's something entertaining or needing me to come up with. Although it is very small, it's the best thing I can say. Sure, there are moments, but some moments easily get thinned by 97 minutes slowly. I do not understand the high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
