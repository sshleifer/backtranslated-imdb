I'm excited to see one of my favorite TV shows. The Universal Trademark looks at me with the newly introduced title and theme song, and still impresses me. Computer animation on some visuals, such as a visual title name "The Jetsons" or Size View, is a spaceship approaching an amusement park and much more. Until finally until then ... I can not believe my eyes !!!! Lucky I had to forget all I saw. Songs by Tiffany and its theme song in the new arrangement are my head.Anyway, I want to see this space-age family (even the Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic computer design like Toy Story or Bug life. Hanna-Barbera is my opinion.
