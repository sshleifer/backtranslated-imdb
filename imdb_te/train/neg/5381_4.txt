Four Eyed monsters are associated with a cowardly, reclusive videographer and an equally broken battered artist, both living in Big Apple and develop improbable romances with the help of the Internet dating site. It is not very unusual for themselves, but the method of their conversation. <br /> <br /> The film's creator's (Arin Krumly & Susan Buiss) is based on his own relationship, writing and directing the main characters as well. <br /> <br /> With the elements of Avant-Garde, Anti-Platru, and Docudrama, the film has a separated structure between the construction and the adjacent effort. <br /> <br /> When wearing the film, the couple once once faced the difficulties of reality and their division of the secret form and the old age will grow. Focusing on the controversial or difficulties of the relationship, the film is neither original nor sharp. <br /> <br /> This is a subset of subplot and external controversy, and the third act, which is none - it's a motto of the play that leads somewhere. <br /> What is more aggravating? An accidental ending and unsatisfying end to the film's descent from the reality of the story is complete. <br /> <br /> In a note note, the film has beautiful animation and a clear and moving soundtrack, but as always, look at the movie and decide for yourself.
