The film story is not very strong in all the holes. If you do not reach it as a car image is not bad, lots of these great cars. It's because I like it from the place where I shot it. I get so much pleasure seeing how the St. Cloud MN is recognizable in MN and changed from town to 89. An interesting historical part for us locals. Everyone needs some relation when a film is made here. When they came in VHS they were stolen so no copy of local video stores could be found. To get a copy from Japan on Ebay, I'm showing interest in the drag race. I do not know from director St Cloud.
