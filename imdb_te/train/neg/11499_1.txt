Gadar tells a fake story because it says a fake story. It is quite unreal and a unique Sunny Dolly film that confuses Pakistan. The objective of the film is that the aim of the film is to mislead the audience of Pakistan and its government, but not to try to hide their own defects. And all the songs and music of the movie are bad. Many Sikhs are so lovable that they are misleading. The film sucks and socks. Ameesha Patel is the only one in the film. I'll make it from 10 to 0, but it's the lowest. Please keep up to 3 hours in your life and keep watching this stupid boring movie.
