Prom Night told her of a sister named Donna (Brittany Snow), who accompanied her by a mental killer trying to kill her sister's night. By killing her family, friends, and her enemies. <br /> <br /> I first said I was tired from the pre-terrified PG-13 horror movies. You talk about the 'oh my god' and girlish stuff tired of the stupid girl dialogue. And you are really tired of the girls in relationships and then there are crying. You're tired of the last thing you have been remaking Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. <br /> <br /> The only reason for seeing 'Prom Night' is to break a smile when killing. Otherwise, do not look prom night. You do not see anyone listening to you and you see some blood on the wall. And deaths are recurring as 24/7. So they are not scary but it is bad. By the time I met the cast I think I'm ready to round up. Most girl talk, very guy talk, and our 'Oh my gosh. This is our prom '. I have a lot of fun to understand but I do not want to be seriously focused. <br /> <br /> If you put Prom Night on list of 2008 list of worst films, I'll be the first to watch other movies. I'm not going to be surprised if it will be released on DVD for cheap and fast. <br /> <br /> 10 stars from 1 star. (PS I can give) picture zero stars I will do).
