Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when he went into tired Italy in the treatment of Hollywood glamor. Originally it was a violation of the volcanic island in STROMBOLI, a brave failure that killed the career of a low elastic actress. <br /> Now it's Europe 51 and another is a futile workout. <br /> <br /> The story of Alexander KNOX is not very difficult. Their youngest son. <br /> Bergman is still attractive here but has a more appealing look as a great social lady. She could not overcome the sudden loss of her son, despite the efforts made by her kind friend. "Sometimes I'm going out of my mind," she tells her husband. A proverb in a movie without humor or grace, but inspires us where the story goes. <br /> Bergman was soon encouraged to help the poor in post-war Rome, but a social worker with poor children did not improve her emotional health and caused the plot to become worse. <br /> <br /> The overall impact of the film is that it is a project like Bergen, a project. The pace loses midway through the story, Bergman becomes more tragedy and her husband doubts that she is twice her time. She goes downhill from the story after street nurses through street term illness. <br /> Ingrid is worse off than all (her son is paying compensation) but this is not the use. <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: SNAKE PIT director Anatol Litwack told her if she wanted a neutral reality with mental illness! It will reach more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> Summary: Another disappointment of Rossellini and Bergman's bleak.
