This "movie" is a bad job! Nothing can even try and be realistic. Plot is weak, acting - painful, actors are surprised at the production of the 1st year, trying hard to work without any chance from the start. No flop! Time for money, money and audiences is what makes wastage of everything. Well, like any thriller, here are also murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine that someone killed a knife just 5 minutes ago, calm and smiled, cutting a throat was not as clean as a whistle, as it was being done by a virtual agent. भी, this murder will have to be a very brittle woman with a heavy strong male, and she cut her throat !!! Are you asking her to respect her, polite to her? The same kind of stupidity continues and the audience is leaving wondering if this means that it is a joke that turned out to be a bad one. Another big problem for the continuation: A favored hunger groom lying on the couch, getting out of the bathroom for his virgin-bride and then falling asleep (!!). Seeking guidance on scene scars, the next sequence begins with the young couple entering the reception-area! Not about last night ??? It's also time to say and write about such a low-lying "movie".
