I can say a piece of fine film making to win an Oscar award. Make a copy safe in the security vault. It is necessary to look at all the high school students in the world. <br /> <br /> Sam Merovich is a genius to thank the film world with his art, perhaps the most intellectual author / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart gherter. <br /> Where did I start with this? Ben and Arthur are full of every single millisecond! And as surprised Marawitch, Wow, as Arthur, did not go for Miss Universe. I can not stay in the nude scene. I gave the film to my brother and he called me on the phone telling me how Arthur's nude scene changed him to homosexuality. This film is completely backed by me and it's a lot of creativity.

I want to say, "Thank you Mr. Merovich, thanks for bringing this creation in the world.
