The first episode of this new show is today, and it's terrible. Shaggy does not have only a serious new voice to listen to his songs, but it is far from the original concept and animation style that is just like a 'Scooby-Doo' performance. Fred and Velma lost and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was in the dark days, where the team still solved the mystery. Instead, this new show has been battling the super villain and his followers of the type of Shaggy and Scooby James Bond. There is also a van, also known as 'The Mystery Machine' (teaser for the next episode that promises that the transformer type is not easily delivered to the robot car). How can anyone do this by taking Scooby Doo? <br /> <br /> The entire Scooby Doo gang, which speaks the right words except Show Shaggy, earns two points for two points for two scenes, and then I am very generous.
