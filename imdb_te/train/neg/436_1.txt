If you are mistreated on earth's ground, "Jesus answered, what is the question?", Then you should thank God if you never met Laconian. <br /> <br /> For the Lazen / Hegel, the word "Jesus" is perfectly rendered in this statement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The Zizek expressions in this movie are totally "real" because he says, Zizek explains, for example, three Marx Bros Ago, Suprerego and Id (Zeppo, or Gummos do you know what they did, or would they sin? That's just what it is. In Zizek's output, the culture can not be investigated, but is set as an example to his theory. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, It's just Kate and Campaign when these examples are separated from their context, without context, you can prove anything you want and you can do anything for Zizek, Lacan's answer ?? So he goes and makes it an example. For example, Jimmy Stewart is an example of Zizek's example of a spouse's fantasy position from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart is spying on Jimmy Nowak in a flower shop, but in the context of the film, this is not a vampire fantasy position at all. Stewart was deliberately driven by Novaquin. <br /> <br /> Blue velvet At the "baby f - - - wants" the absurdity of his analysis. "The woman jayissans" the horror of (the woman), lightly touching on what was thought to be true, does not want to degrade the character of Isabella rossilini, however, is in charge of the situation. This is an example of her "jouissance". Well ... maybe. But - sorry controversial - where is the evidence for this? In this film, she was partially humiliated because he had kidnapped her son. Zizek is also concerned that she has a strict sexual relationship with Kyle MacLachan. But this may be due to many things. Is not the position of the so-called female "jouissance"? According to Luckan, the female jaissance is not expressed, apart from the falonic judos, which is beyond language compilation and caterer. If this is correct, it is not an example. It means that the whole concept is non-sensitive and totally spiritual. It can only be suggested by dogs like Zizek: "You have a feminine joint! Why is this woman jausen? I said so. <br /> <br /> What examples can you really get from these pictures? Only psychology of Zizek. In a boat in Botega Bay, he also wants to be a f --rod steagier as he adds himself to his favorite films. Is this not the desire-fulfilling of the man who spent his life critical pictures? <br /> <br /> "This is not, but these pictures are not the perfect universal examples of the laws of psychoanalytic. It's very vague - how this picture illustrates how the rest of us can be, what a psychoanalyst can not completely distinguish our desire - and not easily universalizing everything. Zizek's love in making this is like: How are we supposed to do it? In this case, Zizek's desire, everything and everyone is rationalized into his wish. + But Zizek is a Leninist and they are definitely about the "thing" Does not like to talk. <br /> <br /> Pervet's guide to the movie is the love and fulfillment of the seduction of the seductress Zizek Zizek has never questioned what his intentions were when analyzing an analysis, since he had never questioned the terms of his exploration and therefore questioned his morals. Zizek is very fruitful but all his books and this movie is the same thing. He is a type of cultural theory, Henry Ford: Mass-Production and any color of black color. He is perfect for most consumers' community of today: the people are pretending to be something over and over and different from the same C-AP and the supposedly complex. People all like ready-made answers to their problems because it is said that capitalism is always offered - instead of researching things with serious investigation. This is the brain dead. <br /> <br /> Film: - As a revelation about the film and the humanity - I love the squeak's majestic comment - music in films greatly influences people's sympathy. Will it only happen to Zizek after he saw Jaws?
