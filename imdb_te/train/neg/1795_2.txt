I have the opportunity to preview the film as a test audience member, and the only thing I have put in my seat is to fill the post-screening survey. The film's biggest problem is that it lacks the main plot. Instead, it has many sub-plots competing for the screen time (too). Consequently, there is not a single role that has been adequately developed to provide any kind of audiences. What has happened to us is that the characters and the producers have failed to do what they can do to us. In fact, any sub-storyline and associated roles have been completely removed from the film. (Earned time allowed for the much needed development of sub-plots and characters.), The Hungry Bachelor's Club's plate comprised side frames and appetizers when they wanted an entry.
