Dahmer, a young chaos guy. Dummer, a tumultuous movie. <br /> <br /> These flash scratches are not confusing and boring, and the real storyline is the start and finish, the only thing that made sense in the film is the beginning of the text and the text explaining the end of the film. Inbound stuff in the picture, just boring images and waste time. <br /> We can never see the actual murders, everything is just a group of insinuations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you do not know what to do, I encourage people to waste time in the movie. <br /> <br /> It did not like a bit and I was cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> </ *
