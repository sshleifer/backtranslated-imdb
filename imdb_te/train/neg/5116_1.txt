Since I was a big football fan, I rented this movie which I thought was a good football movie. Boy, I'm wrong. This film is very religious and preachy and is really airy. This film is very good, so you can get your Christian life anytime, as great footballer! You can not become a great footballer by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and effort. You ask God what you need to do and he wants to give you something .... puh-rent. This is not true, duh. I suffered a lot of times because of this difficulty. They are only part of the cartoonist Shultz but funny that they dumb (mildly flattered Atlantic, etc.) but this movie is not really great. If I'm not a Christian, I do not particularly recommend it.
