The hero of Priyadarshan's heart is a good comedy, but the film is not actually a story but it is very funny but logical. <br /> <br /> In fact, they are not the right story <br /> Have 2 different scenes, inviting a meal and another when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half is slowly boring, <br /> <br /> The jokes are fun to hear every person's voice from the inside of the rooms <br /> <br /> Climax is confused <br /> <br /> Akshara Kumar is now her second skin, but it is her second skin, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It ' Daisy and Neethu (Neet only looks) are good in the episodes but Manoj Joshi is very good
