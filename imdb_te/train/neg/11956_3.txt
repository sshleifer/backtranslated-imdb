This movie sticks. I do not think I was acting in the film on shock value. The plot is relatively interesting, but the dialogue is super flat and acting is bland. It was a good movie. I think it's based on strange visuals. I normally handle graphic scenes and human tabs, but I thought Mike was shot for it. Just a poorly executed image. It is not entertained by watching the film unless you are disappointed with the unrealistic scenes, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-milking, parenting and sibling abuse and malignant repulsions. I think most of you have sold this movie to me, but when I say these sticks I understand. He has succeeded in other films, but I feel like losing someone.
