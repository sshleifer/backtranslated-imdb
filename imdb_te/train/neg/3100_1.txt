Hugoboblins .... Hoggoblins .... Where should I start? <br /> <br /> The movie Manaus - Hate of Fate and Future War is running for their money. This one is fun to laugh, where Manos is just as painful to watch. The term hoggoblins is, in time, the definitive film to describe the term "80's cheese". Acting (and I'm using this word loose) is worse, Hoggoblin has some of the garbage leathers you're looking for, and garden practices can be seen as believing in the fight. This image is the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to see this mess. The film gave Mike and Bots our prescription drugs to remove one of the most ridiculous liners ever made. If you try to see this without the help of mike and bots ..... God help you !!
