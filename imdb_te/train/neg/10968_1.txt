*** This includes many, many spoilers, not letters, all partial confession *** <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here - just now I come home from a movie and say, "I'm going to IMDb up and write this review right now my civic duty." This is the film's evil. <br /> I just said one thing before I started. I'm not a few Harvard-Art-Main-Movie-Noir-Van (actually, I went to other colleges at Mass Avenue in Cambridge, a real smart people without rich daddies and loyalty funds, which I put in the Lemon-love-comedy-book-censorship group , And yet I hate this picture ...). My view preference for the hybrid cinematic overview of Dai Hards, Bond Flicks, Clerces, and The Grail. The Titanic has never drowned, and has never been lost in losing lives, but does not aim to the manipulation of the film. And if it is a young and often disrobed Emmanuelle Beert I have the same and only reason to watch a snooty French art film. I offered one of the 10 most valuable overdrive in its value here in IMDb, for God. I'm so bad because they come and I do not criticize this movie because I'm looking at some of the cinematic fame - Electra is a three-week dead goat. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of downsides to try to classify here. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. Garer: One of the compelling reasons one man wants to see these lovely men (I do not know why my wife will be). I am this and the "Finding Nemo", the second is a sexier image. Do you know the red dress wearing in every frightening statement that you see? You will see her twice - once in the beginning, and finally at once. Oops. For the rest, she will mainly see what Morissy looks like if he is a woman - pouting and lots of black clothes. The JGar which brings me to the spectacular range of expression will show her performances - from "pouting" all the way up to "pating" and "crying". Oh my God, you'd think Ben Ablec was forced to date or something terrible like that. Um, wait. <br /> <br /> Bad Guys / Gull: They expect from a slightly more sharp grapefruit with respect to the expression and acting abilities. Beside JGar's performance, it can not stand very seriously. The role of a person is to stand there and be heavier, the other will stand there and come out of him, and the woman's role is to stand there and / or breathe to kiss. They will remove these incredible successes. The main bad guy has a much harder role - he is a common man) and looks bold and b) appears in Asia. He's going to do this fine job. I think I'm a fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain began to block parts of the film in self-defense. <br /> Plot twists! The film is very surprising to the speech at the Democratic National Convention. I just kept it - my wife was only half a year in the US and only a few people in English - I was surprised when this girl first appeared in JG's pad and I made a promise to God: "She went to her house to kill the girl and her father too." And this is before the father also appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not polite by Mens for her presents and she is exposed to her daredevil or comic book style. And she discovered it in 01015 seconds, separately and without prior information. The blatant clarity of this film. <br /> <br /> You know the intellect! OK, so this big dude is in the picture. He can brush off with a chest of gun explosion and a brush-like shot, and he will take a vicious electra strap on the chest and just bend the metal (or melt - or something - can cope with, thank God). But JG jumps over his head, and he explodes? Alli niggin? As well! <br /> The mind-numbing stupidity of the film. I'm starting to experience the coming cerebral hemorrhoids, so I have to stop. But you are warned. If you intentionally slash your own tires to prevent you from watching this movie, you should do it. If Armageddon is coming, it will be preceded by the DVD.
