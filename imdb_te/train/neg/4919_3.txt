I am rarely frustrated with a famous acting starring in Ali's McGraw's film. God is embarrassing her or what ?? She told everything in the same sound and contrary, the fact that Ryan O'Neill is brilliant is terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> There is not much story. He is rich, she is wood, they both have a lot of sacrifice for love. His father, Stonewall Jackson, is known by her first name, you do not recognize the difference between them, they crossed the name of Love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominations for the film may be a bad year. As good as John Marley Wooden's father, but a helpless nomination? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katherine Ross has acted in Jennifer, but if it was me, Catherine Ross was in many movies. She is definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> When she was ill, I did not even cry and was sad. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Tommy Lee Jones at the age of 15, and the score is good. But now this is a beard mile long, its sin is not that old, but it feels like.
