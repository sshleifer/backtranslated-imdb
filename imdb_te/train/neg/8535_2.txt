As I mentioned, the book is good and Melissa Gilbert might be a good movie if it's not so terrible and reliable in the lead role. What kind of voice is supposed to be? It sounded the same as her terrible Russian accent in another film I saw. Every time I opened her mouth I cringed. It took 3 attempts before watching the whole movie. Brad Johnson is the other leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked beach locations. Melissa Gilbert's adds some inspiring glamor to your depressing role. I look at San Francisco for most of their interests. Night scenes are actually as SF, but I can be wrong. I do not remember this role as this discouraging. <br /> <br /> Make any future movies that you want to accommodate MessaS Gilbert!
