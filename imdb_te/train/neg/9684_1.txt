Frozen, grotesque, strange and opaque, visually striking ... a wannabe-romantic fantasy. Truly boring, the way is too much male nudity (including father-son promise), and a sort of shameless nonsense. Nevertheless, I agree that there are some parts of the conversations taken with their own words, a silent, haunting quality.
