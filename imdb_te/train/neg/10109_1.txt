BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; <br /> <br /> I have never seen an onion lime film but I am surprised how everyone feels terribly worried about him. Like the movies I mentioned initially, one six did not even equal! I'm curious to see how bad this person really is after reading the comments. <br /> <br /> "It's easy for editing, and this film does not make sense and I can not end it is not ending." And I'm only 45 minutes in the movie, I can not take it anymore, I've spent 45 minutes in my life. <br /> Do not look at this crap!
