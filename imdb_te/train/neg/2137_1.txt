The first 10 minutes of the film are terrible. It's hard to believe that someone other than John Cusack would have put money into this. Since the string of anti-militarist / anti-war images has already been destroyed at the box office, this type of studio is almost unpredictable with this script. <br /> Initially, with Acreaid and Cusack (s) again, Grossse Point looked like some kind of political inspired derivation of Blank. <br /> <br /> The film is about 90 seconds in the film, making it clear that Strangelove is a talent at DR. <br /> <br /> I thought it would be a risk to watch DVDs of this DVD. I do not know whether or not Cusack is enough to see another feature of him once again, unless it does not agree with another. As Kusak suffered frustration due to his hatred of George Bush and the Iraq war, he was ready to commit suicide. Tom Cruise has never gone far away. Not even close.
