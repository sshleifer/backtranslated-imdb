By seeing this film I have lost valuable moments in my life, and now I realize that I will never come back. The Thsi image is not just poor in its poor. <br /> I'm worried about watching this movie. <br /> Flixmedia takes into consideration its racial issue, apparently "white" people do not like it, it does not have white actors. Mature, I find the reason why nobody likes it because watching paint powder is very entertaining and ridiculous this dilevel. <br /> Stop the worst films
