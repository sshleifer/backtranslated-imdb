<br /> <br /> Although I viewed it until Channel 4 was broadcast in the UK, it became a cult film in Chinese college students. <br /> <br /> Flirtatiously pleasant, plot is mediocre and unreal; How independent artists can resist the commercisliation of the music industry 'spirit' and their 'maintain the purity of an artistic spirit' and not 'do not sell themselves for dirty money'.
