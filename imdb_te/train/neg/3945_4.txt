My name is Modesty, a low-budget movie that tells the story of modesty blaze sources. This movie is not terrible, this is not what I was expecting or expecting. I've learned about Maddie Blaze's character for years, I'm not very familiar with comic strips or graphic novels, so I'm out of the movie. This may cause my frustration. I look forward to more actions and more comedy. This picture is driven by the dialog. I think I'm looking for something with a little camp value. Meanwhile, my name is Modesty is a deadly serious film. If very little, if any, "light" moments. Acting is at least acceptable from Alexandra Staden but what is not the best. As others commented, she appears to be slightly weak to be completely believable in the title role. The scenes in any scenes in my name are one of the weakest films. <br /> <br /> I'm really going to Quentin Tarantino and expect a big budget film based on Modesty Blaze's character. I have a great sense of feeling and I look forward to a lot.
