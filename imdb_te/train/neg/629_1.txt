I undoubtedly want to give a 10 to the film ... I will really do. Some movies, especially horror movies are very good and they are good. A brilliant-fractured ninja scarec that can run corn cobs like brain weapons ... certainly 'brightens this budget'. The depth of the film definitely drives the audience at the edge of their seats, turns its strong point and turns and turns it on ... turns the ninja ... puberty-stricken ... thirty-year-old student ... but cowboy drawing ... brilliant- Cracking ... a bitch scarecrow is the son who came to light as the most horror horror icon of the year. <br /> <br /> If you really feel this kind of joyful horror, you can say 'you can dig it out' and watch movies such as Franken Fish. <br />
