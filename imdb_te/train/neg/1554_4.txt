Conan has unveiled the true visual beauty of the medieval epic, which is fascinating (except the Dragon Prop). Now that the studio went on for a long time in Chuck Norris films, the first ever knowledge of science knowledge could not be fully accomplished? Point Case: Recalling the medieval legend of amateur acting and terrible plot reminds me that there is no cure for some lousy execution. They actually went and killed another exploiter, exploiting hundreds of people to improve this look. For two "barbarian brothers", they know exactly how brave warriors sound and weird sounds rather than becoming bold enough to save their local land. This is the only great waste of potential I've seen from a "expensive" low-budget movie, and the kindness is worse enough to let an ax strike by gorgeous print. This is followed by a promotional campaign that sells T-shirts based on all the barbarians! This film alone makes a great souvenir!
