If it's over 100, I'll see it's a worst picture. I think the first-graders group might come up with better plot lines than a class project than this. <br /> <br /> God is merciful to those who paid for the production of the film. <br /> I eventually stopped it. /> <br /> Nobody has ever said photography about it. No one has a clue about acting. <br /> You do not have any idea about anyone at any time. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X is showing this trash on this occasion. One of the only time I saw was Starz! Channels - the main one. And it's at about 3 a.m.
