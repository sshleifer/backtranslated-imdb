I have seen this DVD at my friends' home and it's not just a few big names with some Hollywood's Turkish action movie. Enough interest I decide to give a shot later .. The experience is a tough one to bear to believe me. Finally, after the credits roll, I've really succeeded in making Hollywood style making it a shame for the heast. Captive film style .. 'But wait then! I do not check some names and do not, they are not Turkish names and, this is not a Turkish movie; In contrast, it was literally filmed with an American director & crew in America! That again made me think again! - How are names such as Michael Madsen, Edward Farnong or Arnold Wasslu? Perhaps with money .. Maybe you have made me think of how to pay them and what kind of international money can you raise? Then my meditation paid and I got to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and staff you find. If you're still having trouble adjusting your budget, write down and direct the movie you're trying to-or vice versa. So the bottom line is that this is not bad movie because it's like everyone else, it's also meditating on me - and many movies are very good. At least you will think; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you with disbelief .. and then you will wonder again ..
