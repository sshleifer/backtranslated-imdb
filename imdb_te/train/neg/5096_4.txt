Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) serves as a mail-boy for the TV station UBC (which is a United Broadcasting Corporation); He gave the studio executives such ridiculous projects as "Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog" because Lincoln, doctors and dogs became popular. Program director director Joe Flynn (such as Francis X Wilbanks) wisely rejected Mr Russell's proposals, but did not know how to choose a hit TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), is double-duty as Russell's girlfriend, and has a chimpanzee heck out of Russell in the event of a TV watch. As it turns out, the monkey sees all the popular performances, and can easily choose hits. Russell realizes the talent of chimp and uses him to grow his own career. <br /> <br /> Refer to Harvey for things for Rafael and Cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles chimp (operated by Frank Lamping) In some scenes Raffles is bored and / or distracted, looking at the chimp curiosity; These can be corrected by retrieving or editing. There is a lightweight satire edge - imagine a monkey picking hit TV shows! And, it was a monkey who had a BEER during the commercial (drinking in a Disney movie)! Detect a look through the cast and try to identify a group of funitative TV actors. Honestly about Raffles Beer-Gazling, you can drink alcohol by guessing actors and see what you've seen before. Here's the start - hey, "Doctor Bells" from "Dream of Jenny"? Hatch down! <br /> * Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
