I'm looking for the film for ages because it's rare to be one of the video nails. I eventually found it on the DVD at the very low budget movie set around the Amazon forest tribes that live in fear of the story devil. Lara Crawford is a model kidnapped by a gang of dozens while working in South America. They are taken into the forest Lara preserves some fraudulent nationals called "the devil", and she needs to go all the unpleasant things to be happy. Maidens are chain up. Eating ghost meat displays in a horrific way. Peter Weston, the ghost hunter, goes to the forest to try and save him,
