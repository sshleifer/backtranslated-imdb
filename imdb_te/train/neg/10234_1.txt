I'll keep this short; Thanks to Greg for helping me get this brief: The cousin is a girl drink, imprisoned and tortured by her, having sex with her. The single twist and pitchline of the film. It is a slow motion date violence like rape. And it's not a good movie too. This is not good; This is very bad. Even though some among the critics have contributed to the controversy, they also mentioned "spoiler code" that did not break down. <br /> <br /> "This is the worst, and why not," it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> These papu-pedelars do not give your money.
