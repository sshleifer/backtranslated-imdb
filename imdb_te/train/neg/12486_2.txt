Rich Detective Zone Winfield (a rude misconception Betty Davis) is married to Stupid Unrealist Allen Brice (Jack Carson is looking for a defeat). Her father (Eugene Palette) was determined to stop the marriage and was kidnapped by Pilot Steve Collins (James Cognny). They ruin the land in the desert and hate others, but begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> Cognizant and Davis are likely to get a high rating from reviewers here. They are two wonderful actors but they are called for drama comedy and why this movie shows! The script is just terrible - there is a real laugh in the whole movie. Cognny and Davis are the first joke in the cactus (it happens three times!). Their substantial talents will be completely protected from shame. They both enjoy their best. Cagney makes his best effort with his ranks and Davies makes screeches to the full power of each line but it does not work. Carson is "what a hell" on his face throughout his entire film (his characters are emotional in seconds). The palette is the only way to bring some smile on his distinctive voice and some readings. But, all in all, this is dull and laughing - the real function of sitting by. It coincides with both Cogny and Davis's performance and some beautiful cinematography, but it's not really valuable. Cagny and Davies were hated in the following years and you can see why.
