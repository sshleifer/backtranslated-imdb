Tony Rome is a horrible film with Frank Sinatra. Here, he is associated with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome was soon hired to find out what happened to a woman. Naturally, this is the woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Her old age mate, Lenny Kazan, soon died on the floor. <br /> <br /> Older aged Richard Contage plays the role of Rome's police officer and friend. When a local club owner kills, this accusation comes to Rome and the interesting chase scene takes place. How bad is this movie if you rely on a chase scene to give you action. <br /> <br /> Rockwell Welch plays her beauty in the conspiracy. She leads a lot of wanting to act. "<br /> <br />" Do not bother to ask.
