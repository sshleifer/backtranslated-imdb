When someone comes to the film of this kind of film, the overdose of the great over-the-counter brain-medicine comes with a high dose, a desperate suspension, a powerful hand. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, Nelson Eddie is the woman who neglected from the beginning of time, but who also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> When I saw this my reaction was a muted gasp "huh?" Where did I see before? It turns out, I've seen it before, but in a movie much later than this one has done. An unforgettable pile made in 1987 with DATE AN ANEL, did not speak of Emmanuelle Beert's brilliant beauty, he did not have the unchanged lines, wearing an elegant wig and created life hell for soap-actor Michael Knight. <br /> However, it is not unenviable, it is not a memorable movie and it is a doorstop. The last time McDonald's and Eddie were not, they were very good actors, but the amazing singers were beginning to "romance" and "clean-cut" romance. After that you need a cool shower because there are some sightseeing scenes but can not get rid of memory.
