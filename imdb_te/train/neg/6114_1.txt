Moreover, she is naked by the whole movie, not good reason. When Tarzan melts with a snake, she suddenly removes her dress. When is a bea conduit poisonous? How did Tarzan get tragedy by the way? The film did not get animal species for the film. Need an Orangutung hanging around those chimpanzees? He escaped from a group of improved films. See a group of men in the cannibal caccine.Why? And why are they painted Bo and her father if they eat it? It's probably just lame to show her breasts and curves. While her father was standing very close to hunting, stupidly around a bull elephant. No true African bull elephant from Circus, this will be stomped to the butt of the moron. Any smart hunter will have started shooting the minute it saw it. I can not help but wonder if the camera is in LSD, because it shows slowly the different scenes in motion, there's no good reason. It's not good. Boja Conductor who wrestled with Tarzan water, one of them 12 local rubber snakes you can buy in local Spencer gifts eechless in this film, Bo probably is her most glamorous. I'm sorry, but with a similar but good story, rip off a classic black and white Tarzan film. Not to tell the plot .One scene that everyone forgot to say. * (Spayler's Warning) * In the scene where he is trying to save Jane and her father, he is standing behind the running water. Yet! He and Jane are wandering around a seaboard, and his father's death is true as the irregular monkeys jumping and clapping. * (End of spoilers) * The surgeon general's warning should be in this film. If you look too naked in the movie, you will be blind.
