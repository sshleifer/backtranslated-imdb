Just bought VHS in this movie for just two bucks, did I waste my money! Hey, I'm Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Gilligans Island" Louis, but Hello Dig! This third rate product is a dozen other biker films success; Bikers psychos ride crazy bunch into a kick town, beat everybody and everything, and then loses man by a brisk hero. Adam West plays the role of the hero, but he does not have a cape and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not the same. Tina L. is really nervous and frightened overall performance, but at least we know what "ginger" is once we are rescued from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a thin group, and those who know them can never be played or at least once. Hell riders see hell!
