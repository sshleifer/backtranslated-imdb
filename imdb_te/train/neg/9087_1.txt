Canadians are very polite, but viewers at the Toronto Film Festival refused to predict the movie as 0 or 1 in their voting sheets. A modern filmmaker understands a modern filmmaker about the love of past shepherds and shepherds when Droids is spiritual leaders. Working in three periods is a staggering and unrealistic dress and fantastic spiritual rituals, offering many possibilities for the introduction of rare arachronisms, including really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and are strongly committed to idiotic signals of behavior, such as cross-dressing and classified fraudulent conditions. The film may have been a bit of a monte python piece, which is very close, but Romer's work is very flat. The viewers appreciated the sight jokes, but slowly paced bounds. The end all comes with a rush and is really awful. It's a small picture and waste your movie time.
