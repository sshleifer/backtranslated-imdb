This is a really bad movie. Third rate of performances, and the dialogue appeared to be wrapped up and dead in most cases. My reason for renting is easy: find a movie with script writing. I want a visual help for my presentation, so why did not I find the clip to be used? Boy I'm wrong. After exploring my local video store, I named the name "Starrac". I thought, "no hey", and decided to try it one. Well, I'm very dissatisfied with my results. Maybe there is a scene that I can use, at the same time, because of the thorough banality of the film because I'm practically sleeping. So ... I took this back and I chose Ed Wood. An example I can use as an example. Then again, there is something polite compared to that of the so-called "starfar".
