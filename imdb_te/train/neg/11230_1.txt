In the sixth class, every teacher I feel is to make this film a lesson for the entire semester. Each category has something to do with this horrible show. We saw in English and wrote in magazines as we were in a role. In mathematics we talked about maps and other sea trash. In science we talked about whales (it's somewhat interesting, so it's not 100% waste time). All day long was tormented. It is not, but they are subject to us in this horror twice a day by looking at us both in the study hall. I could see this is a new series or something, but it's like '93. I'm trying to block this.
