<br /> <br /> To complete with a very simple trashy Italo-Western, clich√©s and lack of logic, some simple actors, dirty settings, punch-fights and a huge scale of people. - In my German translation version, this German DVD-release is called "Adios Companeros" and matches with McCallaghan Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed him (he was the only survivor). Then they budged Couch and Ironhead each other because they argued and the gang broke up. And you have an ironhead fight against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy donkey anyway. <br /> <br /> A little character is a great role by Clovis Kinski as Revelend Cotton (hence I bought this DVD). In one scene he tries to fight by touching two men and "I love you!" <br /> <br /> It is also said that Joey D'Amato aka Aristide Mussescio cinematography - I'm a master-of-the-match exploitation-thrash, so it's "Ahah".
