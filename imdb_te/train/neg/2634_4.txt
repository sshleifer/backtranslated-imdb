The above average supernatural thriller should not be confusing with "The Sentinel". The Sentinel did not deliver a large dose of constant action to me, some critics reiterated. Not everyone Halfassing it seemed to me, and to make some quick cash out there, because this felt like too made for the TV movie. Reheav of many good films, such as Sentinel "In the Line of Fire", which does not have any originality, and Michael Douglas ran around and considered my opinion. The main problem along with dysplasia is poor. I often get disturbed in trying to watch this movie, and see how much time left <br /> <br /> Ivan Longoria is not sexually harassed. Michael Douglas is a loyal actor, usually made by moves. He does not persuade him as a man or a secret agent. His chemistry was with Bassazar. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just no matter what. He tries to come across a noise, but then there must be something more polite, and to be honest, he does not find that interest. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince her in the role, and the pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the first lady. She is bored for her tears, and her character is a throw away, more then anything. <br /> <br /> Martin Donovan has a big role in the end but I do not have enough of something for me. <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel still, another political thriller, bored me tears. It is very old, very tired, and especially sucks in the absence of effort. <br /> <br />
