This is because everybody comes to know about this issue. Deaf, mute guy well, underdog wins - is fine, the cricket item is great, but the overall average of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot for the film based on the real life event is imaginable. I'm sure the film will be very interesting. The songs are just filling out there, and literally the scenes from the other angles are the same thing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, though. Can be found.
