Not me but, but this film is unfortunately good and one of the very bad movies that is pretty cool, which makes it totally mean and total waste of time. There is nothing more interesting than a normal picture, and my name is Modesty: Which subtitle takes the mediocrity to a new level. It's not fun because B-actors are full but no seriously it takes seriously. It stands out as a thriller, but then increases the growing play and past style. The beautiful Alexandra Stauden is fraught with identity under makeup, similar to Modesty Blaze than a cast member from the top model. I'm not one of the die-hard comic bookstores that every pitch is perfect - his original "graphic novels" - in fact I have not even read the Modesty Blaze - all the good movie I want. But this is not. The film is half finished, with a weaker story rather than a weak and very unexpected ending. <br /> <br /> "A good B-film - just turn your mind off and a calzone - and "Modesty" directed us none other than Scott Spiegel, who brought us the amazing publish worst image Dan 2: Texas Blood Money! Naming, gore, guns, you name it - it's a bad B - Bring everything you bring to the image table I love Dan 2 until Dusk. "Humility" is dull, and it's not bad that Modesty's life is not bad enough to be laughed at acting. <br /> <br /> I would like Nicholz Coster-Waldau's interest (Hey Buddy, <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just lame, weird. Do not look any ino contributed to it. It is quite forgotten, half-hearted thriller, and its more than one attempt. I declined the movement of the review (seriously, I'm afraid): My name is modesti: modesti a waste of time - 4/10
