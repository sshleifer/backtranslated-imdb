I can not really understand why most Godzilla fans think this is fantastic, in fact one of the Godzilla movies ever. <br /> <br /> The film is horrible and one of the fewest of the Gogira movies I stand to see again (the other is G. vs Megallon). <br /> <br /> The plot is a HCC series that attempts to change old age Godzilla franchises to painful action films, revolving around the ideas that appeared in 1974 as of 1991. It is particularly ridiculous in some cases, for example in some cases, is ridiculous, with a dying Godzilasaurus, a pathetic and serious tone, as the former commander-turned-capitalist and his death, serious scene in a movie, for all its fans laughing, and guilty fun-playing fun as a goofy acting Not much taste One of the films, however, I am not a lot of filmmakers, and it's bad for a straight action film. It's impossible to take seriously from everything, from jet pack to android, hockey acoustic effects, and yet the movie expects you to have an irreconcilable romance similar to almost all Godzilla movies, and this is no exception, However, the fact is that it is not a separate and indestructible. There is literally all that is submitted for romance, it just happens and lives there to make 360 ​​degree commitments. In addition to the other awful elements of the film, both Japan and English have provoked a terrible, clunky and possibly Battleground Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar DVD compounds are difficulties, opacity, shading and just plain ugly, for the same sound. <br /> <br /> I first saw Japanese version 2 and have different colors and textures, especially scoring, especially fight scenes, night and day variations. A disappointment with the exception of the Heisei series Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), where praise is very low, and Godzla versus King Ghidorah is the point of this failure. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2
