Beautifully photographed and efficiently acted, usually, but the writing is very slipshod. There are such unbelievable scenes that have no pleasure in seeing. The fact that the young girlfriend has a twin brother, I cried loudly. <br /> <br /> "Emotion-light bulb connection" is also a gimmick. <br /> I do not know. If you feel relaxed with something beautiful to see with some glasses of wine and some fluffy comedy scenes, this is a pretty good image. No need to be part of the viewer. But the Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much better than this.
