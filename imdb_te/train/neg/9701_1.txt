A really bad sequel. Part 1 has a lot of funny moments - part 2 (in the boring route) is just bad and made clear to go out of the crowd. <br /> <br /> Otto Walls! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> It's very easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> Screenplay is sloppy / does not exist. The director should give each one a help and leave his job immediately. Acting is worse than the 2nd class school game. <br /> Technically this film is also awful, but who censor the cinematographer / sound guys who have worked with such an untalented director?
