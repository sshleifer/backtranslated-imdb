Writer / Peter Greenway is his latest workshop art house Prestitution High Lord with crap self-joy his times cements, 8 ½ women. <br /> <br /> The film follows a mutual search for a wealthy Englishman and his son for sexual satisfaction, as they threw women to join their personal collections concubines, and the building was dangerous, and Greenway's prospects. Female roles are a little more than a list of fetish for two main characters. Kabuki-engaging Mio, a pregnant Jiakonda and Berel, had a lot of farm animals there. Giulietta had no legs and uses a wheelchair, her "half woman," to get it? <br /> <br /> The film will have anything to do with emotyping, which is associated with Japan and will continue to float from the snoring (less sexist) 1996 film The Pillow Book. But wherever the pill is book is romantic and elegant, 8 ½ women just gets horny and exploitative. Greenway's work is tasted and proud in its flexibility, and it is the only person enjoying it.
