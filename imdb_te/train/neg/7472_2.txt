This program is good. Kaira Sedgwick is an ok and I love the police sequence, but somewhere in the production this program is very bad. <br /> <br /> First, the authors have more than one suspicion, know that you've ever done !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is unbelievably annoying and irrevocable. I wanted her to be strict, but she meant stupid and bad chief. Crimes are unfavorable and bland and are just lame. As mentioned above, I hate it. <br /> This is a very big disappointment for all.
