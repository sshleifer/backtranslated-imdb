This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, acting ... Danny, singing or screaming or committed to what you normally do with hell. Rarely chopped random chicks are sexually-frustrated and gotta gotta lags. Personally, I really love this movie. The story and the characters are very good, directing, actors and other small nibbi works are better. But the movie is just bad, it's just people like scam because it's in it. This film is always the worst B-rate image. And, you believe it's difficult to achieve, especially when you're defending the def over temptation and crappy excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, so I see another bad movie ... it's really bad. If Dani has done this comedy, he's good. I did very well. However, more than that, I rate it, it's hypocritical. See if you're happy, happy, happy, happy in mode, so you can laugh at everything or if you have a lot of different drugs.
