Vampire bot Gustav Sch√∂nn (Lionel Belmour) BurmaMyster holds a meeting with inspector Carl Brettsnewer (Melvin Douglas) from local cells about all recent murders, six victims have drained blood for several weeks and have the same two puncture wounds on their necks. The Brettsinider does not have a single clue but the superstitions in the village believe that adult deaths are the work of the vampire. Brett's chin yard was not convincing, but the latest victim Martha Muller (Rita Carlyle) was found at the same time telling stories of a big bout of villagers. Brett's chneider is under pressure to fix murders, but he believes he really is responsible for the big Vampire bot and how should it be stopped? Majestic Pictures From The Majesty Pictures It's a murder mystery rather than murdered by the two actors Atv & Wray & their predecessor, Doctor X (1932) to be a looting & robbery & The Edward T. Lowe Jr. script is very serious about it and creates a basic story that may kill some local villagers and may be a vampire, after which Bretts chron Yarder and his ineffective investigations are boring, which is not very well put a point. The Vampire bot also has a bit of an identity crisis because it does not know what to do, the title refers to the horror film, but for the most part it can easily be described as a thriller, crazy science fiction. There is no Vampire bot, you have foolproof attempts, there are broad stereotypes of all character & you can immediately tell the villain of the piece away & not as much as entertaining or entertaining about the Vampire bot as a whole. I know the movie is outdated but the film has been shaken since 1933 and it does not cut in the corny, flat, dull, boring & misleading image like this Vampire bot today, only the original King Kong (1933) was released the same year and how awesome it is today . <br /> <br /> Director Strizer does not do anything special, but in this case it is very relevant. I can cut some slack because of the age of the film, overall it is pretty much the point, shoot & hope for the best thing. Some old sets of old Old House (1932) & Universal's sets of European sets would not be good if the existing weather or frightened. <br /> <br /> Technically, I can not compare VAMPIAR BUT, for its age, I think earlier, but again I was impressed by the original King Kong. King Kong said, "Star Fray Wray is the horror icon Lionel Atvil in this role, and I said it was kind and acting. <br /> <br /> Vampire bot I actually did not have it, personally I thought the entire thing was a bit a bore people into thinking that it was a horror film about Vampire bats. It's small and it tells the story's story adequately, but I have to admit that I'm not a fan.
