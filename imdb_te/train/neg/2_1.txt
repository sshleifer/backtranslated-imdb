I said the capsule comment was "great acting". In my opinion, these two great actors give terrible performances, and with a zero chemistry, a great director is the worst attempt of his all-time. Robert De Niro is the most intelligent and intelligent writer ever. Jane Fonda's performance is inconvenient to take all the steps seriously because this role is not clear because the character is very low. Molassae-like movie is a fast paced one of the hottest pacing. The film's intention is a fantastic story that is illiterate, and the truth is that it is "rare." This is one of the 20 films that I have not seen for its budget level.
