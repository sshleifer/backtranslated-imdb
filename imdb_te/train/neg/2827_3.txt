In the beginning the story is interesting: slavery from West Africa to the Arab Middle East in the 20th century. The problem with which director Richard Fleischer's favorite enemies are deliberately disturbing: Arabs and Germans. It is reliable that hunters for slaves in "roots" believe that many Arab-looking men revolve around and believe that it could be easier to capture blacks in West Africa. Naturally, two transactions are held by locals and (d) have more advanced networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's children and sex slave trade, one of the worst offenders of Israel according to Imastine International. So out of the Arabs, can you choose Germany only as a European buyer? <br /> <br /> The acting is largely by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderbie) is always good.
