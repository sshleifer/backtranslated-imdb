At first I really could not hold myself in this film. It's not a bad movie, another movie I've seen, I'm "Well, it's not unique". Maybe there is drama and stuff, but it just does not grab me, but seamed more semi dull. It's very cheap as I said in the headline. The quality of the film (pictured) was portrayed as low quality and gave me a lot of TV-film than the well-respected English filmmaker. The camera angles and shots are quite amusing in my opinion. Have no shots or similar effects to create interesting scenes or. I did not see a lot of English movies and I did not look much better than what I saw and looked at the same kind of camera work, colors and similar. The "Game" tried more cool, hip & smart (see my review about "Lola Rent" if you wanted), but I did not succeed. Overall nothing (better, I'm scared) and basically unfortunately two hours off.
