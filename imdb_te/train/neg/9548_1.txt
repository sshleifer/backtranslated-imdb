I can not believe I watched this more expectation. It starts okay. This film pushes the way to the distance! At least the first one is real. It's about the rips from the debut film and also the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers hate this movie. It has a good message though, look for the big brother !!! The film looks like Big Brother, he is actually bigger than actually. Very bad. Make the actors even completely wrong. Some of the best in acting. Some acting is very bad. The script is okay at some points and completely messed up at other parts. The film plays comfortably every five minutes. I said, I saw more and more. I will make the original pop to return to Earth ... Q
