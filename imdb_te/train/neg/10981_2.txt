Or listen for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /> I'm honestly not the worst homophobic film I've seen (it's about Billy), but it's close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This topic is dragging and drilling and drilling. It's not a story - it's a good writer. . . It was definitely more entertaining. You can not see the road going ten miles away. Dialog flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it's a dimensional, stereotypical homosexual. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film, I believe that the condition or relation of the two Leeds is very low. What kind of chemistry is not a dynamic, literally why there is no source of love for one. . . We're in love. They can not be identified and sexually friendly when they are not normal. Do they like the same book? <br /> Acting is not entirely bad, but the speed is slowly slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch-slow, but without the quality of Jarmusch. In fact, it will be a good barometer for you. If you want pictures of Germanic, avoid it.
