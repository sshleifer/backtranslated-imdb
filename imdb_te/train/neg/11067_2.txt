I am a big fan of the true conviction, but I could not sit by this unfortunate part. This is almost as intended as a romantic-sounding soundtrack, as Dummer's romantic movie. There was no scrutiny on what Dahmer had done and did not explore his victims. Nothing but "see how hard this person is." And I have to give this a lot to filmmakers - their Dahmer is a rare thing on the screen ever disgraced.
