It seems to be able to make a film for anyone these days. All you need is a camera, a group of people with your cast and crew, script and a little bit of money and walls for you. The problem is not always perfect in this equation, and this type of low-budget images often becomes duds. The video store shelves are called these films. These are not even flawed pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that is better off forgotten. Troma Entertainment Trash is famous for making the film, but most of their films are B film Gold. Nevertheless, they did not make some films, and 'Nightmare Weekend' are not released. <br /> <br /> Pros: Members of cast will do better with secular material. Some random pleasure. <br /> <br /> Cons: Worst writing, flat reading and countless plot holes. Poorly lit, especially at night scenes and ending, which you can not make at all. Not a sensitive of knowledge. Badly scored. Cheap and very dated effects. The lack of character development and you do not care about anyone. It is considered a horror film, but it's not in that area and at least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting will happen. <br /> Final Think: I never thought this was a forgotten gem, but I never thought it was bad. I do not know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a perfect competitor. Instead of releasing the film, Troma should share this role. Do not make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get you the best. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
