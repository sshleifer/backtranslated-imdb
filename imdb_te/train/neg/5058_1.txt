(I'll always learn-) the ecstatic reviewer on the NPR made me think this turkey is another Citizen Kane. <br /> I agree: The setting, perhaps New York City, has never been bizarre and ineffective. I'm reminded that 70th men are a bad decade for fashion and automobiles. And all smokers! <br /> You have to have at least one sympathetic character (at least, in my simplest assessment) a film to work. Only Ned Beatty came close, and I can not wait to finish off Nicky. <br /> If you ridiculed Mickey, it has led to very apathetic. <br /> <br /> When I was strong enough I could not remember it. I think the "art" flux is a roubbin. Oh! Good.
