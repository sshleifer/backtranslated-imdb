The film is an attempt to show Jared Diamond's theory "Guns, Germs and Steel". It explains how Europeans dominated the world. <br /> I came to see this documentary version 2 hours. I think the information may have presented in 20 minutes. Professor Jared Diamond battled by the binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond had failed to properly use the bow and arrow, Professor Jared Diamond fired a muzzle-loader. Want to make this heroine from the documentary "Professor Jared Vajram" a hero? This part of the documentary is very bad, it can be a robbery. Diamond is worse when it breaks down and tears during a malaria ward trip to an African hospital. None of that is his theory "Guns, Germs and Steel." BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said 100 times. "When Europe finally came to business, his theory was equal parts and interesting boring. Europeans captured people in other lands because they had fine blades on guns and stone and wooden weapons. One to convince me <br /> <br /> "I believe that Europeans are non-Europeans. I'm not a racist, I already know this. If I'm racist, Jared Diamond is not going to convince me of his use of local tools. <br /> <br /> I do not think the audience is an intended audience for this documentary. Kids though, I will enjoy more than this. I read a book that is much better than this documentary documentary.
