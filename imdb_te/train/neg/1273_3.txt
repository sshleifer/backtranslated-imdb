There are two good things to say about this film: The scenery is beautiful and Peter Fawl gives a good performance (he thinks he's working on dialogue and direction). Nevertheless, the film was very tiresome. The paint powder was more entertaining. It seemed to be more than 97 minutes. The movie is offensive, starting with the opening scene, and talking to each other and recurring everything that Paul has told him on the phone. Fill played by Frau is filled with film clips and shitiks, not to mention endless moments. Similarly, it is difficult to judge whether the director laughs or targets the tears. There are some touching sequences, but they are played to laugh. If you have sculmalsy, sentimental, and "beautiful" appeal, you will like it. But if you're hoping for something with more substance, look for a different picture.
