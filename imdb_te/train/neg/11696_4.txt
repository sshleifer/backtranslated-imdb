I started looking at the low expectations for this movie, I was actually SK <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectations are low because the film is not good, but it will make you curious. The director and the actors made this story really interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is too long, "nice" shots and scared, dialogues are dumb and special effects are even worse. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm interested in not using the most horror clich√©s (I think the book is good). <br /> My vote 4/10.
