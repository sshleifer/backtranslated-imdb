The weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Felie and Mario Batali brought down. <br /> <br /> Felicity is worse. Certainly a trick pony, I think they might have gotten the other American chefs who came to this one table of iron chef. This duo really comes in dishes ... The original Iron Chef series reflects creativity. I do not think Batali actually went to school for chef. I am surprised that there are a lot of great chefs in America, why they do not appear in the food network. <br /> <br /> More regional materials and perhaps co-operators are stressed. I'm like Alton Brown, but he's a bit worse for this role.
