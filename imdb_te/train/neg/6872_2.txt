This show has pretty good stories and bad dialogue. The main character is particularly annoying. It is very clear why this show cancellation, however, like most UPN presentations, I am still in the syndicated re-run. <br /> <br /> This has led me to think that most of the plot has been copied from other programs and that films and producers do not have original idea in their heads. <br /> I have not commented enough. You have at least ten lines. The special effect is not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> Gnome is a good character.
