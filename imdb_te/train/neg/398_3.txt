C'mon guys some earlier reviewers have written a novel about this episode. It's just 60 old TV show! This episode is remarkable in Star Trek because the most serious babe used in the Star Trek (Yemen barrows) and is featured in real public places. <br /> <br /> The use of public places (and the baby) is the perfect depth and is now the most creepy film of the most common episode. <br /> <br /> Some important exceptions are the old series of Star Trek, which must be intensely muddy, except for "permanent land", "Delivery Land" and "Tomorrow's Yesterday" - the bulk and the boring PC's drop out. <br /> <br /> The half-dozen good episodes from 79 are the poor batting average. <br /> <br /> This is the fact of genetic raden Berry in boring stuff, in fact some people worship the land that he really did, and he really did a lot worse! For example, he did not deserve to speak in the same breath as Irvine Allen. <br /> <br /> See the set of bridge's enterprise from just a modern view. They used the Wabble Plywood for the floor, the caf√© with plastic backs and the use of cardboard less than the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Every cost or what to do!
