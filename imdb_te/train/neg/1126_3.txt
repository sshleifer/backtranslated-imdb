I rented this idea that would be of interest, but it could be an interesting story unless it was said in such rhetorical manner. Confusing, peculiar editing, confusing storyline, chaos of chaos, all the time confusing dull waste. I could not find it and did not care what happened to the characters - Ian Holm did not even save the film. Except if you do not need to cure insomnia, I will skip it. 3/10, and that's generous.
