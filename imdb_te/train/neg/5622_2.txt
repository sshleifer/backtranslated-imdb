Okay, from the psychedelic background image, the information provided here is good. <br /> <br /> For content in the film, the director often brings Pagan's perspective on the existence of Christ and the difficult task of the works and events of the life of Christ. The life of legendary figures / gods like Mithra and Dionysesses. <br /> <br /> If he is directing and staying with them, the film is good. Nevertheless, in the film, Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and his youngest director appear to be individually-happy attacks on a Christian private school. In my interview with her older principal, I thought the director was acting as child of the director (the director, who came up with the wrong idea). <br /> <br /> He had been asking good questions, but this film was also attacked by these special private school rules, not Christianity. <br /> If you're interested in all things, look for the first 30 minutes and then close it.
