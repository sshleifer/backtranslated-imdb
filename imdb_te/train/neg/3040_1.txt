You have a lot of junk off with this title. Bad acting. The script is bad. Director is wrong. <br /> <br /> Film sounds are very difficult and many people yell at you. The movie produces a bad race stereotype. Why does the black hero come with every movie drug addict? Why will the hero always have to dance that would win? Why should the famous rapper always be in the dancing film? <br /> <br /> Hollywood audience should be closed with a brain that knows how to close and speak in English. <br /> <br /> Do not go to self-harm and see.
