<br /> I saw 1 in front of today and I thought it was one of the greatest films ever, 10 stars. So perhaps 2 and 3 episodes were a good continuation, I was wrong. This film kills me and is very different from the very first, which is a continuation and the plot. <br /> <br /> I loved Wane, but here I was hurt him. I am very happy to have Glenn Danzig in this film, but you'll miss him. I have full actors and full actors with people who do not like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it is the breath of fresh air to watch Ethan Embrien, one of the most funny people on earth. <br /> <br /> The movie is a little bit less, so do not look at it <br /> <br /> I take part 3 as a fan. If you have to wait a few days to see Part 3, I'm praying better than this worst. <br /> <br /> The lightning film is one of the most beautiful things ever shown in the film. Fast forward or skip if you do not stomach the first part. <br /> 1 in 10 stars - It's awful!
