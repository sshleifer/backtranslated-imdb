There are six different couples. There are six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eight audience audience in the movie theater. Watching eighty different sections on the silver screen. <br /> When sitting in the middle of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie, I'm sitting somewhere. Not all of the stories are associated with one another, but Nikhil Advani is trying to show some relation between them somewhere. I tried to find some of the lines I could write in the review but found nothing to write for 3 hours 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The image of Hollywood blockbuster Love is very small. <br /> My advice. If you really want to see a good movie do not look at the movie.
