This presentation is just annoying !!! I believe that plays will be funny (especially Bob Saget), trying to cover ludicrous jokes, and the "anneal" track comes at unnecessary times. Over dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this program is the city of clich√©. If you look up the word cliche, it will read "The Complete House" is a "life lesson" to learn at the end of each story line. A sappy speech makes everything good and even a very bratty child is capable of having the amazing virtue of GASP's very goodness is not possible in real life. I do not know how anyone can see this presentation without the mouth of the character or the laugh track. I'm talking on TV, "FUNNY / SAD / CUTE NOT" If life really is, the world is different.
