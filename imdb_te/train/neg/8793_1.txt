For the purposes of watching this movie and reading these comments for insight, I will first give these four words: Do not waste your time! The "Chunging Express" Shadowdale was shot and quickly caught up with the man standing in line at the Hong Kong Burger King. I do not remember watching a film with such a dimensional characters that are trying to work through this secular script! This is a philosophically ludicrous dialogue (a person revolves in a flooded apartment and offers a wonderful statement that "it will take time to wake up with tears but wipe out water"). The same character can also be seen carrying a deep, meaningful understanding with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. Another annoying feature I've done without a shaking, wandering, hand-held camera work. And if you do not agree with your popcorn, you've heard the old 60th-century "California Dreaming" mummies and sins over the long run soundtrack in the long run. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino has been responsible for bringing this defeat to the United States through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, but I can not bother myself why I am suffering in his life. He commented, "I loved this film very much." Most of us, however, he is focused on making his audience happy with more worthwhile innovations in the future.
