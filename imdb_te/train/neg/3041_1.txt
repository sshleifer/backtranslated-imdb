Yes, I rated this movie a terrific star. Yet, it will no longer be my rotating Christmas films. It's so good. This is another K.Gordon Murray product (Read: Buying a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spending zero on it's dubbing into English and releasing at kiddie matin√©es in the mid 1960s). I feel that I'm stuck in this too late and I feel some "mood". I have never seen any bar with Merlin, Devil, Mechanical Wind-Up Reindeer and very painful child actors. I went back with the Kessy Grammar's "A Christmas Carol" on these holidays. Holidays really made in hell. Now I have a triple feature that I can not beat if I find it on "All a Goodnight (Ega Solidide)" DVD. You have to watch this movie. It slowly moves slowly, I can not touch the fast forward button, especially the two dance shows! This thing should be a strain to enjoy the experience as an expensive bleu jose-reference. Feliz Navidad Amigos!
