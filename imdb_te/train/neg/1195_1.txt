It's the only worst picture I have ever seen. I said badly. I honestly wanted to kill many times through this gruesome experience to have the end of the pain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> When I read the back of the DVD I have a lot of expectations in the case, and in the beginning when it adds that Jesus follows them I'm so excited ... I wanted to kill myself. I mean introducing a twenty-three minutes of the most annoying characters in cinematic history ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys could do better work by compiling this trash. At least they threw the stool and some of the worst was unclear. <br /> <br /> I did not get jokes, they were not just funny, they were twenty times. <br /> <br /> Let us look at it under any circumstances. The worst film of the world is 'Manas the Hands of Fate' people are finalized. I've also seen it and agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is only the second worst. <br /> <br /> It deserves all kinds of rigorous languages, but I can not write here because I am going to screw a whole bunch.
