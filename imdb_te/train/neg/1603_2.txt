If it does not act as Clueless Stoners of Barry Diamond and Art Evans, I have no reason to recommend anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is a 10-year high school reunion in a speculative penalty high school (a 1950s low-budget horror film appears as a prop), and the chaotic student class is a very painful one. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters because a student dies, as well as the Lunch Lady (Gunnies Anne Ramsey). We believe that Hornney Kappled killed, but can not see a damaging thing! It is a horrible film that continues to dump down the national lampoon in the 80s and 90s.
