Is this movie joke? Is this not comedy? Definitely this is not a serious thriller? There is no indication that there is any intended humor, but in some cases poor performance, poor directing and scary scripts are loud in the movie. The plot is acceptable - a young artist near the summit that burns the wrong murderer. The killer young artists see his work portfolio and decides to perform his work. In the show, the murderer meets the dead artist's sister and they fall in love. It's all very predictable, and it does not guess anyone because it's a very limited script. This film is located in Vienna and around Austria, which shows what a beautiful city. Do not waste your time on the film, how to star, direct, or script in the movie!
