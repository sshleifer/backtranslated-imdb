I first read about "Larna Doon" about 20 years ago and loved it! While the West has traveled from London for several days, the law and order are very difficult to implement. Sadly, this version of the book takes many freedoms with the story and is very disappointing in my opinion. Acting and production values ​​are terrible in a chaotic story. Why do television adaptations do this? Why do thousands of fans in a book want to change the story? One of life's greatest secrets! The BBC made a fantastic version of Christmas in the early 1990s, and I'm still trying to track a copy! Take my advice, read the book and do not bother with this pulp version!
