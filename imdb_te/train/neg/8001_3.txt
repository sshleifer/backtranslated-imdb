Monster - he is great; I loved the special effects of this monster that looked like an updated version of "The Creature from the Black Lagoon". <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMERCIALS: Most stories happen in the quarantine area of ​​doctors (under orders from government). Disease like SARS is out there in the state. In a nutshell, get the government cover-up story we know. You know, I believe that this Liberal Paranoid opinion with Hollywood images always reflects our government as corrupt, but the Koreans seem to be copying the format, and it's very tedious. Here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this "monster". It just drags down the picture. <br /> <br /> Moral: A simple "do not pollute water." This is because the message is a terrible evolutionary monster. A nuclear-atomic bomb message from radioactive orphans, spiders, fish, or slacky science fiction films since the 1950s. Now focus on its "environmental issues". <br /> <br /> Humor This is very stupid. I usually look at the slapstick but it's not funny. I do not know if the humorous Korean feeling is pitiful, or ultra-corny with the intentionally taking the old "Godzilla" movies. <br /> <br /> Transfer - video transfer is good. It's a sharp-looking image and sound with a very back-speaker audience sound. I see this in Korean with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> Overall - It's a promise but it's big disappointing and frustrating at most places, which is inexcusable for a modern day monster film. Two hours long for this story is too long. I do not know how to shoot record groups in Korea. They can not have too much on the way to the images to enjoy and support.
