This is probably the worst picture I've ever seen. Again the cinematography in the film is nice and the back cover face is very good (because after this purchase and the movie "Melkolence" which I have reviewed here, I learned my lesson). I loved the horror films in the woods or in the desert or in agriculture. This is probably going on in Texas forests, but was probably shot in the director's backyard. The product is probably the worst I have ever seen. The actors are definitely worst. The story is that this story does nothing. I tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other "mother and pop" stores that bought DVDs and did not take it. What is awful this poor painful need for an image is not necessary. I've seen some bad movies before (eg Troll 2) but this definitely takes the cake. I did not think there was a worse picture than "Troll 2". Boy I'm wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone makes you free, but if you do not bother with me, if you deny it, that's what I'm going to do !!!!
