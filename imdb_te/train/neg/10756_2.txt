It is clear that the number of comments on the film is going to be two kinds of science fiction films. Very well read, very literate, and intelligent. They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know what heights to reach in the hands of an amazing writer. For many years science fiction literature has suffered in the dungeon. My reviewers felt a bit more than stories meant for tomorrow's and foreigners for pre-mature young people. Today's well-known fan knows this history well, and great writers Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury and Ellison know. By doing so they created intelligent stories that spread the boundaries and provoked ideas to rebuild the human condition. These well-known fans have criticized anything that throws them into Hollywood. It's not complicated for their own desire, but look at each submission of a responsive eye. (It's like they're less than Hollywood's record star.) The story should have a great deal of importance to these fans. They can not be fooled by elegant computer graphics, and non stop action sequences. <br /> <br /> When the emperor lacks any clothes they are shouting big. <br /> The second type of sci-fi film is little known about the writing of the genre. ("I do not read this book or book anymore ... see above in many of the above comments) Their full reaction to science fiction comes from movies or SFFI channels, with huge plot holes, weak campus and narrow strips lines that they are healthy for bang-action and amazing special effects If they are given the dose they are their criticism For the duration of the cinematic period of cinematic thinking (or maybe they never existed), though I am based on the small stories of Robot Asimov and based on one of his novels, it is very small in Asimov's written and humanity and robotic creations. Among them, the robot was very surprised-the film was directed on all the stories   రపడి ఉండదు!) <br /> <br /> ఈ చలన చిత్రం అపారమైన ప్లాట్లు రంధ్రాలు , కొన్ని పాయింట్లు క్రెడిల్ యొక్క పరిమితులు వరకు విస్తరించి ఉంటాయి నేను వాటిని అభిప్రాయపడుతున్నారు లేదు on't చెంచా మీరు ఫీడ్. మీరు నైపుణ్యాలను ఆలోచిస్తూ, మీ కోసం వాటిని కనుగొనడానికి మీరు అవసరం. Asimov characters are characterized by characters that do not have complex intelligence, the hallmark of his stories. The protagonist is against all of the action scenes with its action scenes. His belief that humanity is capable of solving problems using their minds is not their fists, but it is important to understand his vision of the future. In short, anything other than name, Isaac is very little about this film. Always uncertain (ie, unexpected) is always: "The film does not have to look like a book, because the media has to make changes sometimes." But this film did not even try to stay close to the book (or books) from the beginning. What are the titles they've taken from written works? It prays the question: Why do you forgive the great thing by hitting the title on your vacuum? Do not save the money and get the rights to the works. It's heading something else. Do not use character names. Trust me No one will blame you plagiarism. In fact, you may not be the title of a motion pictureer who has not read everything that you deny. But the readers are troubled, who they think, who do not like just give you a beautiful light show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Hollywood did not make it alone. It takes up the awkward minded audience, which is the same child.
