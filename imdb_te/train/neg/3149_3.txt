A freelance filmmaker and Edward D. Wood Jr.'s huge fan. I believe that this documentary will ultimately record how amazing and bright Ed Wood actually records. <br /> What I did is self-centered, controversial, and contradictory version of self-breeding. <br /> If people need to remember Ed Wood Jr., people actually remember the second cousin of the vehicle known to the Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> The interest in "Wood" seems to be very low. Only nobody has to take the average spirited swipes at someone who gave anyone a chance! 50 years later, I suggested that many of these people would not be able to promise $ 75. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood is a terrific film producer who tells you how it works. In fact he lived ALL. You move around while watching Ed's pictures, but you can laugh with him and not him. <br /> <br /> But, I'm taking revenge ... the picture back in the back. If you are thinking about Edward De Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want an image about cranky bitter old actors, it's a picture for you!
