I can not believe anyone will like this film. I saw very low budget indie films, but it certainly absorbed. It does not mean that the low budget film should be removed. Horror film should not be demamed. Nothing shocked about this movie. It's just a gore-fest, and especially an unhappy one. The average of these acting, they are not all known, but the story is curious, the dialogue is curious. This film is like "artwork", or something. It is not one of the greatest indie films that cost thousands of dollars, but they are very well made. It is not a necessity for people who are ill with illness to make their reasonable excitement over the film. Other reviews also said that soundtrack would absorb ... most of which was written by the same person and some songs wrote one of the writers. The film does not have the ransom features. My time and money is totally waste.
