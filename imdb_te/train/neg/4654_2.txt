The female vampire will color the young and their blood. She has an assistant who does not like to be a vampire, so he has to do her orders or become a bloodbath. After the killing of some, the assistant will be remorseful and fall in love with the homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this film? Its speed is somewhat slower, it has some strange sound effects (it's ever strange) and the atmosphere (where I'm new jazz) and the lights are not included in the set. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and the girl Vampire can not explain how you can kill her, as you can imagine; <br /> <br /> It is not even a funny lousy movie. Perhaps some of the friends and beer have a lot of funny eyeballs (to be honest, at the end of the 10-15 minute film). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, they are one bad movie.
