I do not know where to start; Acting, special effects and writings are as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the product staff reached a point, "Our job is done, it's time to release". I'm glad I did the first two of the series in the UK too. <br /> <br /> I do not know how other IMDb users are scary when filling the "terrifying" dinosaurs. Down corridors that rotate around rubber hands.
