I am very hopeful for the film because I liked the very genuine love. It seems Disney, however, is trying to make crappy straight-to-DVD sequels art perfect. They deserve a razzie. In fact, many. I thought I thought merit, but the music was absolutely awful and the story was not very good. What happened to the great music Disney used in their films. Mary Papins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have made so many great films really sad over the years that they drown to make sequels that are not good enough to put in the theaters. <br /> <br /> I am not a reference to the upcoming Walt Disney Corporation.
