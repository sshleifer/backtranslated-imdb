For the first time, I wanted to refine myself to the film by writing in this review the need to enter the IMAM. When I read the plot sounded awesome, I thought of a little mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, this is a secular, tired love story and a very contrived and teaser-gnashingly stupid "none-of-the-things-such as these evil movies" - it runs very fast for the worst crimes of the film are. <br /> <br /> This script relies on coincidences and depends on unsustainable and untenable folly. It's just ridiculous main characters. No, in fact, it's angry. And lazy. <br /> - Related to: cheap thrills. <br /> - The main characters. True, the screenwriter has not realized that real humans have never experienced the real life, but has acquired knowledge from bad movies. Thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clips. These are just plots-tools and space-holders that do not have a slight bit of personality. They are "men and women still love each other". It did not appear before 100,000 films, and it was not original or enjoyable. Think of over two-dimensional Hollywood fare and you've got it. <br /> <br /> A character in this film is not even remotely fresh, beautiful or interesting. <br /> <br /> The distasteful, vague resolution of a very bad, "conclusion" might be ill because the film is not going anywhere, it is a dirty mess. By the time you do, you will no longer care. <br /> <br /> "If the movie has any redimetric features, it will be buried with dissatisfaction.
