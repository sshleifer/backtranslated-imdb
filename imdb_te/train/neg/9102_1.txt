I'm ready to go with the original - cruel intentions. It went along with the plot and it was true of one of my favorite stories. However, this film, in my opinion, is a crummy rehash with the same story line and clear character options. I have honestly done what's happening to them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Ligans, not CI) are characters and their interactions, not events. I did not explicitly tell you until I read the IMDB, which means that the movie is a prequel, specifically having a sequel titled "2", but it's a companion piece. For all, like the soft sex version of Les Liezans, I must say that the film is at least read me. I was not impressed.
