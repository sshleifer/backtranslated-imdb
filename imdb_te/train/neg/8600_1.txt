In low budget history. This image should be the worst one. True Thor is some of the most funny characters for the movie, but it is usually plain terrible. I can not understand which person can not run the bunch of slugs. I understand they should be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part of this film is close to slugs in an attempt to bite a person's finger. It's fun.
