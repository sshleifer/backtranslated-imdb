This is the first time you are facing the cinematic fantasy, if you have never seen it before "Moving Picture", you may think that the film is the baby of the gods. But if you see a film, a TV show, Barney the Dinosaur, you will not be impressed with the film. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies. I saw "The Giant Gila Giant", I looked at this swel, and appreciated the film better. It works as a B film. It's a loyal as a lamer dialogue, hockey acting, cheesy effects and real real Gila monster as a monster! Carno 3 does not have much part of B Punch. It has some gore, and Polchek man being funny some times funny but this picture is almost vague, flaccid. It's not a small engine of dinosaur movies. I'm not saying film should not be seen. <br /> <br /> Some people may see the gum drying on a pedestal and enjoy the entertainment. If you are one of those people, then give this shot a shot.
