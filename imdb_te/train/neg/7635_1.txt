I totally agree with Variety's critic reviewer, the film is never funny, cheerful, or excited about creativity about its creativity. Contrary to this, it's worse and lighting is really troublesome. Poor lighting performance can not be improved if it feels that the role of the film will be driven and it is sometimes difficult to notice the facial expressions of the actors. In the English language spoken in the film, many South Africans are struggling and local humor goes into some process. I saw this movie at Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. The comments and reactions of the film come from undesirable and sloppy to the welcoming exit from our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow is not recognized as one of the brightest lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the notable images about our apartheid history are best rated in our 110 year old film history. The film was not released from Cape Town after two weeks and several movies from Durban and Gauteng. It is clearly limited among South African audiences.
