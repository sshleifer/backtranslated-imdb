Evil Aliens Peter Jackson owes a huge debt to Bad Taste and Branded for early films. I have to admit that I do not enjoy these films in particular, and I also say about it. Jake West is clearly the director who is missing his own inspiration. I counted many times the Hollywood film Hollywood film, most notably James Camerons, quoted by Aliens. The blood and gore are not funny in the performance here, the tear of the film tired and pulled. There was a good work as a short film. The actors are poor in the direction and the plots do not exist. The director is trying to pay what he's trying to do, but he's done much better than what others have given here. 4/10
