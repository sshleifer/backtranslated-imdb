I really like the pillow book. The intriguing story, interesting character letters, and Ivan Maggogor was absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, I hate every minute. Greeneye is not particularly fascinated by the film's portrayal and is not for the purpose of the film. I can not get into Vivian Vu's unclear acting. <br /> <br /> From this story you will be disturbed by 4 billion teak windows and kinfigures, which will display the music that music plays. It seems he looks at the original story and looks at the development of the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo beauty that does nothing with anything. "John loves Grandma!" Is a bit like a John Singer Sargeant image presenting in a chintzy hallmark frame. <br /> <br /> The director seems to be a dangerous and horror look instead of Autogure's Ego. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It might be a wonder. In the hands of the Greenway, it was very bad for the finest arts classes.
