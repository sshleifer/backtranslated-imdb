Aaron Spelling was built for television Westerns, which gained tremendous platinum for a seventy three minute film. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is a Marshall Dave Harman of the United States who travels in the Yuma, Arizona Territory to kill one of the local big riders' brothers. <br /> Walker goes to another brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican kid who sleeps at Jailhouse. One day, a villain dressed with Andr√©s blue and another man takes the brother into the street and kills him and suppresses the murder on Walker. Your twenty four hours of work is not good. Walker visits the local Army Castle and the commander's chains rank. The deaths of his brothers were heard in large numbers and returned to the city to earn his chains. The local population of the local population, which became smaller by the local beef, also ranked in the chain areas. With all these chains ranks, Walker still has time to meet the local hotel owner. The murdered army guy dies, the local cattle buyer is trapped, the Indians are promptly talking, and Climax brings about an improbable showdown when Clemax Walker has to prove to a town with a town. <br /> <br /> The death of a Walker family is a semi-subplot with the death of Army Riders. The series, it picked up. Instead, the film suddenly ends, and I'm waiting for the scenes from the next week's exciting episode. Due to fade-outs for commercial breaks, this pacing has stopped all and its story fits. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, hard, and deeper than well. The remaining cast television actors you can see in other television films. The action is very dull, and violence is tepid. The first brother who was killed was shot dead by Mid Torso, and he had no scratches. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but the wrong image to teach children about the evil of these guns! The kids say, here the Mexican kid goes from "very beautiful" to "aurumzyme-inducing anger". <br /> If you do not like Westerners, you do not like "Yuma". If you like Westerns, you still do not like "Yuma". <br /> <br /> It has physical violence and gun violence. <br /> <br />
