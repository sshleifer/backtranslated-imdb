There is a lot of love put on Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr. Fox", unfortunately all love is for her only. Granted, too much time and effort is to make this ever self-conscious quirky universe but try the same time and effort and put it into the script to make it funny. <br /> <br /> The surprise thing is that I thought it was Wes Andersen's best. <br /> <br /> The animation is fine, the more everything away is the eyes become really tough and looks perfectly honest as a bit of a mess. Nothing special about the acting is really unique, perhaps because the Wes chooses his buddies and big names, perhaps the image may have been better on the special voice actors. George Clooney's voice acting resume features two guest appearances in South Park, one of which has played a dog. <br /> <br Although the film is very selfish, different and is generally set in England, ordinary Americans play basil ball, but bad guys are the most humorous English with the most insulting English tunes. I can not stress how long this film is waste. I once laughs.
