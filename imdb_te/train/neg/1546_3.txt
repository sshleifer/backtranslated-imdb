I rented this movie for some laughs. I never saw the SNL sketch, but with hits like Tommy Boy, and the Waynes World, is not it so bad? Answer: It is. This film is not for relaxing after a hard day at work. I am waiting for a storyline and funny character, but nothing. The highlight is tiffany amber thieson, and about it.
