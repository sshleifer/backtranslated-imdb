I thought I would be really afraid of this film. And this is it. I really had a star-studded cast- Kathy Beats sorry as an amazing actress ... Before she made this film - Vince Wagner and Paul Giammitty were disappointed but Miranda Richardson did not make me one of the greatest performances and love for her. Fred's father has a line, played by Trevor Peacock (including the vicar of Delhi fame, among others). <br /> <br /> This plot is imaginative and there are all over the place, and humor ... the absence. (However, Santa is a part of the family of the Jewish family ... their expressions are laughable because it's classics) Do not look at the film except for your other alternate head (actually-maybe the train is good ...)
