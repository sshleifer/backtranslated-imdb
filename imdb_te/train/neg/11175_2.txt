Unless anyone shines me, I really have no idea about this film. It looks like an image with a message, but it's too far away. The film tells a story about a New York press agent and his problems. And, basically all. When the agent plays by Pacino, it must be important. But there is no hard idea to figure out what this film is meant to be meaningless and dull. In Al Pacino, one of the best actors in the world, the second film of the year (the other "Simon"), which is "the year's boring and most nonsensical movie". So what's all going to happen?
