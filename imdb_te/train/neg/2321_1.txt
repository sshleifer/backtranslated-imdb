I can not believe this presentation is still rating from 10 to 9. I could see if the votes were in the first 2 seasons, but could anyone still maintain a high rate afterwards? I'm a huge fan of the 1st season. I'm hooked - all the secret, suspense, unexplained events. You never know what's going on next. By season 2, I still look loyal, but some of the basic things are still baffled. And instead of giving you more answers, this is consistent with more questions. <br /> Now, when I finally get me out, somewhere in season 2, I can not even remember. That's enough. I'm not a big fan of an appointment view - you can not clearly see an episode that you can find out exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> They are shy about the less intelligent and loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that ABC has just got greedy and decided they can see how long this show is out. In the end, they do not realize they will probably lose more fans than profits.
