Ahead spoilers, but really have a priority? Have you read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Is this possible? Why ancient civilization buried artifacts around the world? When did you answer this question? Why is it unfair to crawl the opening text? Why a nun? (She's obviously Nice!) Why do 20 orphans be given a madman? Is there always gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does the departure of the shaft of gold mine in the front yard of the orphan does? Why is Tarah Reed's character suddenly shown in the Christian Slater Apartment for Sex? (Or do I answer my own question?) Why even a non-archaeologist bang openly worthy solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why do modern computers still display objects with green pre-tron-era grid objects, complete with "bleeps"? And should the whole film blast timers be digital displays? Why not make any sense in this movie?
