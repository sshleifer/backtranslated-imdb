Filmmotography: Looks good and good camera angles (I do not remember seeing a movie with a good intimacy until this film). We could not avoid the gruesome scenes with a soft camera. NY picture is good. I liked the angles upside down, especially (the other touch). <br /> Music: Good. The songs do not stick to your mind even after seeing the movie. However, I have evaluated the same quality as "Unyan". A disappointment. <br /> Actors: Kamal is slowly removing from hard-core action sequences. His age and belly really show up. Also, he should go ahead with sex scenes. It's very awkward to see the star of the mature / elder trying to play as a 20-year-old heroes scenes. Love at any age can be expressed; <br /> <br /> If the cauldron comes with this name, the cauldron is not just visible, in the picture. She did not know why she agreed. <br /> <br /> Others have only a small presence. <br /> <br /> Directed by: Gautam is an excel (or measure) film "Kaka Kaka" for his other people. He frustrated me. The film took a long time to release due to various problems. He falls in some scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is just okay movie. Many graphics. <br /> <br /> For children (and adults who expect kind of "entertainment") are not for. <br /> Thx
