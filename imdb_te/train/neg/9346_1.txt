The film is an instrument for credits from titles, which is boring and acting on the point of the tandem and engraved and frozen! This was directed by director Richard Jabson, but this script, which is greener on the planet, has grown poorly? The downtown government project (Scott Screen Screen Surprise, surprise credibility) is another money down. I fell asleep three times and my review is unfortunately more restrictive than this. Please, Mr.Jabson, please do this before you direct this relief of this film, go back to it!
