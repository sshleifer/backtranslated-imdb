Dragon Fighter is the first science fiction channel (I'm now known as a serif?) Original image I have ever seen. But I have seen one or two others, I tell you that they are stupid, but this person really gets into the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is perfectly fine, the performance is cool, the script is ridiculous, and what's going on at the end is unexpected and out of place (if you see a dragon fighter, I probably do not know what I mean), put a spoiler in my review. Plus, this is a musical tune that is pretty much used in every serious order. It's really stupid; They just played it over and over. And this is definitely not the original; I have heard before somewhere (where I can not remember). This is the one to avoid.
