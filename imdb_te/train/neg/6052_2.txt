Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns", John Carpenter's Season Masters of Horror Series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between Madness and the 8MM model, but it's still very good for the given budget and time barriers. With "Pro Life", however, low budget and time limits will show more than anything else. There is always a solid direction from the carpenter, and there is a quality of writing and overall production that gives the whole and complete rush feel. The script is not always obvious, the message is fuzzy, and the story plot holes full once you look back at them. Perhaps if you rewrite the Carpenter script, it might be worth the episode. Instead, it's only a mess that Carpenter fans will find in the slightest pleasure in the sign is certainly the worst carpenter ever made. 2/10
