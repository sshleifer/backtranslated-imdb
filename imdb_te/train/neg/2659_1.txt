Sorry, it's just awful. I told the people about this film and some of the bad acting in it and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with this idea, the modern day Japanese troops are back in the days of Basido warriors and their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. Do the forces first realize something strange is not every person behind the shipment needs to say "Hey stopped my watch"? Imagine unexpected lines that are going to repeat 15+ times before they say anything else and you will have the image's greatness briefly.
