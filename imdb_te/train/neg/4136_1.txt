I read reviews before I saw this film, and I did not believe them. I love the worst movies and I guess this is an average. It's not. The film will make Camp Bled 1 and 2 great. The film has bad acting, poor sound, poorly confused storyline and bad makeup - and I was very upset and I stopped it. Even nudity is the worst! Do they have a budget for this film? I do not think they are. You can say whether you liked the movie in the first 5 minutes. u If a good cheesy ghoth image is a poisonous avenger 4 or camp blood going to watch. Avoid this trash - I have viewed it on TV and do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
