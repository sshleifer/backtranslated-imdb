I think it would be a much better film if Cajuns were shot in a more unbelievable light. My family is in the southeast of Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (approximately 20 miles from Charles). I have never heard people grow up when I spoke like these folks. Cajuns are backed as rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are not well educated, proud and do not mean to be illiterate when speaking to these people. Everything is okay with great scene and music in all the scenes. I realized that the writers came from Lake Charles, but I knew about this area, but the love of Cajun's love for all things, the actress's language, lived in the people who portrayed you and tried to behave like them. In my opinion, when the actors believe that they are the person, it's a more enjoyable movie!
