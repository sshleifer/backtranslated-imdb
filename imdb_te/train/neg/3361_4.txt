This film is one of the greatest films ever made, which has everything to do with a movie great. Incredible Performance, Awesome Special Effects ...... Oh Wait. I thought about good movie. Well not one of them, it's just plain. <br /> <br /> If I want to know what is the bone head? When I cast my vote there were 206 people who knew what was happening on their heads. Now for any other vote, an 8 or 9 is very high, but a 10 ??? How good is it to give this film for 10 years? I know this is the 206 same Jean Claude Van Dumm√© felt a great dramatic actor.
