It happened with President of 13 in 2005, it happened with Lost Boys in 2008 and now it has been done with another classic from 80's Wargames ... :( Why, oh why why not Hollywood never learn? Leave them alone ... They can not rebuild ... they will kill us .... we hate them!! 1983 version Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedie, rent and buy now .... You can see the date of the week, the special effects are not the new millennium but still hammer down these rubbish hands ... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived in hacking when sexy in the 80s, the internet was mysterious and your disks were 8 "floppy We have a sense of avoiding this movie like thermonuclear war! <br /> "Chess is a nice game before" good Mpika never felt before ....
