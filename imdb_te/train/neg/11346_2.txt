Faith Domhergue (known as "Doctor Ruth" in the island territory) is the only reason to watch this film. This story is very narrow, and when the Air Force buddies return with a Cobra Curse to the states, the action is just a waiting game. Try to see the woman in the snake and try to act on the other.
