This image deserves credit for its original approach. It consists of combinations of theater, film, and epic stories. Unfortunately, it will be flat at all levels. The biggest weakness in the movies is that it does not adhere to anything; It has camp, ethics, and epic elements. The protagonist, Chr√©tien de Tries, spins in his grave in this terrible adaptation, which transforms the unloved, unsustainable innocent percussion into a very unusual and barbaric chiral. <br /> Many people see two types of these, francocoils or orthutriphils. In the next film, the film is not very rare and I find a very innocent and disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
