People who really liked the child (1990) must have had their heads examined. Who takes the idea of ​​an evil little boy seeing loss of others and thinks it funny? The film is not funny, never, in any way, the ending. It wants to be a cartoon, but people do not realize that writers are not joking if they are attacked by bears or with baseball bats. It may be funny in cartoons, but not in the movie. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker young hero junior (Michael Oliver), who is an infant, is placed in front of the parent's door for adoption. <br /> <br /> He had an orphanage where he was frightened by nuns, and trainer Paul-Tie killer (written by Paul Paul letters to the killer) was Michael Richards. He is soon dying by Bin and Flow Haley (late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Asbeck), who are killing a kid to be like every other parent in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jr. Hayley is a member of the house, and he rarely destroys a camping yard by placing a bear on the site or "Little" Jack Warden, a big politician, although his father threw a cat in "Big" Ben (cat). <br /> <br /> We want to take care of the junior, so that when we take revenge for the people we can for him. <br /> <br /> But the junior laugh is not funny - his new mother, Flow, a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl - who despises adopted children - is a spoiled brat - It is average, cruel, sometimes deadly. <br /> <br /> What is the message of this film? Should those children resolve violence and destructive issues? Will they seek friendship by killing the killers? They do not exactly know what a bad kid is like. Jr. is not one - he's just a sadistic, small twerp. There was a time when it was bad when hitting the children. Now, junior laughing at everyone when a child with a baseball bat strikes. <br /> <br /> The film was sold as "family comedy". What's worse is the issue Child PG Rate. What was the idea of ​​the MPAA when they saw it? Here is a surprise between the PG and the PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy this, but what the parents are watching will be shot on the screen. And for most people, the problem child is considered a "guilty pleasure" classics; The film is intriguing, even though it is a narrative narrated by a more serious audience, although it is a film that anyone can be ashamed of.
