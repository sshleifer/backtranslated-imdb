I do not know what idiots gave to this film at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. I could not believe that someone would make such an abusive movie because I actually saw the whole thing. There is nothing curious about the plot, the letters are depth and there is no effort to give any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this movie, cinematography is just a hand-held camcorder and you can see the main stuff in half. This style is more successful in films such as "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense, which lends that style to any loan. I realized that at 2 o'clock in the morning it could be terrible.
