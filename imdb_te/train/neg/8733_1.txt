*** Possible Plot Spoilers <br /> <br /> I worship Dennis Hopper. I questioned why I accepted the role of a police detective in The Spreading Ground in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is a small town, which is a contract for a sports arena. A hitch: is the killer on the loose and is bad for business. Meyer will make a deal with the Irish mob to make sure that the killer is not found and the court has never been there. Dead. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants to catch this guy a lot, but he believes in the scale and system. <br /> <br /> He wanted the system to see its work. <br /> It looks great. It might be inspiration. It's terrible. First, they call this person a serial killer. Wrong number. There are specific criteria and none of them are fit here. The bad guy was killed on the first day of 5 days, and I think it was 2 on the second day. This whole movie is like 48 hours .... original serial killer action. I do not care for the cynical expectations I give him, the serial killers will do their job for a long time. They will not only do 7 children to kill suddenly in just two days. <br /> <br /> If that's the boring side, acting is worse. Here is only the name Hopper, and he is the only person who came close to pulling his piece off. Unfortunately, he thinks he's a kind of cast-and-cast and he has done very well. This is not a good vehicle for Hopper. It does not make him better, it works with all creepy. The Irish Mob Guy, Johnny Gold (Tom McCamas - Night In Long Days Journey In Night), their research is just as strong. Contradiction? Not really. He's trying to play cool, hard dry guy and he makes the point that the character is just wooden. Maximum boring. He did not intimidate me. He does not induce any emotion except boredom. <br /> <br /> Whenever the film ends, I can not tell how long I watch. <br /> <br /> Previous TV movie. You know my purpose. Reduced scenes to save poor production values, low budget, costs. Now. Yanno? <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlain is the director and cinematographer in this project. He was a little off when he was chewing. I can not imagine that Hopper has taken this role as a personal aid to a friend. I'm only coming up. Vanlain is the first director of the work and cinematographer. <br /> <br /> If I decide to torture you in this case I will not destroy the end, but I'll say that they all got the ball out here. .. also Hopper. In an emotionally gut-watched scene for detective, it's just a blogger. I did not see Anging along with the whole gear-change I made with this guy. Very frustrating. <br /> For 100 days of violence and language this is rated R and R. A 13-year-old boy does not have any interest in this matter, so do not worry there. It is not suitable for anyone anyway. <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later.
