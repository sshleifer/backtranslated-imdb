James Bishop (Matt Stacy), a young psychiatrist, takes his residence at St Andrew's mad shelter or "mental illness facility". Bishop of nearly 600 patients will meet with Dr. McCarth (Bruce Payne), who is working and receives the 'A' ward of severely diagnosed & dangerous patients. Bishop finds a dead body and threatens graffiti messages with spraying sound in his room if he is not the victim during his first round visits. Bishop begins to hear stories from patients about bad efforts at greed & soon finds stories for him to have more than the truth of the truth about them ... <br /> <br /> Damned's asylum is directed by this supernatural horror film Philip J. Jones in the US & I liked sort of but in the end there were so much unsatisfactory stuff for it to fully enjoy. Matt McCabe's writing script is pretty intense & I have a lot of thought behind & some of its ideas but there are some things that work on it. The film is very slow in the beginning, the story is very good and does not get too quick, but it takes me a full age to go and I'm quickly lost interest in every passing minute. I also felt the end of the so-called twist was very predictable & the end was very tender & unforgettable. It's a shame because I liked the story, character's, setting & some ideas but it's just too slow & frankly dull to keep it entertained at 90-minute intervals. <br /> <br /> Director Jones is doing a good job, which is actually a very light and very atmospheric picture. I can not tell you that there is anything scary here. I'm not sure if Hellburn is shot in a real mad shelter but it's not all that good, as they do not have a great job on the sets. Unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action, two hand-stamp shaped wounds & a strained tongue & it is absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore to go down a disappointment. The special effects are bad or good for most people, with a dedicated shield of low budget horror, and most of the reviews you have read and review. Although it is an impressive suit, the effect of a suit rather than a terrible CGI computer graphic. <br /> <br /> Technically this movie is good, it's good enough, welcome to me lack of CGI computer effects. <br /> <br /> Hellburn is a disappointing picture of me, there are some good things about it, but at the same time some terrible things that are unfortunately underestimated. I liked parts of it but I think it's impossible to recommend anyone with a total 90-minute viewing experience.
