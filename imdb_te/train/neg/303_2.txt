It is impossible to consider this film objectively. I did not try, but I sat down, and I pop in the VHS ages, and I did not see the opening ... and suddenly I was five years old and with open eyes and an eager heart, holding my own care bare. <br /> <br /> The film includes a Bidger Merchandising-Mascots and a crazy lovely boy with a mix of Bidgar business, a narrow story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five year old, "Yes! Care Bears!" Every time I thought about it. So I recommend this film for those who have seen during their early youth (and carefully, reluctantly) and who would like to call the incredible power of nostalgia while looking at it (like me) or that lovably cynical Gen-X / Y-minded deliberately stupid / This image is a category that belongs to a particular category). For those who are actually looking for a compelling image or healthy entertainment entertainment: you can keep looking.
