This film is terrible. <br /> <br /> "The first one, the good things: it's great, some shows are okay, the bad things are about it. <br /> <br /> , As you may know, about a Friday twin searching, going to fishing and talking about some of the blocks that find the body, into the cell phone line. <br /> <br /> In this movie (at this time the boy Taking time) for this central celebration <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed that the ensemble of characters (about a dozen) and the other (which, I suppose, are stable, because they are all unpredictable) <br /> <br /> One failure in the lives of the hero is that this is about the film that we do not care about. Ocincadam difficult. After you set the bar so high, it is suicide, everyone is very low. <br /> <br /> silly errors in reasoning. Killer dampings body in the lake, and somehow it miles into the mountains in the distance. The fishermen go out on Sunday morning, but for some reason his wife goes to bed and Byrne returns home late. The first thing Cops bang on the door was to get him to the station the next morning. Um, did they not hear about the telephone? <br /> <br /> The media at the station finds that the whole story is less than 24 hours after they report the body. <br /> <br /> The missing thing from this story is that the blocks are mandatory after finding the body. This is a secret - how can everyone ask them? And the audience are asking the same question. (A crucial scene in the debate "Deliverance" on what to do with the body). I know exactly what I am in their situation. Go to the car and go to the mobile line, call the cops, wait, and then turn them back to the place. If others wait at camp and fish, who cares? <br /> All of this seems very sneaky. The only thing that is true, the girl is black, the local aborigines have captured the fisherman's actions as racist - "if it's a white girl it's not full." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the plot, but not the theme - There is boredom and confusion at one time, when there is a twist, suddenly it's a ridiculous end to the black-and-white reconciliation with a few dirty things about the silence of the Aboriginal people. <br /> <br /> According to The Age, the Australian film " the best ".
