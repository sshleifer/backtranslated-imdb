<br /> <br /> In other reviews, I can say that the audience can give you all the smoke and glasses you want, still no one lives. <br /> <br /> The director is a great eye for the 30s Art Deco (which I love), and I think that I have the idea of ​​using all the digital themes and a future wave of film making. However, the director is clearly showing interest in digital film rendering of his film, he forgot the film with many scenes that helped a surprisingly thinned-plotted film. (SPOILER) For crying out loud, they forgot to have the villain in this matter! OK they have one, but he is dead for 20 years by the time the film takes place. Coron missed a villain housing point. Until an action is lost, a ski, two robot, two or three flapping wing planes (before the Decks (before Ribisi) tells him to stop firing at them!), And a couple robots, but mostly his time looking tightly and his battles for him Others spend their time to get out. Polly or Peggy or Palti or Paltrow or the entire film (the reviewer is not right about the lack of her and chemistry) and I saw her coming back from the age of 70, for a little sick of seeing the repetitive shots on her camera, but both of them are in the shots As shown. Nobody except La Law and Paltrow do not have any time on the screen, and that is a real flaw of the film. Audience does not notice robots, they need a hero for it, and hate is a visible, despicable villain. Without that, plus a good attracting story, not all CGs in the world can help.
