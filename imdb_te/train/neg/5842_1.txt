<br /> <br /> It begins well with the title sequence, but it's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> Rats become monsters, killing spree. This acting is not too poor, but the script is meaningless and the atmosphere is not scary even though it's music. <br /> <br /> This group is mixed in a boiling bag, making it a good image. <br /> This is not a good movie. It's even worse, I want you not to waste a minute of your life! One in ten.
