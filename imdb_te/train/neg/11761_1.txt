Complete the drift. Fraud a decade ago, the unfortunate expression of poisoning culture. In this film, the pedestrian saddle for slavery is mixed with immigrant subtitles (tortured red head shaft?). Forget the most historical reality. Many western slaves come from West Africa? An American slaver easily captures Shakas with a few men. Finally, David Haselhoff was not worse. How can he just look, how he ran in miniseries? (Instantly obscured). Miniseries is awesome, and DH is unfortunate that it has earned her hands on something special, and it has made the world a reality. (I tend to think that he is hand in creating this flop).
