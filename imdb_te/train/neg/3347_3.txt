I do not know why I liked Dolph Lundgren. I feel like I see on the screen I feel that anyone who works hard can succeed without talent. It is good for all of us who are not talented. Some of the other reviews are dumb execution, but there are many negatives to highlight the positives. <br /> <br /> The film that killed at least one annoying teenager is not all bad. Many of the films that have been cast in teens have mature teens. What kind of teens? Every group of teens have an angry black guy? What genius is it that nobody wants? Very friendly and (in the movie) a morally girl pregnant is disturbed by a social anti-white boy from a broken house that accepts everyone (what's the talent?). And a laid-back black kid that tunes with the Universe and all other nerve babies are very good at trusting him all. Then add a simple costable teenage couple of any color. They can not say much but are shot at some points. <br /> <br /> It's nice to have bad guys scold the school. With excellent writers. The conversation is bad and the plot is even worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally hijack the van full of supplements, then they sit inside the van made. Van Vaughn goes to school and they want to re-paint Van in the school paint shop, but they never get to repain Van. By the way, it would have been easy to put just another car or two cars or all the drugs on another van or truck, and the police would not be able to drive back the van. They never even move drugs or sell them or do anything with a big score. <br /> <br /> Whenever you do not care about schoolchildren they decide to kill schools and teachers (dolph lundtren) for anyone. Some people still do not work with painting vehicles in school, so why should they take them back? <br /> <br /> However, the villains have been armed with many machine guns in the best part of the film, and they find teens (including a guy in wheelchair) and they miss hundreds of bullets at teens and usually miss. At the end of the film there is some bloodshed. Every time someone is shot, at least three hundred bullets must be shot. Battles are very bad. <br /> I have read one of the reviews that the film has a budget of $ 10 million and I am surprised. When I saw the film I read, Lundren made some kind of charity program for some movie school teacher. Perhaps this film is their end of the year's test. It was a test to see, but I passed it.
