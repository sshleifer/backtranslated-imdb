The film contains Daniel Petty, a beautiful brunette. She has wonderful green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the final scene. She is not contrary to this film. <br /> <br /> This film is a serious catastrophe that kills film career. She is not good for this film. This is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or far remotely. It does not specialize in production. It sounds like a bad student movie. The horror of the story is not the fact that you are sick, the fact that it happens to you very little when it makes you ill. If I could, this film would give ZERO stars.
