It made me really impressed. The director / writer / actor must actually be really attractive. I can think of any other way that the script does not pass the step. I want to see these pictures ... looking at the pictures that are being apologized to the actors. It felt like standing in the dying and sitting comedy club on his feet, was not happy, and he felt really bad when trying to find him. I want to know what the budget is, because the image quality is really weak and it should be low. I want to write 'Jokes did not appeal to me'. But in fact they appeal to you, you have to write them. Or a retard. So suppose that in the form of the script ... and this guy will light green. Is not it impressive?
