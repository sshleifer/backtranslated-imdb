The film was critically and box-office fiasco in 1957. It was created based on a novel, which later became a play - it flopped on Broadway. There is a story about some Naval officers in San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4-day holiday spending at Marc Hopkins Hotel. This movie is very moving and there are no characters. Carrie Grant is generally intelligent in comedy and drama - but here he plays a sort of wheel dealer and he does not really pull it out. Tony Curtis or James Garner had good options. Audrey Hepburn was initially ready to play Grant opposite, but there were other commitments - so Suzie Parker met. She did not appear before, but it was America's top photographic model at the time. I think she has done a good job. Grant attached a few brief scenes with Janean Mansfield - did not really work. She is trying to give her some class by dealing with the studio grant - but there is no substance in the role.
