There are three films in this animated style, and I remember the love from my youth. The film, "The Last Unicorn," "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit." I have two excellent copies of "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (two amazing) and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" for over a decade. It's up to today and I do not want to. What scripts have for me is very sad. It is very choppy and often inane. Things can happen without any reason and there are other things without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here; We're talking about key plot points! This story is not great, but the script is good but it can work. Not even close. Music on top is awful! I know the music is rarely called classic pieces, but the music in this movie has come to my head with a bowling ball. One of those films I'm going to show my kids for a few days, but it just has to be cut. I do not think I could sit through that garbage fest again. Disappointed.
