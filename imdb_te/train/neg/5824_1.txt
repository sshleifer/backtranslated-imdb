I thought it was beautiful at least beautiful. It is slow, pretentious, and boring. I was almost asleep. There are some good songs, but in the end there is only one song, which is "Yuval"! When someone hits randomly on a wooden object. It is said, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth watching the hte movie. Go to iTunes (they have the album), preview it and choose good ones. <br /> <br /> Half is a person who makes cinema tea. Well, this is a bit more exaggeration. But if you look at it, you'll see what I mean. Saying: Do not look!
