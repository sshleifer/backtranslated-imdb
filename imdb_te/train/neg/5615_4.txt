I saw only DVD 1. A proper program may have 10 minutes of good information; Otherwise it is the unfortunate misfortune of the religious people. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Fleming recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and with these tools he can easily resist his opposition. <br /> <br /> Fleming widespreadly on his personal issues, the film. <br /> <br /> Religious people are more likely to reduce skepticism when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in improper harvesting. Claims from victims are irrational and therefore unreliable. <br /> Anti-religious people need more information. <br /> <br /> There is no need for us to say that religious people are more damaging to American Jews than to tell how the Christmas music is in the middle of December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, Fleming's superintendent will face the director on his inspiration for childhood Christian school. <br /> <br /> If Fleming has a little more self-awareness, he can give his / her "never-present" content to a more serious documentary about himself. <br /> < bonus interview is very good. <br /> <br /> The bonus interview is very good, they are not very strong in Fleming's thesis, Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and that other non-Christian religious Harris also has some good (and easily Google'd) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
