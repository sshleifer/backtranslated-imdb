Virtual reality, the likelihood of computers, the past communication, continuous struggle in the continuous struggle, and the graceful Tilda Swindon's lovely Ada Byron Lovelace, the film must be great. It's terrible if you take into consideration the probability, it's terrible! Acting - from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - can not afford the innocence. Plot construction is a bit daunting to say - the modern programmer is a dull character, but half the film is set to form her character, and when Adha finally looks, she does not have to show an engaging story to describe the events of her life (however, Swindon pulls it almost). <br /> <br /> Digital effects such as a digital dog and bird are incomplete and disorganized, 1997 and not 1985. And, finally, the script is just bad. Bad, often solemn dialogue - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, has made me try to create the coolest and distant characters, and the wonderland to create a wonderland. Previously the programmer successfully approached a person! Surprise! But it does not surprise anyone, and her boyfriend, "Well, be careful." <br /> <br /> Though computers, Ada Lovelace, love to mathematics, it is not even dangerous. <br /> <br /> Any references to these consequences are the complete mumbo jumbo that refuses to commit antitrust suspension. <br /> <br /> A scene, this film, is very good, Tilda Snanton is a monologue expressing her happiness in life, but expressing her happiness in life. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed in the film because this is a missed opportunity for a lovely little worship. If you find interesting stuff, you have to rent it, but it will be said before. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler / Question: <br /> <br /> The film asks Ada not to preserve her memories (I thought it was the best scene in this movie). But then modern programmer transfers memories of his little girl (name of the memorial). Am I right, as the programmer has violated Ada's wishes without fighting it? Or what is another confusing story that I am mistaken?
