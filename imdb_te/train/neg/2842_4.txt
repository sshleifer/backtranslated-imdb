I'm astonished! Wow, be prepared blown away by the unusual means of the ninja. They look like caterpillars, caterpillars, fly in the sky, hide from the trees and spring from the trees, ninja stars, blue welcome theater characters, smoke bombs disappear, make a lot of swoosh sounds with their blades and quickly trotting on their toes or their toes . What a sight! I really can go about many traditional activities, but I'll be here all day. Oh also we do not forget to get popping up again epic Chuck Connors, and watch him send some ninjas with his shotgun a little easier. What class! What a badass! <br /> <br /> Ultra-cheap 'Sakura Killers' is some stupid, but cheesy ninja action fun that this larynx can only get any part of the B-grade defeat. <br /> <br /> The genetic lab in America is a very important video stolen by a couple of ninjas. The Americans were sent to Japan by two Colonel (Chuck Connors) to retrieve it. <br /> <br /> This feature opens up very well. Be ready to laugh! Later it slowly slows down, but the two main characters come to steam as they learn about ninja and go through training and they have fled after a thief beta tape with a very important principle. This is when violent swift action and aerobic wedding crafts really come to play. It's not very vulnerable (such as Morani script and daft shows). <br /> <br /> As slow as two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) look in the case, share undisclosed conversations and face some minor problems. How laughs me ninjas these two were kept by how brave and intelligent. These are considered professional killers. Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') has done a lot of enthusiasm for me and plays what it does. As he strikes Taiwan locations, he focuses on on-screen operations. Score is a chintzy arrangement.
