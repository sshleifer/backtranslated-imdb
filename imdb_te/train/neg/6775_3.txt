Cary Grant, Director Stanley Donen, does not like it in the comedy set of services - I enjoyed this movie in a local video library. It surprised me two things - it's all (including some well-known names) have a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it in many things? Still thinking about the first one, but for the latter, I went to the storyline, sometimes the strange script, the uncertain tone, the lack of stable and well-developed classification and the lack of awareness among the characters. You have to add a lot of uneven performance to criticism, but the actors feel that they are struggling with these factors and underneath rehearsed. Very often they can rarely get out of their lines. Carrie Grant tries to paint his usual lovely and cheerful person, but sometimes his delivery feels difficult and stupid. I told him that he was relieved, his role was not as good as Suzuki Parker with Jassie Mansfield. What about the movie? - For me primarily the beauty of Parker also serves as respect for detention and a grace Kelly. Generally speaking, the movie looks good. Naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - but you really have to wonder at Don Ghost Ghost Fu Manchu tunics in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant would not look his sleek. On the back of the credit side, Ray Walson makes his job a favored job and is interested in hearing Hogan's heroes Werner Klemperer before talking to me without an assumed German accent!
