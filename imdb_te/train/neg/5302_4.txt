The movie Deweyna goes through normal clocks. Man and woman fall in love and marriage, the husband was killed by a family friend who wants to surprise her family fortunes, women's reincarnation and surprise surprise husband No.1. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's calm and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shahrukh Khan have performed well. Amrish Puri goes through the movement as a villain and is no more than the standard Bollywood villain. Nadeem Shravan is a great music, all songs are awesome. My favorites are Sachenge Tumhey Pyar or Koi Na Koi Chaiye. Devanna is a simple picture that moves through the movements.
