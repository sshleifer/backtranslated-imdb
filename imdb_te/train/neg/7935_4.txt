I bought this film by Blind and I am pretty much paid for as long as I did, but I'm less likely to rent for some cold deaths and ridiculous performances. It's not a good movie anyway but I said I would make a pretty hole. <br /> As I said, acting is very scary, I feel that at least emotion or good work can be done. This story is not new and good. I have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type image. I would like to rent or download it but definitely did not buy it. It is not worth more than one watch.
