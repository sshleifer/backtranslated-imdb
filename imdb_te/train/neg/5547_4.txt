(2 out of 5 stars), this is not a long-term nutritional ancestor of classic George A. Romero zombie flicks. It has a low-budget potboiler since 1936, which at the time seemed pretty cool for the audience ... but it is very difficult nowadays. At the beginning of a soldier who fired his gun as a crowd approaching zombie soldiers is actually a pretty good scene ... one of them closest to the bulls who entered the bare chest. This effect is undoubtedly today, but I'm sure it's the audience gas in 1936. The story is about the control of the mind control secret ... to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but a way to a woman who wins the woman he loves. The picture is just over an hour but it moves at the speed of the snail so it's feature length, believe me! It really does not have much to recommend ... you can get some fun from the star's fried studio shots of "wading" through a "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I said at least once the value of the film I've seen. You will see an additional feature in the "4 Movies 4" feature on 1 DVD at Wal-Mart for 5 bucks. Hey, it's worth the money ...
