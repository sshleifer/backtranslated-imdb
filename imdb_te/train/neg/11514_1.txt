When Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, they both felt that they would help their film career. If you are through the fire of "sweeping out", then you know that level is a match made in hell. Almost 20 years after her "Eighth" as she said in a respectable actress (or "The Next Best Thing"), she could not have acted and could even call good taste. And that's something people do not like on the screen: her ego is so gut feeling that it is able to let her go with the audience and prevents her let go. If there is any justice in this universe, she made her last chance.
