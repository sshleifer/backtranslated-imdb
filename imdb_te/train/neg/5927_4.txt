Dr. Miranda Jones, Diana Muldar, said that I was a very uneasy person, when I told him that I was sexist, I would really reduce the female guest role. Despite all her insight and self-control, there is nothing but a big, jealous unborn baby that you prolly come after her technical sidekick Marvik, even after a spurned lover, flips out when he attempts to kill Medusan, Ambassador Colossus, from an envy anger, But instead it will show first. (You may think that he has closed his eyes and left the room and can easily ignore the box). Before he can dodge the boys, he enters the un-navigable space outside the galaxy. Correctly, the ship was trapped in a disorder, at which time they might have gone to a better female doctor-link. "Spokes should make a brain with Majuzan, so we can come home, do you like Beetle until I hit the supply to rush?" But the lady in the true Star Trek fashion is a jealous demons whines and wails when her Medusan statue shut herself and told her to go with them, when the idea broached. So he spends his mind on his face to spare despite the mooded spock. Kirk, naturally, was her total and blamed her for fixing Spock with her superior telepathic powers. In fact, finally Lady and Medusan vacation and all are forgiven. You almost wish that the president from war Star Galactica came up to jettison out of witch from a red for her destructive stunt. But in the Star Trek ground, the ladies are allowed to be totally unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time feel sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
