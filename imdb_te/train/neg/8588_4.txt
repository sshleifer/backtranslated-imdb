Sith's Revenge begins with a long acting sequence that does not look terribly exciting, and becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, as well as the terrible dialogue and the proliferation of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the trials is slow - and I slowly - until what we know we will be Darth Vader's birth. And when it finally comes, it's pretty. Not great. Not even good. But pretty right. The film received a lot of praise, because it did not suck the high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead, it is simply so tough, dull and simple. But you have wow, wow, and those around the CGI are very impressive at times. Are light fights? They're all in vague mess. When I started these developments, the Dark Side caught Lucas and no one realized. This makes a ton of money, but it is over God, this once-worshiped franchise has been beaten enough. I saw 12:01 presentation, after that, a group of very small children said, Wow! But those with more than eight people disliked the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It's kind of boring. I thought Darth Vader's birth was better. So we all say that.
