I went to see Omega code in a group of other Christians who have 15 people. We all make good film Christian Film. What we have done is a painful, painful draw and a pretty boring effort in a movie. It has good product values, but poor performance, weak script with louis vuitton outlet, and no sense in direction. From the first 15 minutes we know that we are a long night. We all hated it, and some of our team cut the cheese more than "Anaconda". No one can believe that the film is less than 2 hours. Vivid effects and crisp looking cinematography can not save this bad, bad picture. I give it to 10 to 3, and rating is very high for renting the bizarre "Movie" Werewolf (1996) before watching this movie.
