Missy Ayers (Bolle Stripper) is absolutely glamorous, although the film is sometimes laced to her underwear (she is not naked in 1954 in 1956)> <br /> The person who hires her to work in the Warehouse is similar to Abbot & Costello's Bad Abbott. <br /> <br /> 10. A 2 out of 10. Mrs. Ayers have a curvacious body, but dubbing the entire movie post because you're not the judge of any acting talent. Some of these "exploitation films" are usually later, somehow interesting, but this is really boring. Directed by Sid Melton (room for DADDY). There are some facial expressions and interesting apartments like samurai, but nothing really is here.
