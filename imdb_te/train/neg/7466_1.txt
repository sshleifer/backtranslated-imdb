Wow. Some movies leave me speechless. It's not one of the movies. When I left the theater one word did not come to my mouth. There was a wonderful desire to slam my head against the theater wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this film is not recommended. Humor is at first grade level, well, acting is overly crazy, and the plot is astronomically distant. I have heard that another film starring Chris Kutton or SNL's other cast members should not be seen.
