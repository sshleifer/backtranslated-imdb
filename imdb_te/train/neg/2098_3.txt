I was hoping for some in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and I've got Buzz Aldrin Jean Cruzt and some good interview equipment, over-hyped disaster-intuitive sensational voice with other people involved in the mission <br /> <br /> You can use voice-over If you change the program's spin to a goal, people can overcome the setbacks Rana then this could have been great - but I'm looking at a 60-minute program is a waste of time to feel my life is about 45 minutes. I want to get that minutes back.
