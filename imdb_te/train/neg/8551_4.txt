With the battle against Argentine on the Falkland Islands in 1982, two years after the Iranian Embassy invasion involving the dramatic SAS rescue from the Balkans, what does a better film than the Gang-Ho "SAS" film? The Iranian hostage was creating an invasion, on the same day used the British number one action hero, Louis Collins. Throw in Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and you've got the winner in your hands? ... well not! The film is also not serious, the second rate of acting. It sounds like the movie episode of "The Professionals", but without formula. The film is going nowhere and is very imaginable. Maybe Kabby Broccoli saw the film and decided to hang Louis Collins as a Toted James Bond substitute for Roger Moore. Save your time if your Lewis Collins or SAS Stuff is in the General.
