One of the most frustrating films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching. I saw this movie in my American History class and in the late 1800s saw the farmers' life induction. What we see is that the pigs are shot and killed, human birth and branding. Oh and the end is a calf birth and let me tell you that birth is not too bad, but many liquids that came out of the bathroom drove more people in my class. The story is okay. The story of the story is a widow and her daughter and they go to the west as this cowboy home. They live a life of difficulties and in the end of the 1800s an interesting picture of life in the West. But if you choose, do not watch this movie.
