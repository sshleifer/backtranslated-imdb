Ooof! This is a stinker. It's not 'somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller', that's exactly. All in reality, it comes somewhere between the cracks of a wham! Video and Captain EO, not just a budget bigger, and crying ugly youngsters very close ups. Simon Le Bone uses the front and center, and the rest of the band try to steal their entire career from the last 3 albums of Roxy Music. Add nothing to the brief clips from Barbarella. Avoid all costs. (But when they played 'Hungry Like the Wolf' I liked that role, but why did a tiger change into a woman who had a tiger strip? That is, they say, 'I'm the Tiger' or 'Hungry as Tiger, it's a Wolf!) Anyway Duran Duran's' 80 videos are worth a look for a DVD perhaps nostalgia
