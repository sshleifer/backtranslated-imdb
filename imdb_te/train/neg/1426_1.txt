One question: Why? First of all, it's not funny or engaging at all. They use tape-made interviews, and take audio to animate parts of the speakers. First of all, the interviews are not funny or fun, and if they are, they will not be the first ones to be cartoons, and I'm sure they are very entertaining. How to add any pleasure I found this on CBS's Monday night sitcom lineup (which made me a simple way to rest after stressful Monday work days). In fact, the sitcom lineup stayed in the summer, resume anyway, but those episodes were again entertaining. I tried to give myself to "CC". I really did. When it started, I was funny, well, I shot it. Nope. And keep it going. <br /> If the interview is shown perfectly, I can see that there is an advantage. But, it's just one line clips, cut and pasted quickly together. It looks like a terrifying version of the cartoon network's "Robot Chicken". I'm not a fan of CBS 'now-canceled sitcom "the class." It's a half hour in the lineup I'm experiencing. But when the decision of the whole season of three or more episodes of "Creatures" comes to me ... I want to take "class". For a few hours since it was broadcast, I came here to see the first commenter ... no one can see that this is a good sign, and I guess it will not last long. Cartoon Roadkill.
