Buford's Beach Bunnies B-Grade T & A movies give the bad name. As an artist fan, I was scared to make a little effort to exploit the talent of young actresses. I specifically point to specifically nude and simulation romantic scenes. What's the next generation of sad young boys watching this on TV last night to think about?
