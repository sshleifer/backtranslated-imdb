The film is bad because it's not interesting. It's not a remake, it's not really. I was disappointed that Tim Burton was considering the tools at his disposal. He's made great and has CGI available and has a lot of money ($ 100 million) but can honestly say that it's as good as the original film we've made for less than $ 6 million? Heck no. <br /> At least in the original film, the statue of the free scene was shocked, but there is no final scene in the film. Next. And, by the way, if you give some idea, and I can figure out how you end up. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, He said. <br /> <br /> The movie, The Apes "<br /> <br /> I think it will be as if I wrote it: <br /> <br /> The astronaut (should be more than a marky mark) (Not the movements), a city governed by the APPs, the hunter, and some of the good monkeys have become friends, finding some ruins that are destroyed on earth Knowing that the crazy mutant humans living under the earth are running into a human being, a war breaks between the modified humans and monkeys, and then your imagination runs wildly on how you wish to end it. <br /> <br /> But my opinion is that the film may be too much. Sadly, Tim Burton's downfall is a good thing Think about what he did with the Batman series and he was angry with what people think he is, he's a good idea, he's a good idea, sorry, or no, if someone made this movie, it's very good and very satisfying.
