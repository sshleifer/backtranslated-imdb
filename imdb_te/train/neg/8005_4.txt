Goveluel (The Host) - The transformation of the mutant beast due to pollution in the Han River ends with devastation. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: <br /> <br /> First, I loved monster movies: mature bears, more sized crocodiles, komodo dragons, alluring packs, a whole lot. Favorite genre features of the horror film. So, I really wanted to like the host, but it was not. <br /> <br /> "Drama / Thriller / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br> It's very damaging as a comedy and it's easy to have a genuine message (although it is trying to do some kind of advertising, anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the attacks of the primary monsters attacked There is nothing to do with the whole movie, and when the Korean and American governments do not do anything clear, the central family revolves around looking for one of them, and they wander about a bit of a bit of comedy relief, perhaps another pressing, the absence of action will turn my attention and the entire plot threads are unchallenged (evil A mystery invented by Americans <br /> <p> Finally, the movie is complicated by politics, even though Americans are stupid and ill-faked, we do not give us American characters with more depth than the cartoon villain. The most obvious of the opening scene is the Stupid American vs Clever Korean moment. The courier marge assistant who asked his employer not to lose chemicals to the Hun River. All American clergy hold people as he has ordered to practice the assistant. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster has a good mix of type, the relic and deep rising mixture. Some of the effects of the movement are quite good, and the opening monster chase through the park is fun. There are some good shots in the film. This reminds me of the peculiarity of the way the firefly is painted (highlighting cameras, focus shots out etc.). There is also a nice scene at the end where the hero and a little boy who's saved is sitting in the family's mobile food stall. It drops at night and the snow, the street lamp is giving a cold light, but it has a warm glow from the food stall. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film disappoints me. I'm looking forward to a good creature film and instead I get some fake-political, horror-comedy lights. I can not help seeing the comments on the IMDb but I think this is decided if it is a US product. Just because it's a foreign film cause it's not a good idea. In recent years there have been some great films from Korea (Revenge trio and Brotherhood, for example), but this is not one of them. <br /> Once I'm in favor of the remake. Improve direction, improve scripting, and this may be a good movie. As it is, it is not worth a couple of hours of time.
