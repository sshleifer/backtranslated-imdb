Twenty minutes in this film I'm already frustrated. Quite simply, these characters are very dull. Occasionally, something is happy, but then again slowly. Fortunately, my patience is finally rewarded, and the end of the film is not bad at all. However, it is not advisable to sit and sit for the first ninety minutes. So, if the film is totally simple, taking into consideration the talent in the cast, I'll be disappointed.
