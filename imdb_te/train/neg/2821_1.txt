I have seen this film once, and that's enough for me. The film is much smaller than any plot and continuous scenes of psycho-goodwill violence and anything less. I want to watch this movie because it is the joe drilling of the second "The Demons of Night"; And I want to see a normal person playing. Unfortunately, the Tobey Hooper script just starts and the Robert Inclund dominates the film and praises the scenery and plot. Joe, I know where you are now. Hiding from this movie!
