There is no value in the original film, it is also Lamar. The fact that I also found it rented is absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this image must have something more than one! So what is the story line? What is the girl with? The first four minutes of the film is the story of a storytelling. Sadly, I tried several times to see this. I also got a kid from someone to get an opinion. Kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old. I would probably go to some of the credit filming directors, some of which could have done more than a B film. It may be pushing. I love the theme song. The good thing is that it's only a dollar, it's worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the movie if you should be like cast and crew. Pat legal in France?
