Melissa's sixteenth birthday is around the right corner and discovers her sexuality with her boys. But she becomes all the boys who spent all the air time killed in this simple '80's slasher movie. It is up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying secret two boots march (Dana Kimmel, Friday 13th Part 3) to reach the bottom of the murders. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on the mysterious and nadodrama elements of the film, and the murders are slightly different from the 80s slasser brethren. It does not hurt to have Alesia having a great body (I think the actress is more than 18 and so I need clear tension with telling you that I'm not overly transformed). On the downside, the film is undeveloped and unnecessarily damaged by some plot points, an unpleasant theme is sometimes used a bit, and a tad anti-climate is out. But better than bad (just). <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Director's cut & theater version image; Audio conversation with Star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; Interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; Still gallery; Theater trailer for this movie; Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, and Balakala Conspiracy
