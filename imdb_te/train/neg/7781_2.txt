A very incredible monster that stems from tough guys, sexy women, swear words, and the depths of a pollution lake. You think the "monster" is fun ... but this is not true. It is worth watching at least once in my book, if it is star Tony Eisley and John Carradine. In an interview with "Fongorya" in 1987, Herbert Strock recalled that the majority of the film was directed, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - his children Andrea and Glenn (Andrea and Glenn's particularly inventive turn) - received full credit. Seeing how terrible the final result is, Strauss probably feels he has not been credited! "The monster" has a look and feel of a seventh TV movie from mid-late, which is why I always want to leave it in the background. Though it is fun on its face, it is very effective as a kind of memory for another age and filmmaking. The missing is the only car chase.
