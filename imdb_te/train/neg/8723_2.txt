Very bad movie. Very bad, very bad image. This is rare, but it is not worth hunting. The Italian jaws do not understand much of the time and time to tear down. "Alligator" is not in all contracts, and many sub-plots are nowhere. If it's at a local video store, you might want to see it as a fan of monster movies, but hunting is not worth it.
