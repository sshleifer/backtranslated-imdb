Like all Carnotour films, this is a joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot does not have any meaning. I mean, first they were on a bus, then in a warehouse, suddenly, they were on a boat. And be serious, do not it make sense that the couple of dinosaurs to be together with a van, or on a ship? Dinosaurs considered big animals, and now they fit on the moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 3 is that it is still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (yet did not watched the second). Just do not rent it. I saw on TV and this was the best thing I could do, because I did not want to rent money.
