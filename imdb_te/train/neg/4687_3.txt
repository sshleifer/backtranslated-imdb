Spears (the drama was released in the first two minutes forever) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is pretty good in this friendly, lonely, emotionally lost C. He is very human, sympathetic, and actually disappears in character - there is no small feat as such a notable actress. <br /> <br /> Very bad movie is the rest of the waste. Assistant performances (and performers) can not get out of place in a soft-core porno (each character but a PSY 100% cardboard). Sometimes it seems like trying to disappoint suspense: we know from the very first events) a full-time job, b) he is alive, and c) end. <br /> <br /> This storyline is not of all interest. <br /> <br /> The insertion and compilation of this plot and some unwanted movements (for example, his wife is barrot to his wife's expensive tastes, she spent her free time at the local discount superstore). About two-thirds C, somehow scupided by the way, is surprised how he really cares about his grand revenge scheme. <br /> <br /> The final clich√© description of his psychosis, in 'Tamping Too', is terrible copout. <br /> <br /> Conversation is the perfect waste. It is not fun for any bad movie lovers in any other way, nor is it an awkward or unbelievable. Instead, each line is absolutely, worse functional - the director gave the plot outline to the newspaper copyrise and said, "Hey, I need a script in this work - in an hour. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be the thrill of suburban Beware-the-help thrillers of the eighties and nineties ("Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"). , And if it is absolutely unpleasant, it's never really scary. Ferrinism of the Psy can occasionally feel uncomfortable, but it is not enough to work on the film in its own work. Finally, this will sink the absence of handicraft expertise from everyone involved except Robin Williams. 3 in 10.
