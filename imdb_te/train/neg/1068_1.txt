My wife and I came into the IMDb to complete this film and commeerate with the reviewers I found this film less than satisfying. However, in 10 pages of reviews, only a few are negative. <br /> <br /> I feel that this film is a great feeling of deception and I warned the viewers in the future. <br /> I agree, I do not like the movie more than I do, so my reviews are all negative. <br /> <br /> I'm biased about not enjoying a movie, but I often get more eloquent reviews of movies. <br /> <br /> Paris Joy Tote is a very serious film I have seen in years. By using a "sensible" concept and adding some big talents to many small stories, the film ends worse than all the worlds. It is art for the art of art, but something that is a 2 year old dream and can achieve. The 5-minute directory of the screenshot gives the free regime the proven factor in the field of entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not visit. (I did Clint Eastwood overturned, but he'd turn to an actor and the director {very rarely] because I'd like to throw. <br /> What ends on the screen? The short stories do nothing, they're done within 5 minutes and the whole thing is not Paris. Why do I call Paris je t'aime when more time is heading cluster f * ck? There are only a few stories made by Alponso Cuar√≥n, but the rest will fall into darkness. Coen Brothers are small passable, but can you name their image that does not have a glimpse of a guitar? It was all the directors decided to do whatever they wanted to do and chose Paris as a place to do this. We all love Paris, present company, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS. In fact, I think they would be putting the names of the directors in each film because the directors decided to show how poorly the film was and how they were determined for 5 minutes. Seriously. <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not a good actress. She is not a three-year-old girl waiting for herself. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you acting from other movies or just controlling the shows? I see Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Eliza Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Mary Full of Grace). <br /> One last comment on acting: Nick Nolte plays with daughters and you look more humane than in the ages or you ever do it again. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to write short stories. Some writers have earned the right way. Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and John Chewrey, I'm thinking of some name. It is a lot harder than writing a full novel and can truly accomplish this skill. That's about the small pictures. <br /> <br /> If you define Paris as a gemstone to recognize and reflect your own lenses with your own story, enjoy all of this movie. Directors ignored or lazy. In either scenario, it means that you have rented it by the time you read it. Praise You do not have to pay a head in theaters for it for 10 dollars.
