The slow speed of the film is slow to tell how life has grown into a village girl in China, the director's intention is intended. However, I find the glacier slowly 'plot' and the common filming style of the glacier, especially for the western audience. Sometimes I say a few different roles because it is sometimes shot from such a distance. In two hours and I showed total attention. Not interested in music, but there are many Chinese history and culture (and not stranger for Chinese movies), I can not get involved with a role and get my teeth. It prays the question: If I do not like, who would love on earth? Give me a chong, give me Zhang Yimov. Tell me about any other Chinese director who has seen me before. This sorry attempt is not just measured up at all. I'm sorry to see Chinese film verdict against this benchmark.
