On the weekend in-los? <br /> <br /> The film stimulates a Canatonic state to bring a welcome relief from the nagging continuously. <br /> <br /> The film is a luxury cruise navy unusable car ferry; This plot has more than one hole than an average cast and a cast driven from the depths of the popular D list. The amusing interesting feature is the "villain spot" as the passengers have joined the ship. You can not go wrong! The double-scripts, like a brick, clutch sets pieces, and the double blood of raspberry jam, try to keep the genre of thriller, action movie and gore-fest in the film and fail to fulfill them at any time. <Br /> <br /> If you want to smile badly, you must watch the movie.
