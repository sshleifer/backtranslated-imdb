It's not really a horrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. And yet, they do a very weak script with an acceptable job. The scenery lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Moreover, the actors and crew have made this film, they are experts, they paid for it. But why do I take the studios time and money to make a film and not release it to the theater audience? Although a box box office failure, it makes some money. If you're a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent a video or hold it on TV. Similarly, the film does not help solve the immigration quadrix with Mexico, but this experience is better than 90% today's TV ticket.
