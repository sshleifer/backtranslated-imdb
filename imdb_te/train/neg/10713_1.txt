Come on, get real. The Knights of Christ, the Ardado Tempili, or the Knights Templar did not exist until the 12th century, commonly known. The story is very curious, it is curious. Dalf Lundgren is just as frustrated as he is. Also, if you want to enjoy real life, why not use the Knights of Christ that exists in Portugal. At least they must take into account the history. The only revival quality I find in this movie is that the masterpieces are authentic to pass for medieval or gothic pieces. Acting is bad, storyline is scary, action is terrible, and clues are okay.
