This film is very poor too. I saw good films. <br /> <br /> There is not much bit of tension to get out of your chair but not much. It starts slowly with tension construction. No success. If you ask me at least. <br /> <br /> When people shot and killed at some points or moments, I would say they were a bit more fun. <br /> <br /> They make it a scary movie and have a good picture. I saw only the pieces of the film by immersing the scenes and was bored by the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time in thinking about doing something with this movie. . Somewhere very dirty ..
