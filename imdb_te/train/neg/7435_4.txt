The film (together with Rinney) has been featured in the horror films of 8FTDF "Horror Fest". And, yes, it's really kinda appreciated. <br /> <br /> It is not much worse than those who think that the atmosphere is a coherent plot alternative. <br /> <br /> You will get that with Abandoned. It is almost entirely made in the director's head. Sure, it would have been nice if he'd transferred it to the image, but this happened instead. This is a very beautiful picture with some real fears, but the cut-off viewers are cut off by the last reel.
