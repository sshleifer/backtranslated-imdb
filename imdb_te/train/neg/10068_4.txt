<br /> <br /> A cowboy's chief daughter who is sympathetic to the Indian tribal people is allegedly accused of rape and murder, which leads to much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> These crackpot walk features are absolutely impossible to maintain any artistic level. Terrible costumes and all Indians are obviously white, making this form a live action cartoon that plays like press materials. <br /> <br /> In short, enormous nudity (the real reason to see it) is good. Not everything else. <br /> <br /> Ramarder was filmed at the infamous Spawn Movie Ranch and was not one, but the murder was probably already at the time when the two members of the Manson family hit Katherine Sher and Bobby Beosollle Pussycat Theater's soda-stained screens!
