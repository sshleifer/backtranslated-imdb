This mess is not even scary. <br /> <br /> Debbie Roche's talent is completely wasted in the film. She is not even a villain. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors look like porno vannebbs, and the plot is very dull, and I can not say it too. <br /> The upcoming Band Tomorrow "sex" is a total of 80 disco confectionery songs. The song about the gaming and sex is good. It's more fun than "bleed". Keeping this way, when you have a device to copy videos, decides to record the song at the end of the movie, you actually have a "bad" image.
