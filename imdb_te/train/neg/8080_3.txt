I have a lot of hopes for the film because it contains Charlton Heston and Jack Balance. But those hopes crashed into the ground within the first 20 minutes. The fence is ridiculous. The performance of Heston or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or nude nude scenes) can not save the film. Some of the space effects are very good, but others are cheesy. The plot is ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this one. Grade F
