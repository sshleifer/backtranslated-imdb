I guess this is going to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. It is not good to start the concept of cinema. I do not know where to start, so there are very bad things about this movie. Acting is terrible. Cinematography is fine. Soundtrack is very bad. The score is terrible. This is the reason why the movie ended in Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I can not believe the 9 people actually thought this "film" was fantastic. They should have liked the go-go dancers. If they never locked this stinker in the treasury of the film outside of Wichita and never let anyone see again, the final justice will be! This qualification is better than 10 ratings in 1 rating.
