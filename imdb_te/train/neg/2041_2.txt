Well I start with good points. The film was only 86 minutes long, some of which were very bad. Less points now. My first warning sign came with the original "warning" on the image. When the following "alert" begins to be displayed: "The movie you are going to have is graphic and disturbing images, because it's not fun, pretty, or sexy, as opposed to the famous belief that was killed." I saved myself 86 minutes and turned it off. The first words of the film: "I'm at the glue factory." This is the man who speaks on his phone and he is referring to a glue factory as a nursing home. I do not know why. So some film based on the movie Kidzkalker is engaged and imitating him. The film's budget should be at least 50 bucks and the cheapest cameras they found. Acting is worse than reading directly from the script. They looked at what they were doing. The script is terrible, and the big "twist" is a zodiac killer who actually wrote a biopic in the horoscope killer. In fact they tried to show this skill but it was completely clear in the first 10 minutes. Without any painful details of the plot, here are some horrible highlights of the film. Try to make a comparison of "an army" Zodiac killer because they are just murderers of soldiers. Then they tried to make an attempt at "Satan's Worship" by showing some people in black hoods at a meeting. The great "computer hacker" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to obtain the address of anyone. I'm not sure why he should use it in the phone book or use on whitepages.com. There is a random formula for 9/11 without any reason. <br /> If you're really bad acting, sub par script, bad camera work and a clear plot, you'll love Zodiac killer!
