I saw in an artistic film showing the pictures of "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin. Depending on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "Immortal" a chance. I almost went out of this movie, and I like science fiction! The future of the story is set in New York City, with some similar discussions about blade runner-style ski ads and cloning / synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not enough for an hour and forty five minute film. There are three categories in this world: humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans have the city's upper arm and control the city's politics. Humans are used for slaves and eugenics and organ donations. Is the Egyptian pyramid floating in the Great Pyramid of Khufu (a gentle "pipe in the pyramid and the pyramid of the pyramid is finished with dilapidated light, a floating future pyramid in the right position?) The pyramid is on the city and what is on the ground is understandable about it or why You can not set up with the so-called plot, but There is a lot of unnecessary gore and many macro-out scenes, as I have said, it seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and maybe even The Fifth Element and The Matrix, thanks to the United Kingdom, France and Italy at the end of the film credits. , But the French non-French British actors The French dialogue was dubbed, and this was a distraction, and I also thought I could repeat again between real humans and animations, which does not help animations to be bad - it's better than a video game.
