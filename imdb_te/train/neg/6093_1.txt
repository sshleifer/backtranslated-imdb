This is the worst picture I have ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, did the DVD work, it was not just a movie, but I actually thought I was acting (before judging from acting). There is no real plot to talk and there is no real scary. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are even worse for a budget image that is too small to hear some exterior scenes to listen to the wind on the microphone. <br /> This is great for the viewer for everything. If they are not well known they become a porno (this is an improvement). There are only two lines in the film, both of which revolve around the stratostate prostitute. (Even though they are all looking good for 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> I think I'm totally deceived by the sale of DVD. <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He is the choice of his victims. He chose his nose. <br /> But I thought it was funny. Even the case announced that it was digital self-reliance, I would love to have seen it before, as it is a grain sandpaper that can be used as a print sand paper. <br /> <br /> This is the first five minutes of the movie (Welcome, <br /> <br /> If you're buying it, this is a very good movie and funny, it also has LOTR Director Peter Jackson. <br /> <br /> Any actors or director Patrick J. Matthews) and their work is to find here, I love to get here, if there is a worse picture, or this movie Alo someone to act
