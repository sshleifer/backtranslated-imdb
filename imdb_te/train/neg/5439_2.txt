Cecil B. DeMille's 1922 parlor-to-prison tearjerker manslaughter finds lovely Leatrice Joy as a good-at-heart but decadent young woman with more money than she knows. She leads to imprisonment imprisonment, which in turn leads to reproduction. Thomas Meghon is a Crusade District attorney who has brought out his personal crusade Lydia (Joy) to bring goodness and bounty, but he comes alone through alcohol and once released, she is up to her! <Br /> <br /> If the storyline is not too bad, you'll be filled by painful presentation. Quality of Demille's direction is very low and does not show any special talent for him. Photography is standard and flat, and editing is rarely more dynamic. One can easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty good. <br /> <br /> DemiLay moves the Miss Joy in a wide variety of clothes (evening gowns, golfing costumes, modeling dresses, fur piles), may be the fashions of the subtitles' 1922 <br /> <br /> The more frustrating photography Or acting more than editing or directing, which is mostly flat and wood. When it is not, it's a simple silent gesture, rolling eye balls, moving eye eyebrows and deliberate activity and hand movements. The better for modern audiences by chewing to the fun and scene of the worst silent films is simply disappointing to see here. Lois Wilson, the only member of the cast who has been successful in any form, is not only beautiful but can play her role naturally. As she reads the moralization title card you follow, her tears are convincing and fascinating until she opens her mouth to talk. As I mentioned, everyone is confused, Joy, Megan and Julia Faye. <br /> <br /> The most deadly and most entertaining concept in the film is a huge moral voice that drives everything. Megan's role has a number of mutual conversations where he leads to how he decides in the moral stance of America's youth and goes back to Rome's deterioration. (Insert insulting past) The moralization of the film is described as Victorian, but more than that. <br /> <br /> At this time, I feel the audience, which does not take seriously than modern audiences. <br /> <br /> Unknowingly, this film is the 'distinctive' silent film, which is the oldest moral structure, woodworking and bad direction. Demiley shows that he may be a terrific director and does not have the expertise in maintaining passing, camera placement or script or actors. I can not imagine taking someone seriously in their right mind. Boring, slow and idiotic, I only recommend it to the hardcore silent film dorks.
