You think the first landing on the moon is dramatic enough without having to make things about it. Nevertheless, this documentary needs to be played in a very negative light. It talks about the dangers associated with the lunar module and claims that the training firm and the astronaut were in contact with each other, that the training was an almost deadly accident of the Armstrong with the vehicle. The computer overload problem (1202 and 1201 alarms) that occur during the final disaster sound is a disaster when it's just an annoyance and not a risk to staff. <br /> It is called "thirty seconds" before it can run for thirty seconds, which in fact is essentially a miscarriage before thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> You go for Apollo's documentary or dramatization 11, "Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
