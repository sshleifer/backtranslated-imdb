If i look " I remember the ads for this film since 1968, so I finally saw it. It did not go to a British public school and social observation might be an American perspective, but I thought this film was awful. For one thing, as others have said, it takes almost the entire film to break the Bilhahood-at-Time revolt. The other, whether the final scenario is true or not, it's not a rebellion, but shooting devastation. <br /> <br /> I know this is a bad form to judge the next events, but it can not be done here. A man wrote a message that asked us not to compare the ending of the events in Columbia High School and Virginia Tech. But if there is a scintillation of difference between Kelbold, Harris and Chow and Travis (Malkom McDowell) on the other hand, I can not see it.

They do not take any responsibility. <br /> It brings me: Why are hell Travis and his skinny even in a school they despise? They are older, or close to it. They are not in a military jail as prisoners in "The Hill", while British film is much better. No one can go to college and lose the nature of the son, without the exclusion of parents who need to wake up on the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity to join college, unless I could not stand silly and ruthlessly with the culpability of my brother's "brothers" <br /> <br /> If Trevis is coming to herself in two of Lenin's coming, prominently in his room) he is free to organize and maintain a fitter's union or work for the Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants Jack Kerack, then write on the road and start writing. <br /> <br /> Sometimes critics should be like the person who responded to the scene in "The Last Tango in Paris", where Brando Mopes was about to go on a date with cow dung on his shoes. In the real world, the person said a listener, "Why do you dare to change your shoes?" - Do not allow fictitious characters to put a self-pity trip on you because you do not have the courage to point them to a general-sense alternative course. So it's here.
