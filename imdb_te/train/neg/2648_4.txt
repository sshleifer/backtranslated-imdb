I read a book on Anita Lewis's book and I saw a great photo of his dearest attire in MacDonald's MacDonald's Magazine, so I thought I would watch this movie. I never heard of the movie before, so I do not have any idea what it was before. Eddie does not know that Playboy and MacDonald are Secretary. She is really lovely with a uncooperative halo and no wings on the scene where she exhibits outfits at the simplest angel costume party. I was with the movie when Eddie was sleeping and she was portrayed as a real angel. But after a while I started to decline. Eddie has "sleeping" for the rest of the movie, so it's a dream. Because he just dreams, what does not really matter from there. The rest of it is pretty much less plot and meaningless. I was forced to stick with it. <br /> <br /> The last number of musical figures in the Madonna musical numbers is just plain silly. <br /> <br /> Eddie recovered "soon" and the original story continued, or he was really a god, and I was very curious. <br /> She does not have enough musical numbers to call her a musical. The first few songs are good, but the McDonald's Ziturbank number is like nails in the chalkboard. She's totally wrong for the operatic voice. Still, Eddie and MacDonald are still trying to light up, and they show there are no real stars.
