I'm a big fan of spaghetti Western genre, and I like the ones that are usually cheaper. However, Fidani at Infamous Director Demafe is known for the cheapest, trolleys, and well-written works of this type. The plot of Fidani films was very weak, and his talent was limited, usually with him spaghetti prominently trying to sell the images by adding Western names to "Sartana"'s "Django" titles. I included the special case of "Giue La Testa ... Hebrere" in 1971 by Sergio Leone's "Jiu la Law Testa" ("Duck You Sucker") and "Hebraub". I purchased this movie under the name "Adios Companoros", titled "Titles of Death", "Western Story ...", which has another Fidani film with almost the same cast. <br /> The plot is very weak, which follows Moulo Callaghan (Jeff Cameron). His involvement with two rival exiles by Butch Cassidy (Jack Bates) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron is famous and not accurate. Jack Bets are not good as 'Butch Cassidy'. However, B-film Legend Gordon Mitchell has always tried, and perhaps he is not a very good actor, Spaghetti has always found very funny and original performances in the Western and he saved some of the Fidani movies. <br /> <br /> "Giue la testa. There is a very funny and original thing about "Hobbie" - a priest is playing a great class kins! I can imagine Kinski in any role, but I guess nobody could dismiss him as a priest before seeing this film. Kinsky, once again great, though he has a short screen time, and a scene, he breaks up in the fight, which is probably the only good scene. <br /> <br /> "Geo La Testa ... Hebrair" is a cheap, charming movie, but it has some funny moments. I was fun to be a spaghetti western enthusiast, but if you do not, never mind the film or see Kinski for a priest. 3/10
