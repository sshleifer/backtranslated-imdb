There was nothing ten years ago /> Special effects are excellent Superman is also in this film. <br /> <br is not saved. Better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors. But a dragon script can eat it but it could not be solved. Plot holes, bad lines, terrible pace, the endless replay of the same shots with the CGI dragon stomach through the holes ... the noise of the boredom. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at all costs. /> <br
