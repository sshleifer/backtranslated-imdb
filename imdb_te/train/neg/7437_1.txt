This film is not just worth the cost of spending or spending time. Complete a plot of clocks and absolutely no sense! I believe that many people gave this awful movie 10. In my opinion they are the producers of the film. <br /> <br /> If I could give this film to zero, I would do it. Very bad IMDb does not allow it. <br /> I went to a friend who really wanted to see me because I saw it. Sadly, I have never started great expectations from this film and yet I have changed little. Take my word, the worst piece does not waste this your $ 8. I made fun of the entertainment directors that came out of the cinema. In all, not highly recommended!
