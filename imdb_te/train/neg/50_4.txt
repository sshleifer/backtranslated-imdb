<br /> <br /> The three-part "horror" movie with two people who "stir up" and (unfortunately) triggered the audience to give us three stories. <br /> <br /> The first story is a car accident couple who meet with a young two psychos. It can lead to two completely predictable turns. However, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-played and well done. <br /> The second is a person who has a large amount of money stolen. His car breaks down, he attacks the dog and slips into a nearby clinic. Very clear, badly done and very slow. It is too long in 30 minutes. But good acting. <br /> <br /> The third is not just a horror story. It looks for a beautiful, lonely woman Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice romantic feel and a nice sex scene. <br /> <br /> It ends with a very stupid one. <br /> <br /> The first one is worth looking at. Tune it and then turn it off.
