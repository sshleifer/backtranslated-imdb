This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I have ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> Plot (small): Clayton Bressford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, an exchange with a bad heart. Clay secretly starred his mother PA, Jessica Alba for Samantha. This two secretly married night, which was found with a rare blooded cardiologist. Go and find those imbalances! Once in the operating table, Clay learns that anesthesia does not work, and he feels everything and can hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay Razor seems to be able to filter the pain of a sharp scalpel cut. <br /> <br /> "When you look at the scenes of surgery, it will surely begin. <br /> <br> How can a young billionaire accept a heart transplant by a surgeon, a nurse, an attendant doctor and an anesthesiologist? I have more people in the room when my sensory ivory is damaged. The operating room is not even being sterilized ... people can practically go out and get out of the room without having to wash out .. The viewer gets to hear Clay's ideas during the operation, none of which is very lovely.Abba ... but here's what ... The doctors are trying to kill him to take his money and believe that he is in unconscious state <br /> <br /> There is no intervention in the hospital, but the ineffective physician is doing a major heart surgery for the four misconduct laws against him. Even Clay's overprotective mother is unable to check her status. It is only Samantha who is interested in putting up ... But oh ... sweet will be in Sam .... You can quickly learn some Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> <br /> In the end, Clay is an anesthetic perception, and in both cases it eventually changes the same way. <br /> <br /> The director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe some dumb fun ... <br /> Enjoy ...
