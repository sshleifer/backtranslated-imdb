I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave Leve for 10). In the first 5 or 10 minutes, if a film is not good, it's probably not good. I have yet to experience any film that proved to be a contest for this theory. Dawn in real life is certainly no exception. I was looking at this turkey and thought; Wow, this is not sad, not sad, and I do not like any characters. <br /> <br /> The story of an adviser / story, love with his brother beloved. I think the tagline is "an adviser to use suggestions". I do not know. The role of the dance as a qualified person to advise me has effectively affected me. I guess it's irony? I do not know. To see some of his parents, brothers, sisters and their children go to see some family retreats, this is a very sweet and potential animal for good comedy and story lines. The central story is how he loved this woman but could not have her. <br /> <br /> Someone with a pulse will eventually know that he will gain her, but you have to suffer through the painfully unfunny, banal, life-portrait dialogue "love murderer" to get inevitable happiness. <br /> One of the worst films I've ever seen.
