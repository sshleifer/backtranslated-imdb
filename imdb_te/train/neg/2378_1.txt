What legitimate actor was involved in the trilogy of the script? My God is also unhappy to see this. I can not imagine this insult. In addition, there is some controversy about whether River Phoenix is ​​in the role of a character. He was dissatisfied but his characters list was here (IMDB) to give him credit. BTW ... his sister who was asked before the Rain. This movie is proof of how big you have "names". Suffice does not stop the puffs. I love Lorraine Bracco but it's just sad, sad, sad ... Some people may be something for me for this kind of film. It does not have the fascinating, entertaining or ludicrous qualities compared to the worst ever.
