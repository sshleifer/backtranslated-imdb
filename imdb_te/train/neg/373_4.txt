Blank Check is a movie I have seen on TV one day and they are not as good as most of the films broadcast on TV Blank Check. I've ever seen no-one Blank check that I've ever met and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Blank check does not recall in check 00s, the fact that it is just overshadowed by Pixar's movies. I can not call Blank Check bad movie but it's not really fun. (Or not for anyone more than 6 years old) The blank check is not an entertaining movie because it's not original about it. Everything will make you go "What did I see before this?" The empty image is not a bad image, but it deserves to become dark when it tries to make money on everything from empty check-offs and Richie Rich Home Alone (which has both Macau Culkin).
