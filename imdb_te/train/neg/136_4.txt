*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** All teen slasher flicks suffer from the drought of the original drought? It looks very quick. First of all, this is a well-known good notice. Who is a rejectionable young man who increases all girls, twigs, and murders who are tortured when he is junior? You can not say you did not work. But this film goes through the same movements of all other recent slashers. From scratch to camera angles everything comes with a false alarm and definitely lets precisely predict when the killer strike. Now the sample knows. These stupid slasher movies push the envelope more credible through the minute. Let me ask you something: in their right mind, who is going to surprise a friend in the dark, drowsy morgas in the middle of the night and will you be surprised if she is alone and surrounded by the corpses? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally new. A good shot will be butchering the character of Denise Richards. She is inside a pool and the killer is trapped inside her pokes with a chainsaw. Soundtrack has good songs, including a cool track by Orgie. The music video will be in the special features section on DVD. <br /> Even acting is fine. Actors sleep through their characters. However, David Borenaz is often even more paranoid in his role as the title character in "Angel". <br /> <br /> Denise Richards is a good actress, and she keeps facing stone across the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine's Day" is as likely as you'd expect: laughing, unsustainable, unforgettable, cheerful and nice without worrying. <br /> My score: 4 (from 10)
