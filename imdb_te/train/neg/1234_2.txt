Well, as I suspect it turned out: the visual overload but nothing else was originally added. But I was surprised that the storyline changed well in comparison to the 1968 film. It was initially enthusiastic about my interest, but ultimately it is clear that the new twists and turns (a) show us with a distinct Hollywood product, and (b) the whole plot is made impossible! The 1968 story was a breathtaking straightforward and there was no time-storm or any such bogus: when you came home after a long journey, things could have changed a bit. Earth may fall into the hands of monkeys, for example. Like many 'old' movies, this is the main topic of suspense (hell, who understands this term?). An attempt was made to change the whole action in the film Burton, but at what cost? Most surely, the images are high, and most of the time and money is put on the monkey-culture design (also monkey music!), But what's wrong? <br /> <br /> First, suspension disbelief has a lot of Hollywood-human traits because of infidelity can be very difficult. I am especially referring to Arya and slave traders. These features include emotional skills like satire, satire, and externally displayed range of 'obscure' emotions. <br /> <br /> Second, people will get stronger. We can imagine that humans never forget how to talk, but the speech and the man's speech is not the fact that man can be very angry / human character and is emphasized in the 1968 version. Charlton Heston gets a stroke in his throat and his subsequent speech requires his specialty and interest in Dr. Zira's interest in him (hence, human rights activists or apache-human love do not need them <br /> Third, they Most ads are broadcasting in a shocking case, but a new twist is needed because the kap Tenn Davison Hollywood-let's-save-the-over-world-and-a --------------------------------- ---------------- Exigning-at-et-and-it-to-the-lounge-bar-for-cool-diet-coke character Oh my god , They can not learn? When I was lost, I was new in the beginning! They need a hero! And then the authors of the script continue to reason: we are a person Sir ... so a person loses ... because he tries to save a monkey from an electromagnetic storm ... unpredictable! But it is necessary to show audiences audiences! In these modern and politically correct moments, we have a grotesque look like Chartonton Heston ' Do not hate: Give them a bubblegam version! <br /> <br /> Fourth, okay, the classic turn of the modern version of the 1968 movie "The Real Truth" (he realizes that he has crashed before his own moments of ships and their laboratory-monkeys developed their society where Heston Something else, the peak of the earth when he is away). Second, the battle-component comes as an anti-climax. The film added the first two Planets of the Apes films as a protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fifth: ending !!! <br /> <br /> Fifth: ending !!! You know that Davidson and you have ever lost on the planet. For Chriskes, who came to? (A) Davidson has twice been crashed with his escape pad, which looks like a skeleton, while the chimp will make the earth more flimsy? Believe, who do you believe? The pods are really hand crafted handles (Davidson finally flew into space) and managed to save at least once a secure landing, if only the ships were avoided. About that end ??? I mean, everything in the original film was clear that everything was done on earth. But here: the whole picture takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (that is the Thaide statue) monkey culture is on the planet ??? How come Many of the planet's failures were technically evolved, and before the departure of Davidson went to storm and colonized land? Why is Thad worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is adorable and beautiful as a nose, but I want to be small. I chose a monkey on Estella Warren as a man, but I was able to get some loose wire on my head. However, Tim Roth Thad (amazing!) And Ari housing monkey (former general, but I forgot his name) was only convinced. <br /> <br /> Nano, 1968 pic is attached / changed, but not platform, at least not that. It is simple and clear and requires no additional explaining. This is a cheek and satire in the nicely tongue. Do not Stylize Everything ...
