Look at the excellence of Zola, the splendor of Paul Muni's patience, who spent hours and hours in the decorating room every day. Muni is one of the biggest actors in 1930 and I am wondering how much today I am - other than classic film buffs - knows anything about it. He is an elder in business for at least a decade. He was able to receive an Academy Award for the show, giving him two consecutive wins as he won for Louis Pasteur for the year. My own opinion is that if he overtakes a bit, I still think he is one of the greatest actors of the "Golden Age". What role he played; <br /> <br /> Unlike Pasteur's character, I lost a little more about what we have seen over the past 60 years: a liberal hero. In 1937, it was not just that the Hollywood Police or the Army was not suppressed by its neglect, but it was a point to let us know what the "corruption" was. Image producers love it when the challenge is challenging and beating. <br /> <br /> However, the film has been on the eve of its big-time since the 1960s. It does not reduce Johanna's accomplishments as a social reformer, removing some evil people. Good for him! I'd rather spend a lot of time showing them than I have a point of view.
