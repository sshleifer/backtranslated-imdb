The film has the most beautiful people. That's probably the best thing about it. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jessie Metcalfe), a young man who is going to make his mark in the world. He is the son of a well-known good work family, and he goes to law school. But like many other settings, things do not look right when they appear. Estimates of this family outstrip love. Except for school, Tristan's father seldom left him home. This past is a result of past traumatic event, which shook the family, which was partially revealed by flashbacks but did not come out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes his friends to be bored in the most vulnerable ways when his friends are taken to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. This celebration will soon follow a few strippers to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan isfriended Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into drug dealing. <br /> Technically well made, the film suffers from a poor script and a storyline that does not get too heavy. Counting against this film is usually a stable and out-of-place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames and fixed camera tricks such as echo's. Except for this case, the types of influences that the director typically show a viewpoint, except in this case, appear to be thrown at random points, in some cheap pursuits in style. <br /> <br /> Despite the relative unknown cast, the shows are better than all of them, especially for the main antagonist (Corey Large). <br /> When referring to the actors, I mentioned about their appearance. Hotness based on ratings, scores of these films 11. The women in this movie are looking at you fantastic and almost distracting from the boring image you're looking at. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend this movie, buying, renting, or looking for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort to sit down.
