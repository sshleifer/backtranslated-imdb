This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. However, Christopher Walken's young slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris, makes this movie entertaining. Alice's smoker, drinking and the way she can not be seen when her name calls is strange and interesting. I praised Jared for Christopher Walken's simulator, allowing Christopher Walken to star in the film.
