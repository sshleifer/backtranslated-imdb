The worst of the worst is the racist, sexiest and homosexual, while dealing with the terrible chic and sophisticated. The worst performances, the clich√©s of rendered screenplay and boring directions make this film clear. Two scenes are particularly dangerous - Shazek kisses his tongue to another (it may be that gross) and a movie that looks kissing by Eastwood Squack's best friend, a Russian actress. After leaving the room, she says "f ** king is aliens"! <br /> <br /> Jonathan Schachch is an actor on the screen and looks surprisingly good. He has not previously learned much from working with gay director Greg Aurak on the edge of the film and seeks to protect the image of homosexuals and homosexuals.
