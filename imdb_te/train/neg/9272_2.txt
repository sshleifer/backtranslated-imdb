I recently decided to resume the Omen trilogy, which is fourth. I did not expect much from it, and in that respect it definitely lived up to my expectations. If you are looking for bad movies for a laugh, this can be just for you. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, I enjoyed watching the movie "made for TV". The movie is inappropriate (and best) disorganized what happened in movies. This script contains all the suspense of the 8 year old fiction writing. But one thing to say is that the script does not do well with horrible acting. <br /> <br /> The story is very worse, all of the Damian thorn's daughter concentrated on all the frenzied pranks, adopting the wrong and bad nuns. I have personally opened my "play", and there are mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally opened me as a simple third-party investigator in the whole affair. Later, by some medical phenomenon, Damien Thorne Jnr was born. And pretty much wrap up the plot. The whole thing is badly executed right away from the first, which creates a monotonous and / or ridiculous scene in another movie with no suspense. <br /> How many WTFs are you? Moments provide a lot of unintended comedy relief. For example, what's with the main over-reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's ear scratches? The original 360-degree-head-turn rebellion. I also laughed at high response at Baptism. The baby cries, and everyone is very concerned. The mournful mother runs from the church and the priest is very worried when crossing her. Huh? Then there is a new age-old nanny who has all the kind of alternative spirituality Kardy Blance, at the age of eight. I was laughed when the nanny suggested me to bring the nanny's hippie friends to bring in an embarrassing Delia, and the mother would consider her shoulders and allow it. "Yes, that's sad, fill it with my troubled 8-year-old daughter with these spiritual aspects.It is very good, but it's expected from a mother who allows her daughter to have a fully grown ratwiler in the street that could snuff these little daughters into a snack. <br /> <br / "<br /> <br />" An unnatural accident ". Here we have a religious enthusiasm (he is part of a culture) who is disappointed to prove that the glory of God will protect them. She makes them snake up by performing them and she has bitten many times. Sometimes an unnatural accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> Snakes-vs-Nun scene is not just a funny death. The car is in danger of slow pace as a result of the wreckage in a school parking lot. Then there is a slow motion demolition ball headed directly to the detective. Slow motion only came back to see the demolition ball headed straight for the "worry" detective I had gone and believed to have a coffee. Then the rabbit-who-shot-who-clich√© death goes off a pistol and two frightening gaze conversion when they are shot for several seconds. Then someone goes down tumbling down the stairs to reveal who is the real victim. In addition, the priest's death at the beginning of the film seemed to me a little strange and nonsense. He walks around looking at the structure of the church. Naturally this is very distressing, he eventually collapses, catches his chest and dies. Apparently something ghost is happening, the music is to suggest. Ummm. As well. <br /> <br /> Others have been surprised to review this film as a "convenient sequel", especially, in particular. Do not take it to a non-sensitive script, unrealistic acting, and improper music score. The film is heavily dependent on Delia's "ghost style" to give the concept of horror, which becomes quite annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a bad movie with the unique ransom feature that has the unwanted ability to just comedy.
