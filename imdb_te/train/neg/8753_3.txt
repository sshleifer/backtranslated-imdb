The film tells me about the pictures of Mary-Kate and Ashley. Though Alice is a more actress in the film Amida Michalka, Alison's performance is very good. I need somethihng good idea after high school music and this is not exactly what it is. The story line is not great and I think they should have gotten two people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alison Michaels fan, this film did not like me. I have to be sure that they should be sick and sing only if you have nothing good to do (it is not sin)
