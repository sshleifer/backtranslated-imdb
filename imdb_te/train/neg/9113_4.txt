They have such a potential for the film and they will be completely flat. In the first cruel intentions, we left out what we wanted the main character's inspiration and how they worked. There is almost no role in this prequel. This is actually a very sad story but this film has nothing to do with me. It's like leaving the good writing to replace the f-words they do not need. And the ending makes no sense and does not explain anything. The writing is just terrible. Another thing that hurt me is that I used lease 3 of the exact lines in the original. Such "down boy", or kissing scene, and some others I can not remember. I was impressed by Robin's performance, but Amy did a great job. This film is about the only thing reconciled.
