You can watch this film by taking a revenge against the movie theater, director, producer, actors and the person you have come to see! You do not need this poorly of an image for you, Sarah Mitchell Geller, for putting your name and face in disgrace. This could be even more scary if Japanese actors spoke in Japanese instead of 'acting' in English. When the movie ends, I want to get it ... The real disappointment is that after all the hype in TV and movie trailers, Sarah Michell does not really work at all to make this film ... Playing her angry skills. Do not waste your time or money in this movie.
