Yes I am shouting in this movie. I was so disappointed that I could not help but could not cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. The first million dollar man (former professional wrestling) was their program, and now it is. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows the flow of religious oriented images to the sketch. It is very fun, yet at the same time it is upset to find the Bible is not wrong. Rather than the original Bible text, the film is called "Bible code". This image is too low; Directing its ridiculously horrific acting from its writing. It is discouraging people to work hard. <br /> It's like night. US. Watch the video directly into a home in the channel or the theatrical release movie instead. <br /> <br /> Your life is dependent on it.
