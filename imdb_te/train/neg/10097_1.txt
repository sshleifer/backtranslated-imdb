I opted for BB and selected 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects may be cheesy, acting is sub-equal and the sets are suspicious. I do not expect much. But it must have at least the story. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" is like the new wave hookers, having 5 fishermen in the end. Zombie image on the front cover is always a picture. <br /> It's time 81 minutes but 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The only advice I can make is that if my wife (she only reads while she's in the computer in another chamber), it's like a zombie romance .... If you think, it's so confusing, The author tried to do many things and ended up with an involuntary mess. <br /> <br /> Free rental and I still feel ripped off. IMDb does not allow me to use decimals because I rated it 1 in 10.
