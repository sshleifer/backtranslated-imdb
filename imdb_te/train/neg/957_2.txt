So, I got this hold as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at U's U. I guess his real way to anyone to see his movie ... <br /> Initially dragged into the documentary section. Yes, where the boy is a nut-job, but it's not good enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> We only highlight Sean Penn, wearing ONJ ... and after thirty seconds it loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover takes the lorry, the story is good, but I can not take it anymore ...
