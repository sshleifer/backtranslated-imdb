Abba, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I honestly said that I am the exception of this whole series ("He Dies", "Mermaid in a Manhole", and "Flower Flesh and Blood" ... and are not great for them ... ), But the "devil's experiment" is just plain fracture. There is nothing realistic-looking here, motion (or any anti-climatic atmosphere), other than the scene of the eyebrow chairs. The victim may not really care what is going to happen and is "bizarre" (often sometimes "fun") torture. "Flesh of Flush and Blood" is a more violent and cryptographic portrayal of the fake "scaffolding" material, but the film is flat at realism. I applaud Japan for borders, they have come really far to wear crowns in the last two decades of "serious" film, but "Devil's experiment" is not just caught. There is no other reason for you to be a die hard though any other reason, but I only give this movie a very generous 3/10 and it only scene for the needle-by-the-eye ...
