I've done a list of the worst movies I have ever seen, and this film is always there. It has no ransom features. <br /> <br /> This happened with the intention of sitting through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> By this I will kill my blood more than I sit back again. <br /> I went to midnight Saturday night. I'm only in the theater, and sitting somewhere behind me, loud, hard, rather unruly young men. They spent a good time on Saturday night, and some smiles came to this "comedy". Before the movie starts, during the previews, they are laughing and joking and having a great old time making loud comments. It borders the borders; They did continue their unbridled excitement into the original image, I've said something, but I'm feeling excited by their enthusiastic fun tolerant and empathetic, so let me go. <br /> Why did I say this? <br /> <br /> The whole movie has been laughed in the theater in the movie. Not once. No, not deadly kids. Absolute silence next to the soundtrack. And when the film is over and when the lights come, we all, all of us, slowly, dull, file from the theater in absolute silence. <br /> <br /> This is a "comedy" product. Laughter, not joy, but absolute depression. It's not a disappointing, depressing film, and tinist bit funny. <br /> <br /> I'll keep Mel Brooks's "Blazing Saddles" ever on the short list for the funny watch. <br /> <br /> If you are very happy, give the film a whirl; Otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
