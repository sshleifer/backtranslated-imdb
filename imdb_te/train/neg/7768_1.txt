Three male millionaires who have left the image of God are collecting a group of people to play a deadly game and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible, and the film is absolutely no sense. It's not horrific at least bit, it's so stupid to laugh, which is why it's got 1 star. The film is not violent at all, but pretty scarce and focuses mostly on the amount of women's chest, and some characters are very annoying and whiny. Plus, the monsters in this movie are not so scary that you broom and dummy and it just wants you to throw something at the screen. Finally, ultimately not so little is horrible. I want to give it away, and you see that you're really waste. <br /> Do not rate for nudity, catchphrase, and mild gore (but be R).
