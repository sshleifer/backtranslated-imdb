I am very angry with the movie and even though I have seen the movie, it is unsatisfactory. I thought that the director was trying to concentrate and think that the only way he could achieve was repulsive. Since I lived in the UK, I loved this country, but the film portrayed British young men imaginatively. Nothing to say but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. The admitted ones should be ashamed.
