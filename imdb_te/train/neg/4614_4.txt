The film has been nominated for seven Oscars and makes Bugsgul's mind about how he has achieved a success. It really should really qualify them because it's endless or because of the creative team's behind the creative team's credits but nominee in each category is because Przysie's Honor is frustrating. Some older Hollywood pioneer John Huston argues that he has lost it in his career but I will not buy it. Preceding the year he was an excellent signing under the dark character set in Mexico, he was always in the best of the best. On the other hand, Prism's respect, star power, good intentions and good scripts have been proven to be a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> A gangster who falls in love with a girl prefigures the quirky crimedies caught by Hollywood through the storm in the 90's before the whole tone and plot hitman but the script is twisted for its own, the motivations off and the whole story is not sure what exactly it is trying Is: a romantic comedy, a criminal play, a gangster saga, etc. Kathleen Turner appears in pacock mode, with Jack Nicholson (unbelievable from Jack, performing Brooklyn's slavery for De Niro) and almost all the movements are sleeping on their way through some areas. Anjela Huston is renting the other side but her performance is worse by her character's motivation: she is disturbed by her elder father's father, proving her support to her former husband, then bitching the grudge against her head. <br /> <br /> Colors have a slurred quality made at the beginning of the 70s The directing of the film is as uninteresting as the rest. The director's promise of lagging behind the story, it is notable that it would be good, but no one was missing in the film.
