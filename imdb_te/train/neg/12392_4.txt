Ben Masters, (Kid Thomas), "Dream Lover", '86 Mike Hammer character, makes no old job for a buck and plays good with a private eye that goses all the sexy curves in good looking gals. Kid makes a big mistake when he stops at Morgan Fairchild, Laura Cassidy / Eva Bombergberg, "Arizona Summer", '73. Kyd takes Lara's home to his pad and when he wakes up, she is eating her eggs and orange juice in her patio and making her right at home. By the way, Kyd sleep in her bed and Laura slept on the bed for this special scene. Laura combines all kinds of hoods and has some scenes between Kaid and Laura. All said and done, this is a lousy movie and I only bought the DVD for $ 1.50 and I got really ripped off!
