Mt is a little sister and I have self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen about everything, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. It's the worst picture I've ever seen in my entire life. Only acting is terrible, but with special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" makeup is the worst I've ever seen. If you can make it (a black eye shadow around the eyes) it's completely clear that you should never judge by your cover book. The only sweet thing for the film cover. Make your fans a favor and do not see this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so adamant about this movie. I have gone until I put a sticky note in the movie. "This movie does not waste your time, you can come back now" I do not like the haha! This POS movie is a good movie wasting night! I do not even know how the ratings came, t must be negative
