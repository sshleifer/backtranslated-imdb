I do not know how well this behavior can cope with cinematic behavior! This image (small) is bulky (at least to say)! It is a group of kids aged 5-7 years wearing diapers with big Bambi pins, acting as adults (and so much!). However, this is a good example of the fact that "good old days" are not good at all because it's interesting! <br /> <br /> It is a small one from the "Shirley Temple Festival"
