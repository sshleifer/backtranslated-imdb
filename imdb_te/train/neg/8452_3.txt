This was the first time I commented because I thought if the right person read it, they wake up and do something about it. In the last few months, the ABC family began broadcasting a new format movie. I've seen the last three and enjoyed them. They engage and trick. My wife liked these pictures. I'm looking forward to watching "see Jane Date". The trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this should have light years before an attempt to be presented by writers and musicians associated with this project. Year 2003, the source (all bad), was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. It's inappropriate and does not add emotional content to all images. Work against it. I am working on film and television business. I enjoy being fun. This is not as bad as I expected. From another decade this script has lines and I know that these women can act but you do not know from this film. To add the whole experience, the end will leave my head shaking. Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Producers' Executive Advisory: Do not appoint composer or music supervisors to do any of your future films in any circumstances. They have lost their touch and they need to understand the term "contemporary", "present day" and "current" while describing a romantic comedy. You have to walk the world. Van Gerneg-Sertner and all of the ABC family are desperate.
