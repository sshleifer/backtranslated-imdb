I caught this picture on the AZN in the case. It's a good movie, it looks like a Japanese "green card". I can not say I always liked an Asian movie, quite contrary. Japan and Korea are some of the most incredible horror films of all time, and I'm a huge fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I'm not negative to light heart films like Tampopo or Chung King Express (my favorite two), so I thought I would like it. <br /> <br /> I added water to Director Steven Okazz with Quallied because no one has the image of the film. And when the characters try to act, against any mumbling of one line or two, their appearance is forced and quite fake throughout. I did not think that someone was honestly ever acted ... Brenda was only the one who liked Akki .. I'm wondering that it was promoted as a joke, because I did not laugh at once. CBS morning news is very surprising that this "comedy refreshing breath". It's not refreshing, comedy is not breathing. <br /> You can imagine, the former critic should be an idiot to think of such things. <br /> <br /> You have to avoid this film unless you want to see a boring speculative plot line and acting on wood. The fact that I actually was "Spike of Beninhurst" is a better acting film than this ... I walked out half way through that movie!
