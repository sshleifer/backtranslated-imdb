I do not know about you, but what I like about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the interaction between two characters (often violent). <br /> <br /> 'Big Apple' IMDb is for other T & J fans who have commented here Maybe, I can not wait for this self-indulgent trash, so I can see the next cartoon on my DVD. <br /> Of course, as part of the whole episode that I really enjoyed, Jerry almost "sold out", broken candle, hanging quietly on a busy road for hundreds of feet.
