Live! <br /> <br /> True Story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station announced that it was going to be broadcast on a new reality show. Instead of a competition. The main partner involved in the program is a dreaded woman who is dying and she gives her kidneys a lucky person with a progressive kidney failure. For the truth. <br /> <br /> The country and international media are fearful, obscene, whichever-world-coming, and so forth. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the government has largely won the degree of whether or not to go ahead with this event. <br /> <br /> They were pushed forward in the gas and the last moment at this event. And for the last moment, every country in the country has their breath, while making weapons and prime minister speeches, every newspaper writes about it. And proceed on the network. On the new frontier on television. And they were definitely successful in doing so. <br /> <br /> This broadcast is broadcast and we will live with her if she chooses the right candidate for her kidneys, and soon she will die. <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it's a partial duplicate. The woman is not ill, but all the candidates. No kidney auction. Campaign and campaigns and all the amazing discussions, the overall performance of a spectacular climax, is a campaign to focus on the major shortage problem in organ donors. <br /> <br /> This particular television system has been diagnosed with a person's kidney disease. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give me a poorly directed film about some woman trying to get Russian roulette show on American TV. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * I believe I will do this by the FCC. I believe through this US Supreme Court based on free expression. <br /> I think two people were shot in the air. Because this woman pulls it back and considers the problems of conscience. Instead, look at the running man with Arnold. At least it has semi-good ending. <br /> * Spoiler * This is a very difficult movie with a ludicrous ending. So she eventually burned, there was some kind of justice because when we left the theater will people look better? Do not take my word for it, but I say: leave alone, instead of looking at the test system, you get more quality.
