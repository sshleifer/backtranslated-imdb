Bob Hope can save this poor written effort in wartime comedy, along with a team of actors, because his patented timing is minimal. Plan Don H. Bolland (Hope), an Hollywood film actor and attempted to escape military service at the start of World War II, after which he was misled by Colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour) in an attempt to make a tough attempt to court. His assistant, played by Bolton Agent and Eddie Bracken, played by Lynn Overman, has been making many attempts to join him and three of the training exercises shot in the hills of Malibu, California. This effort was budgeted by the paramount budget, some of which hired veteran professionals, but was generally directed by David Butler, and should be attributed to a missing comedy element in the context. A shift at the end of this film is still a test of poor stunt work and camera actions to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton. Strangely, Lenny Overman was given the best lines and this sneer master's master makes them better. Dorothy Lamourr looks and feels lively, and Clarence Coleb is happy to hear her as her father, her voice, screen, or radio, but the picture is as small as it can be saved, the script has an error handed down.
