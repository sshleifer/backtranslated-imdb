I've seen this film a few times and I can say that this is a low budget worst and it does not have anything with real history facts. Actors' performances were very low, but resulted in limited acting possibilities. Some people who have seen this film now like Hitler, some silly skinny who are running a gun like a Chicago bandit. In those years, there was a lot of good films about Hitler and Germany and that the growth of the evil was limited. I can recommend German cinema downflows to see the magnificent performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in Adolf Hitler's roll.
