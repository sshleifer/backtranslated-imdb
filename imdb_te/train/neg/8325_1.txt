I saw this movie last night and was still disappointed with those who had too low expectations. There is nothing with the outcome of the main plot point (the person being awake during the surgery), which is too camouflaged in this unpleasant of an image. It would have been unconnected in the same way. So, what's the point of this? No one knows. Also, this surgeon has 4 misconduct claims against him and does he not want people to ask questions if the patient dies in his chart? Will you be. Jessica Alba is absolutely talented and the Christian is almost bad. The whole thing is just ridiculous since the beginning to finish. I'm pretty sure that someone who cuts through your chest with a scalpel, you have more pain than you can.
