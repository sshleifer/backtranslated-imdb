Well ... the picture is a pleasant watch. The main problem with this film is that it is against a lot of vampire misconceptions. Like the vampire vampire walks in the sun. There are episodes that make you enjoy the way society moves. A bloodthirsty stroke and shouting "Okay it hurts ... it's really hard." Since the scenes may not appear, there is a short time later. And there are random dream sequences, they really do not help with the plot. It will come to think, nothing really is in the sense, but I've got a group of friends and have seen it twice to get the full effect. Combat sequences come to think of fears, and the zombies were just fun to watch. I feel like this film. But you know, of course, you can not expect Schindler's list but its fun watch.
