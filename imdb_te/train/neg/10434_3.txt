God is the only answer when you can not think up a clear explanation of something. In fact, this is a problem with the end of the series - they can not give clear explanations for the big questions raised over the range as the return of the Kara New Thriller from the death of the Kara Threses, how old old wiper and cutted body ended on Earth 2, why Baltar is an imaginary 6 in his head Is, why 6 is in her head an imaginary Baltar, etc. So they do not explain with "angels" /> <br /> Â£ Just in the last two episodes, it does not describe the plot, one by <br basestar have holes big enough to fly. For example, Galactica and its crew are going to commit suicide to protect a girl (Hera), especially Adama, saying that there is no way to save him.
