Visually interesting, but the realism section comes flat. This vicious emotion in the technique wears thin after the initial battle. Jude La Mande has the appeal of the toast, but in his defense the film has some of the worst talk I've seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is poor, it removes you from the movie and me thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments with bluescream. Pelto is a wooden carcher. It is saved by the complex film Noir dialog or top camp. My only complaint about technology is Black & White image (sorry, computer) because the Turner looks in color and black. Just a big dull clich√© mess. I will break through my thigh bone rather than sit through this endurance test.
