Pathetic. This happens when the director works when he is paid. <br /> <br /> The themes are good for the image of epic ratios, great positions and settings. But the show, damn! In the shots that appear in the camera in a few shots you can see the extras or the cast as they are "action!" No one should do what he says. Are you surprised at the war scenes - are these people real? They could have caused more damage by just huging someone else. Slowly in the Mo scenes you can see their hands, people around or standing in the battlefield. <br /> <br /> The action was only somehow emphasized. But what The story is very spurious and uninterrupted, which appears to be a random situation in a timely manner, sometimes not even. Dialogues The love story is more frustrating and more ridiculous than the dumb and Hong Kong action films. <br /> <br /> With a 40 million budget, investing every dollar on the screen is the best result, the ultimate result of this immense effort, on the shelf in the shiny round laser disc video store in the shiny round.
