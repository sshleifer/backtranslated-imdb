This is probably the worst movie ever seen. I saw a large group of friends and not to plot the plot about one of them. In the absence of plots, acting was worse, "special effects" were not very specific, and the writing was absolutely horrific. The only ransom factor of the film is very bad that it is very funny. You can not help but the actors are spewing the embarrassing dialogue, but run at a zombie to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good movie, but it looks like a group of friends has a good laugh. It's my friends and joke I'm running now. 10 to 1.
