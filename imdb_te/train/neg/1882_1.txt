What a worst piece of garbage !!! Who are the best of all these people? Yes, it's "artie"; And yes, it is "foreign", but .... that is not enough. The plot is boring and confusing, not as a reality show but too soft. <br /> <br /> People are inherently alcohol; But they do not have enough depth to have emotions to the characters. If they rely on real people, I'm so sorry for them. <br /> Violence (and some of them are very violent) are very horrendous and inappropriate. The producer is similar to Quentin Tarantino. <br /> And oh my: If I had neighbors like this, I'd move it!
