Many say that the film is less than poorly made, obscene, and taken into account that same umbrella made in that era. It's recommended to be a "special film experience" for a friend. He is right. Suppose I mean he's a joke. Not surprising, even those shocking. Average acting and poor efforts in shock art. The filmmakers did not believe it was intended. And yes, as one previous reviewer says, it's sex with a bear suit. This money does not cost too much. If you want to see it, take it down. <br /> <br /> I would have to look at one of these special director's films. But it's like, I've spent 2 more hours in my life.
