Yes, indeed, it might be a good movie. A love triangle, (an apologetic poet is for license, but not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately badly said. The picture is sometimes weird, sometimes okay, the film is crowded and narrow-focused. The sound requires more attention (which usually makes in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes badly selected. The soundtrack is small and does not help action. About acting ... sorry, but the best actress is the owner. Others are immature and can not convince the viewer. It may be realistic, that it can be real, and it must be a poem. This is a picture of the kids that the children have told you. The only downside is very interesting.
