Since the film starts, there is already a difference. The film takes place in Normandy and the Middle East, and the international film also seems to have been shot in the right notes. The sound of this cast did not make much of the American. Moreover, I have seen the best of the best performance, the story that starts from the story is difficult. Who? Otherwise the image is very precise in clothing and scene. This movie is worth a rental if you want to watch a movie like the previous one (in the absence of tones). If you are looking for an image as epic as heavenly kingdom, then look elsewhere.
