The code name does not last long: Diamond Head Network does not come up with schedule. The TV pilot does not have image credits, and it's clear how good it is. I missed something because the plot was not fully understood. Based on what I got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or "tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The secret secret agent of the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thins), ended up stopping him. Maybe more, but trust me? It really does not matter anyway. <br /> You have to take action for action movies. Suspense moments should have a suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. There is no one in the code name: Diamond Head. Others have used the term "turkey" which describes it to make it for TV sneezers. And I can come up better than any word description. None of the characters are at least bit exciting or caring about the value. And Roy Thies will lead to predictable rubbish. His charisma slug is slightly north. Ian McShane is the easiest thing to do with the film, but unfortunately not for everyone involved, he does not seem to go back as a regular cast member. <br /> <br /> I will soon learn that TV movies for this ghat awful 70 movies will make the great mystery science theater 3000 episodes. . If Qin Martin participates it will go double. Very funny things from Mike and Bates. If I give the movie 3/10, rate my MST3K rating episode # 608 and 4/5 rates.
