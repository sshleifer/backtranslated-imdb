Pretty bad image is not new. Moans attempt to make simple creaks and makeup for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is just above enthusiasm. Whom do you think why Liam Neeson signed for this? Owen Wilson recently changed one of the worst performances in horror-film history. Calder Zeta Jones Lily Tierre did an above-average job, but not too long enjoyed. Special effects are very memorable and the house is breathtaking and haunting. Yet they can not do make-up for the poor acting and the story that appears to be thrown in the last minute. No trouble.
