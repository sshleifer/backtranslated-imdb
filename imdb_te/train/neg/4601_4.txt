I do not know anything in the work before the writer or the director, so I did not bring any bias to the film. <br /> <br /> I thought this would be interesting, depending on the brief description of the story in the TV Guide. <br /> <br /> The score is professional and Kariwuher is a good performer but the rest are disappointed. . <br /> I do not go through the changes of the narrative, but I give an example of what I think is clear gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to a discrete ranch house and pulls his previous victim (wend) from a frozen freeze. McKenna killed Wendy by hitting a piece from his neck. Now he feels he should destroy the evidence of his involvement in the death of the Vend. (What are the cops to measure the radius of his bite?) The head and neck of the Wendt's in the MacKane freezer bag, it takes the ax and begins to chop the wend on the wend head. Walk. Walk. Walk. The axis of the ax puts the chipping in the neck. The air fills the frozen flesh with nuggets flying, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (When he completes it he brushes it.) McKenna then takes the frozen head outside the small fire that he built. He sits head on the floor and sits next to it, removes some of the photos of a woman he's killed and shows them on the head of the wend. "Remember her? It's not for you, if it really can," he said. "Duke, did you like to eat anytime, do not you?" He asks. Then he set fire on the head. <br /> <br /> "I do not want to censor this kind of garbage. <br /> < There is no reason to go along with the rest of the movie.It's an example of "unsustainable," since I brought the idea that McKenna was kidnapped and locked up in a dark bare shock that he knew he was going to compile death in the next few days (he literally saw it Heavies are invited to do McKenna is here last night in his life, he can find a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbates (successful).) Give the man a Freedom Medal! <br /> A monster that looks like a pizza hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashback, the camera is often in hand and wobbly.   న్లు, "లైఫ్ అనేది s *** యొక్క భాగాన్ని కలిగి ఉంటుంది లేదా లేదంటే ఇది అన్ని ప్రపంచాల ఉత్తమమైనది, ఇది మీ అభిప్రాయాన్ని బట్టి ఉంటుంది." సామాన్య ముఖాలను గిగోయ్ల ముసుగులుగా మారుస్తుంది. <br /> <br /> The hero house, McKenna, is heading to the front and explodes in an explosive fireball in the house. He was the first to kill him for $ 13,000. With a large statue of many people, then in a pocket plant, he finally killed the body before buying a refrigerator. (It's a little hard for him but it's not enough to keep him from stressing on payment). Then, I hope I have the direct line, he kills the wend by removing some of his neck. He accidentally kills his first victim's wife and blamed it for heavy weight, although it did nothing with virtually any moral classics. He then shoots the head respectable (Baldwin) alive. Then, if the two weights are stopped, he deliberately hurt them, but one of them is not completely discouraged. <br /> <br /> These dirty Harry are not cartoon deaths in movies - Bang Bang and you are dead. They are slow and painful. The first - murder $ 13,000 - will be clumsily enough to be similar to what happens in real life. Hitchcock is shown in Torn Curtain, which is not really easy to kill another man. <br /> <br /> For that scene, nobody has any importance. </ P> Here are some politicians on screen.
