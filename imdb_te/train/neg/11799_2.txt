This might be a good episode, but I have to stop it. British representation is terrible to see. Did the manufacturers ever go to Britain before filming? At least in England? I do not think any British person has such a racket from the Royal Family's comedy skit! Even with 2 English guys ... I do not think any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English kid in British nation history from Prince William and Harry's preteen public appearances. American filmmakers have more than 1 in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. More than 1 Culture! I can handle some stereo-typing but this is not very bad. Fire looked cool though!
