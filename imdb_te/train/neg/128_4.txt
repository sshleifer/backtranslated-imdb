This film, once its sensation to the depiction of its forward-thinking politics and the love of liberty and sexual liberation, just reduced time with enthusiasm. It is now inconceivable that this very boring little image has been banned and governments in many countries have been captured. According to how the Socialist Swan finally ended, the radical in its politics was once controversial, appearing in the innocent and almost mainstream after four decades. And its sex scenes, one of the sensational vulgar attempts at one time, looks beautiful in modern context. Nevertheless, there are many documentaries and documentaries that illustrate many controversies and effects, such as the early relief of the 60th Youth Rebellion. A part of the film still continues: its self-consciousness with the 'fourth wall'. For some time, filmmakers have filmed themselves. Its satirical fun is still a chuckle.
