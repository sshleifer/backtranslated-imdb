That's not exactly my style, this straight-to-DVD Street Fight Action is the one we encountered due to friend keeping it at the time we just had some beers. I'm relatively open minded, and I'm very fan of Emon Walker, so I'm ready to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Blood and bone Isha Bone is a street, while the film fights for rarely occurring vague reasons. <br /> <br /> What a tedious image. I understand that such films do not rely on the platform, but what do they do in such a silly, predictable, and totally stupid storytelling? It may not be important, but it will annoy me with the gummy gum. The plot is better than the clich√©-ridden Flebung Mongrell and pure action. Completely incomplete and unachieving sentimental stuffed with drivel, it stuffed with cinnamon equivalent rotten innards of a thin skin turkey. I said at this stage, perhaps the drawing point of the film: the fight. The fight itself is too small. Single punches (the big ohf or both make bone to take the well-established strict-street fights in the filmmakers' ludicrous effort to correct this volatility); Unscreated warfare is a crazy formula that will attack one. <br /> <br /> It is repetitive and stupid, even when it is repeatedly rotated with a constant fancy of time and time. <br /> The mill, film- DVD is straight to the status, new and everything is doing absolutely nothing we've seen time and time again. And especially especially well.
