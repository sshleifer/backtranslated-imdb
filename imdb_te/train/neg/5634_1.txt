This poster called "Plotless and Meaning" literally took words used in my subject line. The only thing I'd like is "unusable." The film should be a frightening situation in the cold of the movie for a movie that has a couple married in real life and has graphic sex scenes. Daffo and Collaggate are bored during sex scenes, and the viewer also takes a volume and works with it. Also, please, the viewers have seen women tampons most used in their time, and Willem Dafoe need to get really therapy for any guy guy by seeing the bloody tampon pull out of his doctor's vagina. <br /> <br /> The key in the movie (if any) is a waiter continuously describes to the sleeping eye Dafoe, where a restaurant called "Distantstarred Jambalaya". (All the ingredients of the dish are not separate from each other). The film is "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are: spooky, discrete house, dead spouse, scary creepy violin, Veraido caretaker come and he goes and goes, auto accident deaths and near deaths, characters with a mysterious past. Usually every thriller you think is clich√©, but nothing is there. Never ever meshes into a coherent plot or a artsy mood piece that never sat down. At the restaurant, Duffoy passes on "Distant Jambalaya". Tenants related to this confusion will do well to leave this constructive thriller on the video story shelf.
