Seriously, nothing about this bad fest is absolutely good. Randolph Scott, a gay gentleman who lived for twelve years with his boyfriend Cary Grant, is in the lowest and least role of his character. At the age of 57 he was very old to these romantic characters, although it was not very much because Geel Russell was over his age of 31 and she was very rare due to chronic alcohol and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual villain role but it is not enough to save this trash. <br /> <br /> If they thank god that they do not have the pucca, they are racist old films that glaze guns and murders.
