Spike Lee has been in this decline since his early successes and this mess does not help. Looking at my movie, it seemed that the film would end or reach that point. Lee's first film with all white cast was a major disappointment. <br /> What's the point? Italians are lying and sexually suggestive, but not with their wives? If I want to see Scorsese, I'll go to Scorsese's film. The most dull Godfather character is attached to stereotype. <br /> <br /> <p> I appreciate the pictures of Lee's movies, especially "Do The Right Thing". This film is wasted time.
