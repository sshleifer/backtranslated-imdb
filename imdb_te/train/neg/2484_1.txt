I still can not believe that Wes Craven is responsible for this piece of garbage. This film is far worse than the "worst friend." The film is stupid, acting, and the film is thicker. Crowe made his debut "Left House on the Left" - the perfect masterpiece of this genre and hates the likable (probably) this turkey. Do not make me wrong, I really like some of her movies.
