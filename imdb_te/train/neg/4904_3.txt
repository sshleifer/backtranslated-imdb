Tingo Supremo is their leader - Captain Cradle, Rope Girl and Skate Ladd, their own battleship (Buza!) And three children with outfits and movements. They work for Governor Kevin, who was appointed as leaders and after playing in the game. They also lead to normal lives, and family and school functions, but most actions take place away from school combat villains. The villains have some unclear and unique and singular features for the villains, who do not know what their plans are, but they seem to work anyway. The evil baron will face three of them from a bad robot and plans to get their nasty, and often novelties, plans to get power, and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Animation is also very nice and smooth, but it looks light on style intent. The backgrounds overlap the color, the buildings appear in the future. <br /> <br /> Plots are almost always frivolous and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and what is one of them? But this is not the same as Fillmore! Or pepper on.
