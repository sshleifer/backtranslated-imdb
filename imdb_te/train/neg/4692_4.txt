When I first saw this movie, it was named TRAIN in the TRAIN and was part of the double feature. Glenn Ford, an arsenal expert, called for a downed bomb to be loaded with high explosives. Tension is slow and stable; This black & white image only runs one hour and twelve minutes. These years later on TV; Stress and drama lost a lot of its effect. <br /> <br /> This is a good film along with Ford along with Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. Victor MÃ¤rrnn was featured on the villain / din.
