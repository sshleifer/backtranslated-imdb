Before starting to watch the show, I've heard great and beautiful very interesting. I'm quite grateful for the writer's son and Scoobidoo writers so no cheating, scripts are so superstitious. And about the SFX and the colors, they are so bad that they are painful to see, over colors saturated, overlapping scripts and as show overrated. The program is a bad pie, with only one child having a sugar and butter idea, because these ingredients are good, they fit. Unfortunately for this event, only two ingredients of this program are ultimately the lack of vacuity and credibility.
