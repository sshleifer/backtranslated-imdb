I do not know why they made this version of "Peruation" when they already have a fine little series with Amanda Root and Cairn Hinds. I wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course there was a lot to be removed; <br /> <br /> Despite the entertaining attitude of the English courtesy and the mantle, the film was dubbed the drama, but ending in the cutting-room floor all the comic humor and humor. <br /> Also, are shallow and uninteresting. The poor Anne then up and down the streets after they're a silly modern adolescent captain Wentworth (and if you happen to be a silly modern infant who reads this, let me tell you: a cool guy who runs after a male like a woman in the heat). <br /> <br /> In the Napoleonic era, a well-dressed woman has never done, and certainly is not the heroine of this level. <br /> <br /> They found some bogus ridiculous; My response is not laughter, but outrage. <br /> <br /> It is in accordance with the Austin work corruption. <br /> This is bad.
