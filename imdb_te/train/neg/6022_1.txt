I'm getting a little tired of people who abuse their name because of their own little view of the world forever. I will not remove the Armageddon, or anti-Christ, and some people who are really good lives (they appear to be white white children) will go to heaven, and the rest of us will be driven by hell's millennia on Earth, because we can not be enough. God may be a judge, but I do not think he has measured every level of durability. Give some credit to the creator.
