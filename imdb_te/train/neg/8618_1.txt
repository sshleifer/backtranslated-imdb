Unbelievably awful picture. Recently I saw this part of TV. My jaw dropped when I saw a horror plot. The only line from a liner's owner is made of a chuckle smile. This made Radnie Dangerfield's body extracted and kill him and said, "How are you?" As soon as the popularity of the given actor or theme pushes money, I know that many pictures will be taken soon. But please, Hollywood, show little respect for your audiences. It is sad and scary, and people expect to see such a tripe. The Sunday afternoon is also at the bottom of Sesspool through television standards.
