One of the worst films I've ever seen with Robert De Niro is the nonsense clich√© of a workout in The Fan Slash. It tries to evolve or turn around a crazed fan's dirty plot, which mentally transforms - the film does not leave any. (Spoiler) Do you believe that a knife-stronger idiot will access and kill the baseball player in a luxury hotel without a witness, security or cameras? The film is funnier, ending our heart strings, hooping baseball and making it uncertain and untidy. Not sure what all the actors are thinking when they come into this razzie. It's big when they come. If you want to come up with your movies, stay away
