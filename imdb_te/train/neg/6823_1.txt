I trusted my own instincts: no hopes - no disappointments. However, I enjoyed the model like Koeniksetsi (1983) and was disappointed. Pawarqqatsi nothing in my humble opinion but a cheap effort to make money on the success of its previous culture, and - artfully - failed miserably. Some of the producers retrieved leftover material from Koonskatsi, thug together, slowly put everything in motion, and confused some pop entertainers with the nickname of Philip Glass, which would move on to some common background music constantly recurring. Koyanikatti attracts audiences with clever and fast motion modifications, Powaqqatsi is a long line of world images in slow movement (if you see them in your VCR in a quick preview mode, you'll see what I see). But I have been disappointed by Philip Glass's soundtrack. This commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which I can compose at the age of 14 at the Casio calculator, embodies emotional and complete-synchronized music for the same composer from Koenigatse. All in all, time is a big waste! My advice: forget mercury! Look at Koonskates instead!
