This film breeches a fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that does not have any rules encourages marital harmony, certainly does not promote the bridge, so irony has not worked for me. However, I finally enjoyed some things with the big bridge competition between Paul Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschik. It's a lot like the championship boxing match. Not only is competing for the competition in a square area such as a boxing ring, but there is a referendum that is riddled with competitors, radio broadcaster Rossco Corns performs nonstop chants in these events. At one point he had a punching incident, even though he had four diamonds "one ... two ... three ... four ...". People gave their radio to an ordinary event for the championship boxing tournaments. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, some actors are given comedy to retain a sense of sarcasm. Paul Lucas has a great deal of skill and bad luck for comedy. The lovely Loretta Young and Common Comic Frank MacHugh did not give enough good lines; At the beginning of Glenda Farrell's film, a lovely blonde has a nice comical turn, but she practically disappears later. No talent is in vain!
