Okay, the image is cool but the idea of ​​a computer virus has become an organic virus because I give it a pure pure fairy tale. This type of garbage adds moron's suspicious delusions to the uncomputer awareness that just like a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, the number of strings and dozens of code 1 and 0 can add up to the computer virus. An organic virus is more complicated, even though it may be feeding. However, it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus attach the burrow in your cells, and attach them to the RNA, and then change your own RNA code. Explain how it's processed from such a monitor? Can some of these viruses have some effect on radiation on the cornea of ​​the user changing your eyebrows? I could see, but apparently, the author did not care.
