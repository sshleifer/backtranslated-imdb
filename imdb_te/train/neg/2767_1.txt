The movie is a horrific film I have seen in my life - the previous god-awful movie I have seen as "Spin of Spitish" which I saw at the age of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting, stilted and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, mishmashed cut scenes, also music is annoying. Did I leave anything <br /> <br /> I do not believe that I really spent the money to watch this movie. If anyone has contact information for Hong-Ray Shim (director), please send me my username "at gmail" and will personally demand repayment.
