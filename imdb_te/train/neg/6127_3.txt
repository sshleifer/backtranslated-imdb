<br /> <br /> When I was in Hungary, I heard so many people say good and good things, but in reality I did not understand the cause of Fas. Some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the normalization characters are like every Hungarian picture, again, and the story is also pretty dull. I loved the first half, but then I got frustrated, and then I found the whole image BORING. <br /> <br /> Rudolf PÃ©ter is always good, Reviczky is also brilliant, but others just do not ... there's nothing to do. <br /> <br /> The Hungry Hungarian film is still going to pass for years still ???
