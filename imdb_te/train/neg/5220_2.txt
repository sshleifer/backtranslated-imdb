A young basketball-playing professor of genetics, using genetic embryos, researching the genetic sequence. He wants to find a remedy for all diseases and aging. <br /> <br /> When he is not in his publication, he is compelled to finish his research, so the university is able to justify funding for him. <br /> <br /> He injures an inquiry into a monkey that dies quickly. He tries himself. He began a relationship with a single mother of a very annoying little boy; <br /> <br /> In the beginning, he had no effect on injection unless some new strength. He later realized he had lost memory and recalled what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> When the film is titled Metamorphosis, he will eventually change to another. You can not trust your eyes - he turned out, or the black dresser describes what he has turned out to be. <br /> <br /> This is what happened to the film, Laura Zemzer is in it, but she is a very small part. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time I saw this video box with a sticky plastic look sticky to boxcover. Perhaps it may have some electronics at one point, perhaps the light movement (the main character's eyes are occasionally turn green in the picture). The copy I see has a box, which only removed the tear marks placed in glue plastic. This novel is covered by the box, if it still has, I have the only reason to be held in this film; I'm sure to get rid of it.
