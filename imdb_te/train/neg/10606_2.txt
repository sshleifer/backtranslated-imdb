After seeing the low-budget sheeter versions of "Universal Solzer" franchise, Van Dumm√© once again praised his role as Lock Devreux in the second Uuenol. Well, this prayer replied, but not as I expected. Universal Soldier 2 is as intense as poetry reading in your local library. No, it is very secretive. These fighting sequences are top-notch, the quality of Bruce Lee, the only redemption factor in the curiosity of the film. It played the role of former WCW tough-guy Legend "Goldberg" villain. <br /> <br /> However, Gottberg is keeping Seth's sidelick lieutenant better. <br /> <br /> Some of the arrangements of the movie hurt me. This is where some film school students hit it together. This story is much bigger than Kenya West's ego. For example: Hillary looks like Luc's daughter, at least 11, and the first film was shot just seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me! Luke's partner has been killed and Gondam is just a part of what turned out to be a nasal! You tell me that there was an experimental utility that was naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the film. C'mon. The director spent the first time with this movie and closed all the holes in the plot. But oooh nooo! <br /> Speaking of the plot, IT SUCKS! Compared to the first film, the Universal Soldier 2's plot is watered down and worthless. Where is a sandal procession that repeats its last memories in a desert storm, a desert storm or something supermarket devastating? This is a progression of the Millennium, which in the future will be audiences in the type of the cystit / dystopia. This is a good thing to describe this tragic, sad, and sad sequel. <br /> From what I have seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and Hell, even the cheap-donkey / a class terminator Knock-off "1999 Class" is more entertaining than this!
