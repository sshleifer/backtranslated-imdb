The flat, life-size computer images that are shorter than astonishing backgrounds have shown a horrific fantasy story. <br /> <br /> You do not need to be surprised when Bryan Adams is voicing not only the main character, Spirit of the horse. Voice when he describes what happens. This article is not required, however, each one is really clear. You also say what the horses say, they are all neighbors. Which is good, but all the horses are exactly the same - one for the warning, one for mourning, one for laugh, etc. There is no variation between horse tones. Like this movie, though. It is rare for a family to sit and watch, and there is little risk for anyone as someone is afraid. If you do not do anything else and want to see a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> But this is not recommended.
