I do not know what to say about this terrible film that has not already been told. I'm honest and I'm angry. The title of the film was considered worst, but I loved my luck because I liked the war games. I'm worried about that decision in my life. Since the start of the government, I have explained how much of their super-computer they are able to decide how well they make the video game. However, I'm good for the ride, the better-writing-forgotten. IMDb will crash if I try to post a list of too many bad plots, dialogs and acting. Tell me who told me the worst of these movies. I am curious to see something that is topped by this steam pile of horse dung.
