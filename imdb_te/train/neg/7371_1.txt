Steven Seagal .... How can you be part of such a horror film? I've rented these movies because your movies are generally very clean. I have lost much respect for you to be in an awful picture of this. Very, very little taste! I also got hired to rent this movie. Steven, if you are acting in movies like this, I believe that you are your career. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always get a "bad guy" with some hand strategie and clean it up ... and language is pretty clean in your pictures ... but this is something else. I have to think again before renting your other image.
