I'm not joking even when honestly saying that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a single ounce of reality in its flimsy dialogue or its blatantly plagiarized story line. I can not even begin to count the number of things in this film apparently ripped off from other films like "Omen" and. For example the nanny "Lucy" in this film is actually one of Devil's Minions who sent to guide and protect Satan's span ... This sound is very much for Mrs. Another factor is the first time that the orphanage was the first to die, just like the "The Omen". Fortunately, a priest escaped from lightning and escaped and killed his body .... Another coincidence and a hospital room with pictures of Jesus on the walls remained. On the walls of the wall, the walls of the Bible, such as the "Omen", were placed on the wall. Please start the comparisons between the end of the film and the "The Omen" because I have a lot to say here as I mentioned here.
