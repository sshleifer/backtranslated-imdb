This is a marginal, but well-loved, early remake of the early 70s. I saw at least 6 times real. The 1997 version is a 20 minute film 'Cranged' in 2 hours or in runtime. The cheesy storyline is different from the original. The main government's involvement has been lost. Do not flow from one scene to the next. Originally you could get a beer or hit the bathroom and still go to keep up. <br /> <br /> It took just a few hours to change the oil pan in the car. In real life it takes a lot more time. The car guys notice this thing. Furthermore, the 1968 charger should be filmed with a thick bullet with a heel bullet of the fool or fools chosen to misuse the worst of the 1970s challenger. If they are not 'car people' they are clearly visible and their passport does not get distressed. <br /> <br /> The actors did not have any emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a mono. <br /> <br /> Finally, but not sure, Radio DJ. The challenger has been hit by bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). That's all the worst. Are you aerodynamics or not? Hahahaha !! This film is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this time.
