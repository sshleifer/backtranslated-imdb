I worry, it does not really cinematically, the negligent mish-mash of borrowed footage and the awkward new footage of the bunch only together with the whole confusion and call it a "Boogeyman" sequel. Literally 80% of the film was stolen from its long predecessor "The Boogeyman", even those worst writers did not like to see, because they were the actress Suzanne Love's original character (Lacy) right. And the killer will not appear in the original footage and appear in the new footage to add insult to injury, apparently their viewers are stupid. From 0 to 10 and I wish IMDb's rating system was the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off the money of people I saw, even when I saw less!
