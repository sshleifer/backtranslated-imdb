I rarely do these comments but I thought others would have to cut the pain that I see in the film. It's so stupid and implausible in the whole story and details that you just can not suspend disbelief. This problem began in the beginning, when a government investigator looked at a new Porsche and a caf√© in Washington, DC, on a Capitol building in his dining room, when he saw that kind of government salary, It worsens further. In the end, when the bad guy starts killing the owl, the final team seeks to die as the law dies, to cleanse the gene pool. Special effects are very good - no producer's money can be bought - and the main actors are great in other films, but the screenplay and direction are moronic. Many people think that there is some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous, face stupid films (Soggers, Starship Troopers), but this film should be stopped by surprise. He is bad.
