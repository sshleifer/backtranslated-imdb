The movie was a case study for most people not to do the film. Since I am a filmmaker, I give a 2 for the consistency. <br /> <br /> For all successful bits of stories, The graphics were similar to seeing a video game at computer points created and the director did not make any attempt to add some realistic feature to the story. <br /> <br /> It seems like this project has brought forward the limits of a very low budget film. Dragging a product along with the story without engaging the audience without their imagination. Actors are not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
