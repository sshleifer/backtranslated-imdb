Because this movie is the only reason DVRd 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is now and plays basketball for us. I've always heard how awful. The film does not disappoint. The best parts shock clothes. The worst parts are all just fine. My 12 year old son and I squirmed and started to shock rap and we would not look at the screen when we kept wondering why Max did not wish for Kazzam to fix the Dental before that! But for all it's terrible we can not stop looking at it, as the story is a black hole or quicksand or a tar bit, you are sucked, you suck. But it's worth it for laughs and we really see "casum".
