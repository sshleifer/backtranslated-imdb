I'm happy when real blood is killed, but when I put the DVD to the bloodstream, and a bloody scene (iball) at the end of the fake scene I've been receiving, and spinning a desk chair, I end up thinking "I've never been 43 minutes in my life forever. " I would not assume this is the exercise of this or the concept of Flower and Blood "Movies" too; Watch if you sit through them. There are some tough spots to see flush and blood flower. Devils did not experiment. It's fine, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectation is too high. I thought the DVD "Oh man, this is sick." <br /> When they watch a thousand times a fake applause, I'm looking forward to it faster. <br /> <br /> The two people are interested in the film. 1) F'd up movies to see how much f'd up really people want, or 2) full of horror. I sought the next reason for this and other guinea pig films, but even if I dropped into the former category, this film would not float my boat. In fact, I guess this film will increase a bloody live ... "Will you kill the B * TCH already?" So in the end, the only reason this movie is owned is for collection purposes. If you want a carnage that does not offer traditional horror, get traces of death. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see only those who appreciate this garbage is because they feel that they have to do it. I do not have any artistic merit that I understand, it's no reason, nothing. A laughing attempt to shock.
