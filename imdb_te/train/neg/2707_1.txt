This is one of the most dirty movies of the 90s. I would not recommend it if anything good to you. <br /> <br /> The film presents African-Americans a barbaric, impregnable, violent, impartial, referer-smoking sokopathas. The fudge (ice cube) and his pose of Holmes continuously deal with others, not just white, but also asians, their discipline is not disciplined. Despite all the patience they are crying about the evil white men who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact it is the effect of the fudge, to bond with the skin heads, to get out of college and eventually kill Malik girlfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not make people angry with their music, or blame police. They commit serious crimes such as battery and rape, but they are not intimidated or intimidated by Fuzzz and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <p> Bring me or me. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dredd are students at Columbus University, and we can not see them in class and do not know how to pay their tuition. They smoke are left to suppose they have something to do with their finances. Although they are students as a private university, they can not even say a single line in the proper English language. <br /> <br /> Drink Kristen (Christy Swanson) seems to know why drunken Billy is taking her home. She also asked them to get rubber so that they could begin. The fact that she penetrated her without a condom is a rape, it would be great sex if she had good sex. Kristen Tarin (Jennifer Connelly) was no longer responsible for this, and she was not ready for sexual intercourse but flogged on a person's bed and was seriously benefited by sexual abuse. Then a week or so she met me, and knew how to bring a condom to an ultra sensitive do-well slept with. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of full black and full of nostrils and women look stupid and brittle. Cole Husser's performance, and Laurence Fishburn's voice is the only ideas I see. The author / director is clearly a limited intelligence man. If you want, go ahead and lower your own limits, but neurons do not get back. Just follow the end and the advice at UNLEARN.
