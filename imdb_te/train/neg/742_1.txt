If the movie has a 20 million budget, I would like to know where to go the money. A monkey trash can do good CGI effects after wasting 3 hours on this horrible piece, but I have to admit the machines and look really good in the original PlayStation 1 game, and the early PC games have always been a game since the mid-90s. Where did the money go? Pradaragon films La George Lucas Circa with a good old design patterns and computer controlled cameras has been able to construct a great movie with 1975-83, and actors who really like what they are doing (or destroying this case) are 20 million. This is probably the worst movie ever made! I sit by Ishtar's 24-hour repeat screening rather than watching this film again. I'm totally hated! I'm going back. Apart from plan 9 or other bad movies like Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus, you will have a special place in your heart, they love you, because they beat the Martians. There is no place in my DVD library for my love for the film. I sold it to a person for a dollar. I was betting for this film, spent on booze and other evils for cast and crew. You disgrace Pandragon Movies! I need my money back!
