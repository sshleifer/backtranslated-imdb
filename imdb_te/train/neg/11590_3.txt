This is getting worse, the sequel is severe. The first two sequels are acceptable and since then we've seen really gruesome movies. Robert England gives another great performance as Freddie, but the other cast will not work. The story survived from the previous installment of Alice, Nightmare series, and Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams begin once again. This time, the murderer by Alice's sleepy child was killed by a murderer. His intention was "born again" to the real world. Who is the only one who can stop Freddy from his dead mother, but can Alice be able to release her soul to save her son? Check out the first three, watch the last three miss the last.
