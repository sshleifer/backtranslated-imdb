* Possible spoiler. <br /> <br /> 'Return of the cabin through the lake' is a useless film. This act is not good and the plot is not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> The cabin of the lake is a good TV movie. No sequel. Jad Nelson is the first in the very first movie and has put so much of his character in his role. He seemed not interested in the sequel. His performance is good but it may be good. In my opinion, I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because they are not even valuable. But I will do it. Alison's role was not even shown in the first part. Suddenly she is the focus of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role does not make sense and it needs to be a little better. Dallia Salem is definitely terrible. Her performance is poor and the cast people should find someone else. Director, Mike, is a confusing character. He appeared to have a purpose for being there but it does not seem like his death is needed. <br /> <br /> Acting for this role is great and is no greater than Salem. <br /> <br /> If you think about this plot is truly lousy. Stanley, who feels dead, makes his way into a set of 'Kabin by the Lake' based on his script. He delays on the director, shortly after the director dies, and Stanley is running on the show. Yes, out of nowhere the staff just come up with this stranger and let the film complete without knowing anything about him. There are some murders, not quite a lot, and what's shown is ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set was electrocuted when filming the scene. Another character is chewing through a motor boat. And one ends in one plant before sinking. <br /> <br /> The authors of this film should be firm for enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I said that I was not impressed with the filming of the film. It began to swamp rapidly to a change from the general budget. Also, the new cabin of the lake was created poorly. We did not show it but in some scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement is useless. <br /> <br /> We have shown a lot of movies in this movie, but it is not a work. <br /> <br /> There are many characters in this sequel. There is no reason except for some of them. <br /> <br /> All in all, from where the 'Return of the Cabin by Back' is a sequel picking from the first place. 'Cabin by Lake' I take it but it's just not impressive. Judd Nelson must avoid it and so should you. It was not the first and totally slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it lasted for the latter. The writing is not terrible. <br /> <br /> In this way, we will see that Stanley's death is restricted and still alive but still good. As he said, just one film could be possible only a third possible just sounds through it. <br /> <br /> Did not the filmmakers realize that they had shown us how they were filming the lake scene from the beginning? <br /> <br />
