This mystery ... this film is blowing. Sorry, but it did. <br /> <br /> In this unfortunate event, you played the last Summer and Scram, Beth, Dory Barton, and friends on the Spring Break journey. The group tries to rent a fancy house and enjoy a pleasant holiday. Then, deaths begin. The first one after another killed another of the friends, the predictable results led to the sad and affordable climax. <br /> <br /> Darry Barton, Reese Witherspoon of the poor, looks like Reese, Reese and passes the police line for Rees. Perhaps how did she cast her? Anyhoo, good cinematography and judicial acting did not make for much bad dialogue and terrible writing.
