I hate it when the film is completely different from the end, after you have already taken it for an hour. And what happened with this picture. I was disturbed by its actors and Malmood wrote the story of his origin. I did not go to read that story but I can not imagine that this movie will end. Unfortunately, my library did not pay to see it or rent a good money. Such a fairy acting (specifically the wife is perfect) is such a waste of ohh. But what is a Milo Ocea as a Jew? !!!! It's funny now. I did not research in its production, but the director had lost his marbles or starred in a movie 3/4 way. Prior to that story, the story and characters were developed, there were plenty of plot and no time wasted. But ooh that last 1/2 hour- that's not the screwiest, the most worthless decouement I've ever seen, I do not know what to do. When one's faith is destroyed, I hate it; It's a violent act.
