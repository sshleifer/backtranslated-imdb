One of the worst films ever. Funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. I can not see the most famous actors, take action, and not be able to walk. Nancy Young can not lead the woman. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasionally weak jokes come flat. The basic premise of the film does not even make sense. Somehow they need to stop being married but there is no logic behind their actions. My wife looked slowly but I was suffering from it. Older men are supposed to be acting as young and horny as they are, but funny rather comes like a patric. How did they earn money to make this money?
