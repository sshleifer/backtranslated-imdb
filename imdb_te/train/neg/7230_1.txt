I like science fiction, attracted by Egyptian myths and I congratulated digital animation. I have enjoyed the film that has been combined with these three. I have not done much wrong: the story (or in reality) is totally uninterested and does not have a fiction - but it is usually a big part of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are much worse than average romance. Thomas Kretschmann in particular gave the new meaning of the word 'bad work'. Bad acting is not a big problem if 'Bilal' does not take himself seriously. All the stories are sound, they contain poetry, and Bilal really thinks he's made a piece of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry found in this piece of junk, just pretentiousness! If he fails on all the accounts of the director, this person is really committed to comics. All the worst terrible digital animation, it is unrealistic, it actually looks like a physical traumatic experience. The graphics are so fake that they were made in the movie 'Van Helsing', which looks like live musicians! And half the letters from CGI-animated, it's quite a problem that CGI-effects are so fake. If the Egyptian gods actually exist, Bilal will be a dead man because they will be fierce in the guilty sinful way for him to deceive them.
