Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see his work. He is known for saving his existence as a single film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The film is suffering from a low budget and its product values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for Christopher's love .... Avoid this movie!
