Unlike the great cinematography by the fairy James Ong Hau, the film is a real stinger. <br /> It was the second film I saw in the second days of Alexander Korda's direction. The first is Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt." It's too lousy I shut it down. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth, the Queen of Flora Robson, always hated. Perhaps, her performance as a Virgo Queen is good for 1937 standards, but it certainly does not match when compared to Helen Mirren. In robotic fashion, Robson tells her lines. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Olivier can not free this frustration too. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivienne League is here a supporting role and she does not really reveal anything here. <br /> <br /> The history of the Spanish Armada is insulting that the film will be boring.
