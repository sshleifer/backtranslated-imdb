With a true story, it was a very strange but occasionally elegant exploitative movie, but its excellent performance was the main actress and nice, gorgeous makeup effects. Daniel was a beautiful twenty-year-old girl who was raped when she was 13 years old. She leads her to believe that nightmares and hallucinations are the reincarnation of an ancestor of a woman mentioned to her. She was killed in the night encounter with her brother-law killing her and being hospitalized. However, she escapes, and the police will devour more men by accidentally detectives, doctors and relatives. It's very beautiful and very listen (really great soundtrack), but the lack of plot and continuity has become very frustrating. Fortunately, the mainstream female Anek Borel rarely ever dresses and fills boring moments by dancing naked. The image is too long, very strange and very forgetful. Suddenly and blue, director Rhino de Silvestro tries to convince us that he believes his film is true. Yes true ...
