There were no earlier reviewers, many of whom praised for its accuracy, and actually read Louis Pasteur's biography. The relationship between Pastor and Napoleon III is very opaque. A self-appointed "military intellectual" who allowed him to be dragged into a deadly politician and a fierce battle in France, he is not a stupid reaction that has been shot here - from a spectacular role back in the 1930s. He has a brilliant interest in science and has seen a bright future in the 19th century as a result of improving many other people. From the departure of Pasteur he had his PATRON, a laboratory for him and all resources needed for his research. During the lab construction, Pasteur was seriously ill. An officer decides, deciding that he would soon create a laboratory for a dying person and ordered him to stop working on his own authority. When the emperor heard this, his zeal stirred up the power, so the buck-move was quick and the work was restarted. Emperor Pachtar personally visited him to comfort him and assure him that he would get his lab. It was clear to all that his court members were to admire Pachur's projects and one of Pascal's favorite of the emperor. The pastor's main concern about the Emperor, Napoleon Pasteur, is almost impossible to do, and his appointments are continually appointed outside his previous experience. Pastor, a very modest person, always protested, but always met with Napoleon himself, and despite his suspicions of the pastor, they always had a close and friendly relationship, and after the emperor was demolished, the pastor refused to give him a bad word, grateful. <br /> <br /> The daughter who has the daughter, and pastor sacrificed his principles to get a doctor, never happened. He is generally well known about the famous Anthracs and rabies, but the introspection of Anthracs has brought him from the dark to fame, during which he was well-known and respected. This film is dramatic, but it is distorted in a very biographical way.
