If you want to learn the basics of Quantum Mechanics, spend $ 9 on a textbook that does not use this movie. The money I spent was used to buy Cool-Aid for transportation to Guyana. <br /> I do not think the directors really got anything, but they are trying to do a lot of people. 1) Science means that our lives are decisive, science can explain; 2) Science can not be used to describe everything we can not do, that means we have a free will; 3) Science, like really cool, brother; 4) We are God. 5) The world is only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough character to follow and 7) Here, put this little paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.
