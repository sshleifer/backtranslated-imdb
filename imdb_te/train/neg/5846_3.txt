Yes, it's one of these movies, so terrible, so desperate, so simple, you can not stop laughing. I saw comics, good humor, less than my wife and I laughed in the film. Other comments make this idea better. Characters mobilize rats, you're casting anyone's primary school art class, acting - oh acting - you're excited to talk about tired conversation and awkward pauses <br /> But the rat, yes, the big rat. In the end, we did not see the mouse. The budget is limited and good effects chew more money because it does not often show 'big' one. In this case the big rat was hidden until the filmmakers were ashamed that they were dressed as the best of the Third World Dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most exciting part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After the rats find that a large noise (migrons from bad acting) can not stand, a major fire alert threatens to send the main dude rats. If you want to see a pair of rats, squirts blood out of their heads like the Gisner paired with Waltz, this picture is for you. Really, you have to rent it and look for yourself. <br /> If not more than 99 Â¢, okay?
