This film is awful. CGI Very cheap gray blow CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray scar. The worst it is that all the effort is to make it walk or is it is alive. It's very visible and you feel you'll see the hand moving the CGI spots on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I have ever seen, and I have seen many bad science fiction channels. <br /> <br /> Special effects are composed of simple low cost actors who work with waiters / waitresses at local diners while they are waiting for their big breaks, rather than cast. One of the bad guys Kate and the Giant Crocodile Villains is joking directly out of the water to the second floor of the headquarters and trying to pull the off the bad guy through and through the balcony is perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie. Kate and Crack down directly through the building (and Kate Crack) Just behind the same angle in water Fly. The laws of physics apply to this movie or special effects. At least crocodiles are respected.
