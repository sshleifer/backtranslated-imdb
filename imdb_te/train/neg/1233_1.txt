Oh god. This film is a thriller and a perfect joke for me. It was written by a 5 year old. The plot, acting and filming of the film are also insulting. </ p> <p> I can not say this criticism about any movie, each person has his own style. But this film, though, is probably the worst movie I have seen in 2008. I honestly believe this movie is unknown, and I think it's like a like this, for a thriller genre for movies like this one is joking. /> <br /> I would advise someone who is a fan of breathtaking movies or even films to stay away from these movies.
