OMG watching this is the most painful experience of my life. I can finish what's happening to Nikki. Teen Nick is their best thing about Drake and Josh and thats about to go off the air. Children's songs are a little annoying and so kids. My younger sister wanted to see this show because there were any likes in Disney or Nick, but after completing the show she said, "One of the worst performances I've ever seen boring." My little brother fell asleep. If you are briefly without your brain aged 3, you'll be happy in this event or change the channel now.
