Oh man this movie is bad. This is terrible flowing. The story is about a race car driver who loves himself, and then a chicken has to promote fast food chain and while doing this, he does not love himself. He tries to get out of the deal and make the terrible, painful unfunny cast occur. Jim Noorce does not act as if he is asleep. When you see this stinker you will lose Burt Sidekicks like Do not Delus and Jerry Reed. Anderson's hair is heartfelt scary, proof that Harrisway's tons did not go out in the sixties. Or it's a wig. Burt's wig is not bad in the film. His worst "Wig Day" is in Smokey and Bandit 2. Anyway, the film is the worst Reynolds car ever, ever, with "Cannonball Run 2" there. The great, funny pictures of the original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", gratefully, do not have any sequel). It's not. Ned Betty, a great actor, also sticks. You'll be long for the Jackie Gleason type villain. And mind you, it's not one of those fun movies in the bag. It is lousy, pure and simple. At the end also outtakes are tiresome and boring, and all are the worst, unfunny. And at least I was one of the first big nails to print the "Stroke Ace" Burt's coffin, in "Boogie Nights", which shows that before the "Deliverance" years, man can act. Very good when he is so good platform.
