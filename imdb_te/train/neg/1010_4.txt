I rented this movie last week. I'm on Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, so it seemed good. This happened in the Justin Timberlake scene. He is really a bad actor and never allowed to film again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, enthusiastic actors I've ever seen. He puts no emotions on his lines. Why was Josh Polach's hell for the role? <br /> <br /> I think Matt Damon was a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is another big disappointment. His character is very confusing, a bad combination of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's performance is great. This is one of the few good things about this film. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing is unique. <br /> <br /> The story is good, although it's a bit obvious and sometimes exaggerated. I was looking forward to a big twist when Lazarusov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing happened.
