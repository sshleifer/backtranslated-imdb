I covered this film. It's not funny at all and the main characters are bad. The girl is beautiful but the story and the acting are terrible. It was not completely done with surfing. A surf "terrible image" with surfing and nothing with original surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones is very beautiful and this film is probably now a rebirth, she's fine now, Gordon Gekko and all are getting married, but if you do not see it you will not waste your time. The bad picture with the great surfing, real surfers and the amazing, beautiful cinematography is in the hands of God.
