The second segment used me as a little boy because I rented it. I actually walked early in the morning, I started looking at the HBO, and the raft (segment 2) frightened me. This time around, I still enjoyed the sound, though I could not say whether it was for nostalgia reasons or whether it was really a little short. The other two departments were completely worse. I can not believe that the producer paid for this junk somewhere. Destroying a childhood memory of everything I have achieved by watching. Creepshow 2 will now have to join Rady on my list of stigma childhood classic. 4/10
