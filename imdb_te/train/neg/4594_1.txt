<br /> <br /> It is good to have some basic factual information about quantum mechanics. Although quantum physics has been around for more than 50 years, this information is of great information: "You have never removed it before!" Well, really not. These are no longer Earth Broken Revelations. At any time, I already knew better about quantum theory, and the particles do not need to be described by the wave equations. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with the film is that these people use Quitmum theorem as a way of providing scientific evidence to mysticism and spirituality. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spirituality, but Quantum Mechanics does not really have any connection with these matters, and it should be special. With the ideas of Quantum theory they will make an interview for this film and then make a leap, thinking about it, you can change the content around you, so it's good to have a positive impact around the world and improve our lives. The argument is totally ridiculous, and the conclusions from quantum theory are not logical. For each "expert" they interviewed for the film, there are theoretically totally dissociated physicists. <br /> <br /> They have suggested that the unorthodox world can not support mystical feelings about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It 's a nice positive feeling. The film's main thrust is based on the total misinformation of Quantum Theory, and it is very bad in its argument in any attempt to justify organized religion with the same principle-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> Oh yes. At one time, one of the "experts" has been misinterpreted by many of the world's estimates of estimates throughout the world, and we are now inclined to make predictions about the whole world. Huh? Do not follow that completely. Even if it does, I do not know how to help her. I mean, if his ideas are always a simple speculation, it is based on his own reasoning, assuming that we have to think it is wrong.
