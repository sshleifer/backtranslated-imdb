This plot is exactly the bugs bunny cartoon named "Baby Buggy Bunny". Baby Faced Finner stole a bank, hurled money into the carriage and dropped into the Bugs rabbit hole. He dressed as a baby to go into the hole of the bug to get the money back. He is directly from the scene cartoon in "Little Man" looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his note. It's a happy 5-minute cartoon; Not quite a whole movie. If you really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was the first time (1954). Plus you will get the most classic bugs bunny cartoons boot!
