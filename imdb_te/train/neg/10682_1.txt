So I'm looking for a DVD rental and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars with James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and is a summary of a teaching political thriller. Well worth the look. <br /> <br /> Now, being something of a whodunnit, I would like to without really 'ruining it' for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity Not to slash into it, but 'why he / she / did they do it?' For such questions, do they "remove these resources on earth?" <br /> <br /> For the acting - you know about the movies you like, the movie is a terrible mistake, and this shows it in their performance, one of which is a ridiculous script and a seriously flawed, irritating, <br /> <br /> It does not make it to the movie, allow it in your room; Continues.
