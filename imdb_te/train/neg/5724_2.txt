I agree with the last reviewer that there is a terrible act in the film. Yes, there's a lot of gore and some nudity. But with a slow moving, meaningless storyline and mute end. Where is it portrayed: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel is a better image and instead I'll see it. The technical outcome I have with the DVD is that if you close the Spanish subtitles, they will come back after a few sequences, then you have to go back to the main menu and stop them again. Also, do not waste your time in deleted scenes because there is no audio and it just looks like tourism footage.
