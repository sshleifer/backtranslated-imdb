"Look, I know this is right now, but the pain is temporary, the film will never be, and you'll ever be spilled into celluloid for all times and thousands of years." ?? <br /> <br /> Originally directed by Steven Spielberg, the director directed and directed the director to adjust the screenplay. So we have a dangerous family that threatens an endangered monster in the form of released Robert de Niro from prison. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the unsuccessful family groups combined with the failure of the beast to drown the beast, failing to save the deer during his trial. <br /> <br /> In a simple Spielberg style, the father weakens his family and completes his sins instantly. The father retains his parents in the Pittersweet Coda, which is enjoyed by Spielberg, like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Neal, Tom Cruise, and nearly every "Daddy" figure in Spielberg. Eventually, the film was abandoned and moved to Martin Scorsese instead of this project, when he tried to trade his business at a more commercial fare. This resulted in Scorsese's worst film in the film, and ironically, his most brilliant. <br /> <br /> The artist's failures or false lines often reveal the inner function of their art. While the story does not work, the characters do not connect or search for pictures, we have left some kind of inner core. Is it ?? <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an innovative movie, so Scorsese's filmography ("You've already sacrificed me)!" De Niro says, but pictures of Catholic liberation pictures of cookie cutter). This film is, however, revealing its type of stylized language. Let's see how Scorsese's camera is undoubtedly pulled back, and how madly he zooms in to the Dorcornobs and the windows in order to force the pressure and how big and screaming his characters are. But more importantly, see how the movie makes no provincial sense. At the end of the film a showdown occurs in a clear acoustic stage, a street parade is claustrophobia and occurs at any larger context and the family home is not exclusively anywhere. There are no geographical features in the image, Scorsese can not film the film or create any spatial atmosphere. <br /> The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera should always have a bond or bond to its central role. The role around the character in order to make sense is to focus on his camera role. Resinis can take you from a hotel around a French hotel, Wells and Hitchcock, and can move up the building, Cameron gives Titanic a tour, Scott can rebuild the entire city city scene, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and many other directors are "text-up-mid-shot A shot by "Shot Wide Shot" combinations Can create, but Scorsese can not do this. There are no poems in his stories, no point in the obvious. He's all about the role. If you break the tetter, leave the boxing ring in that taxi cab, you will see away from De Niro and everything will collapse. He can not break from this painting style, which precedes performance in a movie. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and sets become the central character, but this self - deliberately spatial experiment is suppressed by Daniel Magdalen 's magnetism, the actor ignorantly scares him as a moth for a bulb Drawing of the camera. <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite being a regular B-movie, this is an ugly, indecent picture. Look at matting paintings, trivial attempts, crazy rotor scope special effects and hockey pistastite showdown. However, we're taking Robert De Niro Slack. Scorsese gives his body a glimpse of De Niro, giving it a tattoo of Christ. In Juliet Louise's sexy romance, she kisses her thumb in her mouth and kissing. <br /> <br /> But the performance of De Niro is not so much tasty, just above Scorsese. You need tone and baroque visuals of musicians like the duplma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope. <br /> <br />
