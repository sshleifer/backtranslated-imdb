If I look at the movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made, I'm not one of those online. If you suspect me, please see my other reviews. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I have seen a movie that I have been in a lot of trouble, and I wish it was written long before. <br /> <br /> I loved bad movies. For me, Ed Wood was a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Zipper's Crepes and most horror horror movies were good. <br /> <br /> I am not a good thing to say about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist at all. If anyone reading my review wastes their money to see it, they will find out how this plot is, but I would advise you that the film is nickel than it is worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Do not spoil a movie for anyone but invite anyone to me foxbarking@yahoo.com <br /> <br /> I love the bad movies, I love the horror, and I love new images. <br /> <br /> Before you discarded this review, not only sat down by the Dead Sea Premier Premier, but actually purchased a copy of it.
