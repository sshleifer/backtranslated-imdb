The film is like a sequel to "White Zombie" because it is made by the same person (Halperin) and feedbackbacked zombies. <br /> <br /> Cambodia is a person who controls the minds of people, and the search to destroy the source can send zombies free of charge because of his power. Also, the love of the evil is interested. <br /> <br /> The images in this film are actually in the picture. Cambodian temples and dancers are great and their large number of zombie is very strong. Unfortunately, we do not see much of the astrologers in action and the love story plays a big role for a horror film (although it is later valid for a reasonable plot). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] And the powerful villain (like Bela Lugosi) is looking forward to the war against our leaders. And using Lugosi's eyes? A good influence, but he never misleaded in the film ... Why not rebuild with the new actor's eyes? Overall, a great script with a small script can work back and be a powerful remake a day (especially if they keep the frame during the same post war). Heck, if they can solve "The Hills Have Eyes", then the film is hopeful.
