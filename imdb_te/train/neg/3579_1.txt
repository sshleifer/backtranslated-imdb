As soon as the film was rented and looked a lot over the years, I decided that the picture and the film series were perfectly defined as zero. There is nothing about the film that can make it worse than this. <br /> <br /> A long time ago, a lot of good movies and much more bad people than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago, I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry. Among other things, "Last Summer" and "Mad Housewife Diary" and she asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins book "The Lonely Lady". They did not think she understood the problems of a female writer in Hollywood because she was sent to her treatment and she was rejected. Then she said, "I think someone is someone they write." The interview was filmed before the film's release. She died in 1981, and the first thing she came into heaven was to gratefully thank God for her to protect her from being involved.
