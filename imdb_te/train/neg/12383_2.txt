Some performances are better-Victoria Raul, Adriana Barbeau, and two Italian friends-the story is dirty and derivative, focusing on the lovely background of the girlfriend moves better and relatives are often portrayed as normal, not real people. I found the wincing uncomfortable at most moments that were funny. I can not understand why local paper is good in SF here, it's amazing to post a glowing review here in IMDb. Very disappointed in this film, and madness I actually went to a theater to see it, based on the mistaken connection of the Garden State, this is much more ridiculous, more inventive than the one, and the touching image. I particularly need to mention the emotional climax in the church, the number of wood and numbers I've left almost, some of the audience really are. The next 10 minutes before I got a silly climax in the graveyard I saw. I do not want to mislead my money to spend my money.
