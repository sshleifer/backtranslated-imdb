Woosh ?? Man? What can i say <br /> <br /> The opening scene, maybe? We see a group of Mongol-barbarians who have made a mistake by some of the ruins of the ruins. They penetrate around and some people are attacked by a cloak of a small dress. The dude escapes, the mongoloaids follow him and one of them is raped, but instead she reveals one of her chests and kidnaps her. Then, the dude (still in the run) sees a horse and tries to steal. Suddenly ?? The god who appears as a hero with a vicious cast appears, "This is my horse!" "He said. Mighty Deathstocker just performed his performance. With the arrival of monologues, some Mexican Western score (which is not a swords & mortars flick, so goes to the 'arriia-troppets' captive girl and reveals both her breasts, which he starts to rub and captive girl loves it. They begin to build This old dude appears, the exact day end for Deathstacker and the smallest thing that's just the end of the film is interrupted, now tell me, if the feminist is the cinematographer, or any male spectator "It's a good film's hell! "This plot is as easy to throw a cat from the balcony: Deathstart Sword of the need to get a lawyer and Charles to steal magic from the evil sorcerer munkar use it. <br /> <br /> executed, trippikottadam, random bloodshed, retard fist fights, knife fights and awkward, the film also t! ts & $$ has a huge amount of shots. I initially added an extra point to this movie, for each indirect shot of naked boobies I could imagine. After 9 points (not even half of the film), I had to count. It is focused on me from the rest of the film. The rest of the image is valuable. Totally crazy stuff. This mutant cat / worm-like creature is a pet of Munkar and checks he has feeds on eyeballs and fingers. And here's an interesting question: What if a man enters your bedroom in a woman's body and tries to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple: you slap around a bit, take away the knife and try rape him. Then he realizes that he is not a woman, so you tell him to throw him away from your bed and leave your room. It works well, I will tell you. <br /> <br /> "The villains are vigilant and women are well aware of them, including blood, sexuality, violence, rape and delicious chicken. There is a completely unintelligible tournament that contains a group of barbarians, hitting and removing each other's garbage. My favorite weapon used in the tournament was a huge wooden hammer, which defeated the poor competitor to the bloody pulp. <br /> I do not know how the film ends, but I'm ready to make you happy when the film is thrown in the climax of the 4-way pieces. <br /> <br /> In fact, the inability of the entire movie to see a man who is carrying a horse on a dirt road And the next point-of-the-shot shot shows him straw (no road). Make a magical tattoo on the head of the magician, turn the miracles into the same scenes (on the left of his head on the shot, on the other right). Well, after all, Munker is a magician. This is, or the film is portrayed in an alternate universe, where there is no "continuity". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I'm preparing, however, to give the maximum amount of minimum points, so I can probably deduct a couple of more points for the low-level sequels to follow. DEATHSTALKER may be a wonderfully fun, worst & serious CONAN Rip-Off, which is also abhorrent.
