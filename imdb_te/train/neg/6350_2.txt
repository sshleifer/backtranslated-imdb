I saw my stake in Woody Allen's films and I think that when you're not always great, you're generally going to be entertaining. Perhaps the last really good ones were Broadway Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then I have seen them are sparse but watchable. So when I was invited to watch the new Woody Allen film Melinda and Melinda, I did not know yet, but I was happily mingled. <br /> <br /> "What have I done? The premise is explained in detail, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless, and there are not many scenes yet, <br /> <br /> I do not care for the concept of the film - two directors are commenting on a simplistic situation like comedy or tragedy The film is trying to show us how to play through two scenes.The problem is that these two films are not all good.The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. <br /> <br /> Allen has come up with a good idea but after completing the movie Steam or Time ran out. <br /> <br /> Normal level of acting is also bad - Ferrell who is alone  ట్టిక ఏదైనా తెస్తుంది, మరియు ఇది ప్రాథమికంగా ఒక వుడీ అలెన్ ముద్ర ఉంది. గతంలో చిలీ సెవిగ్ని వంటి మంచి నటులు ఇబ్బంది పడుతూనే ఉంటారు మరియు మెలిండా వలె రాధా మిట్చెల్ (ఆమె పాత్ర దాదాపు ప్రతి సన్నివేశంలో ఉన్నందున) ఇది రాఫే మిట్చెల్. <br /> <br /> Actors do not have the existence of the script in which they are working. We know and certainly far away from the classic from Manhattan or classic like Annie Hall.
