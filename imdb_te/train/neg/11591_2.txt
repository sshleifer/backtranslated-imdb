The film was so bad, it seemed to me sick. At this stage, there is at least one good thing about it in other installments. Part 1 Suspense and Gothry. Part 2 Beat off and entertaining. Part 3 is interesting with great effects. Part 4 great music, good special effects, and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is boring than anything I've seen before. Alice is very dear, from Part 4, and she is back with Prince Don. In some areas, Em St Street installment becomes a daytime soap. The new characters appear stricter, and the sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy looks completely from this one. He is tired, and does not seem to be gruesome. He is a linear place and looks different, in Part 4 they are pretty funny. Leslie Bohem's story is never on the floor and Stephen Hopkins is very bad in directing, it's great my grandmother! The entire plot is ridiculous and irrelevant. It is also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
