As a young pastor I have heard good things about this film. Then I saw it. Acting is not the best. It's a forgery. Give it your message: Jesus will give your life and everything will change - you'll fix it better, make amazing catches, stop wanting to stop, make the touchdown goes, and even make the playoffs. Jesus miraculously weakening weaknesses in American athletics. He scores goals why he has goal goals Why coach the coach to explain the coach when loudly laughed. But wait, it's not. You raise a branded truck, $ 6000, and you and your wife's fighting suddenly end up with pregnancy - twice. God knocked out more than 12 yards before weakened, because he had earlier kicked and lowered in the air - because "God wanted to do it". You will win the state championship next year. <br /> <br /> I'm away from the film: God can do anything he wants to do. It wants to do it - and it makes our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps win the games. Which Bible story is based? I'll bet St Stephen wish he'd know a safe life keys before he came to death rocks. In order to follow Jesus, 10 of the 11 apostles should take this film before 10 people die. This will cause them a lot of trouble.
