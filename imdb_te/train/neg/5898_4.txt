In general, take every Asian horror ghost movie concept and hit it in one and you will get this movie. The story goes on: A group of college children get voice mails from their own phones that tell them about their deaths. Some are going to be with any *** ghost, it is not scary now if you see any Asian ghost movie. This film is very upset because it's very cliche. This is the same bull crop, a different image. <br /> Acting is very good. Unfortunately, most of the actors put it in the Ring-Esquire situation, so this is nothing we have not seen before. <br /> <br /> Gore is not so much going on, like gore. We have a cool sequence, so that the head with the head twisted (not known how to explain it), but let's see it except the final result. Guilt hands and a zombie (I think it's nice to mix), but you'll see some blood at times when this film is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The fears in this film are low and expanded, and this is not really scary. You sometimes get some creepy images, but I can not be scary. It's not different from ring, ju-on, or dark water, none of them are intimidated by me. This really (and most Asian horror films) is the reason for the fall is not good if it does not provide fears. <br /> <br /> As long as directed, Takashi Mike is still a very good job. He seemed to be far less likely to be compared to his previous films, but he is still very popular in his confused style. Most of the films were mike (including a scene with dead embryos), the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed to be the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend only those people who are heavily on Asian horror films (although you can, I can recommend better) or big Mike fans. <br /> Warning to those who want to go to Michael, this is not his best job. If this is released 4 or 5 years ago, it may have a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I think horror films in Asia are a real quick one. If an Asian horror film is it, would it automatically be here (US)? For all these movies, there are no screams in Japan, Urban Legends and I Did What You Dead Last Summer It's 90 Over. If you see them you can see them. And most of these movies are scares and relies on a lot of way over the imagery if they do not deliver the scares out then they are just not good, and nothing will change. More Asian horror films like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, if they do not intimidate or frighten the two, make them the greatest stories, acting, directing, cinematography and much more. Two films that are not just great horror movies, but usually great movies. In addition to the more Asian horror films cliche, "a ghost is their phone / video tape / house / electric appliance / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / kiros / etc."
