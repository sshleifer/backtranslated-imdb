I saw this movie in the free preview screening today, even though I could not pay the applause to see the film, I thought I was still emerging. Ladies and Gentlemen, the time is money and you leave a benjamin in your seat if you see this movie. Acting is the best; Keker Sutherland phones and Michael Douglas in Jack Bauer's deadly deceit were aware that he was aware of a bad choice left by Catherine Zeta-Jones when the turkey was taken to shoot. Eva Longoria is non-entity; She looks like reading her lines from the TelePaperter. And if you do not recognize "mole" in the first 20 minutes, you land on this planet in the world without TV and recycled story lines. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent in the fire line. The Secret Service looks and acts like the grown reforms from 90210 because you know that you are scared for the president's safety. Despite your feelings about W, this does not reflect the "art" life.
