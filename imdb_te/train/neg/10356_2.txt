(It might be a bit of spoiler) I'd like to start saying that I have not seen the whole movie, or it's clear from the first hour that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a very exciting book, and the issue of changing the Disney Made-For-TV movie. <br /> <br /> The writer in time is a wonderful long ago picture. It came with great storyline that kids and adults hook. Plus it got constructed in quality sequels. But Disney-Fiing is not the way to go. The problem with the film is that all things changed to change a visual story is dumb down what's great about the book. It's a complex and emotional story for kids. There is no reason to change Charles Wallace completely "mental" because it is the easiest way to describe it. There is no reason to write a fight between the added tensions of three Mrs. W, there is enough tension in the story. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to remove the glasses of the Mag ... The most sweet scene between Calvin and Meg in the book is that of us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For example they made a comma-jose form, with its eerie dark skies. The book creepiness that comes across may be the land of Camazotz. It looks like a land. It is with people who look like human beings. The skies are blue, the grass is green and the children play. But something a little bit. Directors chose to take full advantage of the Camacotte instead of taking the text of the book and applying it to the overall direction of the film. The lesson of course Camacotez is very good on the ground, ie if we forget how we love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not see the end. <br /> I unfortunately did not see it finally. <br /> <br /> Anyone can tell me how to do Disney's eventual confusion. <br /> <br /> Overall artistic frustration. <br /> <br />
