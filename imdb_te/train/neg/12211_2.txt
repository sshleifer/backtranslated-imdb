George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood Part II" Pure wish-fullness. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They imagined the loss of the country beyond the imaginary, which will continue the miracle of the Oh-innocent soldiers. Only the bad guys in this vicious country. Rambo's character is sure to notice this. He is a very patriotic, American-Americans who do not celebrate the achievements of a single soldier, but only the great officers and politicians are unreliable. Like every film that protects the battle (eg "We Were Wales") has also avoided the need for a comprehensive cause for engagement in South Asia. That is the reason for every American-American soldier. Instead, Rambo gets revenge for the whole country's wounds. It is better to work rather than to cope with memories. "We want to win this time?" Yes you are.
