Dansel is the only one in the film. <br /> <br /> In the early stages it's probably a good movie. Someone originally decided to bring some action and plot points to the beginning of the cinema, giving the storyline more than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is the first thing that can be confusing to you and then keeps you up. <br /> <br /> It is a great deal of injustice and anger that can attract audiences in such films. Grant, so if you are looking for that ... kicked yourself.
