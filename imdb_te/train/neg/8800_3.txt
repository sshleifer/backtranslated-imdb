Deleted scenes and editing of alternate judgments will be edited along with added voice-votes to appear after the first events. Pretty cool idea, but deleted scenes remain on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is more proof. It's not just as funny as "Anchorman", and that really is that the film's not exactly comedy is gold, so you get worse than a 'cinema' is moderately funny. Still puts it one or two knots on "kicking and screaming", or "bivitching" in my view. "Wedding Crossers" return to old school form (not my intention) <br /> <br /> My grade: D
