I picked up this film with the intention of getting a bad zombie image. <br /> <br /> I started the film and soon pulled into the world like pain and visual torture. <br /> When I finally know what the hell is like. This is the film. For eternity. This image is not worth it. This is not really a plot. <br /> <br /> Instead of looking at this movie, you have suggested that you line up the blender with oil and try it as many bullets. Can. You will find that the result is much better than this movie. <br /> Do not look at it. Not even bad to see. I will not spare you. If you see it, they mean winning.
