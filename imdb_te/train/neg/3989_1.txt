What is a song song in their right mind when filming an emotional scene between the two people? When Flipper falls in his dressing room in the dressing room, it is as big as the song dialogue sung with lyric feel, so no one can hear any emotional effect that has the scene. Annabella has her fist, her fist, the scenes playing with a lamp, and occasionally a belt cartoon. The whole picture is a cartoon, the dominant character of the white people is literally believable. Following Flipper's wife, the black talk was cheated on him with a white woman - if it was a debate by an Oxford discussion team that was ridiculous. Rare racism is possible, but the soundtrack and sound mixing are very high in the film. It is a poorly constructed film. There is no awareness of the movie making, the soundtrack, the editing and the disappointing effort of great actors. I apologized to Anthony Quinn, thinking why he played a role in this film - it's painful in his performance. This is my last film, the first film I have seen this director.
