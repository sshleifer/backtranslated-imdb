<br /> <br /> It has been plastered on the cover of how many of these "rubbish" covers are called "awards" ..... <br /> <br /> Words fail to describe how horrifying this film really is. <br /> <br /> I flat almost 20 minutes ago, almost constantly moving forward. <br /> <br /> The absurd absorption from the worst light to the horror direction is a complete and thoroughly enthusiastic piece called the film entirely. <br /> <br /> It does not have any ransom attributes seriously. <br /> <br /> Defend your cash and watch a good low budget horror film, Dead End, The Blair Witch, RIE, are very few to name. <br /> Get rid of this waste of all costs. <br /> Please note all other comments! You are alert!
