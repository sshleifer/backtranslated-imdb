Perhaps this film is about "viewer beware". Christmas Evil cigarettes should come with a warning label because it is harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely dislike this "B" horror film, but the film could not bring little fears for five years. The point of a relentless lunatic who has a thirst for blood in an image is a hideous attempt to surprise his next victim with difficulty in a chimney himself as he / she should look like almost as god, Follow the famous legend of Santa Claus all along, which he is dangerous How dangerous this man is too stupid iii because it is a reminder to the viewer. All in the whole waste film.
