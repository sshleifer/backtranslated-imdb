In Steve Irwin's show, he has landscapes. He's funny and he is not alone but his film is that I'll call a movie, when he's trying to kill me in a car, he's oh, it's ok! 'And looking straight on the camera side. He put his face in the camera too! Did you expect him to die when the car fell off? And Terry had the worst acting I'd seen! When the crocodile almost killed Stevie she said 'Steve'. She was not afraid or loud, it was 'steve'. I understand the sense of noise but it's not worth looking at that. I love Steve Irwin but his image is very stupid.
