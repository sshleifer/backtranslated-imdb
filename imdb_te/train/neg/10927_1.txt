Reviews of the film are good when the expectations are high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, funny thinking, and a major actress. The final result is a disaster. In Alice Tremblay's fantasy world, each of the funniest travelers will fail in every way to entertain audiences (I did not hear a single smile across the whole show), it's a symbol of magic that has its own page-narrative storyline and single spatial characters without a single spark. Sturl and some good actors are doing their best to come out as expert in a feature, with a thin direction of the film's 90 minutes here, certainly not a great idea on that set, just listen on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremble' is a collage of comic sketches, which is accompanied by very fine thin layers. Avoid or bored.
