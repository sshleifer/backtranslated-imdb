I saw this film in a drive in 1959. I thought this was the worst film ever seen till "Howard the Duck". The film has attempted to combine all categories with one another; Comedy, Horror, Teenage Anging and Hot Rod "My Mother, The Car." Perhaps it deserves a second view to see that it's a perfect reflection of the time.
