That song keeps humming in my head. Not a great song, but 80's. The film is the lead singer, "Supposebly" dies when he is accused of murders, as he shoots his girlfriend singing a backup singing in his band. The lead singer's name is Billy "I" (yes, right) dies after two years and his band returns for the concert, the backup singer is the lead singer. Billy shoots her and eventually kills these people, scares the girl and makes her around and she feels somewhat wrong. She finally goes to a cemetery and decides to take her tomb if she is there. He sees he is dead but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film, Billy has a brother, John, and he admits that he is jealous of his brother, and he scares her to bring the people back to him and accuse her brother of strangling her and then threatening him. The ending is very cheezy and acting is too lame and woody. But ... I like it anyway. I'm looking for it for the song. I wish I had it.
