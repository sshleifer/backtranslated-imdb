I can say that when I took this movie to see my theft, I said no terrible experience. Fay En Lee is a horrible actress and is unbelievable in this film. Larryjoe76 is clearly a shill reviewer. The storyline is very small, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tang must be after the film that is a low or no-income image. The common plot attempts to compete with other Rom-coms and combine to the scenes. It's like looking at dry paint. <br /> <br /> The total waste of time and space in this picture. I've seen good movies on YouTube.
