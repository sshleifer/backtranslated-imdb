This is one of the worst films ever. I like cheesy movies but it's terrible. Where are the pictures in the box? I spent more money with DVD box illustrations than the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why does a company release a covering DVD? I feel like an idiot to rent this movie in the box. I did a little research until I searched the IMDb and made a list before visiting my local video rental shop. Nobody can blame me except me. I need my money and time back. <br /> Do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> If curiosity promotes you, instead of cocktail umbrellas in your eyes. It is very enjoyable. You are alert!
