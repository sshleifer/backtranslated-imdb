When I saw the film, in 1979, it became the first film I went out in the middle. There is nothing more humorous than comedy, it's not just funny, and it can not be missed every time (I can not talk to the last 25 minutes of the film). There is nothing original about what the skits are. While I enjoy the appropriate ethnic humor, these skits are needlessly offensive. The film was advertised as "Robin Williams's first feature film", and invested on his newly known fame in the "Morg and Mindy" television series. And yet his character has become smaller and you can not see him on the screen.
