I've had some time for this creepy chic, and she does not have any complaints at all. But after catching it last night in high definition, I'm sure: that's not the only thing in the film that's not standardized. The script is terrible, acting is terrible, the direction is terrible. How great is the sex scenes? No one can. You might also change the soft romance when an image is this bad, but instead I get to see some paddy white dude blocking me from seeing Wuhrer body and scenes that provide me nothing except a merry. The film is not just a complete waste of time, but just cinematics must have gone. These awful scripts with the script should be capable of Wuhrer's looks, because that's the film's solitary pro. 2/10, she was very hot.
