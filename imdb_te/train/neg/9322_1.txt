Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you look at the horror movie that looks at it: it's not. Usually I'm funny for stupid, but this stupid is almost stupid (or perhaps) stupid to me. <br /> <br /> If the image quality is not better than handheld, music has been created by pressing Samba 2 key on the casino keyboard. These problems do not really need to be afraid of the horror movie, but add this amazing (tear) cast, and you have a real hidinggiger. <br /> <br /> The story is a family cabin in Texas for the weekend about who invites his friends to his friends. He invited his lady love in his office. On the way they meet women, he is invited to go along with other girls. <br /> <br /> When you are in a group (audience) and morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they Immediately another distrust begins. Overall, I made a better sound. The main battle characters with this film are very advanced, plot contrived, acting bad and impulsive clueless. <br /> <br /> It's really sorry, but it is at least bit funny but alas, it's not. <br /> If you really think about it again, no one can imagine it, the film will not be understood anyway. Please do not allow this review to stop you from looking at the imagery of this image strangely. (Woah, my nose just increased eight inches.)
