I do not spend much time or energy on this comment. I thought that all the comments were very positive because I thought everyone knew that I did not make such a pleasure for everyone, because I tried to create intellectual philosophical film enigma by this endeavor. Some scenes were played with visual dimensions, promising, but did not hold the rest. <br /> <br /> The weird attempt to increase the Dutch cinema into new heights. <br /> <br /> I am Jesus Palastine, raising questions about all the harassment and straightforward humor, life and the facts that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert D'graph Jean-Luc Goddard or Tarkovsky and never appears.
