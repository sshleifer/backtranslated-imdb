This film discourages people from doing drugs, and it fails. I'm ready to start using them and I have something to happen and really have to wait for nothing really. This film is not a horror or drama. This is just the frustration of meth users. The film can be used to use the term "F" several times and get the award unattractive. It did not say well, but I thought they were making me meth to give it to someone else. Hector was just more confusing and more suspicious, the film continued and the girl was just more disappointed. The conclusion is not really any sense. It shows how light the film is in the middle of a house somewhere in the middle. When I decided to watch this movie, I rely on other opinions and the rating should be low.
