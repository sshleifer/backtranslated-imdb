After dung sitting through this pile, my husband and I think it's really a product of an experiment to see if a computer program can produce a movie. It is careless and formula. But the US campaign thrown in your face throughout the film - frustrating - that it is the work of humans. I called a conspirator theorist, but it's like quotes like guides to justify the actions of the attack on Iraq, "We need to steal the declaration of independence." Nicholas Cage lines "use a bargain chip Independence statement" with a simple face that I and my husband are surprised to take the entire cost volume before filming each scene. The "logic" behind the back of each plot and the new "clue" is really fraudulent and impossible to follow. And there was a bonus site plot with a doctor named Wattf-she-named, "Moving For All" and was more conscious of everything. She was only apparent in the film for looks, but felt they needed to put a "doctor" on her role to give her gravity. On one occasion, Cage's character, "if you've ever been closed?" And she looks at her hands down at her hands down the camera, she's like a baby. Really grotesque. The only purpose of this film is that it is amazingly bad, you do not get some smiles out of it. The most horrific thing is that most of the people watching us enjoy this. Creepy ....
