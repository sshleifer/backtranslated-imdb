Back in 1985 I caught this thing in the cable (I would not even call a movie). I'm in college and I'm with a high school friend, and its hormones are out of control. At first I found that I was disappointed. Stupid script (some young boys showing some young players to score with women), bad acting (with an exception) and curiosity jokes. The abundant female nudity kept my friend happy for a while - but he was bored 30 minutes later. Remember - this is a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! It came back to the Internet and such nudity was easy before it became easy. We kept looking forward to something interesting or funny but never happened. The ridiculous thing about this is that the studio was the first advertising campaign to get the film worst! (A poster has a fictional review, "The best movie I have seen this afternoon!"). Not only Grant Kramer showed no talent and actually lost a career in business. Budget and Boring Ti & A. Skip to content
