It's good if you plan to sit with this teenager, blonde, and pokey film about a younger or older middle-aged widow with a younger or older teen daughter than she likes. In Tunisia, setting the mother pedals around the flat, Antzisi, and reluctantly (she just did not help her), wear dress and dance in a local carburet. Meanwhile her daughter is taking dance lessons. General divorce is a Tunisian band drummer. The film is full complementary and I've seen the DVD at x2 and read subtitles and walks the most common dancing and walking walks (they are walking everywhere) and more and x4 this boring, non-budgetable, low-budget movie has some pretty good complex compliments. Go and find out. (C)
