1920 jazz, 1920 costumes, Charleston and ultra-scandinous boats (e.g., all scores) are the ones who would like to like this film. But the sad fact is everything. The plot is simple and clear, acting is more terrific or playing to the frenzy of goeks, and the whole thing is not very high, but the seal of the mirrors and smoke. This beautifully made bad image.
