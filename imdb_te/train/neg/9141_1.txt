Oh man, what was Sam Mravov's idea? What's involved in this "movie" idea? Director, writer, producer (producer also producer!), Castor, lead star - the name of you, he scored: "Ben and Arthur" is almost everything head of Mraovich. <br /> <br /> The wrong thing in this film is that he (Meravich) has succeeded to anyone. Everything. The film tells of two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Meravich- * Gout *). Ben and Arthur want to marry a world that hates homosexuals. Ben's crazy "ex-wife" (they do not exactly divorce), Tommy (Julie Belknap) Ben has left another and they are madly gay to sit back together and demand Ben!) And Arthur's Christian, very hypocritical, Tammy's brother, Victor Like Arthur, turns to kill him, even as he is equally hypocritical and dedicated. /> The film is composed of most goofles (ie, Ben and Arthur flying to vermont), which have Alaska and Vermont palm trees, who return to a FedEx cargo flight - (Final Deed), Arthur and Private (intern) Detective Victor calls Arthur to kill "The Final Plan", Bla Bla , B). "Actors" are all too bad and way, way over; The script is a ridiculously horrific (for example, "I do not make sense! I mean it, it makes sense!") And "cinema" <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous and unbelievable thing about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Marwitz feels he has created something really amazing, Ben & Arthur "and clear comments on YouTube). <br /> <br /> In this way, Do not forget that the film is claimed to be the worst of the worst film - "Ben and bark Arthur," the title right away, Paris Hilton film, "The Dark Knight" as the "Ben and Arthur" will be compared to the so-called manistrositito.
