Slash flicks came down a few days, so when I heard about the cut I heard a lot of hopes and good things. The good things I heard were all wrong. This movie is bad and I mean bad. It's plain stupid. Everything about it. Especially the source of the killer and how he will be alive and how he will finally take care. There is nothing original or unusual about this movie. That's another slasher wannabe with "hip," "self-aware". "Cinema Understanding" characters. I'm sick of that trash. Some people need another blood for slash style, literally.
