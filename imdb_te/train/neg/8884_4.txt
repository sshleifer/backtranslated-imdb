"Dominic" is one of the words "slow-molasses". Many endless and repetitive scenes (how many times do we see Robertson running slow on the stairs as anyone can hear the piano)? Unfortunately, it will eventually be relieved by a surprising twist with a second turn that leaves bad taste in our note. Not very happy movie.
