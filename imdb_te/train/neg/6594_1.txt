I've seen most of Laurel & Hardy's classic films. After watching me again, there was a lot of humorously enjoyed there. The new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors similar to both Laurel & Hardy, but fails for a number of reasons. Although one of these was their clothes (at the beginning of the twentieth century), both were shot in about 90 sets. Some of the former talks brought back, but it also failed to come close to the classic series. The worst image of this movie and the worst of the movie is to remove the shelf and lock it forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are spinning their tombs in such a bad imitation.
