... and Athel Merman Buffets also loves her loud and quiet voice as a bad witch, but this cartoon sequel to The Wizard of Oz is unmistakable, with a noisy action of fantasy and excitement (and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video ). Little Dorothy goes back to Oz, unable to destroy it and meets old and new friends. Anatomical animation is somewhat difficult between Walt Disney and Hanna-Barbera, but many songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet tragedy "It's a Faraway Land", superbly performed by Liza Minnelli. You can trust Minnelly for energy, why the movie around Dorothy produces the film. It's not for many people, and I'm not sure whether it will get charged from baby boomers for a long period of time. As curious aspect, it is fair. ** from **
