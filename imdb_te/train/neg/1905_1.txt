I reviewed more of Buster Keaton's films for IMDb than one of the biggest fans of silent comedies and another person. Every film he has started since the beginning of his career has only reviewed me with two initial exceptions, so I can say a major fan. This is because I found this episode so painful and hard to watch. I love the pictures of this guy and "Buster, how are you doing?" I thought. Well, now I think about it, I guess Buster Keaton acted in this awful episode of The Twilight Zone. He lost his fortune after a terrible divorce in the 1930s. He spent a long time in his career as a prominent figure. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and enjoyed his darling in popularity, so he separated himself for anyone willing to pay - this mess of beach pictures and episode of a great series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> The show is funny but instead of a tribute to silent movies is just painful to watch - especially with Keaton keeping that stupid time travel helmet as well as all poorly executed extravaganza. Make a favor of yourself, this is a skype - once Keaton's career is a pale simulator of greatness!
