Wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say I can say I'm doing this presentation. Number One: They have no talent, they probably can not play instruments too. Number 2: On the Commercial They said they were famous but no one heard even until there came the crappy show. Look, I really hate that bad thing, I give you from 10 to 4, but they have a great deal of great talent to tell me that I'm writing so profound literature. My donkey Deep! He spoke of hardcore wrestling with inner feelings. Wow, I was able to read what I said on the walls of the bathroom and was much deeper than that. And they did not become known to themselves, their parents wanted their children so much that they are famous celebrities and they make a bad show. I'm going to cancel soon.
