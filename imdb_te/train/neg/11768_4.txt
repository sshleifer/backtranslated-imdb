This resume is similar to the McDonald meals processed compared to Yang Lee's very good but very poor 2003's "The Incredible Hulk". <br /> <br /> Ang Lee "The Hulk" is a comic book for the person who thought. Hulk takes some time (about 40 minutes), but when he sees the conflict at the core of our character. He does his best to avoid losing control, but he agrees, and he likes it when he gets angry. <br /> Now compare it to Edward Norton's turn, in his personality, he turns into Hulk and his pulse rate hit 200 beats per minute (not 183, 197 not correctly, 200). This reviewer, in the Phantom Menace, felt that the introduction of Midi-Chlorine was "powerful", as to how strong it was to obtain spiritual capabilities through a powerful test. In the 2008 film, all Ed Norton's Bruce banner should keep his pulse rate below 200, supervising the device tied to his wrist. <br /> For this record, it is very difficult to raise a pulse rate of 200, especially for a person who is physically fit. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive the Hulk of Eric Bana. He remembered the deaths of his mother and his father's role in his early life. He is calm on the surface, but there is little angle, it is enough anger to fill fuel when contrasting Hulk. But Hulk killed his assailants, intentionally killing them. Most likely, he wants to stay away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He saves his shooters and forces in a critical scene, following him from hitting a fighter jet. <br /> <br /> In 2003, there were visual effects, but necessary. <br /> <br /> The action sequences (and a lot of them) require plot, unlike the action film for action. <br /> <br /> The "Fugitive" story focuses on how the Ed Norton Bruce banner feels about Hulk. For him, an experiment in Hulk has been wrying the impact of a dangerous side. And Luis Lipierrer, director Ed Norton queue, failed to add emotional volume to the banner-Hulk relationship. This story can be explained as follows: following banner and hulk bats, along the banner, Hulk is kick butt. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against 2003 was not true for comic books as the 2008 version. However, even though I'm a fan of comics, I'd like a movie on any day of any 2008 version of comics-comic, comic-loyal, enthusiastic and sophisticated version of the fans. <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should read more comics. Iron Man, released in 2008, is the best example of a true and heartwarming image for its comic-book roots.
