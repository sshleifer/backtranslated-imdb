There are more interesting Polish documentaries in worm farming, in Braille_ !! Competition (worm farming) has a good plot and more interesting characters. After seeing this film, I am physically ill. Cheating Husband (I dougray_scott_) is a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer really need to work, and with what is the accent !! Locations and random meetings remind me of a high school prank, and showed a 10 year hub in the cooking class. I think this is a sequel. Thank you for listening to the great weight of my consciousness.
