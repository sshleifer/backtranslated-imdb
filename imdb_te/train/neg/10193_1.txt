With this film, Bunuel changed his viewer's image to the film, but clearly stated in the film that his work was 'impartial'. Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes are portrayed by 'pure chance' of clear set-ups (that poor goat fell on the hill 'accidentally', you can see the fire smoke right on the screen!). For another, hiding her in a vital information: the Hurdes people are the way they are for a specific reason, which is just a hint in the picture. That is, the illness caused by absence (salt). This astrology took the bunu time for the cause of their creatinism and his research (he was, doubtfully), ended up telling the truth about the fact that he discovered the 'gait' if he checked 'critique' in medical theory. Instead, with his image, he is constantly talking about them, judging them, 'cretins' all over again, again, action dramatization, set-up scenes to create scenes, all this-all-powerful targeting for this very unacceptable for a documentary. Bunuel speaks at all times in the film, and he should not tell a movie he's portrayed. He speaks to them and, even then, will judge them. There is a fault of the roots of this pigeon, its ideology and the real shame that it is considered a great film.
