<br /> <br /> I love Jamie Fox. <br /> <br /> 99% of all the movies I watch. <br /> I walked out of this. I agree, every little thing ("Oh no, jamie knocking on the door!" HEE HEE! ") The lauded theater may have anything to do with two middle-aged white women, but it's just too painful. There was no camera shooting from the angle ... everything was your face, loud, and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad man It's just so old and tired.He brought nothing new or interesting.And from all the characters, so many lines you've seen coming up before you heard too much, and a very "tough guy" lines ... and I There is a bit of time, really, that kind of thing does not mind realism. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Fox, he's really good <br /> <br /> The film has less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotions, more feel and more Jamie Fox required. I gave a 2.
