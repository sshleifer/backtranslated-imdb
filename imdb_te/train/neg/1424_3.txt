The film plays an interesting and strong Shannon Lee role and introduces two simplicity characters through the first half. But then something happens and all the sudden Shannon faced this straight, second hand turns bad girl and loses the film's own case. The second half is not of any kind and is filled with clutches, bad acting, terrible story and worst stunt moves. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" is bad and clownified by Bruce, but Bruce Lee played again after his daughter had a bigger trouble than the double. <br /> If you're a real hard-core action fan, you will go ahead if you do not care about quality. See this movie. I personally look forward to it but I was terribly disappointed.
