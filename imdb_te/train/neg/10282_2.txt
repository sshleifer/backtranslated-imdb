I do not think this is a great film, but it does not feel terrible. I hate the mother's role to change the channel. I hoped it was only a part of the film, but I returned. And where would the daughter sat down, or almost full of job, or take a madman in her own home? Are you playing me? I respect my mother (and I'm also scared) but if I find that hurtful in my home I'll put her in a nearby hotel. <br /> I've followed a set of rules in my mother's house. <br /> I did not buy anything. I tried giving many opportunities, I really did. Sorry.
