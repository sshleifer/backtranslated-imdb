I saw this film in my international film class. <br /> <br /> The 4th person spoke of his alcoholic writer, Rev. alcoholic writer. He meets with a woman named Christine while speaking at the local book club, and decides to stay with her only when she learns how attractive she is. Reve liked Dutch sausage to keep it plain. Reeve creates a plan to disturb Christine's friend so he can eventually have sex with him. But she later learned that Christ had 3 previous husbands, and she was murdered. Now Rev and Christine's boyfriend can be "4th person". The storyline makes sense of what story. Editing and everything that's technical about this film is good. The picture was just gross and I felt I needed to vomit in some areas. Generally, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the tip of the bed in the t-shirt. So at the very beginning, when you walk in his narrow apartment in over-the-state, you will see Revive's lovely peeker around. He then was in a dream when his dreams were cut with a scissors, and they performed with the blood fountain. Rev loves a statue of Jesus and is homosexual in the tomb. Plus there is a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything against "shocking" scenes, but when it comes to surprise, the film is very stringent. <br /> <br /> If you have any cup of tea in this movie, watch this movie. If not, stay away from this distance. My mind is still scratched.
