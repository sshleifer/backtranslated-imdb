Why the film was promoted as a wild, quirky, laughing comedy. It is not too entertaining in this movie, or the director of the film is happy. Annetting Benning (whose acting was promoted as an Oscar) made her acting performances appear to be common. Brian Cox's character is confusing and boring, and plays the role of Augustine? Joseph Cross ?? Not just the personality to bring his character. Evan Rachel Wood is the best thing about this movie, but she is not enough to accept this boring, insane film. <br /> <br /> The film is quickly disappearing and looks good. Some of the worst scenes in some scenes (Brian Cox and Sun and the Whale ',' You and Me and Every We Know 'and' The Squid and the Whale ') are some of the awkward and unhappy. I found the whole experience wasted time. Do not you waste your time?
