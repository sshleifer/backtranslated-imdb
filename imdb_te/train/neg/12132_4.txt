The lower-life bounty trilogy, led by Matt Dillon, was stolen last night. They run away but quickly cross the paths with police who walk in the hot pursuit of a terrorist. In fact, the police are mistaken for the terrorists, the gang of thieves, the real terrorist, and the thieves carry the barrels and force them to capture a small dive, and the police do not know why they intended to catch them. <br /> Furthermore, who has been selected as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> Is unbelievable? Sure. And it goes down the hill from there. Spicy acting earned a good bit of performance; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunauve, Gary Snyes, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they all were wasted. Most probably because all the characters are stuck in the bar, they can argue for the rest of the image. Endless and without aiming. Long before the film was taken, you had to say what happened to them.
