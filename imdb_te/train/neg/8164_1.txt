I saw this film at a real cinema theater (probably $ 2.00 a) with my cousin and uncle. We around 11 and 12, I guess, into really scary movies. I remember excited to see it because my cool uncle did pick us the image (and we probably never had to do that again!) And sooo after depression !! Not just boring and scary. From Silver Spoons I can only catch the Carcass piece, and it's not great, it's not just someone I've found. I've seen bad movies before and this is harder to get out of my mind like the worst. This is what I can recall, very boring, non-scary, our collective $ 6 waste, and the film's waste. I've read some reviews that say it's a watch value and I say, "Everybody is everybody," but I'm not even bothered. That's not so bad.
