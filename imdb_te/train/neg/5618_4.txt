This Christian anti-fake documentary was surprised by the amounts of good ratings. Now, I respect the opinion of the person and the faith, I do not believe in Christian doctrine taught in this state. <br /> <br /> The image has valid points, but they are very small and represent a very partial case. I do not recommend watching it. In fact, I want everybody to see it, and they think they have decided on their beliefs. This is much more likely than the director gave to Christian teachings. More than a way to ask about this topic, it looks like a personal reward in the Christian school affected by his childhood. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes from the love of Christ without permission, and sets up an interview with his headmaster's face. Pre-school and almost all anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster a lot down to Earth and I think his attitude was fully justified. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that any one of the Christian believers interviewed later would have interviewed or interviewed before the interview. <br /> <br /> There are new and interesting subjects here on the question of Christianity and here are some original ideas. But the way that this whole thought is often dangerous is the most unethical and terribly biased.
