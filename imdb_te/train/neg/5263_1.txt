This is the hands down the worst picture I ever remember watching. Everything is unbelievable clich√© and retarded. Acting is terrible. Camera work is not bad but it still does not redeem it. The writer / director of the film suffers from Downs Syndrome, believing that the film will help her career. I want to get back an hour and half in my career, I wasted watching this rubbish. I'll rather watch a video of growing grass than this. I believe IMDb will make me write 10 lines to post this way, but I think this film is very bad, and I warned others about it. The reason I came about this movie is that my girlfriend has requested from the local library thinking that it was Chris Christopher's film, which ended with the title "disappear." I do not know who's it's mistake to finish my worst in my Daddy Player but I feel that I am indebted to me at least 20 dollars for my time, pain and suffering. In the end, this film director / writer I hope to recognize him on the street better.
