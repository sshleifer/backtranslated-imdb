Prom Night Shot by anyone providing artistic eye when filming a live-time original film. You know one thing. This October livelihood takes a break from a woman's adventurous story (where the name of the disease) to tell some creepy story of a woman who accompanies an incognito ex-boyfriend. Is it dramatic? What is it doing ?? It's very dull. It does nothing more for a genre, tell the original story or fight for any innovation. Prom Night shares this plight. The killer blows in his victims looked at the holes, sitting quietly when the soil was decomposed and we would not have sprinkled the blood. <br /> <br /> Our director is working with a very handsome killer, so he can break the camera angle. Imagine coming to you with a knife about Matthew McConaughey. Did you really want to go? "Oh, good lucklin guy is going to kill me? Do not panic for a second, so the director throws shadow on the shadows and the mirror in the mirror, repeating the mirror's illness, which is practically the fisherman of the creator.You get 15 jumps in the film, Date jumped (I might be afraid of her everything). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been cut off, and it seems that the key points in the room where the crew is cut to protect some comparison of the horror film Do not tell me I'm telling you that this movie will turn into a movie, you'll often get a jarring jump.This film ends up together with a movie catches and a projection expert, his fingers cross, and hope for the best thing you'd expect. <br /> If you have two sentences, a false spray of blood, an emo killer and the tension of a separate episode of "Silver Spoons", what reason do you have to support this weekend horror? At least on the big screen. In fact, this is a film to be punished. Is it really hard to make a scary image? Do you know that this band is doing a horror movie? !! My time and your complete waste. I'm bit the bullet to get this review. Do not let my sacrifice waste. Do not get involved in the movie !!!
