Both are observed by different individuals of college roommates: a fashionable and disciplined star basketball player and a pot-smoking, rabble-rouser separation of women and a conveniently broken character-study. We never learned why these young people are not friends. They share chaos about the world and their places, but they do not appear in any of the common ones. Jack Nicholson has produced his character, Jack Nicholson, co-written by screenwriter Jeremy Larner, based on the book Larner, who does not introduce us to any obvious characters, on screen. There are some very good performances (especially from the new William Tupper in the central character), but most of the unwittingly (perhaps deliberately), sketch or not sure. Bruce Dern is a hard-driving basketball coach, Karen Black is old, married to Lady Tupper, and Michael Margotapper's vicar friend (off-putting, over-the-top performance). Nicholson failed to set scenes with any special taste, choosing to interact with the character's interaction (as I suspect) to interact with the character; His script was helpful, and the result was unclear of whom we had to sympathize with. The whole third act of the film is a epileptic mess, while working in small, random moments (Supermarket fight between Terper and Black, Dern in his dormitory room, all courts set). Nicholson did not show any kind of craftsmanship for the development of the all-important B-Ball game with a sexual assault (in his performance of these events, he did not score points for Chadpapai because of his quadrilinea and ugly). When a director leaves his way to humiliate his actors, his intentions have to be questioned. Perhaps "Drive, Hit Said" finally makes a powerful statement of bargaining, the audience can forgive filmmaking for his failures in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is so dull. **** from * 1/2
