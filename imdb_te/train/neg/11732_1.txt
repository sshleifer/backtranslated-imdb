IMDb Guidelines stated that you have to announce if your comments contain 'spoilers'. <br /> This whole picture is a spoiler ... this is a warning story. It gives no warning and glorifies the story of a lost young man who does not know where it will go. <br /> <br /> I saw this at the Film Festival of the tribe. This film is not too bad, it's not too bad. <br /> Acting is not very different, the characters are very deep clich√©, and the performance of Farmersworth is particularly bad. <br /> Hopefully, the dialogue and scenarios from hopeful tones are from the 'graphic' elements from the non-nonsense plot ... which is bigger. <br /> <br /> I think he's looking for a more painful, updated 'drug shop cowboy' with 'naturally born-killers' touch but the former characters, slowly (out of a few frat level gore) <br /> <br /> "If you have a ham-hat on a valuable thing ...) b) edit this image, if it is reduced to a core, <br /> <br /> I was able to do something like zero kelvin.
