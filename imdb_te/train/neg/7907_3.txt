Exciting performance by Alix Elias makes a false directed and confusing file highlighting. I probably saw this film 12 times and I found little and less enjoyment with each run. Why are males too crazy? When was it explained? They are our wish, bourse 'reflection of the good of animals?' If they are, why not more clearly? Will this film hurt, will the connection be made clear? Motorcycle - another episode of this film bothers me to no end. The jacket worn on the front cover of a small monster represents 'street-wise' pilgrim. The sun mirrors say 'pretty cool'. With all this I'm ready for Ryder Muppets meets. I am All Mankind (1987). What will Stick to the Glamlin series, if you're a fan of intelligent, wise-breaking, reptile toys - you give a qualified treatment.
