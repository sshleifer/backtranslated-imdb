If anyone really wants to make a really bad movie, "The Last Kingdom Wizards" really sets a scales to measure the depth of the vicious depth. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-cheeky revolving main character ... The little skim in a garbage white "furry" costume, it looks like segments cut from pieces. Slowly and painfully refusing the viewer to refrain from disappointment, without affecting your work more positively. <br /> <br /> The second idea is to completely cross the film and find one for over an hour and a half.
