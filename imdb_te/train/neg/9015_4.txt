The first 45 minutes Dragon Fighter is completely acceptable and surprisingly vibrant. The characters are incredibly and interesting. The cloning lab is really high tech. After that, it collapsed. The letters begin to behave idiotically, and a new subplot is a combination reactor (and this supposedly "current day") is introduced from somewhere, it is only necessary to kill the dragon, which is only the plot justification - only 't. The end is very weak. <br /> <br /> All the characters except the Dean Cain have played the Russians. I feel this movie is a 5 rating because of some unnatural situations and good start, despite her huge voice (and she is, in one case, the special * Spanish language!), Which plays the role of "Bailey Kent" by Wessella Dimitrova It's worse, so I give only 4.
