I've rented this movie because some of the Grand Canyon scenes in "Romance" and "Western" disappear, but if you're looking for a typical porno Western Western, forget it. This film is pure muck! Romance is also between youthful youth, who can not even go into adulthood and middle aged man! The other child also mocked the other child. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda Brook Shields is portrayed as a mentor by trying to resist his appeal, and her character is more involved. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives up and they drive off a happy, loving couple. <br /> I do not see how this film can appeal to anyone except pedophiles.
