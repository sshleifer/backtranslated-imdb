My boyfriend and I have rented it because it was a good 'Halloween' to take off. A killer who is scared of young people, a white mask ... you'll get my motion. We're dead wrong! Number pun intended. We can not only find one of the worst films, but it's also a cult classic! It is filled with w / plots holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Madi is pretty, but it's about it. Give me credit for filming a very low budget - I always support such films. This is not unique. <br /> <br /> This film might be better if you are drinking or drinking too much; Otherwise no trouble. If you do not want to lose your movie rights as you did!
