The film received a 6/10 rating from me and a 9/10. Here's why: action and gore and scares are taken into consideration, as a standard horror film for the standard horror crowd, this film has bore you. This is basically a family drama, but in the horrific universe, as you would like to see on Life Time Channel. The story and formula are age-old, repeating hundreds of times. If you're looking for any realism in the plot structure or minimal contradiction, you will be disappointed. Deductions and you will have something dramatic just like a beautiful Mind, tripping on the cheese. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br> <br> It is literally something that jokes about when you and your friends are drunk halfway. . . But that joke was actually a theater release. The idea gets 9/10 from me. <br /> <br /> It is not perfect, because they are more likely to be taken, but they are not. <br /> <br /> The two combinations are mixed. I thought it was funny, but with all the jokes, it was not funny. I saw my mother and my younger sister with me and our jokes about it are not ridiculous. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> "A great picture to watch with a bunch of boys (or girls). It's a great movie to see someone. . . But if you look alone, it becomes a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Other people always make this kind of movie funnier and wealthy. <br /> <br />
