This is the lowest movie I have ever seen. I'm not kidding. By the time it arrives, I will constantly carry my head in a wall. <br /> <br /> I think it is a bad idea. <br /> They are both good comedies and both are very pesky. <br /> If they have to do it again, they decide not to do it, and those who have lost money have lost a ton. ) Are terrible.
