The worst thing I've ever seen so far; I'm ready to go out after ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater are in the middle. Do not make me wrong, I loved crazy, stupid movies like the next gas but hit the whole campus, writing and humor. It seems to me that they're going to feel a "Napoleon dynamite" - strange and random scenes lead to the cult audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know how to do this. /> <br /> Thanks for the Goesh I do not have to pay.
