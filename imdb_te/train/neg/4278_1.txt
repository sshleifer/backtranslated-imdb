<br /> <br /> The National Liquidators picked up the film for a buck, and after watching it, I feel like I emerged. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I have seen a horrible film. A. <br /> <br /> I would write a negative review of the film, not to mention such immense respect for Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> First, what is it? What is a musical biography? Yes, Foster's many voices are here and there are these fake-Broadway-Jerome kern-type numbers than the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone had to pay to write this payment? Secondly, Foster's original story is a lovely one. Why not come close to it? Thirdly, what did he do in Rich Ray Middleton to make this film? His pictures with little kids ?? Communists? <br /> <br /> So, Foster's friends, and the truth and good entertainment, be scared ... too, very afraid.
