For some reason the film is very disappointing. It's really good for the first half hour. While acting is not good, you do not seem to be half bad, in which you find it in a rap video. In fact, I felt almost as good as Perico Ripio (another recent Dominican film), which was much better than I expected. The plot for the film is not just to deceive the husbands, how they look at women in the Dominican community and in particular in the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, the makers of the movie do not think that the good picture depends on how you deal with your subject and they have killed their predecessor's calf. The protagonists of men and women for about 30 minutes in the film are reversed after the main characters put a spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. This change takes place by the edge, space age, which I consider the CGI effects of 70 years to be expected, but the entire plot is just going to the canal. The rest of the movie is cheesy speculative, and not only the ingenious liners. It all topped off (and I now expect you to alert ** SPOLERLER **) It all turns into a dream. Oh i see my coming? Oh man I forgot the most fraudulent thing about the film. Well I started thinking about an hour "? Hmmmm something was not just about the sound track but what would it have to be ??" ? And it's taken nine times a minute from Hitler's video game for me in the movie 95. <br /> Oh, when do you give us a picture we have a movie genre? Countries such as Thailand's Oni-bak, Akira are likened to a comedy or an action movie, a widespread criminal thriller for England as a Layer cake or a social-awakening journey in Waking Life. <br /> <br /> It would give a 1, but I'll come out of DR much worse, search for Los Jodedores and you'll know what I'm talking about.
