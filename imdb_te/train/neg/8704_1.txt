Usually I like dinosaur films but this is a pure rubbish. No script, no conversations, no action. And the brave Colonel Rons he is tough and he's similar to a stupid proctor from a couple's brother's academy in his mouth trying to show. So it's time completely waste (I saw this movie on TV). And I did not really understand 7 people this sh * t 10 graded. They should have joked. My advice is, if you see this title from it!
