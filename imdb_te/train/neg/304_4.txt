This film Ruth plays the role of a female, hard drink, gambling, overeating sports figure. The little bay ruby ​​early life is very interesting and for all these intentions and purposes are ignored in this film. Moreover, Gehrig was just covered and this is a well-known relationship, good or bad, but better than that. His life is more than all evil. He was an American hero, baseball slave and many later changed their lives. I'm good to remember a great baseball player who completely ignored the film. The film's producers are not his mistakes and his greatness.
