Before the show I liked the Adrianne curry. I felt great in the top model and was really happy she won. I also liked Kris Knight, he seems like a great guy. But this show made me just sick! I'm angry at what happened in the show. I do not care that they are different ages and I know that age is not between love. But adrenine, you're just seven months old. It does not surprise me at all that he did not propose. I want to force someone to marry you before I'm ready. If this is intended, then why do not each other love the other, and do it naturally? Turning a wedding ring to a ball and chassis is absolutely unnecessary, Chris is clear that you will love you or a ring. And Chris, you break up and be ashamed of you for proposing her anyway! You've been through two failed weddings, how can you rush into another one because she's a fit pit? I hope that the relationship will continue, but I feel the marriage immediately and for all the wrong reasons. Perhaps now they will find the right reasons to get married and marry from marriage.
