The film is considered a "playful" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and spiritual" wonders. But instead it comes to creepy creepy. There are two things in this film to stand in my mind like horror 1) Santa looks .- Have you ever seen more terrible looking Santa Claus? And 2) "Satan's Bad Representative" are just sickening just to watch the pitch's just plain odd dance. If this is MSTed version or if you'd like to smile good then watch this movie. I can not believe this is a child's cinema.
