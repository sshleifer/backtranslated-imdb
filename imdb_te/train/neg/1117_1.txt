I do not really know what this film is about. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is so dark, but it is dark except for a couple of seconds. For a long time, the shots disrupt all kinds of insects without any reason. Any small dialogue in the image is as unpleasant and reflex as images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight and then shoots on her head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cochen after a white naked woman emerges. I have never blown away by how bad and meaningless image is. Honestly, anyone would like to see it, and tell me what they think about it. But I do not want this level of hell for anyone.
