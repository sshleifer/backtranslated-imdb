Wow, a film about NYC politics is written by anyone who has stepped in to the NYC. In a moment you have trouble when you go to the credits and expect that the Move will last another half hour. Characters boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the boring and ridiculous middle story teeters. A terrible picture.
