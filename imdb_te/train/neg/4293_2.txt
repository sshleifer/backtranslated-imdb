"The Rainmaker", released in 1956, has the best actors of its time. Catherine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Burt Lancaster Principal athletes. They can save this entirely upon the playful drama. First of all, Hepburn is frightened as a cowardly spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, she has not even removed this position. She is very small, it is very simple, and this part is very old. Lancaster, and Erl Holman way over the intense reaction is very guaranteed and comes off as much as Jethro Clampett. Bridges and a little more upward than the reliable Wendell Core cast - but they can only do so. Catherine Hepburn seems to be in the 1950s when she wanted to make her wings a bit like an actress, that's fine. She made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (I'm in them) she did not do much of them. Despite an A-list cast and good product values, it does not work.
