Strange ... I like this movie crew and dark humor movies; But not all of this! It's awful, horrible and definitely not funny. Pitti can not make a whole picture plot, disgust. And it's really boring. Long empty moments fills the picture; It may have been removed. It must be in another minor format. Maybe I expect a lot more from staff - like lol the image -. It is also filled with overused clich√©s of characters and situations ... I can not get why people liked it ... "Poems", "hope"; No, 'mam, nothing like that! ^ All of all, it's empty and raw, pitiful and helpless. Oh this shank ........
