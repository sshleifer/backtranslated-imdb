This film is terrible. John Ritter pretends doing Prat, 75% of the actors distributing their lines so that they can read them from the terrible sound queue cards, poor editing, mixing (the conversations are tight to pick up over the background noise), and a plot really goes somewhere. I did not think I could ever say this, but Dorothy Strachan was not the worst actress in the film. There are at least 3 more sucks. Cotton Hansen offers her lines with Ben Stain's passion. I was surprised if she died inside her. Even Bogdanovich's children are awful (the oldest one is sure to read her lines from a cue card). The film is seriously terrible. Bogdanovich has reason to not get another project until 4 years later. Please do not look. If you find your television lists, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it, review your friendship. If you want to see your spouse, you're better off finding another spirit. I'd rather goggle my eyes with pastry arrows than sit by this piece of garbage again. If I could not compile this image up in a word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
