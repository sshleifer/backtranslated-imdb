Any film that starts with a cowhand that cuts a female soup is not much promising. It's like Kibbutz's 50 yrs ago, well I'm there and it's just not. Every Kibbtz is exactly a part of the picture shown (like the young man looking at the kitchen at night) but you can not show the whole kibbtz - we say - naughty traits. Each kibbate has its own problems, but no kibbtz does not have everything in them. The views of Israel are great. I call my youth in the Eden Gardens still called the Emak (Valley). Yes, and acting is very good, so you do not have to be black - a wrong character - perhaps with much advantage.
