Recently I saw this movie with my sister who likes Sofia Loren's performances. I call them a cultural barbarian. I hate the art of any kind of shape or form. Rambo is my kind of film, action, murders, blood, horror. If you find yourself in this case, avoid this film like plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing kind. Give me some sentences. It starts with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. In a housing block, every Italian attends a procession in honor of Hitler, except a housewife, an anti-fascist and a guardian. Her husband meets the housewife and anti-fascist. He falls in love with him, wants to love him, but anti-fascist gay. Still, they love each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from his homosexual and the man is expelled by agents. End. Do you also need a small resume? Boring ... is small enough? Guy should use his gun at the start of this film and shoot himself in order to protect the viewers from this vicious circle. On one hand my sister liked this movie. As I mentioned, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
