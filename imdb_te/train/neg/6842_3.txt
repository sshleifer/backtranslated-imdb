"Paula, I may be bitch, but I'll always be batch!" <br /> <br /> Stacey Walker is a delightful line in a different tiresome skin that has pretty honey. The gas has a real pain that brought her boyfriends, co-workers and co-workers and her lounge roommate Paula into her bedroom, but turns out to be a "whack" job that calls for police "misuse"! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certificate c ** t will probably be interesting for a while, but this story eventually becomes a real recurring-note affair. At least wait for that end, still for those who care for that time.
