This juvenile, blonde movie is perfect for young men in the old men's bodies, and is disappointed to be satisfied with their hormonal challenges. How? <br /> <br /> Mister Rogers is the neighborhood (if it runs my oil compound) and Logan Run (if heavier) <br /> <br /> The film, starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, is built into the world of post-air-crisis , Which does not want all the powerful government you drive your car (* ahem *) and burn the gas. Today Enron-Bush, oil-grabbing, SUV-pushing is against the government. <br /> <br /> This film is just ludicrous. But wait ... there's more. While the film is set in the future, we do not show any signs of future technology without back to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You believe that the future will look ... you like it today. These same garments, the same suburban houses, the same green grasses and the film. There are no exceptions to any solar panels, airbags and alternative energy. <br /> Acting is flat and tasteless. Awkward or moving, buddy-flick, respect, romance, horror ... everything is shining under a briefcase than a paper doll. <br /> <br /> The lack of continuity - the character of Burgess Meredith from the moment to the moment from the moment to the moment, the filmmakers insulted our intelligence with the stock footage again and again. <br /> <br /> The plot is thrilled like a Dukes of Hazzard episode. <br /> <br /> Dash hard car-film and SF fans must avoid these images as a monthly roadcycle, unless you are interested in Exxon executives trying to paint as the hero's gas tank.
