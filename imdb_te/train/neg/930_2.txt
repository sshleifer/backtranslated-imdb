Some children are hiking in the mountains, one of them going into a large tunnel and finding some gladiators. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spent the rest of the movie killing other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> 1) A man and a girl are in their tent and they feel that they will hear something outside. He investigates and finds another hiker outside the person. Then his friend bowed out loudly, so they went back to the tent - came the next morning? <br /> <br /> 2) These two helpless people have heard of another girl (100 feet away), but do not investigate that they are afraid of getting worried. <br /> <br /> What do I mean? <br /> <br /> 4) Attacking the injured girl Demonios, she stopped her and, as she had told, taught her how she was injured without killing him in his gladiator training. Um, yes, we can not hurt her and die, because she has been raised and running around. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is involved in the Demonicus Cave, and when someone tries to release her, she will help this guy and help her get help. Um, look, idiot, if she is set to you freely, it takes about 5 seconds, no need to get help. <br /> It just continues. The central part of the film is lost in two idiots forests, and then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore their friends' shoutings, then they are going around a bit. It's just damn boring and pointless that I turned off the DVD by half. <br /> <br /> These characters are sympathetic, especially on the screen. Demonicus himself every time I saw him loudly - he looks like a young child in a Halloween costume and shakes his face up to see evil. He runs, or he should say scampers around like gay people. <br /> <br /> Overall, if this feeling is a bit of pleasure and effort, it is very ridiculous if it can produce an enjoyable campie film, removing the ridiculous conversation, creating characters with genuine people, logical flow to action, and Demonicus a sexy gladiator A woman in the outfit is also creating a role. But, instead of we pile rape to this knowledge of death nonsense that you bear.
