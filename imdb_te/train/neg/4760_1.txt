The remake of Anthony Shaffer's classic drama did not take long in the cinemas. Recently suffered it by cable, I would like to congratulate for not just wasting a ticket money. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine has improved his reputation as the second leading role in the fantastic 1972 film. Lawrence Olivier is now seen with the intention of destroying it by playing a major role in that version. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but Marthan Brando was damaged as Devil.) Puffy and washed out, Kain had less depth than he was like Batman's butler. He has already cut himself into a guest role in GET Carter's deadly remake. What's next - ALFIE II, or the son of man? <br /> <br /> After that, no one can benefit from this frivolous simulation, often the accusation and the extra sexual aspect that it may not be able to compare with Shaafer's witty characters. Braunag's direction depends on a soulless intimate set design that does not hold in blue light and render rate nightclub. Shadows, or tight and intrusive closeness to help him overcome his stupid screen. <br /> <br /> It is good to consider the original stage production (with Anthony Quaye and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Cain. 1972 Screenplay, Hitchcock's Frenzy, and many Agatha Christie introductions Last Shah Shafer, in his grave, wanted to make a real assassination or two!
