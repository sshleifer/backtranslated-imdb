If you believe this, * another * teenage tension * another * locked cabin * three years after * dangerous 'accidents'. Less and behold, a psychotic hockey mask wearing them one by one (a cheap papery one at that) wastes them one by one. The mechanical 'Friday' debuted on the '13th' first digital stroke, but interesting facts end and all of the things that are still there are sub-partned performances and recurring boom-mike infiltrators. One last second turn makes little to lift the souls, and 'Memorial Day' is something that is best thrown out in a lake and forgotten. Frenzy slasher collectors only.
