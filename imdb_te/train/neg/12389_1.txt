The model Chris McCormack (Margax Hemingway) raped her (Kris Sarandon) teacher of her sister Kathy (Mari El Hemingway). He is brought to trial but is totally free. <br /> <br /> For the comedy is rape! <br /> The objectionable and sick rape film. The film was promoted as an important drama about rape. Written badly (for the most part) is a bad play. The sympathy of the victim was sympathetic but shaking the scene in our face. To be completely honest, Hemingway's performance is bad in that order, and it may have lost any real effect. The trial scenes are boring and predictable. And when the 15-year-old was raped, the film went too far (fortunately no). Margotics captures a gun and I will admit that even if Sarandon dies it leads to a great end. But seriously - a young woman who is raped is just rebellious. <br /> Do not act on acting. For instance, Margas is not an actress. She is definitely a beautiful lady (and I believe it is an actual model) but she left too much to be acting on. It will reduce the film. Mariel is right, but she is one of the first films. Sarandon makes him intrusive. He's not bad but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say but do not worry about this One has found the simplest and really ill.
