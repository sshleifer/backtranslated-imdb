I'm not usually the slate of the film. I try to see good points and focus on evil, but in this case, there are not nearly enough points. In my opinion, if you want to do something bad, why bother? Some of the film is filled with images of Anne's face, she deeply breathe, and violin music is played in the background. The other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. Rupert is not the expression of Perry Jones. Jennifer Hayley plays Anne's younger sister with modern habits. Anne is portrayed positively and self-influenced, which is fine at the start, but she is by the film, and you see that Captain Ventworth has no reason to fall in love with him. There's no overall production, a lot of mistakes are being ignored, running from concert, kissing on the street, running on the streets with no caps (why the scene in the film is one of the most romantic scenes in the book), a terrible movie, very frustrating.
