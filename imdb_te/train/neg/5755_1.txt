I saw this movie in its New York's High Falls Film Festival screening and I said it's not full and terrible. Though it's funny in some places, real plot to talk about real laughs and some places acting is pretty awfully and woody, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the voice of the story (I have never listened to). J.C.Mac I thought this film was a real action and grit and only (from the cast) was a recovery feature of real acting. I'm sure with another cast and direct rule, it's a half good film. If you think it's not a normal release, or if you really want, look at the bargain bin in Lidl.
