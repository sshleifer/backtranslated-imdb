Seriously, American and French actors are pretending to speak perfect English with a fake Russian voice to pretend chess? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a man, so I am grateful to the nudity - but the soft romantic movie has a large part of it and at least it works as artistic. Did the director hear about subtlety? This acting is also timber and dramatic, and comic relief is not always funny. <br /> <br /> I have read many short stories of Kuntara (The Beijing of Light of Being), but when they cut the actors into the footage of the performances in Prague, And there are good things about his writing style (although his themes are a big male fantasy) and I say, nothing is the goodness of this film Kudras style.
