I thought it was a New York movie: wrong! <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! This is a play .... well, until the third, because the story is completely "abracadabrantesque", symbolic for the French presidential mandate. <br /> <br /> That means it's a sense of honesty with the intention of close to nonsense. <br /> What do I do? Perhaps, a good duo of the actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the reded policewoman is a bit invisible to me. The longest doctors surprised by her punch, and McDowell offers fine acting as usual, all of a delicate, smooth and almost muted attitude. I like this sensitivity because other fine artists or directors will repeat the same pattern and over. In her case, it is a movie, it is the same character that spends her feelings, her values, and infinite different stories. <br /> <br /> Another positive attitude to the film, feminine touch, interesting views. Every woman has a lifestyle of everyone, even though it is one. <br /> Lastly, the image is very desirable, but it reduces great final cravings. Next focus.
