At least it is not filled with ambiguous violence or soft fur. It's not too full of thought or a soft storyline. The story has a few possibilities but the director has lost a green space. The story is confusing and going bizarre <br /> <br /> Commands, until the end. I do not even believe that the director spent most time around the Gulf Country Club. Some descriptions are absurd. Not very attractive.
