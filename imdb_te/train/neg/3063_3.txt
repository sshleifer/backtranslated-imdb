It usually means pictures of glorifying a leader. For example, Bonnie and Clyde distinguished dynamic bank hackers and you are really sympathetic to them, even though they have done bad things. Why? <br /> <br /> This film is not satisfied with the film. Viggo Mortenson's character will soon become a folk hero. Why? He increases the speed along an Idaho roadway to the hospital where his wife's wife is taking. Nobody is hard to understand why everyone is trying to flee. Worse, when he learns that he is not a red-necked terrorist, they seek to save the ends behind them, and the government wants to help him. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley is a radio emisi based on the story in support of our protagonist. <br /> The end is totally unreliable.
