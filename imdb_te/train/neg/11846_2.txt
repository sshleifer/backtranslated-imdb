After watching this movie, I complained about the sound-track quality of my local movie or the movie sound system could be wrong. Anyone for at least the first half of the film is very difficult to understand what someone is because of music and sound-track scratchiness of the background 20. <br /> <br /> I'm ready to complain about the movie complaint, but it is not. Director. <br /> <br /> My complaint is an important role in the film's production of the subject. Music and sound are supposed to distort to create a disturbing effect inside the image. These days, directors will go many lengths to make their image unique. <br /> <br /> The historical leaks of this film (which you can learn for yourself) sound-track distortion is a good reason to miss this movie. You can only hear the twisted twilight of the sound-track and the cat is not exactly meow.
