And the only reason I have this DVD is. Now I did not see the first Nemesis image, but I checked the information from it and I said here: what? Why? Because Alex is the first film. But again the first one is set in the future, so maybe this Alex brand was new and the scientist had to do this time with Alex. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of the plot: Alex, by then a baby (or anytime, in the future) escapes with her mother using a special time vessel and ends in the 80's Africa. Mummy is killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows in an African tribe. Cyborg will be slaughtered from the tribe's future, and Alex then runs and hides, and eventually kills her cyborg. So there. <br /> <br /> The Terminator is not only shot here, the Predator receives its fair share and is one of the first flight film Vincent Price <br /> <br /> Nomination for giving a solid foundation to build on your cyborgs head. Okay, this movie is a very authentic small budget movie, but it has bad effects for the film between the 90s. It's okay for 80s movie ever. The big problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is just interested. Nemesis 2 is not the crappiest piece of cinema I have with pleasure but it will come close to turn <br /> <br /> I can not say one thing about acting because here should be honest: Does anyone expect Oscar's worthy exhibits here? Oh well ... at least I found the Suu Puyes on the way to the innocent warriors. <br /> <br /> "Real" Movie Rating: 2/10. <br /> <br /> A occasional laugh at me from the film's pure evil, so it's the smallest of the best.
