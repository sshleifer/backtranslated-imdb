Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley film I've seen is "42nd Street." Then I feel all of his stuff. <br /> Oh, the ultimate musical figures are always beautiful, but this story is very much for others and very tiresome. They always shout and have happy performance producers. <br /> <br /> In this film, Cognny is not only a little bit later and he has a headache and wearing his character is narrower <br /> <br /> Here also songs "42rd Street" class, And for years it could not be hum - for decades, I must say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early cognizable movies - and Berkeley movies - I was totally disappointed and looking very disappointed when looking.
