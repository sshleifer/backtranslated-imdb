I read the DVD case behind and I guess it will not be lost, if it is worse, any damage, if it is good, I bought this image cheaply. <br /> <br /> Then I saw ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken's, but in the picture we have a small screen presence, <br /> <br /> Start the "action" in the plot  రార 0 భ 0 లో తన మిత్రుడు మరణి 0 చడ 0 ఆయనకు చాలా తక్కువ ప్రభావ 0 చూపిస్తు 0 ది, ఆయన చిట్టచివరి ప్రతీకార 0 కేవలం బోరింగ్ మరియు అసాధారణమైనది. <br /> <br /> Grand revolution and vengeance allow you to capture the audience and feel something for the characters, but watching this movie is a lot of confusion and more coincidental events. <br /> <br /> At this time I am in tears. <br /> <br /> When I saw this film I thought it was the most horrific piece of the day, because the pilot wants to kill any civilians By refusing to sacrifice himself by jumping ludu laden truck on the scene that is tragic, it is not too bad, it's not horrible and painful, emergency surgery on the injured girl. The performance is poor, the script and the story is weak, "action" is also weak and "visuals" are not all visually appealing. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
