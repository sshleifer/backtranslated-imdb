I look forward to this film as a fan of Notoras B.I.G. It's unfortunate to see a horrible movie. Jamal Woodward Notorious B.I.G. This story is a very real son of Notorus B.I.Ge, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. As a child. Unfortunately, he did not adequately convince his father to pay attention. Derek Luke Schen "Puffy" is just as astounding as Combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. This big problem is that these are actual people who are acting. It's boring, and notary B.I.G. No information about this. Fans and non-fans are already unaware. I was disappointed with Angela Bassett, a good actress who wasted like Volatte Wallace. Film Slugs and Slugs Notorious B.I.G. Fans spend tons of it. It is unfortunate to say that it happened. It's not so close to good film. I had a lot of hope, but unfortunately I did not want anything from this. I definitely want to skip this.
