Question: How does a bourgeois director deal with a topic like immigration? Answer: By changing it to a survival alienation parable. <br /> <br /> Yes, at the beginning of the 90s, we were more than a portrait of a parasitic middle class journalist, an existentially high-profile politician, and a great widower who lived in the European Union after flooding and immigrant immigrants. How to solve the matter <br /> <br /> The immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. I have shown some social perceptions of Angepopolas when I am hopefully dealing with problematic upper classes. I honestly understand that the top commander's officer is responsible for his duty to push you to the scene that he sends his daughter to study in London. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Angelopoulos is the master of cinema art after all, right? Wrong. At this stage his habits are quite artificial and begin to look like a filtered filmed in FordShop. His usual tricks appear: unclear windows, vague lights, unreal marriage, walk through the river shore and people with yellow water quotes. Even Mastroianni breaks down the new ground for a very sleeping performance. Avoid really. Go for his early pictures.
