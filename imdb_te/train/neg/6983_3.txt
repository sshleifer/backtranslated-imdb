If you're a history teacher, news writer, al Pacino fan, I can not tell you that this film is not a legitimate '10', the revolution is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> The key to Tom Dobb (al) is the key to taking the boat and earning money from the note gained for the radical patriots. Everything revolves around that note. Tom's son enjoys an army with this army, so Tom also arrives in the army, who go on an expedition to get out of the army, and over the years after the war ended, and eventually the note for their boat. End. <br /> There are some war scenes, and they are the best. The transitions between the scenes are "five months later" and are some of the greatest characters in the historical war. The love story is a joke, and the whole movie is just hard to follow. So save your "Notes" and see the Patriot instead.
