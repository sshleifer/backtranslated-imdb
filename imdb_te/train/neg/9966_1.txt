Although I do not like the sort of person I'm refusing to have someone else's personal taste; If you want something, that's fine. But this film is horrific and there is no way around it. I do not like Aunty Derranco, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter, I do not agree. But I can not agree with any sort of ransom attributes to the film. Many people believe that the high school is a definite description of the problems faced by students. Perhaps, but everything is shot too far. Comedy esque type - "Naked Gun" seems to have an effort, but the timing is off; There is a lot of space between each of the actors, if they hold for the laughter (there is nothing there). Whoever wrote the script is around the place. They tried to cram up with a lot of controversial elements in one of the films, none of which was fully developed (specifically the girl was inspired by the teacher). I did not laugh at all this whole movie. I can not do anything with this effort to ridicule and ridicule but I am rehearsing my eyes on the screen.
