What am I seeing My precious life was spent 90 minutes. A serial killer clown concept is actually very scary, there are many who are scared of clowns ... but it's a 300-pound nursery train reader killer clown makes a mockery of the genre. I'm still wondering how the character can not escape from Clark's clown ... he's gotta get 300 pounds, he's finally tired. The whole end to get me up and say literally loudly "what do I see?" Clearly was Brandon Deniz's cousin .... and got it in the middle of what he meant having sex with his cousin ..... Yeah it is that people want to look * shudders *. <br /> Another thing I found ironically stupid is the opening scene where the clown meets a woman and she says "what did you do?" Well Betsch, what do you think he did? The last thing that is stupidly funny is the main character hitch-hiker slapping and calling her AC * NT and then the second is after the next 5 minutes that violence does not help anything .... Does the script author give the line to the wrong person? <br /> <br /> The film is a low budget porno. I took the amount I bought (all 3.99) and there was no entertainment along with sex scenes. I'm surprised that the fat clown is not in the dance, it's just enough. I hoped the film like other B movies might have some fun value, but I was wrong. <br /> It's not worth seeing. <br /> 10 out of 1
