The movie's comedy scene is probably when our fans come to their medals and plaques and whatnot. So the basic idea, the police outnumbers these gangsters by a million one, but the villains guns are just a bit bigger because they're powerless. I guess police ammo just bounces slightly. They fake interviews and decided to shoot this movie in all and documentary style and seriously, what are these guys wrong? They're talking like rolled-up newspapers are armed. If I admit, the fire is in danger even when the situation is too high for your benefit, but the nuts may not come. And why does hell take 44 minutes to fix everything in it anyway? I tell you a long time when you are surrounded and you are allowed to shoot. They're ten feet away, they are absolutely nothing. Then they buy big guns to increase their heroism. And then yes, there you have one, one of the cops actually hits anyone. The bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something. I guess I had a good laugh.
