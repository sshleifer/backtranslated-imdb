The movie is in circular shape and the viewer does not know where they are. I thought at first .. mummy, it's a cool movie, it just pulls, and in the end you do not know what's going to happen. The main lady is a good actress and her character played well, and the psychological outrageous, creepy, but after a bit you really do not care what to do, because this movie just drags. <br /> <br /> The mainstream ladies and psychologists have a good career in front of them, but they will remember this movie, known, or for the worrying film they've ever made.
