This is definitely a stupid, bad flavor picture. Eddie Murphy is the star of what is written as a sitcom. He is with his perfect family full of good family values. If you are looking for politically correct entertainment, this movie is for you. If you hate the idea that you do not laugh at the popcorn addictions full movie theater, you will run away.
