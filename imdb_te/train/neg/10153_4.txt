SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> That's not really a very good movie ... but I have the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers came to work when they were considering a small budget. The film was an "episode" of the live Japanese reality show, which closed many competitors from "danger zone" and included three dressed creeps sent to kill them. Survivors, if, wins fame and wealth ... Everyone is just dead winds. The main drawback for the film is that acting is very bad. None of the "real" people is true. The actors who are playing killers are fun ... they have been featured in the modern horror film genres - cheesy and over-the-top satirical ... and this is a matter of realistic performance. The movie takes all one takes pretend ... Competitors around the "danger zone" and everything is a camera that looks from his camera's eye ... But the lights turn on and off flick constantly (I hide from one to another "cuts", I would imagine).
