I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing I can say is that I have received a film accolade at college and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> I thought acting was anticipation, but Arnold was an outstanding actor, but I liked Arnold Vosoo, and he made a movie viewer. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene as cruel and unnecessary, but ultimately the actors who acted far away were pretty good. But the sound effects of shootout are very bad. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
