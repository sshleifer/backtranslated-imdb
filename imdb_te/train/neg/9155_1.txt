I have seen this movie so far. It is like a "homework assignment" for the film class. When it comes to "message" it loses the mark completely, trying to relay it. The letters are for hyperbole, poor acting and plot ... well this is totally ridiculous. The cover shot has made it think that it might be a good movie, co-star is beautiful and about it. The morality of the film: Never covered by Jude film! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home images and you'll be better than I am. It's painful to see and very apparently I was surprised to spend a lot of money on making and delivering anyone!
