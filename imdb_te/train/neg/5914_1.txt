This film is really boring. This is banned in the Chinese movie and I can see why. This is not to criticize the Communist rule, because the film is not of low quality. Never pay money to see this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I come out of China as I am disappointed with such a poor movie. It is completely ignored by the audience and the director seems to have made this movie. The shots of a man standing up for a minute did not seem to be happy and plenty of them. Cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad. I saw this film on the net and really liked this movie. There is only a clarification, some film fans are automatically better if a film is not in English. There is no reason why people like it. It is not an art form of celluloid's waste. (If they were actually shot in the movie they were not)
