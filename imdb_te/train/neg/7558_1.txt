You will not waste your time on this point anytime. Image. Remake without rebuilding. Everyone from the theater made the same comments. The worst picture I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage has biking into the hills, swimming in the narrow water and hitting the hills, but his suit is still entirely pressed, and the final scenario. <br /> <br /> Even though Ellen Bernstein and Cage have a good cast, the film does not believe that the film is good. It's amazing how good actors make such bad movies. They can not get a copy of the script first. If you are all interested in the movie that is still waiting for you to get out of DVD.
