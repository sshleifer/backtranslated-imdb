CQ is the worst film I have seen this year. At almost every film I've chosen to see in the theater is at least entertaining or anything to say. The film is directed by a film student for her intro. To the Film Making Class. His father makes great pictures. His sister is good. But brother is Roman? NO! A critic has the courage to compare to Gadard's Le Merath (Contempt). Coppola, Jr., was filmed about this film, and he tried hard to show himself as European, fictional and witty, when it was really just kitsch. The main actor has the same expression through the whole film, in awe or shock of the film he has made around him. Schwartzman removes his role as some attractive director. Depardieu is alright. In a scene where no true movie is spoof comedy, B-movie sequences are not, surprisingly, in Italy; Picking up a montage of shots of several characters inside a small car, driving around and dropping random people. It's the only thing that reminds me of the movie I'm guessing he's trying to play. Or rip-off. Or both. The documentary ended with the main characters talking on the camera and depicting various objects, the ending "twist" or tagged for artistic value ... The ridiculous thing about this film is, and not as intended. The film was resurrected after re-editing or re-editing or back-festive screening, which was interesting to me how bad it was before. I can not believe it's worse than that. If you want to look at the Austin Powers movie inspection, Any of them. The third film is more entertaining and more genius than the whole of this movie. Lil 'Romi for the movie, go back to direct the music videos of your cousin. Leave the God Fathers Daddy.
