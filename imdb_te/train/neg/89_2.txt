I saw four films in this series. Everyone has more and more steps from the books. It's still the worst one. My problem is that it does not in any way follow the book with the name afterwards! Directors and producers are named "Loves About Joy". These characters are only the names of some of the characters (Willy, Missy, Henry, Clark, Scott and Cookie) about the film in the remote mode. Child names / age / gender are wrong. "<br /> <br />" The music is very loud. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good family image, it's clean, if you're looking for a compelling version of the book, do not look at it.I hope I'll be the last film from this series, but I doubt. + If there are more movies, then I'm Michael Landon, Jr and Others want to stay close to the original storyline and story Nukuntanu. Books are splendid, if close, will make a wonderful film!
