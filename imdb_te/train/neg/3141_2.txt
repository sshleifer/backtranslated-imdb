I have testimonies that have confirmed my suspicions. A group of children was placed on the DVD of "Titanic" in the fantastic state of the 14 to 22 art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them have seen before. But they saw the moment of Katie, Leo and Celine Dion, many of whom felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the start of the epic, they began to break, some of them did not ask others - in an hour and a half in the film "Call for Us in the Show of Ice", there are still two girls who have seen the movie. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. After a stampede, they returned to see all the titanic sinking. They open about the subject, emissions os and much out. So, when I first saw the film burst into the scene. What is this Waiting to wait for one and a half hours slowly, what will wait for the rest of it. Dr. Jiwagho, for example, has a running time, but think about what happens in the film itself. How Kate teaches Leo in "Titanic". See the faces and hands of the devil, creme de la cream in the first class dining room of the ship. If you find them, see the historical details. The storyline is very narrow, they have to put guns and guns on the sinking ship. Here are the real drowning image standards. All efforts focus on special effects and the opening week. The film became the highest grossing film of all time, so what do I know?
