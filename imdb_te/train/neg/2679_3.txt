(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "action" (and I use the loose word) I've been trying to watch for a year. In the end, I finally got it, and now I have not participated in repeated attempts. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life, a person with a potentially long blade out of his arm will return to his mother. Turn things ugly after he hit by an old girl friend mafia boyfriend. When he brings the girl home he will take revenge on the person. <br /> <br /> Mafia mother takes revenge for her men to take revenge. <br /> Much less is said. No explanation is really given anything (why they lock the ID girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part is the all-off screen. The film is essentially a person who appears Adrian Brody, and killing and killing people (many actions on screen). It's great, well played and there are some reasons for what's going on, it's a good film. Hell, I would have liked some sense of the real character development or back story (we know that the person who knows all that is a kid is selected on). The film is running two hours better and it looks like six. If they were not going to tell us anything they could not take pace so that at least it seemed like it was moving faster. Instead we can not get the leader in a boat. Hero on the bus, the hero walking, the hero is disturbed.Hero with her girl. <br /> <br /> "It's about four o'clock (my attempts to see it) I'll never get back. The action is only for those who want to watch a Russian action movie
