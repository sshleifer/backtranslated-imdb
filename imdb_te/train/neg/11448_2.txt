The film is not as bad as 'Perfect Stranger' but it is not funny. It is not a kind of comedy - it moved from SNL to Adam Sandler-Esquire, romantic, small guy scores, slapstick, and jerk to 'lasser' films. While some pretty funny slapstick moments (descending to the hill), no one is particularly funny or the best in any way. 'Schindler's List' is ridiculous (and lesser concept). You never know if Andy Samberg was in high school, a college dropout or a loser at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, who played a role in her worst characters. And poor Ian McShane, serious actor If I just got a name, the camera is given the worst to read. Including the story Drugs and fully assessing and ending (spider's here as Adam Samberg's mom in the case). Do not spend money on watching this movie, and perhaps Larn Michaels get a hint and begin producing quality (yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy Quality) movies.
