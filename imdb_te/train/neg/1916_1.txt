This film is completely worse. Some Impeccable intellectuals who can comfort itself as the best of the clergy of the working class. There is no part of self-despairing Catharsis. <br /> If this type of image is set in the US, it's definitely a big joke. And because it comes out from the other side, it also makes a masterpiece, some brain washed and / or brainy washing Excellent for Westerns (some George W. probably does :). <br /> <br /> As expressed in the film - Soviet intellectuals are thinking of those years, perhaps because they deserve all the wrongs they claim to have gone through. But not! 'Most people have seen the real artworks that I've read and have done by the real fairy-tale Soviet intellectuals. For example, the "white bim black ear" is also associated with a dog - both Gavil Triepolesky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's film - a true masterpiece. True life, true tragedy, true regret, true pride and respect, is one of the true best of the Soviet period.
