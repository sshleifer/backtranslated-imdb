Now, I've seen very bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I saw all the movies of Jean-Claude Van Dumm√©, who was his own clone, including two of his twins, and where he was cyborg. I own one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in the truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he's got a big donkey and you can almost always see the DVD, you can also break and zoom!) So when you say that the movie is very bad, Plan 9 looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about snake eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. Battles are bad. Battles are bad. FX is bad. Acting is awesome, earth-time-bad bad, most probably the so-called worst performance of each of the cast in the cast including Lorenzo Lamas, and something really speaking. And I was lunchy ready to bet everyone involved with this film, ready to boot. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> It's unacceptably funny, so it's not total loss. However, if you look at this movie, you have a birth idiot or a lot of rocks. <br /> <br /> It was necessary to attract me attention from the cat's urine out of my laundry because it was able to sit through me. <br /> It did not help much, but it's better than nothing.
