I've seen some worst movies in my life, but this should be among the worst. <br /> <br /> We are two couples, Dads (Billy Bob Thornton as Earl and Natasha Richardson as Dollne) and Kirkondals (Roy and Charlize Therone Patrick Swisez) <br /> <br /> Loney is not happy with her sexual life , Candy cheats on his wife,. <br /> <br /> Roy, meanwhile, is checked by the doctor if his sperm is not right. <br /> Now, I read the back of the DVD, but not my girlfriend, and she was blurred about 20 minutes later: 'Oh, she's pregnant, but her husband can not have any baby'. Spot on, this movie is very imaginable. Boring as well. And annoying. Meaningless. Dangerous. <br /> <br /> This is an example of how this film is. Two couples walked to their large car in Nevada, when they stopped 2 police officers, they could not stop. The boys know each other and finally bribe two officers in a case of beer. This scene for the movie does not mean and is not important (or even relevant), it takes about 5 minutes! <br /> You can talk and talk and talk to you anytime nowhere. <br /> I'm thinking about the ending. Apparently, Roy did not have problems there, so he was the father of the child. How many times it happens in movies ... Try something new! The deceased wife finally apologizes for having a relationship with her husband and relative, and they are already happily living. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film's best scene, some shots of Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> The majority of the cast (Thornton is really trying) can expect more, but you can not really blame them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
