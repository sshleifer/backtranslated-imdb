This is a German film from 1974, which is a few of the women who came to a castle and it's beyond, I can not tell their intention or the purpose of the film. I can tell you that there are many women on the moon in this special castle, they paint the body and put the body to the Bongos as in the Gothic kit-cat club, but it's a good part. The run time of this film. Yes, there seems to be some devil worship and vampires, and there is some girl on girl stuff, etc., but the main focus is painted kids gyrating away in the basement. I like the rolling of one of the main housewives / devil worshipers to the eye, gave me the authenticity of the inquiries and made her look more bad. That Venda Evil Lesbian (on the bill on credits)? No matter. If you're not too picky about your lesbian devil's movies, you might like it, otherwise it's pretty frustrating, and I'm not able to finish it, I'm frustrated. 3 in 10.
