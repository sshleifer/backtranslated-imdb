This film is amazing. I saw the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said alright, but I think it RULEZZZ! That is, it's great. Ted V Mykels is very brave and clever. Unlike those terrible Hollywood films, he shot a matrix and a STOP or my Mom shoot entirely. Although it's fine. I like ninjas and pirates. I'm also funny funny tannin wearing funny man. He said that Domino Pizza is the coolest guy from claymation person. This film is really cool, and outside of my dad's attention outside movies when my father comes out of it. Butt tells dozens of complex characters that seem to be completely unrelated, but they are at the end. This is the genius of how the web is woven to make everything meet everything. I'll continue with Ted V. Michaels. But more aliens need. And a pirate.
