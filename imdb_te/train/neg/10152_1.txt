Cheery Horror is a fan of movies, which I saw in my video store, and I try it once. Now what I have learned I want on a soul that can not live on the planet. I'm getting my movie rentals for free, and I feel that my money has not gone down. I've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time, hell i'm a fan of them, but it's just an insult.
