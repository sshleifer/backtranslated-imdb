I do not know how to explain this film. This is definitely one of the amazing movies I've seen in a long time. It is a lot of times worrying but boring in other places. The teeth torture scenes are quite extensive and will attract people in the gore & pitcher. I hold my teeth in the above mentioned scenes. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing about the movie is that our fears and dentist are very dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The movie's humor is somewhat hidden and not everyone is recognized. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and drilling to teeth, it's just the picture you are looking for. <br /> <br /> You read the comment and this kind of entertainment <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (very unusual for my taste)
