The brutal Irish sea captain Nolan (Richard Harris) and his crew are trying to capture a large white shark so that it can be sold for big bucks, unfortunately, a disgruntled marine biologist known as Ken (Robert Caradine) is attacked by a killer whale by the killer shark, Nolan's interest will increase And he wants to catch one of them. While trying to do that, he catches a pregnant woman, and the wounded her miscarriage will suppress the fetus, which makes her two uncomfortable, and Nolan commands the whale in the ocean. Men's Killer Whale kills one of the Naulan crews before arriving in Newfoundland's dryland area in Canada and the Killer Wally performs a series of attacks on the town. <br /> <br /> I think this horrific fear that was directed by Michael Anderson was terrible, I'm sorry, but it's just a ludicrous, modest 90 odd minute. Producer Luciano Vincenzoni & Sergio Donaty script The script is stupid so I'm losing words, not helping the fact that it seems to take very seriously & I'm just laughing once again how brilliant killer whale's if I listen to Charlotte Rampling. I'm sorry but I do not believe that just a killer whale belongs to a special boat and I do not believe it is insufficient to find out if it is drowning, and I do not believe the killer whale can cause a big explosion by overturning the oil lantern from a wall. I believe that killer whale can find someone's house, I believe that someone is at home and then ruin the purpose. A killer whale flips over a boat and moves the ice cubes around, and I believe that killer Wales can physically identify people and this mute motion No revenge which is strong as the image Professions, or at least I believe it to be one. Maybe I'm a bit harder, but it's a movie that's trying to be a serious one, I'm ridiculous because I'm half anticipated to write a letter to Killer Whale Nolan. It seemed insightful to do anything about it. They wanted to heal the common cold! Seriously, it is a statement that does not get more than anything in this film. I have a very boring, totally dull & awful character with screen presence at all in the film. <br /> <br /> Director Anderson is certainly not Spielberg, this rubbish film is absolutely no suspense, fear, tension or atmosphere. All attack scenes are not dishwatter & completely unforgettable, they do not have any progress, Orca can not survive a person. Then there are scenes that are literally smiling at me, the killer of the killer whale's pure comedy & two killer Wales's early sequences I suspect I tried to show a 'loving' & 'caring' bunch but I think it would be helpful but we'd always get the killer whale romance, hilarious stuff. The footage of Killer Wales is a striking and frustrating, rather than comparable scenes around the scenes, which seem like rare rare wildlife documentary footage with less than anything. Did you think that I do not like this movie? Good. <br /> <br /> Forget about any gore or good deaths, Bow Derek cuts his legs, but when it shines and you lose it. <br /> <br /> This is probably a very big budget and it still sucks, there is nothing better about Orca, but it's flat, bland & completely forgotten. Cinematography is great. <br /> <br /> Orca is a lame jaz-rip-off, which is entirely ignored or disgusted by everything that made Spielberg's image, which is pretty cool one of the lovers of evil cinema everywhere. Joss: The Revenge (1987) was not as good as it was.
