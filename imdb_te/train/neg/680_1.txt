I was finally caught on television on "Starlight" last night and I can say. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - many hockey special effects (check out laser beams outside of Willy's eyes!), Fraudulent acting, fantastic conversation, unmatched use of stock footage, or faint overall production. This is truly a kind of one-off experience, and we should be grateful for all of us. I nominate Jonathan Kane as Ed Wood true heir!
