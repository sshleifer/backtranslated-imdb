Cohen Waters is a serious singer and presenter. In the early nine years he tried his hand at the movies. But this incredible piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. This also ended the acting career of Dutch actress Nada Van Nee, a television commentator and programmaker. I saw it in the (almost empty) theater because I was a fan of Koen Waders, Clausau's band. I'm spending money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and every bad way to execute evil. Some people think it's funny and bad. I am not one of them. I found a wonderful waste of time and money.
