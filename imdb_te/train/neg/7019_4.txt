After seeing the poster from the movie Smamer, I know I live in one of the film experiences that I can not make my eyes open. However, I thought it was a solid cast for the movie because it had a little optimism <br /> That certainly did not happen.It's not true. The evening was a horrible movie, but it was not executive. That's best what I say about it. <br /> <br /> The same guys from the licensed to the same boys, something that explains that they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor. Very often, I do not even laugh at watching this movie. Besides, I have a solid cast Completely ruined. Some people may think that Diane Keaton's career can be hazardous, after having participated in a large number of tragedies (like a monumental defeat and execution). Even so, it's impossible for me to forget the stunning performances she has brought us for decades in films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom. In Smother, she will do her best with her acting, but she writes that her role was very bad and did nothing with her. Dayx Shepherd shows me the rigorous films Baby Mama and Idiocrossis. But he can do what he can do with his role. Mike White also works well, but he can not reach far. He is a very talented storyteller (such as The Good Girl and School of Rock as he has shown in the movies), so he was willing to be one of the artists in the film. Instead, Liv Tyler suffers from the same condition of actors mentioned earlier: wastes <br /> <br /> The worst failure from the smear is completely boring and unnatural. We can not see it from this crappy comedy in sit-coms..Stay rather than collecting weak screen scenes and scenarios.
