The rebellion of zombies is bad. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is dull, lifeless, poor, and poorly written. I've complained that the original Dracula was a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes Dracula as a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> 65 minutes were shown in 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition to Cambodia is to find the secrets of mind control by "Westernization". A person finds the secret and uses a married man to marry him. When this happens, he will release the zombies under his control for terrible consequences. That's it. It's the whole story. <br /> For the most part, I see a male senior. He looked very familiar. I thought about this. Nothing happened in the film. Just before the zombies "rebelled", it hit me. This is Dean Jagger. I recently saw him as general in White Christmas. <br /> <br /> I did not buy a DVD for this film. Compared to this film, this is the most important film in the making of the film. It's worth it, I'll give it a 2/10. (I can not go to 1/10, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
