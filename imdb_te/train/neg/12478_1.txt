I want to give this film to 1 because it's not bad, but do not think I'm enjoying watching because I laughed and laughed and I had some questions too. So half a time I'm laughing, and in half the time I say "what's going on in hell". Or "Why do someone else do it?" And the rest. I have seen the most terrible fog effects, the 80th style nude scene / war / dialogue / naked scene, and the warrior swords in the air as they walk on their horses. And some crappy model effects (that is, if they want true trees?) And I still do not understand this person they found in the cave, what is in hell? One friend told me about these films and I thought I would give it a try, and I liked the people like Ed Wood films, and I'm not really happy with what this film intended, I see it in my own happy way. So if you really want it to be an action movie, this is, I'm not able to attract this attention, it's like for other reasons. Evil is worse than dead, so it keeps on wasting your life (which has been in my mind a few times). Many people have some drinks and some other friends, and I guess it's good to laugh in the movie. Perhaps it's a bit tough, but I do not think so, let's rent and you'll see. Yo.
