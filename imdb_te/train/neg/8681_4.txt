The campus in this program has to confess that there is some merit, however, after an executive deadline termination, it is difficult to imagine a program that is completely unchanged for a single politician's denial. <br /> <br /> Lil Bush, which is technically classified as "sarcastic", attempts to ignore its value, the original use of the comedy's unique tool to retain its goals in exceptionally vulgar (but not original, entertaining, or funny) ways. The consistent weaker writing of the show is often heard by Bush / Cheney jokes wherever possible and less than one in a 30 minute block of television.
