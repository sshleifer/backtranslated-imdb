Well, what can you say about sitcom? There is very lame, courageous dedication, and just plain. So this show! It's got a boring cast, but A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical rubbish ... always. We have seen it before, and can be seen again when this program is canceled. The reason is that it faces its face and self-righteousness. <br /> <br /> Very small. If you want to see some good entertainment, you can take a twenty minute break before the mirror. Make some faces and go ahead ... Its more entertaining than this performance!
