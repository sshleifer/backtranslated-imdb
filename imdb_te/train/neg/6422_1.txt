"I have seen this film last night and this film keeps me in the back of my mind because I do not think I will ever think about the actors I've ever played. <br /> <br /> I think the ad is a good or bad thing, in the movie I'm Tom Cruise or Demi Moore Every time I see it, I think it's a good thing, "A Few Good Good." Now, I'm Ron Perlman or Christie Swann Every time I see Nancy, I feel like "Tinseltetown." <br /> <br /> I think something is wise or at least I think Chickley and Ari Gross and Swanson and Pearlman mentioned above are not bad at all. Wheeling can be built in the size of Indiana (where exactly?), But each of them <br /> <br /> The film is not in any angle of funny or entertaining, it's there and 84 is slowly slower. <br /> <br /> The letters are paper-thin. Almost all the two struggling authors of a dream written on this need to care about the NONE of the characters, Wood, because the authors. Well, two REAL writers know everything about the changes on the screen, so they will impress the audience. <br /> <br /> They do not even think about developing a character, unless they try to rebuild the story of "Gilligan's Island". <br /> <br /> The plot is unnatural. Two boys live in a storage center, one of them stores a bed and lives there twenty people. The rest of the story is complete and stupid. Have you seen "the favorite deadly sins of the National Lampune"? The second story with Joe Montegna is that he does not find a good story to make a TV movie about a television writer, so he created one. <br /> <br /> Now, the story writer Morp Mantegna has replaced Television writer at half the age of alternative actors, and the comedy is taken out of it. <br /> <br /> The actors have tried. Christie Swanson is perhaps 10 minutes in the film and is giving the best performance in the film. She is still hot but she does not actually help make STAR in the film instead of making CAMEOS. For all the others, I do not think it's wrong for the actors because they have bad stuff. <br /> <br /> Let's go watch the image of the National Lampoon, but stay away from this film.
