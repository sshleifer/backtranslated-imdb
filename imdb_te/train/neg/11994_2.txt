Another big star, another glamor set, another well-known director, is another movie full of charters in the chart buster, but it's a story that every movie is expecting from a big budget motion picture in what's missing at the end of the day. Most hype is what it's lurking around the film before the Red Carpet premiere. Anil Kapoor is widely known as one of the best love stories after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Anil G, are you talking about the movie? There are 6 different couples and 12 different people who have a different attitude towards life as well as the plot of the film, but they all love a common problem, despite their different approach towards life. Well indeed a lurking theme. But we did not expect the movie to make such a bore, and the audience left the audience with such films as the last hope. <br /> <br /> These are the films that were previously disgusting. Because after a heavy buck for a multiplex ticket, I will lock up for the climax for 4 hours in the theater. . The director will now be confused with the plot where he will be baffled how he shares the time slot for six different star audiences. Some couples like Anil Kapoor-Zhuhi and Sohail Khan-even though the woman is against her) can not understand their existence in the film. Salman (also known as Rahul for the whole film, also like Rahoo oooooool) has a lot of good feel with his Hindi style. Hey Salu Bhai, now married to Aish, get some tip from Abhishek to improve your acting abilities. A simple strip stop movie box office does not hit every time. And Anil will stop your trademark chin to pardon or see him as a whole. And your daughter-in-law-loving girl Jack Nicholson is looking at a romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The other big mistake of the film is that there is no exact synchronization between the stories of different pairs. Each story appears to have been taken from different stories, put together to build a difficult story of Salam-e-Ishq. <br /> <br /> Bollywood still has to learn a lot from Snatch and Memento, where the director knows the whole art of threading different distinct sequences to create a perfect mixing plot. <br /> <br /> Before I released the movie, the title adds to the number 28, and it is estimated that the film is not good because it is considered a bad number in the 28th numerology. But I took my stand by saying that I was not totally failing to cope with my numerology deficiencies, but due to consistent myriads in the film. <br /> <br /> Director like Nikhil Adwani could make such a big mistake in the entire story, and no miracle was saved from the bombing at the box office. <br /> <br> Please avoid viewing this movie at any cost. There is not a pi value you pay for the ticket. There are good movies on valuable theater screens nowadays, more than Salam-e-Ishq.
