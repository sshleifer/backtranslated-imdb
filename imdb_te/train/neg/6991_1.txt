Just do not bother. <br /> <br /> But when it starts, it will increase the boring and terribly predictable. In the center of the picture you have a slightly different social drama and all tensions get lost because of the speed drop. In the end it is good but not really great. I think the director has taken this film very tightly. U do not care about the plot in a kind of a picture, at least you want some good action. I almost dozed off in the middle / main part. <br /> Derby.
