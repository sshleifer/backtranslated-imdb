Set in a post-apocalyptic environment, cyborgs led by the warrior Job Reign on human population. They are primarily livestock, because they need fresh human blood to live. Nea and her brother managed to escape one of their attacks when she was a child, and years passed when she again came face to face with cyborgs, but this time she was cyborg gabriel cyborgs. Job and his men are more likely to take over the city of the population, but Neva (with a vengeance) wants to train her for killing Gabriel Cyborgs and she is taken to Gabriel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Hunk is the most misleading of some cheap novels by cybercourt / post-apocalyptic fay which is a cheap low-rental cycle made by writer / director Albert Puny (which "cyborg" and wiping the same year "Nemies"). The very small structure enters the triangular story, the triangle script is weak, the tramp and the greater. The lead seeks ridiculous fun, but it looks pretty cool and stunning in random times. The actions that occur are very beautiful and are simple. This substance improved with a lazy addiction, an absence of narrative and nearly joke tone with an inspired feeling. The open-end, cliffhangger's end is just too impressive, especially the sequel and the need to do it. It seems like money is canceled and the time has come to pack up "whether it's a different way (or another decade)." However, with its quick pace, some well-executed combat and George Murdian's gliding cinematography have been found, and the scene of the eye-catching scene captured. Exhibitions are legitimate. Chris Christopherson's dry and rigid personality battles with skill and aggression, such as Gabriel and a self-assured, mentally capable Kathy Long. But her performance is very wooden. A mugging Lance Henricssen gives a mouth-watering performance of pure ham, the villainous Cyborg leader's job is constantly having a salivary movement. Scott Paine also gleefulness as drills and Gary Daniels also pouts about one of the cyborgs as one of the Cyborgs. Pan has hit some exciting martial arts pieces, with some lightweight vigor and rare slow movements. Tearing in the background is a scorching but mechanical sound score score. Special effects and stand-up fx stand up enough fine. Watchable, but not too successful, it can be less limits.
