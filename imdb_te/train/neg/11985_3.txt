Have you ever wanted to eat insects? Here is a 'documentary' to show how! Yes ... the kid eats live worms! <br /> <br /> The film was very frustrating by the earlier critics. I'm completely here in agreement. The film does not go anywhere ... unless you like eating worm! <br /> Now the technical side: they should give the baby a haircut. He's trying to look like ... Bojo the Clown. It's almost ridiculous ... I thought I would almost be shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> On top and above; The way the kid always looks hungry is very chunky! Junk food should be kept away for a few weeks to shoot. <br /> <br /> For all, this film is made to sleep. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a good story to go here, <br /> <br /> It is safe enough to see children: bear scenes and 'odelball' iball <br /> <br /> I'm afraid of most people, And the scenery of 'thin-dipping' in a short time does not show anything.
