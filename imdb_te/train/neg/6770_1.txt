I saw this film with my 17 y.o. Daughter. I insisted on seeing the show, because I'm tough, but I feel it. In the NASCAR spirit, it's a sponsor's dream. Most blatantly announcements, even though it is not called acting, is almost as informative-mercial. With tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy tale lines, the car for the carbon of motion picture only 'vehicle' (not intended). Earlier in the Herbie installments (even cheesy) were produced in more severe periods, they were easily able to digest. Mrs. Lohan, Disney's dramatic queen, has less acting ability. I'm surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon are involved in such a project. Snack bar only a big repo!
