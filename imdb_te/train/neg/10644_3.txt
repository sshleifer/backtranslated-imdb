Well, here we are a different image. Though gender-reversing tired plots, it is worth looking. However, this is not. In previous reviews, I made my impression about the general decline I enjoyed for Haim films after the last 80s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Just one of the girls' tells about a high school kid (Corey Haim) who tries to prevent her bullies by dressing as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading team and isfriending fellow cheerleader, Mary (Nicole Ellert). <br /> <br /> This film is very bad, and I thought it was not even funny. But, judging by a majority of reviews, it is only the fans of Alanis Morissette or teen sex queen, Nicole Egertt who are the only ones who wish to see. If you are looking for a good hyme feature (or character switching comedy), it will not be more than 1989.
