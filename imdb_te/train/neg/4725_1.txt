A great opportunity and indie director make an interesting film about a rock musician on the edge of fame. It would have been a good movie if it describes John Livien's painful past and how to torture his mind. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to figure out the life of John Levine's John Livien. John Lennen's suicide mother, John Lennon, and Lennon himself wanted him to be viewed as powerful and productive. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical aura and his amazing ability to learn about their life for others, it has shown Lennon's legacy to be a confused, drug-inspiring spirit. Man. The film reminded me of another "silly" man who was a big John Lennon fan and Lennon, Lennon Killer, and Mark David Chapman. Lennon had a brutal murderer with a man with Lennon, who had killed a man. Is it necessary to remember us about it? John Lennon gave much to the world with his music and honesty and I was failing to see another disturbed person in the lead role in the film, and did not show his beautiful works to the world. Yoko Ono honored in memory of John Lannon, reminding him that by giving John's attention to his fans in Central Park. Instead, the film chose to use a site that contains a suicide killer attempt. I remember this disgrace and disrespect in Lennon's memory. He was a man who died of a brutal supernatural death, and felt similar violence near this site to recreate a terrible trauma for any Lennon fan. It completely destroyed the movie. It may be a good film, but it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. John Lennon, and his family will not let in the rest peace and remember his poisoned murder by the film that is irresponsible.
