If a person who does not have Alzheimer's does not remember how many films he has done, he is the most fruitful director in the world. That man was Jesus' Franco, the so-called 'eurotrash' king. His 1980 film Devil Hunter rushed into the true sense of the word (the title of the movie was misleading, for starters) as any other Franco movie I saw, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative. It sounds pretty pretty awful, and it's the fastest ever made of all of his movies that does not have a kind of unpleasant sensibiliation kind, with frank nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing, <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is near incomprehensible for the first, because the combination of these items will cause you to take the movies, half an hour. Kidnap meets a group of local acts in South America by strangers of a white woman who is a model or film actress. There are naked melodious dance, dance, and endless zoom-ins on the endless totem pole. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always referenced in soundtrack through the sapphire glazing, apparently recorded in an echo room. In the first part of the story, he bowed over a local woman who tied a tree and found it hard to find out what really happened here, but I think she had a stomach (or her genes, sweet jesus!) <br /> When the expedition begins, a pirate guy and his freak Out Vat Wet Pal is the right thing to do when sending a white girl from Kidnappers to the island Begins. The layman is a lyricist, Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpoolian and Everything is a voice called retarded. Conversation and dubbing are all ridiculous and ridiculous, having your interest in another piece of the film. <br /> <br /> There is not really much from here, it is very dull, filled with an odd bit of anger like a rape. 360 degree nudity and two female leads from the locals, and even the observer actions from the monster (hah!) Flabered out. He walks around with his penis exposure and makes him wrestling an unappetising opportunity for the tough guy hero, but it should look at at some point, and the director is nice to note that the camera shows someone's genitals <br> The best feature of the devil hunter is location filming. Frongo is very cheap with the structural and story elements of film making, but he does not encircle the sets. You get in the real islands, forests, helicopters and mountains, all widescreen. <br /> <br /> The CGI sets and backdrops of this fun are really nice to experience these days. If you're trying to see all the video nesties, you'll see it at some point, and I'll make you free. If you like Franco, you'll see it anyway. If you fall into the above mentioned categories, the odds will never exist throughout this movie. Its copies are not lying around, and I rarely recommend asking it. This is Franco. Lazy, Crazy Franco.
