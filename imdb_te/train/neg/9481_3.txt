James Bishop (Matt Stacey) goes to a 'mental illness facility' for medical resident programs with Dr. McCarth (Bruce Panez). There, in a fiction encouraged by many interns Dr. McCorm, he finds that the ghost is being killed by the "Ripper" who bring their souls. This story is very irrelevant and suppresses it is impossible to write a summary. Dialogues are very ridiculous, especially as Helen, James Bishop's Blond Fiance's husband arrives at the shelter, almost entirely trustworthy to have a heroine in the screenplay. And what about James returning to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And with a cast of ham stars and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what's wrong with this film: screenplay, director or cast. The correct answer is perfect. I saw this movie on cable television, and I was surprised how the producer had spent money in such a trash. This horror movie becomes very funny to consider the absurd of the plot. <br /> The title (Brazil): Demonio (`Devil ')
