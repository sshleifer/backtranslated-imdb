... except the zone header. <br /> The plot is entertaining. A 29-year-old slacker son (Hedder) still lives with a widow mom (Keaton) who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). The slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and seek to sabotage the relationship. <br /> <br /> I love the show of Daniels and especially Farie, but it is better to sell hot dogs on the beach who have cast Haader. Headers performance is worrying, he's a good thing since he's playing an annoying person, and ultimately he is bad as an actor to lose this act. At the end you still want to personally punch the guy in the face and you are upset about the end. This guy in the future will not have any movie for me!
