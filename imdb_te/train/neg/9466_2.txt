The film was physically painful, perhaps because (for many years my age and younger) I was Dr. Grew up with the sauce and loved his books - funny, intelligent, whimsical and destructive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hut" is out of interest and survived the story, and Mike Myr's performance as a cat is very mesmerizing. Why borscht belt accent, unfunny sound, inappropriate jokes, charmless dresses? I had to read the books back to see the real problem: the books were simple. This image is overflown and the path is too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect the image of every child to be a toy story or iron giant, but it's a new low set. How Mike Myers Need Money?
