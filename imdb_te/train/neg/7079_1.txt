There is no reason to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It has been portrayed as a soft romantic film, but it does not have anything emotional about it. <br /> <br /> The world of sexual abuse is witty but one point. <br /> <br /> The boring sex scenes of Ed Beleg Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save the film, bad storyline and guest characters.
