Some time ago, Billy Bob Thornton ("Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan" and others with classrooms such as "The Man Who Went Not Their Name") is odd turkey. However, I can not understand it, it can be a bad thing. How rare is this movie - it's very ridiculous: "Knock Knock", "Who's up?", "The Great Stinking Man", "The Great Stinking Man?", "Big Stomach - You!" Yes folks, it's not really bad. Billy Bob is only about two minutes (I think he needed to work at that time in his career) and the rest of the movie was painful. For some reason, though it is irrevocable, I hate it. This is because I do not have any high-budget, special effects for laden junk like "Fast and the Furious" and this is not a "No-Budget" film. 2/10 at a push.
