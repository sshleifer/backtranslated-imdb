In the past, Madhur has given us a powerful movie bar. His next film was one of the worst films. This clearly tells the story of some of the upper class in India. After seeing the scene where another man goes for a movie to play a movie for sexual reasons. I thought it was like a violation of the DVD and a break. I did randomly. The film has scenes of child pornography and abuse. I was surprised to see a movie showing literally vomited and naked kids. The most tragic thing is that the kids do not need to be completely naked. One of the richest ones kidnapped the poor children and wanted to sell the British men and the British men. He was surprised to learn that the film was hit in some parts of India, otherwise the super flap in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK, and this kind of thing should make me sick and should not be released in the UK.
