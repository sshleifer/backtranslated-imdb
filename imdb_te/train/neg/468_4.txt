Before I commented on this film, I saw on YouTube, I agree that I have checked it out to see what I saw in TV ads in 1980: a split of Barbara Bach. And since the film received an R rating, I wanted to see her nude. Oops, there was no dice for her or any other beautiful actress who appeared here: Stessy Nellkin was a teen, but she did her at the age of 20. After seeing her in a bra and panty and just a belly dancer outfit is just Ms. Bach is as enthusiastic as. They offer some of the scattered laughs offered by the film. In fact, I'm not blamed for Ron Leibman for removing his name from credits, and I'm pretty embarrassed, even though I'm lazy enough to liquefy the role of a "seductress" with a middleman. This is also the first time in solitary mission Ralph Machiae in the Mississippi school that was sent to the academy school. Others really love a stepmother who loves Arab and his girlfriend Candy (Nelskin's character), who is an admirable mother of his stepmother and motor oil, who looks at her in the middle of the night in the Academy of Girls. In the supporting cast, Tom Poston plays a partial role Sisson who I found partially amusing. The director directed by Tom Patchtard and Jay Torres and Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. is a guest at the beginning of a soccer scene), the academy is politically untrue with humor, but you are ruined in scathical and sexual matters, in fact Mad Magazine and its trademark cover Boy-alfred e. Newman - a comedy that does not shy away as they once removed their name and character. .PS "Misfits" Another was born in my birth town Chicago-born Harry Teniwitz, Ill. Rodney played Ververgaert. He said one of my favorite lines was: "I'm trying to come."
