This review applies generally to the "sword of the wolfman" image of the film. I understand that there is an uncensored version with additional footage, and I hope there are at least eight or nine key scenes that seem to be missing from the cut called "Woolfman Fury". In short, the film is no different. <br /> <br /> In the seemingly undefeated series of films shot by Valmamer Dansky, the respected lycopropic antihero Paul Naschie, he clearly went to Tibet, where he returned from an ordinary person, where he attacked the Himalayas. Whatever it was, he made him a wolf. Danis was a doctor, a scientist, and a teacher who appears as a college. One of his female colleagues, Elona Elman, took part in unclear hypnosis ... "kematodes", a nonsense term, refers to the conflict's head contradictions. <br /> <br /> Elman allows her to "change the direction of the human brain", which allows her to rule the world naturally, and can reach us with all the strings that are in trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Elman is also in Wroclaws, because she kidnapped Danis and brought him to her hidden lab. She also has a group of other people trapped there. Some of them are like gypsies, and bonds are being made, and are in different stages. Others are clearly hippies. One day Elman feels she "can help them again as a human being", but this time she controls her komodo. Nashchee's Wolfdale's make-up has changed many times and churches around him as an animal until the film makers use another Naschie Warwolf Film, footage from "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" (Do Not Ask). <br /> What does this mean? No? Good. This can save the image. It does not try and engage any kind of intellectual level, it just can go to full speed with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror film sets it up. "Fury of the Wolfman" is the best Halloween party image. You definitely do not need to pay attention to it, and in fact if you do, you will be totally confused.
