I feel like a very open minded guy and I like it a lot (!) If I do not like a movie, I have seen this movie! > <br /> I do not know what is wrong with people who gave me a good rating (IMDB is generally reliable when it comes to ratings) ... The only thing I can imagine is that people should vote in one or more situations: <br /> Moves from the minds / throws stones 2. They got hard cash for votes 3. pointed gun <br /> <br /> For me I have wasted a good 45 minutes in my life Kuhn is not a curiosity for the film.
