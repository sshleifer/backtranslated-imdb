Ah yes, the VS series, the pinnacle of MVC2. It has been said before, half of this staff fell asleep job is what you get, unfortunately the gameplay has made halfway. Do not get me wrong, it's fun, but you're tired to bunch the buttons. For a summary of the plot, Ahahahaaaaaaaa ... no plot. Beat that guy to the end and win! Eh, who can play this by their self?
