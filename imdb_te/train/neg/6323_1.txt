This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. One of those movies showing children on a rainy day in school when you can not go out for the nest, and you can see anything else. At least when I was in elementary school. I will remember this movie. Granted, I did not see in 15 years, and they probably would not be used anymore in the rainy days but I warned everyone: You have to use this stuff to make your kids better than sleeping and entertaining. Trust me, choose any other. Although this issue is controversial, the plot is very rare and I can not remember anything about it, 15 years later, I thought I needed to be alert to all that. .
