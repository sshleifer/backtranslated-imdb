The film was featured in all the fans and theaters in Bangkok, which failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The story writer does not just have water. Something is definitely missing. People in my opinion should have a reason to see why they are other than the historical glimpse of the past history. <br /> <br /> The accuracy in history is not what we're looking for. <br /> <br /> There is no substance for the film. The only way to do this movie rights is to have some changes, where it is just a legend instead of a story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It is called the central theme. <br /> At least some strange epic flying elephants, supernatural king, or the unusual King "The King and Eye" were appealing, films appeal. I guess there is no other appeal than a plain vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you've got the appeal, the story is the next thing we focus on. In marketing terms, we call it "must see". People say after listening to the title of the film, Oh, I'll see. Where is Appeal in King Maker now? Why repeat the title and call it, "How is a King not?" And the old Siamese days make black comedy, "Dr. Strangelove" style. It was more interesting. The film was a lot of fun with the story-like experiences of kings laughs from the first people. <br /> <br /> Many films today "must see" appeal to Spiderman, Men X, these topics speak for themselves. If they do not know the characters, some other movies like The Island ask about advertising, "Do you still believe there is an island?" When asked. <br /> <br /> For the film, "How Not NOT A King", "Do you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> <br /> "
