Carl Jr and his father are now running an army on a remote island. They are three of the three relatives in the island. After some time, who should fight back. This is a non-rit blood, gore and carnage, it's nice to have seen any remotely real, or if it does not look like a product it's worth the benefit of a profit-worth week (it's probably just two days worth it). The dreaded dubbing did not bother me and I realized if I was really drunk, it's a little funny ... probably. But it's just 78 minutes, the film is still very long .. Oh I do not know ... 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus Movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; And other shock-o-rama movies
