I never finished this film for a reason, it's terrible and just acting. I'm not even sure about the TBH movie which does not make much sense and violence is awful. I'd undoubtedly dude in an image (lol) but what was happening was just sick. All the characters were angry at me and it just finished crying out loud and shiver at the parts of the camera and Blair with the project looked like a sequel but without any good features. It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time and I'd like to please my time. I do not recommend this picture to anyone or even consider it. (N)
