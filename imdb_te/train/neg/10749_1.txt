This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that jump right at me: 1. There are more hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush in the woods. Not scary. News flash, if you shoot in Southern California, the big bear is an hour away. They are actually trees there. <br /> <br /> Writing is definitely without doubt the worst conversation I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the image is unrealistic, cliche, or just plain stupid. For example the camp name is "camp blood" (lame), the clown name "killer clown" (lame). What is a clown in a forest? The only mask they could find? 3. Last but definitely acting at least. The worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. The true beauty of Shetty Lines and poor acting. This is the worst part of when the fatty go backwards when the foreign girl is naked for a photograph. It's a really long sequence and I guess she felt sexy, but she was not. Also, and this is one of the few enjoyable parts of the film for me, this tool that feels like "athletic." For example, when he is bored in the movie, he draws a couple of rocks and curls with them. He is then thought to be a clown and it is clear that he is far from his player. The girl who plays Oh and Cat, the good Lord stops singing. <br /> If you have a reason to watch this movie, I would recommend that you look for special features. This is actually a group of Jacques who spoke about the film as being the original story. In fact, one of the girls actually told her that some of her friends read the screenplay and can not imagine that none of them will end up. Apparently hang out with her special children.
