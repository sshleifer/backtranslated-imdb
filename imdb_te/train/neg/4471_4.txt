The best thing I can say about this film is that it is very fun at times and it's the right time killer. Unfortunately, this film is very annoying, I want to read these characters. It is the type of film that is sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions are good, I think, but when the conversations disappoint SO things are confusing. When two Leads are not on the screen, this is not really bad, but be afraid in those moments when the couple start talking to each other.
