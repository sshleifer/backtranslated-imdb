I went out laughing when I saw a reviewer compare it to LOTR. Yes, if you exclude dwarfs, thousands of cast, great special effects, big battles, strong character, good plot, good acting, classy direction and everything else. It leaves you with walking. And boy, this movie is not walking! If Mr Piano is on his way, this will probably be three hours of hard walking walking through the Wisconsin Rural, but every 40 minutes or these pesky Martians pop up a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You have not seen too much walk in a picture. It must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because if he really has a $ 20m budget, he too can get through the gales with all the walking he's walking. For better effects, good video camera or proper actors will not have any money left. Honestly, it's like watching some hideous fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in long dresses. <br /> <br /> As in science fiction, I feel that Martians are wrong in this movie: On the way of walking <br /> How much am I wondering if Mr. Piano can drive dogs?
