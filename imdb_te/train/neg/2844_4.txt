This is one of the greatest films made by Clarke Gable. Parnell is just clear. <br /> <br /> Gambling is unbearable, it is very sad that Gabe or Jean Harlow do not have to be proud. slammer (like gangster talk?). He hopes that he will do the right thing but he leaves her - no one knows what, she is "in the family way". In the end, Rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they all happy together! They forgot about the rap of the gap and the need to spend many years in Hoszego. Leonard Maldin said "stars are their best". What standard? Best at the production of unnecessary chuckles? <br /> When I say this, my wife, Leonard Maltin, finds me and leaves my butt. Hmmm. However, despite my commentary, Mr. Maltin was the best reviewer and the man on the planet (I calmed him). <br /> <br /> <br /> I decided to see this film very soon, because I do not like the very first time (especially the ridiculous ending). After all, sometimes I like so much more when I see a movie and I realize that I am a bit too tough. In recent months, I have not liked the film for the second time. This is not due to the first half of the film. In the first half, Harlow's character is superbly stupid but at least it's believable. But when she was sent to jail, all the clich√©s of the last funniest wedding scene were taken. Bottom line This sequence is awkward dumb - it just makes no sense and the film becomes a few wacky fairy tales instead of the love story about two melee. I think my original review (despite all "NOT Benefits") and possibly POLLY at PARNELL and CIRCUS, would just be the worst gap image.
