First of all, you must confess it is not good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a strange 24 hours of a publicist and he works more, dizzy, ill and sometimes sad. After 20 minutes in this role you really sleep. I understood why the casino should be part of this horrible movie. Money or what? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I am an avid amicable fan, I bought this 2002 movie People I Know. If you have not yet bought it, do not think about it, it's just a waste of time.
