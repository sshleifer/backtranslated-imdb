If the film is directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad image cult classic, it can be a success (I say). Have you ever seen a movie that you can always sit and feel good about its mistakes? Well this is. Each of the acting cast has to be nominated for the worst acting performance awards. It is difficult to find another movie with this type of product budget, which does not have any value. The whole thing, relieving logic from the opening scenes. The conversation is completely unreliable and legitimate. Dito for the simple storyline of the behavior and the film. What is really intolerable is that some boats in a table room actually make the decision to spend money on the trash. Wow.
