The lady who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath to find this hole in her bath. So she goes to find that her neighbor is her neighbor photographer. The film may have a great plot, but then the plate drinks have no hope. The problem I have with this film is every 10 seconds, anyone hit the heroin. If someone takes the scenes that hit heroin, this is a very good movie. Every time I thought a scene would go somewhere, someone picked up White Powder. It really has a lot of drug use in a movie lame. It drew attention from the great story about the main storyline and the photographer. Lesbian stuff does not bother me. I'm looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
