Forgive me to say clearly, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. However, there are extensive elements in those two broad categories. The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars Slot are convenient for the better class. At the other end of the spectrum there are only unwanted images to be indicated by name. Occasionally, someone produces a really annoying image. A film to be taken alone as a show for how terrible the movie is. Cinema more than bad. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that was hijacked by a gang of evil criminals seeking a ransom from a slander evil and plot ship. In fact, an American leader on the board is full of chained jaws and sculptured chests, which he will save day. <br /> This is a product of sinking new depths. Everything is bad about it. Acting, direction and plots are very low in breathing. In short, it is a disgrace for the intellectual and intellectual. <br /> Yes, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I do not stop temptation to create a list of things that make me angry about this movie. . <br /> <br /> Think yourself in your mind that you are a bad hijacker and you stand in a public lifeboat on a serene ocean. . You are in the company with the hero who has a ticking bomb. Side hero throws you bomb and jumps up. What do you do I do not know about you, but I will go into the sea until I deny the bomb. This person is not. He swims as our hero and he will block the bomb with bad results. Put it. Such death is mentioned in the Darwin Awards website and fits the lives of the production team.
