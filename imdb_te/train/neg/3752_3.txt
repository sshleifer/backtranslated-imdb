I grew up watching and loving TNG. I finished watching the entire series ST Voyager with this DVD, which increases my humiliation with this episode, the difference between style and style between the two styles is not the hardest. This idea may be better if the Riker is used as an opportunity to expand the character, perhaps how it will be treated in VOY. They are not only old-fashioned clips, but are "new" memories for the audience. Transitions between the "memories" and "present" in this episode and the beginning of the clichy begin, and the tiring pattern turns out to be very fast. Bar none - ever Ghost episode.
