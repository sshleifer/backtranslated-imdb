I got luck (MIS) to see this film at a show in the US. Sit by unsatisfying whole endless thing, I'm shocked seeing IMDB better reviews here. <br /> <br /> The original image is a turkey, but an interesting one. It was set for the early seventies in the 1969 revolution; This film is just torn ....... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> Madonna can never work, and has suffered a big screen for years. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie, who built his "reputation" on the lock stock, was unable to direct - his films were shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He is not disappointed here; <br /> <br /> Please take good reviews for this movie from other posters below to others. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to insult himself by giving him money. <br /> <br />
