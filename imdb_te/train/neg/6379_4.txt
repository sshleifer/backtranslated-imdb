How can you make a mistake with a movie called "Guyangers from Outer Space"? Just throw some of the top templates for the characters, the main suppliers for the soundtrack use the Village people, throw in tons of gay gags. Plot is not important. Very bad, this film is not in this case and every joke does not miss the spot. Characters from German ginginger are identical, one or two jokes work, and others are failing. <br /> <br /> This title laughs at me and I'm ready to laugh more about the movie. My expectation is clear.
