... and I never deserve to have a picture awarded to a 1! But this is the worst thing I've seen honestly. My wife chose it because of the cast, but the plot that I thought was from the DVD box was imaginative. This is not a secret, or childhood catching image. It does not have any sensitivity, if that title could remotely suggest you any. This is not the whole number. Do not lose your time or money like looking at a group of young people in a gothic arrangement. There is nothing new, nothing interesting, it is not worth looking. Max MacSky is the worst of Nick Stall.
