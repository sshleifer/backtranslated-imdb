If you want to see an image about two completely unsympathetic characters, this is one. The performance is fantastic, suspicious from John Cassavettes, as they say, they really get out, and he is a good friend from Peter Faulk throughout his life. The big mistake is, but because they are both innocent mobsters, and flawless bastards boot, it's hard to decide who to root for less. Only the author / director Ellenay May is the only one to avoid this. In a long interview with producer Michael Husman, the two interviews featured "different ideas" about the script, the director's director is almost impossible, the photography director is unquestionably angry about the strangers, the angry stands of the staff, and so on. This mood of a large extravagant family is clearly visible on the screen.
