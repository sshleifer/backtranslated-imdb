I liked this film despite the pace of my favors. But I did not appreciate the comment that I referred to Canada in Montana. It's certainly not North of Montana and is always there. Why Americans are surprised that they are proud of the rest of the world, why is that one reason why. Stop teaching the children of the United States to think they own the planet. There is no such centralist world view in the great countries of the world. Even happiness. I never suggest the USA as the Alberta South. Where is Walt where we are no longer, so why not start now? The movie is pretty pretty Goofy, the next good luck.
