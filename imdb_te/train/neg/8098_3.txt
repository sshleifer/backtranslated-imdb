This is one of the worst embassies I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a secular story, they should not be giving the title of a good book. There is no connection between Wolf's book and title. I do not mind changes if they help stream a story on the screen. At least changes can not harm the final product. The final scene in the film is incredible. Actors misunderstood. <br /> <br /> The director and / or screenwriter have not been able to decide whether or not to make a slum comedy or not. <br /> If you do not like this movie, try the book. If you like this movie, read the book.
