The Rocky IV Heavyweight Championship Boxing, the Platoon is in the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone's story about the experience of an American Army Platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is very ridiculous. All or more events occurring in the Platoon during the 10+ years of US military involvement in Vietnam, war to portray these things happening in a small group of people in a short period of time (few weeks). In the platoon, the plaintiff men watch for a week or two: American soldiers kill civilians, US soldiers are raping civilians, and a US sergeant has been subjected to another US sergeant. Soldiers were killed / injured by a friendly fire, 90% + killed or injured in a warship. Stone is a disgrace to try to paint the film as a soldier in Vietnam. We are soldiers of Vietnam War films (the true story of the undoubtedly trash battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
