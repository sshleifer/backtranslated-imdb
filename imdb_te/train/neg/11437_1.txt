Ballroom Dancing, Sam (Thomas Cavanagh) and Gray (Heather Graham), sharing an apartment and many fondness for an attractive woman in the 1940s movie music and their surprise, Charlie (Bridget Moyanahan). Historically heterosexual, Gray is confused by her new feelings. <br /> <br /> Gray Matters proves to be one of the blurred images I've ever seen. It is dull, predictable, unjust, poorly acted and poorly written. Nothing about it is not real and everything is very cheesy. Moreover, it's not really a romantic comedy with a unique twist, but more of the "upcoming" movie. The first half of Sue Kramer tried to make beautiful second half beautiful with beautiful romantic items and original half and coming in part. Unfortunately, she failed miserably. The first half was more ill and heather grabbed a little. Then, the film took an awkward tone and all got serious. <br /> <br /> Severe scenes are not properly performed and emotions are fraudulent. <br /> I assume that relations between characters are more authentic. The relationship between brother and sister is very weak and they do not look really close. Their relationship is not very natural. Also, the relationship between Tom and Bridget is a very unnatural concept. If two people get married only once a week old, you may want to see a bit more enthusiasm but the characters talk about getting married in Vegas. . <br /> <br /> In addition to the lack of enthusiasm in the film, it is difficult to get into the film with such mutual characters. <br /> <br /> This act is very weak, it's a bit of a good cast. Heather Graham gave a good performance in the film. She is funny and has some beautiful scenes but it is very bad that her co-stars are all full duds. Bridget Moinehann is very weak and her performance has been falsely ringed at every level. Moreover, she seemed to read her lines. Thomas Cavanagh is pretty wood and he has no emotion. The chemistry between Thomas and Heather does not exist and the film is damaged because their relationship is fraudulent. I normally be funny in the supporting role of Molly Shannon but here she is just annoying. Sissy Spacek has two sequences and she is annoying at both of them. Finally, Alan Kumming has just had a difficult role and his performance is not good. Overall, Gray Matters is a lame film and it's not worth watching. Rating 3/10
