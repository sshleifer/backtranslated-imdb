Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (Josh "Josh" as Polac) called a court mentor "thank you" to verify LL Cool J (Rafe Deid), an officer who left the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you are given a description. You decide not to kill the Damien Dante Weines (as Isaiah Charles) with Mr. Cool J's Devil Detective partner Dylan McDermott (like Frances "Lose" Lazarus). Cops in the "Edison" city are so corrupt they snoot their dope, steal their money, shoot their suspects. If he wants to get his girlfriend (hereby called "pussy") or win the Pulitzer, the city's corruption does not sit with great Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake corrupts the unexpected scope and the level of malignant dangers. Author / director David J. Burke keeps the film on top of the water, but just simply. LL Cool J was hit by Timberlake in "Pop Star for the Movie Actress" sweepstakes ("actor rapper" progress). Mr. McDermott was delighted with his role. Lenders to borrowers are prolonged in favor of Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. The first response is attack and tactical, but know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (seems lost). ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
