I saw this movie in the History Channel (in 2006). First, I realized that this was not a documentary - it was drama. But anyone can expect that the least complicated "facts" of the story may be based on actual events. Reagan shot and other characters were real people. The film has got the right. From there, reliance on the facts will decrease rapidly. I never heard of this film before I saw it. I have never heard of Secretary Hag's treacherous behavior filmed by Richard Dreyfus, who was a TV reporter during these events. I heard the whole country "I'm under control ...", but Dreyfuss Hague is a powerful cabinet threatening and can not be fully controlled individually. I have seen this movie, I started investigating the Internet on this topic and quickly discovered that this film pretends to be remade the transcripts of realistic audio tapes and Situation Room conversations. The most important "facts" for the White House, Secret Service, and the driving of the nation's leadership on the horizon of the country and the driving of the world atomic warfare - is undoubtedly wrong. They did not! There is an internal conflict, sure. Hayg is misled, his press room performance is historically sad and he is "harder". But there is nothing approaching scenes depicted in the film. There are too many gross errors in the list, but the record and written record and the simplest comparisons to the film's fantasy are what the producers really are trying to achieve. Knowledge? Inform? Ask? I failed on three borders. It is difficult to tell others the intentions, but there is a need to ask questions behind such a shameless discovery. And for my beloved History Channel's "Real to Real" documentary, the events inside the administration on the shooting day - the focus of the film was almost never addressed. So, the viewer left to investigate without much - if any - help from the network.
