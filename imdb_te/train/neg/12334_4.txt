The comedy is ridiculous, the characters are unbelievable, the conversation is simple, and the absurd ending. I believe, I'm a fan of Kevin Klein, but I'll pepe Le Puy Ant for 2 hours, Meg Ryan is again perky and adorable (take your pick): Cutie doll, baby, puppy, kitten , What you think is a beautiful creature on earth. <br /> <br /> The film gave me the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas Cassadon and Klein in Paris and to Paris to South Africa, to the south of Paris. It is. So I can not blame them for sure.
