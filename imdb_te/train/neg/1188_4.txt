Kurosawa really killed this. Every genius has allowed a failure. This feeling is good but execution is very unclear. <br /> <br /> The film has a fantasy air about making something in an art picture. Poverty in Tokyo plays a simple and realistic role. Many of them tell interesting stories. Very frustrating image.
