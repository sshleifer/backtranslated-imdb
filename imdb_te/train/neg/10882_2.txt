This film is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. From the very first scene, I knew that I was a smash crash. It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns on a mission. As it turns out, it has some random people having a lot of zombies. Well, some years later, some college children are trapped. The head goes jokes from harmful acting pledge. Over the retaliation, over and over the things in a very non-chalonte manner is the final battle that really took the cake with this one to be the whole "Interesting Leading Role" overall over doing things like joke. Absolutely horrific special effects with guns. For example, guns are flash of any muzzle, and vice versa is an alibi. Cheesy music comes out of nowhere that 40 guns (this is a secret why they move in the stop motion), and the stop animation will be accompanied by this by zombies. <Br <br> Overall, the film is the worst. Just like many others you can rent 50 cents in your nearest low brow image rental.
