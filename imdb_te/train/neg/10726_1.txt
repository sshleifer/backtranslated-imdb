With the previous comment I agree, the movie is very good, and you are curious about what's coming ... what's that. All open story lines are open; Firstly, the two characters that appear to have two significance will be fully saved for 1 to 2 or even smaller sequences. I'm addicted to it, but I do not do anything with her for a remaining role. She visits some terrifying goddess, and suddenly the film is not about her, but a few days old, man's toys are made of bread, homemade vodka drinking, and every other tinted glass. Some people say that the movie is about to crush society like judges of IFFR, but for me it's just a bad taste, bad camera work, a secular script and a frightening badge. So I can not be generous as my ancestors when I come to Grading: 1!
