This is a Japanese movie but here it speaks a lot in English. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful picture of the beautiful visuals that make up the lovely beauty of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> However, it is the only redemption quality for me. The story is generally boring. Who wants to see a young lady sulk for 90 per cent of the film because she is too "older" than her husband? <br /> <br /> In the last 10 minutes, she loves and loves her. By then, it was too late for most audiences. We then fell asleep.
