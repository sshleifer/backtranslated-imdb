This is one of the most boring movies I've seen, its terrible. Christopher Lee looks great but he is very small in it, the only good part of the opening sequence. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I finally stopped looking at it all, it was just bad, just die hard hard banner to have this vomit standing movie fans.
