I'm thinking of watching this film, ok it's always nice ... I'm wrong. When it ends it's the real best part of this movie. Total waste is 92 minutes. Wendigo has finally seen it at the end and all the intensity next to the best part you really could even look good to him. And the tail finish is really kind of dumb too. There are a number of sections in the movie that you think is going to happen, but this is a break. There's worse part of Wendigo more then Wendigo has more talk. To make the creature very bad, you can not tell exactly what this movie is.
