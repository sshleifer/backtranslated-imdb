It was filmed in 1992 with the re-design of Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Last World'. <br /> <br /> The film begins to be very good, with a cruel organization intended to exploit the lost world and the challenger, but will return to the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everyone is alone in the plateau and remains with the weak, boring, over-length rehash of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (who have never seen) are just ridiculous. Want to take that cuddly toy that we want to see as a sick toy? <br /> <br /> Receive and hold the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Unbelievable CGI and other advanced influences In this era, the twentieth edition is the best and someone ultimately decides to make a good reconstruction.
