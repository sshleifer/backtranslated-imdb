I agree that Roger Corman did not expect much from the movie. Basically, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Ganslinglis is the story of a woman taken by sheriff (spunky beverly garland) after her husband's assassination. Ms. Garland was pretty good shot by killing one of the murderers the next day for her husband's funeral. Her first work was to close the local bar that violates urban curfew. The owner of the bar (for the aspiration) is trying to buy land by anticipation of buying through the railroad. However, Ms. Garland appoints a man in her plans and a man to kill Barr Madron Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Her role as Mrs. Garland's character is sincere and realistic, to go to Suzanne Somers "Shiris the Sheriff" Jokes. The film is quite acceptable as the film's film, except for Fox Pace (an apartment door that opens inward, jeep tracks, and two horse rubs waiting for a corner of their corner). <br /> <br /> However, as he did in other films, Carmen could not paddle his portrait with horse riding scenes. <br /> As Sterno says Gunslinger is your time valuable horse opera.
