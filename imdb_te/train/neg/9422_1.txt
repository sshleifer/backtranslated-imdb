The film describes the experiences of two successful men (such as Burt Reynolds), a prostitute, and two drag queens for a few hours in a night in Miami. Conversation storylines eventually combine all people in one place and at times. The film is a little entertaining, but the big problem is that everything has happened overnight and most scenes are literally dying, and it's impossible to see what's going on. In some scenes, you can really see when trying to "stretch" the progressive process to preserve images. Some people do not know how to work on the camera. This film is also released!
