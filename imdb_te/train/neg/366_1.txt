Bad actors, bad filming, choppy dialogue, shallow characters, but again it is the evil mantle in the first place. Initially, an 11-year-old is suffering from very little money because she is paying a bad criminal criminal check. In fact, at the age of 11, it has enough technology and intelligence to buy a home, pays up to 1,000,000 dollars and can even trigger three idiots that bring back three stooges. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is a bored, bad guy, boy, when he writes a blank check through a complete stranger, he takes advantage of the situation as best as possible. In other words, he goes to the bank. <br /> <br /> In his printer he makes a check, and goes out with a million bucks in cash. Preston also has the ability to achieve unbelievable speeds on his bicycle, even after Preston and his 10-speed driving a jaguar managed to prevent him from breaking the Preston cars respectively. Of course, with the image of each hockey adventure, it must be the hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine abuses the FBI agent who is running Preston at the age of eight and promises another date when he is 17. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the absolute worst factor in the film, or its catless dialogue, "It's the only way to think about combining a cat, it's a tape, and then chooses a fur". In addition to that, the entire film was completed to realize that the FBI was not bad about Random people. I can not explain Preston is using a "Macintosh" alias, nicknamed as a different businessman. In fact, the FBI detects this hobby and Preston then sends his young hero, who when he is 11 when he falls on his face at his face, then treats her with the hamburgers, watering the soil from a stable area. Our heroine killed the FBI criminals during this whole adventure and made the Preston's car on their way, to finish with 1-dimensional driver, the cheapest, 3rd rate. <br/> Over 1/10 of the film is very beautiful. It seems to me that it's only 4.4 / 10.
