I did not enjoy this movie. Acting is not very good and the story is boring. Will 20-year old old computer be saved per day? I thought it was a bit too far away for an image. <br /> <br /> Before that, what was actually distributed. This film may not be the 21st century version of the old film. If you'd like to see, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer is not changed to save the day, it is still quite cheesy flick in my opinion.
