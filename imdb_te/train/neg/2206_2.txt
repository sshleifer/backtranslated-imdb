The scientist is suffering from an island on an island about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: Why do my dead son turn into a Hammer Head Shark. Well, who's not? The Hammer Head Shark, which murders everybody, is constantly called "Paul". In addition, actors are not as loyal as William Forrest's maggie-kick-ass-saving theater hero. On the other hand, there are some hot chicks on the screen that kill Shark Pal. In fact I find bad movies are very amusing. But for my taste it would have been a good image if it made to say 1000000 bucks low. Then it may be fun.
