I saw "The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare" BBC series, the first of which, if they were all, I can not see it yet. The full text of the practical drama is that this "Romeo & Juliet" is in all other categories. Alvin Rocoff reveals himself as a terrible director in technical and artistic matters. In the former, because he is also a first grade film student, he is also making wisely avoid mistakes. For example, in the opening scene, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Baltasar, or the entry of nurse in Fiorier Lawrence's cell, is where she is in front of her where she is blind, if she is blind. And, in the meantime, performers mislead each other because some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks like I've always dreamed to be like Juliet, and she does not seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but she does not have any kind of passion for her appearance. Patrick Rickert was also bad in the role of Romeo, not just as disappointing as Juliet, but also as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and Chucky's figures that were too old and not good. It is impossible to think of what they feel to feel for each other, the only major players of any great love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, played the role of Timbalad if he was Darth Vader, a huge flaw in which Shakespeare's intent was removed, which hero or villain, but all the wrong people. This tybolt means that we do not believe in the characters after his death. For Paris, I thought of "Prince Valium" from spaceballs. <br /> <br /> In 168 minutes, this product can not give us sympathy with characters because the characters are not different from each other and are believed to have their own roles forever. The best screen version is still Franco Jaffery. But, to be fair, this BBC is not as grossly offensive as George Cooker's gross aging reform, or crime against Humanity, the bass-lenient MTV video of Baz Luhrmann. 4/10.
