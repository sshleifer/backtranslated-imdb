Not a film from acts of British invasion, but Lip has a collection of contemporary performances that followed Beatles's dynamic entry to the music world. Some of these actions did not make a big splash at this side of the pond, but there are many. Hermits of Hermann, Billy J. Kramer and Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and The Beatles, The Beatles. <br /> <br /> These young actions have improved their work.
