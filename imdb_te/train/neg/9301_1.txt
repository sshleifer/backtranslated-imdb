<br /> <br /> I would recommend this film so people can really see 1/10. <br /> <br /> Story: Do not Believe in Credibility - There's nothing to do with film banned cars and people will understand what happened in secret. <br /> <br /> Give credit to the heroes of this film, but when you start it will work hard ... But it's the worst. The story is flat - it leaves you the whole movie without emotion. Conversation is very weak and predictable speech lines "Woah, you're totally free" and "I'm wondering if you like it if you like it .. Would you come to the cabin with me?" <br /> <br /> "Some of the colors are described flatly and I want to take it one step further and they actually do not bend the reverse character." They actually start working in a parallel universe and start acting almost backwards ... <br /> Actors: Characters actors than characters They are already taking poor writing letters and terrible highs <br /> <br /> Technical: Lighting: Eight years of age will be disappointed with the film, many shadows in many areas, among others Even if the director correctly performs an initial scene as an emotion Sound: Sounds: How many sound guys do you take to sound a noisy sound? 9. Many sound guys have this amazing sound but quite the opposite, a scene is really sticky, these people are driving in a car and in every camera angle the car changes noise .... WEAK! Camera: Learn to use it. <br /> Anyway, I'm out of the complaint ... it's rented - I'm dignified ... give it a rent and learn from it ... <br /> <br /> Amanda Christmas
