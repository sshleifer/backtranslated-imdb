Not your usual vampire story, where bram Stoker or Anne is not rice. The true original Vampire story. These vampires can have a genetic mutation that suffers sunlight. They are pure cheats. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. Many actors are obviously enthusiastic. Van Helsing and the vampyre chick rally are pretty good while playing two leads. The film is very violent, which can disturb some people. Moreover, it is loaded with scientific information, many people struggle hard and get frustrated. I sold the brilliant storyline and the best performances of the couple. If they have a big budget then it does not tell how this film will succeed
