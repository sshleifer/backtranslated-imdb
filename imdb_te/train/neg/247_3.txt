It was last night at my friend's camping trailer at 9:30 PM and we were hype to see South Park (a new episode). The matter was broadcast at 10:30 PM at South Park, in my country and we decided to kill time by looking at now broadcasting the father of pride. I'll start by saying that I've seen episodes only. For the first time I saw it, I know it's unhealthy and nothing, so I'm "holy she's, tomorrow's tomorrow football game, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons". But yesterday, I tried to give Pride's father a second chance. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the complete synths were broken, but instead replaced the yellow man characters by the lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing is that I wonder why it is available for a TV-14 rating. I found The Simpsons to be very unpleasant, and the real obscenity in this program is some homosexuals (unexpected) jokes. The Simpsons are also very violent (Halloween specialties) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series was also directed by Shrek 2, well I got news for him: Shrek 2 is way better and I think he's staying in the background of the family. However, Pride's father did not smile me three or four times (once he laughed). <br /> <br /> For all, I do not mind the father of pride. I hate it, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you do not know what to do,
