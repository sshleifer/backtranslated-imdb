I do not imagine being a horror film at the same level in a Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I'm still so enjoyable to watch. However, it is not pleasing, but acting and simple film 'rare killer' all the people who kill the victims and kill all the young bland women. This is a stereotypical horror film. <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women and a majority are killed in the accident. 2) is beside the killer, in the dark. 3) Surprise Surprise, Help Shotgun Shape! <br /> <br /> By using three simple points, I've saved two odd hours by capturing this poor consent of the horror movie, so you do not have to lucky now.
