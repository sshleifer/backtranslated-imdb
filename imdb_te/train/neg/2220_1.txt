Which of your minds is hell? This movie sucks! Every minute I am more bored. I hope to see it at the end because I will do the last thing! But instead, I was amazed at how much irritating it was ... what is this story about this bloody "bogeyman"? How will he die? He is a bloody man for God! 15 years ago was just a boy who killed his crazy sister. What is that? Was he immortalized when he was in a psychiatric hospital? This film is appealing stupid ... it must be of silliness. I'm gonna have to sell it to some silly guy who understand this crazy movie.
