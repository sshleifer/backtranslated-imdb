I caught this catch a few months ago at Family Channel, and I had some memories of the TV show from my youth, which decided to go with my 4 year old daughter. I should have a few psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'It's just a bizarre cause! It is made up of some of the most memorable travels, with songs that are preemptive to their collective integrations, along with the most memorable tones, requisite cutting effects and caimos. This type of garbage is very young for British children to speak ... in the words of Krusty the Clown "Yuenuegghghhah! What am I?" If you're a huge fan of All Sid and Marty Kroft O'Connor, go for it; Otherwise, if you do not like to loop before you see, stay away from it.
