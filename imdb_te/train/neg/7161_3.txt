A young American woman visits her Irish origin and leaves a druid witch with her. After a very interesting but interesting start, I missed out and spent a lot of time going. The film seems to be wiped out in both directions - is watching a horror film about a nasty witch who has seen the suffering of an Irish-American woman who is facing alcohol or is she returning from the past? The director did not decide. Two gel does not appear and in the end you get somewhere. This can work very well and the drag at the end of the story appeared. It's very boring and frustrating.
