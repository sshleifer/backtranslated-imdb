Immediately, the film is funnier. Is not it something that can not be redeemed? For example, the best about this film is a beautiful background view. Anyone living on the east coast does not have beautiful mountains in the south. I know that Uta was right from the bat, but perhaps Dalton refused to overpower his English pronunciation, so they deny this southern town. It is easy to change his voice to the south. Definitely the image plot holds the turns, but its deceptive sense of space is something I can not get past. It's not because Utah has spit labs ... so I thought why the writers believe me acting south. <br /> <br /> Another issue of action pictures is me ever puzzles. Why do they always have a "cocking" sound effect when the character pulls the automatic handgun? This is the sound effect of each other in the movie 9 mm. Loaded up and looked like a "Chuck-chitch" ready to shoot. In fact, these weapons are not necessarily unnecessary. <br /> Finally, the fireworks are over the top. But hey, suppose this film is aimed at a particular 'market segment' ... it's very bad. Each actors can work, but this film is dull.
