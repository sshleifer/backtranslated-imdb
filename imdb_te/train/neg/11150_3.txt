I'm alone in the film, it's a full moon! I did not do it deliberately, it was done. So there's everything to frighten hell along with me for this film! Well, actually, I wanted to close the DVD player after 8 minutes, but unfortunately I did when I gave the opportunity to expect. Acting is awful, there is only Samaire Armstrong for some good performance. If you're a horror fan, the plot is not real, and you've seen it many times. Some scenes do not make sense of everything and get the feel of the director watching the movie! The monster is the biggest disappointment of the film. From the 80s they were horrific (scary) scenes from the absence of sufficient technology, and some good films were later made! I was amazed at the beginning of the film by a big production company, I thought I could put some money on this and do not do it right? !! I agree with the cinematic ratings, which is my rating of 10 to 3.
