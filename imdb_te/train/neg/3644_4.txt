This film is very poor. Acting is endless and totally compulsory. Moreover, by portraying it as a document it is not reliable, it can not easily remove Mr. Dir. I would recommend that I look at these pictures because some light on the psychology or non-existent psychology behind such crimes has been lightened. However, the film climax is completely worse! There is no other way to put it! It was pure and just failed to catch any sense of the atmosphere! What does not translate into any feelings of frustration, fear, fear or fear that horrific situations are a sure feel. Instead of being jaw dropping, do you give up? You are not hiding from your tongue, and you chase through the actions of these boys. Apart from that you just feel embarrassed for another movie that started the potential, but the most crucial point is out of the flat falling on its face. Zero Day is actually .... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
