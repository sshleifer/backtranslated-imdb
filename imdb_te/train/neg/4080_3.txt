It's one of those films that we think we like, but I did not. It seemed to be very difficult to say 'no'. Total flash without content. It has some beautiful scenes and any of them is good, but if you mix them all, it's a difficult task to sit through. I was burned in the video carton, and rented the fact that I was a big Shakespeare fan, but I was very disappointed. I found a bit pretentious and, at times, boring.
