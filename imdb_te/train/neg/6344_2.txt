After a half an hour I went out of a Woody Allen film (I learned about moral weakness that I had commented on more than half a movie, but I hope you understand why). Initially, it was very clear from what we were going to play on the screen: a script showing its sense of bullet points; Hanna and Her Sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevig) are a cast trying to make characters, and are badly directed to do this; And a camera sitting around the photograph is not just for the non-film chat and the actor. Drama? none; This is partially anticipated, but this action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> In this case, I gave up a lot of time, but by then I had another one-and-a-half-year-allen clone. Is the script its funny moments ?? I've gone almost entirely behind the creativity of Will Ferrell in the trailer (trailer-hooked, do not!) ?? But better, there is little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly. Not worse than that. The wooden image of the film says a jelly-like forest appearance: Opening Cafe-Bound Talk is a very unpleasant case-in-point. The only thing that can be done by numbers is pocketed into the consideration? 2/10.
