Where to start The film is very good, but 30 minutes later I saw the clock. At the beginning of the film, the scary was good but later he kicked the story. It was a staple of time and intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vinny Jones is bored of the film that is constantly laughing. <br /> <br /> If you dragged the picture and took my seat for it, it just pulled, it just got a long way. <br /> * Spoiler Alert *** Spoiler Alert *** I just could not understand it if I thought the movie could not get any worse towards the end load, if the monsters turned up the slippery looking-up looking skeleton to eat dead people. It has become some sort of eating meat and good guys die at the end. It's actually ending me laughing at how bad it is. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the film is made up of Creep's best horror film. I thought the lady was doing a good job, but I could not save the train in this film.
