Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just around this terrible movie brings this piece of junk. It is by sitting and excruciating. Just awful. Do not put a penny on this. The film is bad for people to get out of the movie theaters. This "horror" film is at least bit horrific, creepy or upset. It's not appealing. This acting is so terrible for all the actors that any attempt to get into the film through the dialog is completely lost in opening up the actors / actress's notes. Plus the whole story, I do not know who else is going to make a movie with this story. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, it does not waste a moment of watching this movie. You have to feel Dumbler for looking at it.
