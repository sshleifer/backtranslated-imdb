I can not say much about this film. This may be a wonderful tour-force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic missions in film history. Sellers final picture makes it more painful. <br /> <br /> Terrified screenplays, directing and surprisingly wooden shows have been pretty drawn to become one of the most scary movies ever made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know how much I can bury a skunker or shirt with some smoke, but this is a lifeless, humorous catastrophe. The truth hurts. <br /> Peter, why can not you be there?
