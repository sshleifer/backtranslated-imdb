One person is killed in a college hall with a horn. His girlfriend Beth (Dory Barton) finds him and attempts to commit suicide. She is institutionalized. A year later she is out there, a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and Spring Break with Hank, and four more mindless friends in a large, beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally killer popup (without cause) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller - A textbook that does not make a low budget horror film. For starters, the larger parts of the film are complementary to these six idiots, "pleasant" (more fun than the audience), drunk, and quick running. And there is no nudity here too. I do not think I need the horror movie nudity but that's something that has not been helped. No deaths are really shown (you are listening to them, a little bloody and not gore). <br /> <br /> Acting with some exceptions is successful. Dory Barton is terrific because she is the lousse of the lead female and Tom Jay Jones Oz. Chad is Allen Broad and he is Terrible. Lawrence is actually very good - beautiful and handy and his tears to him. <br /> <br /> The logical failures were extended - after learning that two friends were talking about sexual relations for a friend; What happens to Boston's reaction to the funny type and Laurence for seeing a killer friend? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Thick, stupid, no gore, nudity - skip this one.
