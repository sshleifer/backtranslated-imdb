Since 99.99% of the people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, the language of this website is with the English language. <br /> This film cr *. Bad acting I've seen for a loooong time. The kids are terrible. Especially boy. This is the first time a person with a lesser face than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a voice tone, which is read before a 5-year-old boy. How bad is a film's main actor? The storyline was so deep that my daughter could do well (she was 3 years old). <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for anyone to enjoy the film: 1) Teen before you; 2) You are well thought out of the globes of the globe that you think is any wonder that you have a globe seal; 3) You have severe brain damage. <br /> Avoid all costs! Brazilian film scene is a shame.
