The old mummy's spirit is transferred to one of his followers, so that he punishes everyone involved in the deception of his grave. Self-transfering young man ages at mammoth speeds up to his own mommy. <br /> As far as possible, the Pharaoh's Curse is very poor. The film's definition of some good, original ideas (blood sucking mommy, soul transfer, interesting makeup effects, hand-scene etc.) and certain weather conditions, direction and speed are the definition of pladding. To make matters worse, the first 15-minute runtime of the film's shortest 66-minute runtime was not more than padding. I usually go to these slow mime movies, but Pharaoh's curse also examines my patients. The cast is very small. With only one exception (the Quiw Radon is a lone bright spot, the film is more focused on her suspicious role), the cast is discouraging as a screenplay. Finally, I do not know who the idea is to be a mummy-seen servant who looks like pygmus, but it's a ludicrous, ridiculous one for a creature to frighten audiences. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments on the Curse of Pharaoh, I'm going to rate a 4/10. A good rating is not perfect, but I'm generous with all the problems with the movie.
