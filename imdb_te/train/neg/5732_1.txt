I'm all for a "bad" horror movie! But this is a heap of dog sh! T! How can anyone call this movie cool or good? If you'd like to edit special effects, bad acting and bad script, then go for it! It does not have any suspense and the gore factor is ridiculous because it's a hoax. I'll make a hostel or wolf creek on this day. My partner left after about 20 minutes, when she saw one she knew a stinker. On the other hand I look at you, look at any movie and look at me and sit idle by the whole movie. No such luck! I'm not his other movie tarcord and I think it's upset now.
