I hate this movie. It's also not too funny, poor, poor, pathetic acting, REAL REAL REAL STULED criminals are also not too late (not quite as good as the first 2 home alone movies). All boobie loops are weak, because their Pecheque 20 bucks did not go over for a week because people just writing this movie meant that people were just lazy, there were patricary excuses for copies of the first two. This image is definitely lousy, it's not worth renting. It is actually t.v. Not even seen! Use your eyes as a more useful way of seeing the first two times! I give 1 star (in 10). Trust me when I say, if you liked the first two, and you're not a full stupid person, you do not like this movie, do not look at this movie!
