Boring, predictable, at least the horror outing of the numbers is at least pretty good for special effects and plenty of (vacuum) turbulence and gore (void) genre fans. Most likely it's about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we do not care about a ioda about - if your thing, tune in (* 1/2)
