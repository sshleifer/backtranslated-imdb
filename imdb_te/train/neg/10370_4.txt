I'm really sorry for every second when I'm seeing this movie. Unfortunately, once I started watching, I removed the movie from time to time. Especially when it's a classic or what people call a classic call. I think it's one of those movies when I see the lover of every movie at least once, so I see. Do not make me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Baucal and actors, but this film is a big fraud in my opinion. Not really good plot, a spy movie or a romantic love story. Well, not a reliable blend of these two genres. The cause of the tension is that the 'bogey' and bakal are unlikely to be together at one end or the other. I think "There's And Not Included" is too overtreat and Bogart has many good films during the 1940s.
