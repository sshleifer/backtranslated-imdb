The Earth's center of Journey is a few tourists of Hi, three of them sibling, and one of them running a young British nanny dog. When siblings accidentally navigate their jeep with dogs' biscuits, the nanny all the way to the cave (I guess) to explore the cave (which is a bit safer) when they follow them. For some reason they walk in the cave, and no one is able to get it, except for a six-year-old sister who is going to get help when it starts. Meanwhile, the more they move around in the cave, the more they continue to plummet more and more towards the Cavernus core of the lands. The city of Atlantis and its eccentric aliens find those who live in a regime that is oppressed by a foreigner who does not want to ask many questions about their own external worlds. <br /> I see Rusty Lemorande, the naming director of the film, that he has provided commentary on the film, in which he explains that the second half of the film is continuing in LA Well. Slightly higher than the much smaller city limits (1988 psychedelic film is also made in the budget that does not exist). Eventually, in 20 minutes, some comedy and entertainment are aimed at, and we will eventually see it as in the world of the alien world. It's fun in any of its sensitive subjects, because I also gave a rating of two stars. For example, the aliens ask the British girl to be a foreigner and that the ministry will soon send her work visa. Or when the alien girl Bryan finds and explains that he is in the city of Altantis and he makes mistakes to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Small things like that make the inertia of the first hour or so reasonable. <br /> If they really intend to do it, and 2) actually earn money, imagine how big it is. <br /> In the end, what happened to a younger sister who sent away at the beginning to get help? She just wandered around the Hawaiian caves and ran away from the volcano erupting too far, I think you should keep in mind.
