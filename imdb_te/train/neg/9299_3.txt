When I saw this movie, I tried to figure out why they did not make it. Although the film's main storyline is good, there are all unrelated / unwanted subtitles. Marketing people in Hollywood should have multiple bad guys, permanent double-crossed and man and woman who get too close and sex to get sex. It's odd to see we have more sex than we're president and his mistress. Many of the plots and sublists are very extensive and none of the characters have been properly developed - I know what role I am, except for all corruption and evil. The conclusion is complete incomplete - leaving me more than just wanting what might be, but what to do. Finally, there is no explanation for what they will do, not just the extra corrupt characters that do not double-cross. I was surprised that many (and good) actors agreed to do such an empty image. It was a film created by college students working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> You do not have to waste your time when you're in the series of films, making a movie.
