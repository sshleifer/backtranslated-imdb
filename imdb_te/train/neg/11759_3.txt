For those who are looking for a sequel for the best South African nineties of the 1980s, this is not. It's not a historical play. There is nothing but a historic shack, but only the name of the Sinitic's idiot uses his name to give a specific ammunition about an African superhero of Jesus name, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. <br /> On the other hand, there are some laughs-loud moments, as he is bound to Shaka and kicks some serious thin butt. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have only seen a 98-minute edition, but I can not imagine two times as much as this trash. <br /> What is the name of Mango?
