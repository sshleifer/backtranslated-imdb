The pilgrimage headed by Hanky ​​Captain Storm (Mark Dana) goes to see what happened to the valley in the Valley in Cairo. They meet the beautiful mysterious Siri (Jiva Radne) whom they met. <br /> They are experiencing mummy as soon as they drink blood ... and Simra will know what has happened. <br /> The real snooser. I took this night to tonight at night when I was about 10 years old. I can see why after years of looking again. It moves slowly, mummy shows up to 40 minutes (and only 66 minutes), acting from bad (dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neice) and found no violence or blood. <br /> <br /> The film is very good for all three stars because everyone has a direct acting career, a good acting from Dianne Brewster, which is small and mummy assault scenes (three of them) are not bad. Just a little creepy they are not just scary. Still, this movie is very bad. A precise fire prevention for insomnia
