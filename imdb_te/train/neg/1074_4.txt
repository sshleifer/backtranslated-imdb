I should never have started this movie, and stopped watching after 3/4. I really missed the end result. This is very good because the film is disappointing. It has good weather, a top-notch cast and director, has good places. But a baaaaaad story line, a bad script. I took care of Kenneth Branagh's southern slang - it's better than the script. The plot is driven by acting characters in stupid - dubious and incomprehensible ways. Nobody behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts.
