The only thing I like about this film is that it's just enough to keep me in my seat ... I kept thinking that the NEXT scene was gel things ... Oops ... <br /> <br /> Gus Van Sant's movies - especially with his next - probably preferred. Personally, I'm Van Mant's movies dull, majestic and easy. He has acted as an executive producer for the film, so it is not surprising that the film can be done by him - personally, it is actually better than Von Sant's latest efforts (eg, Elephant). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " appear. But the problem with the movie "mood" is not enough ... and not only, but the mood is painted here, chosen for my mind and the wrong story. The nature of the nature of the nature associated with nature, beautifully captured here, but is very small for children, it is really caught up in nature (waves on the beach, grass and flowers, spiders etc). The summer's rhythm reminds me of my summer when my eight or nine is about. There is a LANGUOR for the opposite of the hard work of teenage life. When you are trapped in a crush on someone - or being a bullying object at school - you are anything but tedious! There are only two moments that really work for me in the film ... SPOILERS HERE - First Logan drops groceries and his mother throws a bit of a healthy one. <br /> <br /> "The second, Leah" (creating Logan's own) phones come to him in rodeo and phone sex tries. The voice-over of "Lee" is the most persuasive actor in the whole movie because the first reason I like it. (It's about Claire Danes from my so-called Life ... voice is also a claire). She and the Rodeo kids have only one of the most spectacular scenes. And the fact that I'm playing along with playing the rodeo is the only fact that is playing ... it's probably the best moment in the film - and finally! <br /> <br /> Some of us are working harder than anything else ... Let's see what we will do in the next film before we really tell about the possible talent of the director. At this time, if he is away from Van Sant's influence, it will make him a better world. However, who is this director - is one of Van Tchun's toys?
