The film is not appropriate for the next few minutes I will be criticizing, but I know that many people are helping to make movies on IMDb.com. <br /> <br /> "Live feed" is like the Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (all of the "blood skiing freaks"). Http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, slicing pieces, murder, cannibalism ... It is here, along with a third-grade script, curiosity, and a disadvantage of black comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film is China, and all speak English. The girls in the picture scared by butchering the dogs in the market is quite abundant, yet the sexy parlor parlor is sexually happy about entering. At a restroom shop, it is still with her friends after a song that has been wounded in some restless shops (how it may be the only engaging thing about this film). For a B-image. If you download it free of charge, it will be a disaster for your hard drive.
