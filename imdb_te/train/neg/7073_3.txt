We have an average family. Father is the famous rapper, we have "rebellious young man", adopted white colt, and cute little kid. And we have a careless housewife, what kind of housewife is there in this program? Do we have a confunding Brady Bunch? Yes! When I first came, I thought I was really cool, and I was young. The music is bad. The raps are so bad and they are very ga-rated. His raps are all about his family and friends and problems. The kind of father is the kind of father of the "full house from Danny". Always advised. But he is not pure. They have a house keeper. Remember? The plot is primarily Lil 'Romeo in some ways trouble, or ... it's not. Oh and maybe some predefined play. That's fine. Not really. But still a good show for children. But Nickelodeon could do well.
