I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstacker III" and liked the movie - I decided to see the whole range of "Deathstacker" films - "even". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Very sickness and nudity. I was a very cleaner product as "DS 3" or MST3K was really correct, because I guess something like stupid and negligent and simplistic. I made a mistake. Even $ 6.99 it seemed to be a waste of money. I did not open "DS 2", I'll send it back tomorrow. I will not come back now I'll throw this DVD away and no one wants it - including me! So really, this one does not bother. Even nudity (which too, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
