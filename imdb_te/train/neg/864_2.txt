Despite having a film of more than 180 films to choose from, the 'Suskabas' is often named as the best Jess Franco film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang calculates 'sukabas' between his personal favorite. So, maybe it's me but I thought this was a terribly boring and overly confusing film. The opening is great, however, the Janeine Reynat displays an SM action on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately. The role of Renanad, her lovers eventually kills some sort of trance. It has a good budget to work with Franco and has spent a lot of nice places, beautiful photography and mesmerizing musical scores. Although it is not for lame and uninteresting story, this is his greatest film. It's called psychedelic but I'd say a good word to explain what sophomoric has shown here. Half of the time, you do not have a clue exactly what exactly is going on or what the 80-minute short running time seems to be the last age. This is not exactly the best film of Franco. I can not even recommend it to fans of hard exploitation to die. If you're looking for a superior Jess Franco movie, try to get your hands on 'Los Vampirus', 'The Awful Doctor Orloff' or 'Bride Vampire.'
