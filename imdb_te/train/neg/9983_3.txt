This film is a huge Yen that proves that Americans are not able to get too hollow. It's already written to them! The original film "Haddet Over Wannet" is the intriguing comedy of the bugs I've rated 8/10. It's not about a language translation, but some of the absurd chains completely overwritten, stolen the image of its original intellectual nature and cheaply "shifting my pants there" style.
