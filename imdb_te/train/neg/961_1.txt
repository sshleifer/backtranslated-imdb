<br /> <br /> This short (sixty minute) story is not inspired by many classic spaghetti Westerns. (Shortened by 1: from a woman) that brought Sam Raimi's The Quik & the Dead (his spaghetti respect for Western senses) into a contemporary setting. In Quick & Dead, Sharon Stone's character Dastdale Sheriff (played by Genie Hackman) reacts to her father (a brief comic by Gary Sinise) when she is a yacht; She accidentally shot him over the head. In gun crazy, Saki (a miniature Rioco Yonekura) dostarli retaliates against Mr. Thozo (played with a slight appeal by Shingo), when she was a urchin she placed her father's fate in his hands; She separated her step from the clutch, and the beloved Ole's father was drawn and quartered by semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadistically Saki with Sripples ?? <br /> If you decide to see it, I will not spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> Small, cookie ?? A light simulator of Clint Eastwood's 'Non With Name Name'. Are you going into town? Primarily, there is an auto shop and a dining room with an American military base, so am I satisfied for a town? Damaged by the dungeon, the local culprit explained or did not exploit the ridiculously high price on his head. As a bounty hunter, he takes up local guns in the Saki shootout, admitting his true soul, and plays comparisons to Johnny Two and John Wu's works. Of course, the film finally endured her fair amount of violence in the hands of the bad guys, but did she get up on the occasion? On her knees, in a ridiculous endeavor of a surprising ending ?? <br /> <br /> Do not ask where she gets her rocket launcher. See it for yourself. <br /> Do not laugh. <br /> Film quality average for DVD quality. Many scenes have the maximum quality, but, for all, this is not a bad transfer. The sound quality sometimes goes to town, but again, it's not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> However, this is a bad image.
