If you're one of those people who find great television comedy "according to Jim", this will rock your world. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a large, steaming, brown, german, to prove that you are really good talent, good writing and attractive star on any network other than ABC, The shepherd's size was said to be "thanks" for the intellectuals of the first film. It is definitely worth the fans of that movie and less Belushi. The selection of jim's jazz chaps and projects is never behind the blues standard of the blues standard. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the work of the gym then this is your reward.
