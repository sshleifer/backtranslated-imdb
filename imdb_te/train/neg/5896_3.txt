One miss call, another Asian horror based on cell phone. I recently hired Korean Korean film based on a cell phone called "pon". A missed call is just a boring. Perhaps phones are not just scary or something, but this action is dull and brown. There are no tensions or thrills for me, the ultimate monster is unsatisfying cheesy and kind. The film is slightly different in different areas, and is considered too long. I do not have my attention. It's hard for phones to be frightening, it's kind of like pop vending machine trying to make it strange. And it's ridiculous to compare with the "ring", which seems to be compared to every Asian horror film and so far I have not seen that measure at least. Horror Directors - Hook off the phone as a horror device.
