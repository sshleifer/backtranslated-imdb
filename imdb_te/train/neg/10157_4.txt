Slashers ..... If you want to see how scary you are not sure, otherwise you will not even bother. It is clear that the movie has a very low budget, for example the whole picture is a warehouse, and in many cases you'll see the Mike Boom shadow and camera man's shadow, you trust me do not need to look at them.Also, if you know what they call, cheerleaders try to ignore! Basic Shape Some people decide to take part in a game that survives a night in a large rodent, with 3 killers who are ultimately loose and alive in those who live. Now you keep looking at this film and rarely do not find that you have a cheap budget horror these days, when I watched the example I thought my self would'nt mind I had a go at this game! Especially $ 12.000.000. So whatsoever I would like to see you and make your own mind.
