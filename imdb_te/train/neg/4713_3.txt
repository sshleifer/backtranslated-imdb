You think my rating and my review of this review I do not like Johnny Test. I've been watching the film and animation, and this is just a '<br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first because it's me One of the chaotic things I have seen. The first two seasons or the first season was handmade animation. <br /> <br /> It is a good performance. I thought it was a good animation when it was hand drawn. <br /> <br /> If you have a strike in my eyes, watch the show story. Dexter is very difficult to be like a laboratory, but there are differences because both red and two instead of a red-led scientist. There is a spoken dog (why?), And parental attitudes are somewhat altered. I have others but I do not think I'll write them here (I'm not cursed, I do not know if the limit of the words). Moreover, Daddy's character is Johnny himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It 's a good idea to be a decker but it seems like a heartless macaque. Finally I want to talk about jokes. Dexters remember some of the joke to remember in the laboratory? Yes, the joke is good for a joke or two but Dexter's lab has made foolish comments that checked me to go back and get joke. Johnny Test forgets all the time and the time is 50% and the music stops whenever a stupid joke or a liner appears. It's not ridiculous, it's a stupid comedy (I've thought of some, not three stupgies stupid comedy? And that's the Johnny Test back and you'll be surprised at first). Sometimes jokes are based on unpleasant situations, like a chowder that makes me mad. <br /> <br /> I've had a formula for all cartoons and comedians: not very bizarre comedy, "what am I seeing?" You can think of it. <br /> It will attack all accounts. However, if you have any respect for comedy in the shape or form, do not look at this presentation.
