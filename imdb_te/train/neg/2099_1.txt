<br /> With the incomplete dramatic voice that begins with the incomplete dramatic voice is nonsense, it is nonsense and unnecessary drama. It's unfortunate but definitely sure. <br /> <br /> Space travel is a dangerous company. Neglect, radiation, stress-related properties, etc. There is a very complex system, and unexpected things happen in most unknown environments. They know that the matter is wrong. In fact, the stuff went wrong. It is called learning. Granted, Apollo 11 is not secure by today's standards and has immense political pressure, but the technique of the mission is impressive. <br /> <br /> If I did something wrong, Nixon prepared a speech. Well duh. That's what I did. <br /> <br /> 2) Although the fact that Apollo 11 is likely to blow up, NASA will give the green light. <br /> <br /> The cartridge ejection does not work. It's a chimp as it does not work time. Is alive It tested the test and the rocket exploded, speeding up the capsule and landing with the parachute. It's a video, you can probably find it on YouTube or at least see it anywhere <br /> <br /> 4) An explosion by an individual said that a blast was a fair part of Florida. <br /> <br /> 5) Technologies were the Adivasis compared to today's standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware are still being used today, which should not be crashed. It is even worse for radiation, because their computers must be constructed with large comparable components that do not necessarily have radiation. (And craft may be manually pilotable, so no complicated steering system like B2 can.) What is the fact that they are using "TV screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. <br /> <br /> 6) "If the object is not a part of the rocket, it can only be one thing." We'll see where it's going. Who says that this statement is not a rocket piece, rather than a fact? <br /> If the voice-over is made of some side effects, the radiation foil of the Lander actually looks like its hull. <br /> <br /> 8) Near the time of Neil Armstrong's Practice Flight I can congratulate the footage; I did not see it before. As I mentioned, if any part of the manifest technology can be misinterpreted, especially if it's unprecedented, it is not adequately tested. <br /> <br /> 9) The difference in the trajectory of the descending land is the inequality in the Moon's density). <br /> <br /> "Fifteen seconds of fuel is left", actually "canceling the mission and leaving fifteen seconds to go back to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10) The "chain of disaster events" usually end in disaster. I really do not know what to put it simpler. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a small scene in which one of the astronauts is aimed at a walk and an active kid, after which the voice-over says the reason for this strange behavior is "exposed". As he turns out, he was walking and hopping around without aiming like a gleeful kid. <br /> <br /> 12) During the re-entry, all contacts have been lost. It's a perfect natural phenomenon and it's still known to be away from contemporary technology. <br /> <br /> The shuttle is not lost in the space, but Apollo 11 is the voice of this fact. Worst pile. Apollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real disasters took place during the death and re-entry respectively. However, Saturn racquets are comparable to shuttles ... well, okay, plain stupid. <br /> <br /> What is hell with UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> For entertainment purposes it is somewhat unclear for a particular audience (including the people next to understanding science, rhetoric or rhetoric). Catch-funny "is now covered", "the first time publicly disclosed", to come up, but the film does not make any allegation or provide a lesson or anything, and so feelings. In a good old tradition of sensationalism, in many cases there are interactive shots and recording sounds, we do not know anything or "NASA scientist" with people. Wow, so astronauts are too nervous before attempting? That fancy. What to do with the point of the film again? Oh, no point. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is not a good entertainment, either with willful or inappropriate inadequate determination. And believe me, I'm a person who enjoys his crappy documentaries; This film is not funny, witty, quaint, it's nothing.
