If you are mental illness or a hard seal fan that many people die, you will have a horrific tire for this movie within 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Plot - Seagal is also plot stupid. <br /> Acting - unbelievable wood. Very good acting in porno. Ironically, the film tries to make money on the audience, a 'lesbian love scene' that is absolutely horrific. <br /> <br /> Special effects - 60 will not appear in the image of knife and witchcraft. <br /> <br /> If you are suffering from insomnia and all other remedies, do not make the same mistake I made and if you do not buy this DVD, that hour and half of your life.
