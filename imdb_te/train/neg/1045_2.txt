The increase of Victor Vargas is a terrific failure that makes a lot of effort: the real one. Unfortunately, the film does not have a reality. Characters and conditions are completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> Directed by Bad. Peter Sollette uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. This is not a somewhat unreadable movie by Mr. Sollette, which gives his film a classic feel. Wrong! It's just a bad feeling. Similarly, the shivering of the camera does not give you a documentary style for your films, giving the audience a headache, and instead of improving what's on the screen. <br /> <br /> In fact, the duplicate, Mr. Solettt wrote with a single goal of trying his script to see his Sundance buddies as "hip" and showed how much he was a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Overall, the permanent seal only leads you to mislead Mister Solet. Next time, how about some writing and direction classes?
