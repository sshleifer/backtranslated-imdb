Who is the main complaint with this film? No racism is intended, but these asians see the same! I can tell you some story, but it's heck until it's gone. People's idioms are not mysteries, if they're mystery, I'll take care about them. <br /> I'm not from the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> The tons of widespread scenes and silent emotional faces occupy the film. Heck it is boring, I do not know these people, but they are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> Generic Chinese John Woo, producing terrible video with blotched scenes. Andy Lau's "Full Time Killer" (which is a great movie?) Seems to be a bit better than that. You can think of a good budget that they can make at least 90 Hollywood appearances. I do not know that the Chinese have beaten art.
