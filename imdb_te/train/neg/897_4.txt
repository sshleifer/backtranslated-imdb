Two years before "Arthur" was written and directed, Steve Gordon made Henry Winkler, then TV's "The Fanage", a small hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedy vehicle. The 1950s college tribe (and the whole-neighborhood) marries a co-ed and marriage without job opportunities on the horizon; When he ends, he transforms into an attractive world of wrestling, eventually known as "Gorgeous George". Changing the winkler there is a alarmed Gobb-off (a perfect way to separate from his television alter-ego at the time), but jokes and situations are often mistaken-headed and understood. Director Karl Rainier. Float Henry's beloved from the "Alice", Kim Darby is a little bit away from his element - especially when the TV is surrounded by hams - the sex of the script is unlikely. **** from Crooded Herveyville ("Fantasy Island") * 1/2
