Violence is either true or not always affected. The torture in this film is like the cross. In the Great Ecstasy, the director has successfully demonstrated how the success of the violence of the people has succeeded. But what's the point? Violence is 'Iverworthable' of Nois 'and' Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange' as a blend of ... Both great images. Do not make me wrong, I do not oppose violence at all and I have seen some nasty things in my film-years, but this film is all over. This story has never developed to give any reasons for serious violence, the introduction of drugs to the rizla paper we give Robert's death. Danny Dyer plays a partially responsible role for Robert's drugs fuel, but he is on screen at less than 5 minutes. Leslie Manville fails to cope with Robert Mum, I do not know what the actors do in this low caliber film. Acting is a wooden, scene in the kitchen with TV-cook and his wife, for example, not surprising, who wrote those conversations? Some comments made by the boys ...

Yes, war is violent and social decisiveness is discouraged and strongly intimidating the violent acts of terrorism that you are in politics. Understand the violence of man. <br /> My opinion: is derivative, bad and nonsense.
