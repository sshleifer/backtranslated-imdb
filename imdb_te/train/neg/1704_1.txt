You can not imagine that this film is good and it is not. It's a budget, ultra-violent zombie movie with a bad looking hand-held camera ... and it's fun. Actors did not pretend exactly and it shows their terribly happy readings. There's no plot to look at. The small plot I could find was a government experiment, and the family of a group feels like a couple families are scared. Gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It has gore effects that attacked the butcher's store for all parts of the body, and many scenes include the falling of zombies and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickening movie, and about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
