<br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing one after seeing Der Uterangiang. <br /> There is no connection between different scenarios. Acting is very rare. I can not even believe that people can make such a dilemma that has great potential. . Big mistake. It has a definite sound for the German language, and, in particular, Hitler makes sounds only when he speaks German while speaking. </ P> <p> <br /> As the story says, it has improved on the spot, the characters are empty and it seems to be a collection of random events that take place. <br /> When it is seen in English or der Untergang, everything about the film is fake and ridiculous.
