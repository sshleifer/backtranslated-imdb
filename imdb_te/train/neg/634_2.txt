Well I'm probably about lambasted by everyone in this site, but Good Earth is one of the worst constructive films I've seen in a long time. We have two and a half movies, one of which is a two and a half, because it has two pictures. The first film tells a family story to set up their house due to drought and drought. They should go to the south of the city or find some kind of work. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of ornaments and at the same time they realize the drought ended. Yes yes. With this knowledge they return home with their riches, and again and again are good. <br /> <br /> In this film it takes about one and a half hours, and it has a very good arc in its lifetime. You think this is a wonderful place to end the movie. However, the film will continue for the entire hour afterwards. During this time, it takes a simple story about a family facing the world's hardship and turns it into a delicate drama about betrayal and jealousy among lovers. Oh and old age, money is the source of all the bad blah blah. If you know that you have created your epic imagery, your story may not be more than that. The main idea I will collect on this film is good for the family and keeps them together. Why the hour we spend an hour to tell the story about the rich man who is in love with another woman and why the last moment of the film dedicated to the wife that our main character did not take much care? <br /> <br /> Oh wait and the film is not only a poorly written thing, the wife of the main characters is not exactly sure. She has a lot to complain to her that she is a slave and she always wants to have a slave and yadda yadda. Then when her hat fell, she wanted to sell her only daughter to slavery. While this idea is not even hungry, it still does not make sense when it complains about wanting to slave again in the film after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> "This is the only thing happening for cinematography, the landscape is beautifully beautiful, the sequence is very impressive with Oh and the Grasshopper. <br /> <br /> Last thing is that I found that I was focusing more on stars in Hollywood this time and could portray a good actor. He portrays the best Asian man in his ability, but once the film hits the half-point without any reason, he loses it and becomes the only regular Italian Italian pal, so he looks like Tony from Scarface (this is a better movie) Three would think that is really Asian, the rest Oh, and oh I'm merely the Americans are okay. Oh and I would not show a really nice note if I would rip your hands out Oscar, please Ms Rainer. <br /> <br /> Good Earth is an epic waste of time. If you want something of this waste to see good evening, the Grapes of Roth get a movie that really deserves all praise. Because it's written a monkey mainly.
