It's probably the most boring, worse and useless film I've seen last year. The plot with some philosophical aspects has evolved as a very bad hollow copy of the play, with plenty of clich√©s: camel wolf cap, good looking, mentally disturbed, sleeping with his pistol ... + good guy and shy, but good-her scientist, you're a 2 Add percent plot and I have the robot! Fredx, Audi, and interviews have expressed terrible displeasure through the clear advertising of brands. The film is commercially shaken and unfortunately 30 seconds later. My misfortune enemy is not recommended for this, if you have some free time, watch a good TV show instead or read a nice book good.
