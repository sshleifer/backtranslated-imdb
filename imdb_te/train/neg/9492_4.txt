A star for "Plot". A star for acting. An actor for dubbing as an American who swim-voiced. Five stars for Monica Broke and Inge Maria Granzive, with their propensity to lay their clothes. And ten ten men for Daman Emmanuel Bertert, two years before she made 'Manson des source'. Bearett has also been committed twice, but her film is full of joy, the film is awesome. Look for the scene where she told her three friends "first time" for a girl. It is more romantic than a fun dancing rather than "love sequences" starring Brooke, Grangejoy and Patrick Bacchau. Incidentally, cinematography is not great; The closing credits Stills is a good indication of David Hamilton's ability.
