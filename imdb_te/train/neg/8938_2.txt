I can not believe how bad this film is. If I'm not a musochist, I do not know if I saw it. It seems to cost $ 1000 to make, but it's not the money that brought them down. Acting is terrifying - not just bad, and 3rd graduates read well. Secondly, another reason for watching this type of film is the skin, and the film is not serious. We can not see more attractive chikas in F. <br /> Ah, well, good luck next time?
