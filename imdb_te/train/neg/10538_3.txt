The First Power (1990) is a horrific film in the period of inexorable horror movies of the late 80s / 90s. I found this movie very boring but in some areas very hilarious. This movie is not very funny and it is not even funny. Texas is weak in comparison with Swift Justice system in the film. Lou Diamond Phillips plays his role in this role (he plays a hard boiled cap) and Tracy Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a supernatural. Do not waste your time because it's bad. Any minute, I'll take it back. This film will make a great party image. Check out the Switch Blaze Cruzefish packing nun, who has seen the foxes I've seen in a nice Franco noispllitation film that she saw in a nun. <br /> This is L.D.P. An era ended. His actor was terrified and he could not draw the flies to the pile heap. It is D.T.V. A few years later until his "reproduction". <br /> You should not recommend until you are disappointed.
