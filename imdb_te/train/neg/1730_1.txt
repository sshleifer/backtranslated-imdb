I want my first sister to see that I am the only one in this program. I find the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable. This program works very well when the live audience is filmed. Thus laughter will show how 'unfunny' performance is. But I will give credit for the acting talent of the young actress. I am ill to think that it will look back at the future program and see how bad their first TV program is. Show links that contain annoying accents and style for CBBC presenters. Why do young people today rarely want? That's all.
