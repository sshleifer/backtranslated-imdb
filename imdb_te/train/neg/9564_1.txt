<br /> <br /> I think two people have seen the worst movie ever seen, and I understand where they came from, but I have seen really bad. <br /> <br /> The films that I say (that is, I do not prevent them) are worse, they are physically bad with every sense of their connection with watching movies. You would like to make films that are worse than war games to break in your eyes or to cut sharp objects in your ears. > <br /> War Games: Dead code is not that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes I am a fan, but I do not expect miracles from this one. Let's deal with it is not really the greatest of an image in the first place, it's basically just a campy 80s teen romance film with some geek-appeal. <br /> <br /> I'm hoping that something is bad, something like that, but my geek-strings May be tugged at. Is it too much to ask? Is it not possible to match the video release directly than actual war games? Well obviously that is a lot to ask. Stay away from this movie. First it's bad, "Oh yes, it's bad, but I enjoyed it, and finally it's fine at the end". And it just gets worse and worse, and in the end, trust me, you will want to not see this movie.
