It is difficult to judge impartially on this film that has such an impact on such a young age. This is a dirty kind of exploitative movie. It is unfortunate to see the film for the first time in my youth, and Ivil never forgets it. I thought it was the most terrible film I had ever done. <br /> <br /> I saw this earlier this year and once again scared. <br /> I am not an enthusiastic or a man to tell others what to watch and do not see, and the horror of rape in the film. I love Lobro movie but it's just plain nasty. Instead of renting some Rus Meyer.
