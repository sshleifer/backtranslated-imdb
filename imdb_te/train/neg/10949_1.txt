I'll go to the movie to get fun. There is nothing fun about this film. From the beginning to the end, the gray, grinding reality of this woman's life is not relieved. There is no change in mood, it is at the same speed. I stayed to the end because I was convinced that things were good. They did not do it, and I thought that only a few groves in the cinema were watching around the film because the film was shot in the same way. I do not mean honestly portraying social coercion, but throwing your audience into Growth does not mean to win people's sympathy. A terrible picture.
