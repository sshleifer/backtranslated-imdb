After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought that Cruella de Ville experienced her punishment to torture animals for their skin. The whole picture is very funny, and in my view, better than animated. But the second is not necessary. If Krulala returns, first of all, do not make her mad again, without healing her. Take her a break from prison and it's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's just supposed to have an original puppy back. I think he's lucky, because he's very pretty, and Roger and Anita are back. Nevertheless, they decided to have a full restoration and not just one hundred and two hundred, but only three dogs and decided to add only the parrot that he thought was a dog (intelligent). Part of Gerard Depardieu is understandable. Finally, the cruel way is very high, it is very insulting and the way is very real. She will be baked inside a huge cake. It is an unpleasant effort of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from scratch. It did not work. It's too high, and not too funny. Sorry about the cruelty.
