Anyone who loves two classic novels written by Edward Ormandydd is disappointed in the film. A good deed for a mysterious old woman, and a girl who gave "three" instead of magic and romance from her original story. What about three? Three wishes, but three journeys on the dirty elevator in 1800. <br /> The first time in the first novel. Second time is good time.
