<br /> <br /> Directors: Most Lucyo Fulzi, but Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Matteo <br /> <br /> Cast: Ottaviano Delguava, Massimo Wani, Beatrice Ring, Daran Seraphin <br /> <br /> Review: To start reviewing this film and get some good background, I started at the start. And this is really the beginning of the dawn of George Romeros of the Dead. When Dan came in 79, Lucy Fulzi decided to make an indirect sequel to it and called it Zombie 2. The film is known as the plain Ole Zombie. You know one in which the zombie stunts with the shark! OK So, after that movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge part of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Let some zombie flakes! These things are rocking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Still confused? This is a story truly the best comparison that comes from the brain is the Living Dead Return, which is just a rehash of the stories we've seen most of the American zombie flicks we've seen before in this one. Let's see ... there is a government making experiments with a specific poison gas that converts people into zombies. Cookery is a common population and Shebang will be released! We gain anxious burden of zombies for human flesh. Some people are running away from the zombies and hung in the old abandoned hotel. <br /> <br /> The film was in trouble during filming. First and foremost, Gory's beloved godfather Lucio Fulk was sick from Italy. So he could not finish the film as he wanted. The film was entrusted to two low-profile directors, Bruno Matte (Hell of the Living Dead) and Clodio Fragasso (Zombie 4). That's fine, but the film is their best. Fulki does not really have his heart and soul in this film. He was so upset with it. He gave the producers the film and said primarily: "Make the hell you want with it!" <br /> <br /> Why do we have women and men who have a zombie image of such intricacies as they are credited as "Director" The main problem in my opinion is its just a bore meaning! No matter what it is! The first few minutes after some terrorists stole poisonous gas and accidentally release, the rest of the movie would have left empty-headed characters without any personality running from zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, making the # 1 zombie and zombie action is actually very good and fun and there is a lot of # 2 gore and guts. <br /> We here! Well there are some inspired moments, for instance when some Eagles are infected by gas and they start attacking people. That's cool. There is also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich all the logic and explanation of the way through) and a scene munching off a poor girls legs come out of an abandoned hotel pool. But next to that ... the rest of the movie was flat in its ass. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My main stomach is with this film. The sets are incomplete and art direction is not practical. I hate it when everything is incomplete! I love my B-movies, but it really went down too! If you ask me, it will be close to a z-level image. <br /> Zombie make up? Pure garbage. Zombies all Asian actors (portrayed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of zombies looking Asian. This is not a big problem since they were set in any movie in the Philippines. Really sucks that zombies its appearance! They died for some reason for the same reason. And what goes for a zombie here is a group of black group (more like smudges) in their faces. One or two zombies are getting more complicated, but still not good enough to impress. Its little goo is rarely read into actors. So the film is slowly slow but the zombies look like the worst. These dead folks feel! For those who look forward to the general coolness of a full-fledged film it is not anticipated, because it is the image of others. And both of those involved (Mattei and Fragasso) really do not put the heart and souls there for it. In fact, when you look extra in the DVD you'll see when Fragasso asks about his memories and his feelings about his memoirs, he does not even take it seriously. He is ashamed of it and in many cases he says, "They have a job and they do it." And my friends, the last nail in this movie. No love, and the heart of the film does not. <br /> <br /> Only those who want to see or see each job flick or watch each job flick. Not everyone, even trouble! Rating: 1 of 5
