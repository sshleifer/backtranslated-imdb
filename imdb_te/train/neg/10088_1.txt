I was an actor, producer, director, and I said the truth. The movie is the worst film in the history of filmmaking. From the producer to the director and this film is a joke and I understand that it is a big joke. Why does a block buster release such a garbage? My work is getting worse and this film is insulting to my career. Is the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad zombie movies, but it takes on the table of coffee and everything that everyone ate. This movie is Success !!! I hate to talk badly about other filmmakers because I consider myself a person but a different career. I respect the fact that you complete an image, but I ask you "smoke you angry", I mean decorating your girls, scary zombies, what are you thinking. The whole country, I will have if I vote Zero. The movie is made in the film
