The movie is a bad acting and poor set design and crink-festivals of frivolous lines and sluggish plots. But it's great to watch. Everything is so happy about it. Basic Plots A group of scientists from future futures returning to capture a worker's intention to destroy them. They meet with him for 1146. The 'future' laboratory of scientists since 2033 has an ephemeris-style room with 'future' flashing buttons and a microwave caps that appear as a grass shed. The actors distribute their lines with the great Ablomb, which is not hard to be considered as land-shakers, usually "everything I double double checked". Has he checked everything twice? Has he observed it four times? It is not, but they will feed you in the entire premise of the film within the first five minutes, and they continue at the fire pace faster until they hit the medieval episode. When Roger Carman is outside the money. And the time and consequence came to stop traveling through different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash from the late 10th to the 16th century. What clothes they found, they were used. I assume that the chain is not in the mail budget, 'the boys will wear the formal shirts worn as armor. Fight scenes are ridiculous, men are massively knocked down with hammer knives and die with death, which throws up with a garbage cast. It sounds really awful, but enjoy every time I watch it. If the lines alone are fit for you and everything else is a connoisseur of terrace flicks, I pull together to create an amazing B-image suggesting you look. And read the review on once and unfamiliar movies. I showed all the funny, really horror bits in the film.
