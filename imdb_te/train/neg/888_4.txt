It is a picture I can not wait to see! I finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. For starters, the film says very little about buildings, streets, bridges and cafes just about a group of confusing shots. It really does not stay in sight of New York magic. Another thing that changes my mind is the French movie set in the movie. I know it's remake, but it's not a French style remake! However, here you will notice the symbols of French films such as long and horrible scenes, what little talk and everyone wearing French style! The story follows many lives (for my taste too) and they can somehow feel connected to the end. I think there is no commitment to the characters on the stories. The picture is very low for everyone to have a happy ending for everyone. So we can see about 30 people in 30. There are your 120 minutes there! If you like active scenes dialogues and items it's not a movie for you! I give 4 because I love New York and I loved cast!
