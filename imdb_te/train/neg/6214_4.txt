What a damn! ?? Why do people say this? "Blowing the mind?" It's just the end of cinematography history's worst conclusions! 4 left and the whole world is out! Not everyone has claimed that nine of the victims were seven idiots. 1 whole time, if he sacrificed 9, nothing happened. What is the reason for people to be there and what? ... to rain? I admit I have parts of the film, and the whole concept is lovely. But it's one of the many clicks later. And did anyone feel this feeling like the Lord of the Rings? Characters die for stupid reasons, almost no role is developed, honestly ask you, it's good that only four people in the world remain; Its meaning and insane. This is one of the smallest movies I've seen, and thanks to God! How robots are human beings creatively! It happened like a hundred times! This film is really worth watching, such as Stupid, Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglourious Basterds, those good films!
