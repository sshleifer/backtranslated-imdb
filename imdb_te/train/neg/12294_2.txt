I looked totally for this movie. It was filmed in an old hotel with a friend's shares. <br /> <br /> The plot is imaginable, acting is fine, scared are all gross, not real threats. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much plot and one of the many things to remember. They do not even use the full potential of the hotel ... the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is on a peninsula. On less waves, walking around for about a quarter of a mile up to an hour, which is very scary in the early morning or early night when it's in the air in the crashing air. <br /> <br /> The way to see this movie is with the remote in your hands so you can move forward through the action (and I'm using that word loosly) at the beauty of scenes and surroundings!
