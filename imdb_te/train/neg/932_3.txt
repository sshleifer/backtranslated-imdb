I saw this movie and hoped for something to improve all the time. What's so great about a person who has no emotion? <br /> <br /> Alex does not show emotion for anyone other than his son. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a scene, they say that they will not fall in love with the next time, <br /> <br /> It has seen the Boogie Nights and wrote this piece to mimic the Little Bill, a scene that he "loses his friends" It is good to visualize a human being without the emotion of William H. Mackie - where is it - is it magnolia? <br /> <br /> The film is not an emotion, Characters, and a plot and it is definitely not my recommendation. <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
