Well, how do you rate a movie like this movie? Does it really have a movie value? This is an image trying to be as slimmer as possible. Basically the whole movie is a group of guys who are just a little girl hilarious. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film is as real and as awesome as possible. However, the film is very fake for the intended work. Clapping and stamping is all soft and fake looking, as well as noisy. They are often kicking on the ground, unlike the girl, apparently. The girl is beautiful and beautiful also that responds to all abuses. I understand if this is true, surely she made her screams. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly a low budget, an attempt to achieve the most real and vulgar, along with the most horrifying resources, surprises and realities. <br /> <br /> Since the release of the film has released six sequels, do not really think that the film was very effective during the release. Gore is often disappointed in the film, although some people have a kick in the movie with the fetish. <br /> <br />
