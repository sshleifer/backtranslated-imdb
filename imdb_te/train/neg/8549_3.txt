Ok, now I'm looking at the hell of TRASH? "The Witch Mountain" is one of the most absurd and insane Spanish predatory games, yet at the same time, it is also bizarrely compelling. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense and I suspect there is always working script, but something I could not turn it off. Scratching your head with chaos soon begins, with an early scene about the angry little girl who kills her mother's cat. So think this movie revolves on children having evil forces? No heck, because after this acquaintance, the girl and her wickedness are not merely mentioned. Then cut a man, you will see the most undisclosed cut off, who will break his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way. When she asks her to spend her vacation with her, he asks her employer to ask her for any kind of appointment! Great move. The film finally starts now, when he travels to an isolated mountainous area where some peaks are portrayed. Before he is a new girl (Patty Shepherd) and photographs her without her! Throughout their journey, all sorts of strange events take place? Did you expect it? Explain. Girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loudly petrifying music plays everywhere and anyone jeep steals! Really, car jacking witches? Apparently quiet witches have a coven mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers. I'm very close to explaining the theme, but it's a good chance, why am I going out? Here's a more important environment! "The Witch Mountain" is occasionally creepy, its horror music and interesting cinematography. The support roles play all the deceased and ravishing Patty Shepherd plays a good heroine. If it was responsible for writing a structured screen play, this was a European horror film, a myth.
