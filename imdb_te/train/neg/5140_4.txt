Demer Daves, it's an excellent director when it comes to Western and "broken arrow". It's all in my mind. He should leave it to find people like Vincent Minelli, George Cooker or the amazing Douglas Sirk. The screenplay does not surprise you in an unexpected manner, such a waitress is looking at Alex. Natyne Wood's role was inspired by Funny Hurst's "simulator of life" (see Stahl and Cirk), but is she a black man's daughter? Susan Koehner is more reliable in the "simulation of life") and that Sinatra and Kurtis could not do anything with them: such as the poor officer and the rich-looking and average-sergeant. Does it fall in love? France is shown as a tolerant land where jobs are very happy with the unions. (Circa 1944) It is doubtful. .
