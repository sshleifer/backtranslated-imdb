<br /> <br /> I enjoyed the single work of Singleton as "I Boyz En The Hood". However, I was a major disappointment in this one and I hate everything about the so-called "message" films, such as Contrived, Clich√©. <br /> The acting is mainly weak (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors ... take note), difficulty swallowing conditions (rape victim turns lesbian ... overnight!), but not all The worst of all is to strengthen every screwed stereotype you can think of. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film has become a cartoon similar to that in its spectral, so you lose any cloth of empathy that you have for its one-dimensional player. Characteristics of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it just ends up hitting the results of these issues. This is the result of a general lack of confusion and plot combination. I found it to be an imaginary, awkward, predatory and mildly objectionable for the resolution of the films. <br /> <br /> I have told you to avoid what I have seen before for a movie called "Higher Learning". </ P> <p> <br /> If the movie is totally unsuccessful, some people have a real idea to rent a "American History X" ... if you see it for Tyra Banks then you have to take life.
