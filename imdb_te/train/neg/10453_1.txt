This film has more than one desirable of 1. But most Phikak fan boys gave it a 10 rating because it would give a rating on the top 100 list. It's not so bad. Its stupid cult classic with many son fanatics is ridiculous. This is still kind of still who still laugh Chuck Norris jokes and still "old I'm Rick James B! Tch" no matter how old or annoying it gets. I have just heard "I'm tired of MFN snakes on this MFN plane" Now idiots will try to be funny. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie, wait for Marine John Cena starring.
