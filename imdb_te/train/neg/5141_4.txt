1914 excellent year for Charlie Chaplin. It was in his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these movies are not good, he has given him a chance to slowly grab his screen personality. However, through this film, the role of "Little Tramp" known as the still is in development. Certainly looked at the piece of Charlie, but his character still lost sweet and decent, and later he developed. <br /> <br /> Chaplin often does not hit, knock, or other evil things at all. <br /> <br /> For this small film, it is interesting for the cast. Chaplin Mabel Normand, Chester Conclin and Mac Swann, are among the most celebrated stars today with Chaplin stars - Keystone Films. While the problem with this image has some nice scenes, the plot is not very vague and improperly improved. Chester and Mabel Race Track (the most common thing in Keystone Productions - it's near a race track). Charlie and Mack show and sneak. MacCalline kills Chester and follows the police when he stole his girl. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is no clear reason that cops take away Chester and Macs - Charlie Mabel (Charlie's unpleasant behaviors can not be ignored) is a huge silent comic film or film historian, Chaplin's evolution, . He and other actors actually do what's on stage, but it is not unusual for a keystone film, but it's not particularly funny when you see today.
