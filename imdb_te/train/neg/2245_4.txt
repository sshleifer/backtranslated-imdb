The film is not like the 1954 version with Judi Garland and James Mason, and the 1954 version is much better in my opinion. I'm not refusing Barbara Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I did not introduce myself with Chris Christopherson's other work and so I can not judge it. Nevertheless, the film was much appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it is only natural that I like. Judy Garland version is good. See Barraba and Chris 1976 movie, and judge for you.
