The film is the most horrific feature film I ever had to bear, which is worse than the fact that I have to look at it and it's for school because it's not possible to stop! However, the storyline is fine ... but I found the acting terrible! Minaane Jean-Baptist exemption, I thought her performance was awesome. She only highlighted, without her, I suspect I would have been watching the movie. Every time I hear someone "darling" I'm scared! I almost attacked a customer the other day because I said it was "it". <br /> It reminds me of one of the worst one and a half hours of my life.
