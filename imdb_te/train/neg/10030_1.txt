Tashan - The title describes the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> These types of films are actually made for flap. Yash Raj Films are producing such films and are worth more than c-gray movies. Or some C-grade movies have a much better and cheerful story than Tashan. <br /> <br /> In my view, this is the worst ever since Yash Raj Films banner of honor. How did they manage such a huge project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gaddi's paths like Dhoom, but eventually he suffered. Action scenes are more like comics or cartoon movies for the audience's hearts. <br /> <br /> This story also means that you can grab audiences' hearts delicately and lose in ingredients. In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of South Tamil actor Rajnakant in his body language and expressions. I am not a fan of Saif or Akshay, Kareena's award to go to Saif instead of Akshay. From what I had expected since I was starting, but in the end it was unhappy with the climax truth. Saif is mainly behind the whole adventure, meets Akshay in the middle. In any film, the final whole article and award should be finalized or rewarded to the credit worthy of the award. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing to do with his comedy show but still remembers his previous films. New imagery has to be created for his fans. Saif did a great job in Race Between, and now he returns again to his hilarious nature through this film. But he has completely developed himself in the field of acting. Kareena is not the last one. She looks very hot with a bikini cloth, complaining that she is too lean. But I do not think so, instead she became slim. Yes slim !!! It is a good factor for a woman to attract older women (or male, say). Saif's son Ibrahim will appear at the start. <br /> <br /> Tell people who love this tale of being mentally depressed or say they want to return to childhood or agree. In the shelter. Directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, the film is being stolen by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he will need to study and study the 5-year script before practical commands. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not want to rate this kind of junk films good stars.
