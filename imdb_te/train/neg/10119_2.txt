Peter & The Wolf's re-imagined animation is amazing, but in 29 minutes, the film is inspiring to sleep. They call it "Peter & the Nuties", because each one moves in the snail pace. <br /> I had to watch for 15 minutes at a time, it was pure torture. <br /> Save your 30 minutes - <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the Oscar nominated committee for the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, voting for the winner in the best animated short (small!) Section, the voters will sit through the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - to estimate that there is no way to win this film.
