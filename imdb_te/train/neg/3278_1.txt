I had a modern version of the new "Dukes" film that many people have argued need to get with us times. Kindness. If it is considered modern, Hollywood can keep it up. Many people on the MSN site (and I quote) "You have to come up with older priests and except that." Let me say something, I'm not 24 years old, and I'm far from the oldest fourth, and I'm not able to get it, it's no longer hazarded county. The only thing in the title of the film is "Hazard." All pornography, smoking, drinking is really necessary. The cast is terrible. Jessica has had many morning shows to discuss about this film and obviously I believe it has gone all over her head. She is a Daisy Duke, not a lucky, but definitely duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but Bo. They included the original cast at least as comios, but Hollywood knew that they did not accept the script. Today, actors and actresses have expressed negative opinion, so some of you are making positive comments.
