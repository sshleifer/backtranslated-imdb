I guess it's funny like "Big Mama" movies. <br /> <br /> There are three plots in the film: the first is Made and her pet. The second is the woman engaged in the misuse of the wealthy woman. The third mother and the same relationship with the same father are the third. <br /> <br /> There is very little comedy in the cinema. There are also many distorted messages in this movie. For example, Made convinces a pet (in a comical way) to convince the child to straighten it. The boy actually revolves around him. <br /> <br /> There are plots (child's consent) of child abuse. There are scenes with scenes with young people. (Ogling takes place in a family reunion.) The movie you're going to go from here to the theme is always going to be balanced. Is not it a comedy, love story or drama? In fact, nothing but time and money waste ... nothing.
