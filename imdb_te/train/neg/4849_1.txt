I hired today ... I heard good reviews in advance. Wow !! What is the pile of this movie? Do I know the director's address to get my five dollars back ??? Finally someone hit the "Stop-Loss" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' Number One spot. Okay, I do not think there are any good Iraq War movies, but it's very bad. <br /> <br /> I do not get any technical leaks, all of them have a hundred reviews from GWOT vets. If the director does not even contact the lowest e-mail on technical accuracy, they probably made the film realistic ... probably. I guess the author should give the film "credit" for this waste. He or she is clearly not bothered with reality restrictions from sharp imagery beside the plot for the film. Would I be surprised at what this picture is about? Is there a message? Wow ... WTF? <br /> I'm pretty surprised by the pretty positive reviews. The film is very difficult to see all the mocking bugs, but if it is unable to think, the plot will succeed, the characters are inevitable (at least to say) and acting is fine. It's strange, I think, suppose the film explosion is about removal, because the biggest bomb I saw this year.
