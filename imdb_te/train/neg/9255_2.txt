First, I said that I was really enjoying the ISHII Katsuoto's previous movie "Somada Otocco to Mamozieri Ona" ("Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl"). While it was indebted to Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction", Ishi's cast was in the process of carrying out the story and broke through the entire film force. The scenes between ASANO Tadanobu and GASHUIN Tatsuya were especially involved. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " -The action is intelligent, combine the action! Then, the original image began.Of course, it's sort of shuffle on the side door of the "start" <br /> <br /> The whole movie takes place in three chambers, a futuristic Wahair paradise (a bit borrowed from "Shark Skin Man ..."), and another travel agent Office, and the third (most used) is a sturdy hotel room, in which there are seven characters cast and ... . I "speak" is not a stranger to the movies. One of my all-time abhimanalalo "My Dinner with Andre", all the images speak talkiest. "Andreto my dinner" very Warmness, and discussing their lives at the two middle-aged men. Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn tell interesting stories. The cast of "Party 7" literally whine at each other for the whole movie. "No, you will not do it!" "Yes I will!" "No, you really will not!" "Yes, I'm really!" "No, you really do not really!" Yes, I really ... "You got the idea, I wish I had the director. <br />" Party 7 is an unreliable unengaging image. Platitis flimsiest (only as in "shark skin man ...", stealing from yakuza), almost with action. There is no interesting dialog. Characters are mostly unhealthy. Taking out the moments of conversation that derailed from Ishi Thintino's paintings, and built a complete picture around them. But Tarentino's conversations are always known as their own internal logic and wit ("they call it royal, cheese"). Not with the dialog here, which is more than duller than you can imagine. It's not for the succinct, hilarious Cameo (who is always amazing) and the low-key display from the amazing ASANO Tadanobu, I would have given the "Party 7" single star. It really is the duty to do it all the way through.
