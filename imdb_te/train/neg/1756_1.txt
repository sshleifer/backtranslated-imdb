Two years after this television reunion began to be seriously launched on the back burner (so it was reported) that the most beloved characters in sitcom history - and went straight down downhill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Roda Morganstern (Valerie Harper) broke up in New York for a long time and met on one's life. What a novel concept! But sadly speaking, there is nothing worth talking about (only to make a film about) interference in either of those years. So instead, when the script was thrown up by a Horiery old plot device (mostly associated with older women in the workplace), the original performance was a quirky charm and sophistication. The supporting cast was instantly memorable, humorous, and Moore and Harper collaborated with chemistry. Moore's allegations have been canceled by the project over the years, waiting for her "right script". If it is considered "right" to her, how did she reject the earth? It is not the age of the characters that (at that point inevitably happen), but the complete lack of refutation with the refutation of the series's work. It was a pilot at one time, but, obviously, it failed to create an interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, between potential audience. Quickly and graciously forgotten, the film is a humiliation and an insult to a classic.
