This is the way I've seen so far on Starz on demand that way up in my top list of worst movies. <br /> <br /> The DVD that they find and can put here can choose each row to the worst-fest. <br /> Why? No one knows! Anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget apparently can come up with a horror film and get it on TV. To be honest, I looked at this terrible moment from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I have an open mind about low budget films. <br /> <br /> Some of the best movies I have seen are low-budget movies or other cases where low budgets are needed. <br /> This is not one of those films. <Br /> <br /> You know about the plot now, I'm sure if you're reading this. I have heard that you have heard about it either on Starz or because of the boredom on this page. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl we all know for 3 minutes in the very bad "heavy metal" music video. No one should come up with it looked really interesting, but it really does not, really. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she would have someone else. Then some murder begins. It's really unmemorable and totally boring as an average and as possible. When the first gun went to his apartment it popped up a part of popcorn popping. Is not it the best sound effect they could do? I can find a good sound effect on the internet for free (free non-copyright) free ... right. <br /> <br /> Do not allow other reviews that tell you 10 star movie fool. <br /> <br /> They clearly believe that the distributor or director of the film may feel this part as junk off. <br /> Lagamable.
