This is one of those weird films appearing on Lifetime TV, which portray unpleasant behavior of the unpleasant woman. Besides the other evil films like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", the film shows why she is not such a bad guy to show off the boring criminals and audiences. Give us a break! Here is my question to filmmakers: Letterne a man, and Willey a 12 year old girl, have you been sympathetic and portrayed with this guy? <br /> <br /> Hey no. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you change the pathways in this movie and you will see why and why this bad piece is taken to myself and others. As sexes change, the perpetrator has no sympathy. Instead, we'd treat a luminous and bizarre man's portrayal of a young girl, his lascivious behavior taking place in jail, and his brainwashed victim suffering a risk of suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. <br /> <br /> In this film, Leonauau did not receive a similar treatment. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade with one hand. Letonne pedophile. Plain and simple. Not ifs, ands or buts. She is a criminal in prison, and deserves our ridicule and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
