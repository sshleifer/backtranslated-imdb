It's not the worst movie I have ever seen, tell me about it. It starts with some good weather; The hospital is clean and contaminated with the attacks, the mood is set to "strange". And then ... nothing. Well, somethings. Apparently unsuccessful sammits ... and trying to clarify the connection between the bizarre and the most intimidating critters and the hospital they took. I mean, come on biker duds? <br /> <br /> When looking at the middle-aged trucker, I can pop up a cheap beer (maybe the Schlitzz), and then watch the game, throwing on an Afghan-bed bed, looking at my personal favorite, . Honestly, I've seen very horrible truckers. At truckstops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooHHHHHoooooooo !!!! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are more cartoon, and even less scary. At least, in the DVD, videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they obviously just pop up places randomly, play some bippy "metal", and cause a bit of people dead. Except for some good special effects, the lack of good writing is not entirely terrible, nothing here. This is only a background-sound picture.
