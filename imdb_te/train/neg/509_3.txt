The film is about British prisoners from World War II escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I found the boring "Wooden Horse" unhappy. The subject may be thrilling, pathetic and adrenaline fuel, but "Wooden Horse" is said to be very plain. It is a collection of plain and poorly said events, with suspension and thrill. The first half clearly tells how prisoners of war are dug a tunnel, but the events are not so smooth, enough edges and shaves close to make me on the edge. The second half of the film is even worse, they are going from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And the characters could talk a bit less and have more action with an action movie! I was disappointed by "Wooden Horse", which lost power to be a great film.
