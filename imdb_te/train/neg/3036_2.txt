This film is absolutely horrible! I do not know how to produce this film. There is nothing against the film cast, of course, it's all wrong with the writing team. You have to take the old average plot - let's be poor and stable in our way - or STEP in this case. But this does not make any comparison with a real plot - or at least one who care about someone. Canadian speaking actors do what is to be done in an American setting - the film is very flat. Directing a positive note is very good and cinematography is pretty good. The product budget is very beautiful. My team finds the original screenwriters to leave this work alone and get the words alive in the film. The net result - how she stabs how she sucks.
