Good illusions in Webster's Dictionary define logogobia as the fear of words. I can be lafofobia. In the beginning of the film, credits are 'generated, written and directed:', and then have a person's name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but most are Jack of All-Trades. Many of the directors like Spielberg and Scorsese rarely take control of their films. But in the theater in my theater seat, in the popcorn, and the 'Brian Helleland's, are written, written and directed words' when I was thrown in the theater as a fourth Ryan fastball. Oops! <br /> <br /> I know about Brian Helland because of the movie buff. His writer in the last 10 years as a writer was drawncom in 1998 as a stock price of the company. There are many theatrical favorites (the murderers, the postman, conspiracy theory), such as the complex and award winning victories (such as LA Confidential and Mystic). They seemed alternate ?? Knowing that a good, an evil, one of his last film, Blood Work was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not breathe. <br /> <br /> How did the Archbishop Stars Heath Ledger (Helglands a Knights Tale), Alex Bernier, a priest called Rome, in the order known as Carolingebis? 'Interesting'. The meeting with Father Thomas (the Order of the Order and Still Standings mark), they departed to mingle the Riddle to the backdrop of the premature death of the priest. <br /> <br /> Her efforts to kill Alex during an exorcism resulted in Mara Sinclair (played by Shannon Sosamone) subdirectory from an organization as a result of her attempts to kill Alex. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Alex has expressed feelings toward Mara. Without acknowledgment of the audience, they go to Rome together for some reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ A Sin Eater, as we have been told, was eating the sins of a person who died during the death of the church, and thus could enter into heaven. William, like luck, Alex Alex has captured his character and is life and tired of healing for free him from his worldly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after his new love Mara's death, Alex has completed resorts and conversion to Sin Eater's karma to save her. Alex searches for answers to his many questions, but his father interprets the Vatican story after overcoming his fellow investigator's authority. <br /> Order is not a horrible movie, but it is terribly boring. There is nothing to do with the funniest special effects and any connections. In a very dramatic scene - Alex is walking in a dreaded Mara - it's soft and smooth and leaves us without any emotional response to the twin's plight. <br /> <br /> It is a very quiet and unethical talk that everyone has ever known. Cinematic flat lines and smelling letts have managed to keep trying to capture a small nap in between me. <br /> <br /> So, Helgland, I appeal to you not to try this again. Share your attention with others, be more willing and more helpful to guide you in areas that are not fully self-imposed. Until then, it shows you are capable of doing something more than a failing grade. <br /> <br /> <br />
