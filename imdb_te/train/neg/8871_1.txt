I can see 200 movies in two years in theaters and at home and this movie is a lot worse when I see this year (if ever, I'm really "Quest of Delta Nights"). <br /> <br /> When I was 13 years old, I was a bad joke, and I was so upset by the bus trip that I could not go out. One of the rented aisles. Four dollars can be spent on any film by numbers created by Jerry Brockheimer.
