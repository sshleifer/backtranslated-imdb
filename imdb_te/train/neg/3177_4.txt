I guess she does not really mean the Dead Body is not really bad, my mom would like to see it, I hired it. I go ahead and look at the horror before my eyes, but in reality it's not very bad. I'm looking forward to this horror film, but the writers do not understand any harm, but the actors of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry) have fewer sets of the film. I thought I was a little better without her, she annoyed me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell gave the film a good chemistry, which was somewhat enjoyable. But you have to agree, there is no point in the film, it's one of those quick payments in the type of actor. <br /> <br /> Henry lost her husband named Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on the wedding day. . But when his sister takes him to the supernatural, Ashley and Henry fall for her, but Kate hunts her out of the tomb. Kate's envy and Henry do not want to go too quickly and make sure that Ashley frightened me with the voice of Katie, for her harassing her day and night with her Robles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Eva Longoria does not have enough star power to do just the film, there is no crime for those who love her, and she's on the silver screen on the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's role, she still does not like everything that she is pulling, or her "gay" friend, Don, just does not really like it. With some rewriting and proper attention, this film may be good, but instead we leave the imaginative romantic comedy with a blank feeling. <br /> <br />
