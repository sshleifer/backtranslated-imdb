<br /> <br /> I am very clever to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the cinema is acceptable: The relationship between a man and a woman can be explained by all problems and problems. Two people living in a big city can experience. <br /> <br /> First, the film first appeared, explaining the problems that must be resolved within a day. <br /> <br /> Second, the total slapstance of the product, with just meaningful dialogues. <br /> <br /> Very bad.
