Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comic duo in history, and with lunch, I'm happy to see what their movies are. The fourth person is usually a horn factory, and immediately crack with all the horns. He needs quiet quiet at home with his side Stan, and the doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he's over Ali's inspection. After muddled by a cross-eyed repairman who absorbs plumbing and electricity, the doctor comes up for check, and after some exams he is drinking goat's milk and the sea recommends some sea breeze. He and Ali were renting a boat with a dock after Stan's phone cord and walked some trumpets at the window meeting by a car accident. They were placed on a boat trying to make a goat on the boat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the newspaper's first-page killer Nick Grinder - escaped the conquest (Richard Kramer), and when they were asleep, penetrated into the boys' boat and chewed through the goat boat cord into the sea. String for spaghetti, cheese, belt for pork meat, soap for sponge for meatballs, and he will eat them - eg, the stomach, Stan and Ali fake food. When Ali begins to breathe something, Stan's help keeps his trumpet up, and Ali's rage gets him punching the killer, and it only keeps Ali's rage in jail until it goes to the police. There are serious moments of comedy, but it is not a great black and white image. "Well, another good mess you've got me!" 60th, 100 crores in 100 years, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are ranked 7th in The Comedians' Comedian. OK!
