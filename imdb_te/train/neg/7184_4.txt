It's not a good movie. There are a lot of unsustainable and predictable things happening during the film ... but I think many reviewers have missed out on why the audience is enjoying the audience. This movie was created by Magic JOHNSON! Is not enough to induce us to look at this picture? The film produced by a former NBA star does not come every day, you know. In a big house, pretty stupid kids are caught by a pose and cut through ax. Every cliche trotted us for being mourned. Teen sex. And all generated by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this film! Teen drug use! College Hijinks! And all generated by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
