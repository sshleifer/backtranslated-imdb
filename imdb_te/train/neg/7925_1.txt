Need a great dish for failure? Take a s **** y plot, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters and throw the worst special effects known to the horror movie. Let's be a week's inside stool (the amount of time is probably the cost of making this rubbish). This resulted in Corps Grinders, a film that filters badly and publicly for low places. <br /> <br /> The film was completely blew up. I can not say how painful it is to see my words. You and your friends are not one of those bad movies that can sit around and enjoy. This is not from Plan 9 to Outer Space. This time is a long, boring, sad ruin. Corpse Grinder II is the largest waste of fuel and skill I've seen. If you call acting, I feel discouraged when I realize that people are taking the time to spend their lives in this life. <br /> <br /> Again, when the last thing you criticize in the poor direction, poor storytelling, poorly acting, acting is something heavy, a friend or something that you loved Those are afraid that can be seen. I have destroyed each copy of this film with something, so it does not contaminate the minds of filmmakers. Thank you, Ted v. Michel, for giving me the new respect for every film I've ever seen. You're really terrifying, and I want to congratulate all the films that are clutter or bored.
