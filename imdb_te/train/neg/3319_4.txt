I was amazed at seeing this film. I have always listened to the best of the novel. How frustrated I am. <br /> <br /> If any Jane Austen fan, this story is a mystery to my eyes. Written authors decided that they should adhere to bits of ridiculous humor in the best of time, but also destroyed the feel of that period. For the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but no 'hot' American star will be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is sneaky, and poor Evan McGregor made it look ridiculous! I can not really tell you the good thing about this film. There are very few people who do not rate me, but if you want my advice, watch TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - I believe that it is of great importance to this surface.
