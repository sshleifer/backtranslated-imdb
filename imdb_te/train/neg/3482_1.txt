So, I know I've voted 10 out of 1, but really it's not more than half of the star. I hate it. <br /> <br /> James G. and Catherine O'Hara have played fantastic roles in their roles, Ben Affleck and Absec. Cristina Applegate is great, but the story is sucking and I encourage anyone watching it in the video store, not taking it back and reading the back part, but just to walk ... I do not even like to know what to do about this movie, because it is very sly for the popipity . <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It's terrible! Horrible!
