Julia Roberts apparently makes this an unlikely attempt to shake off her cotton wool pretty women's personality thriller with this unrighteous spousal abuse thriller, but Erin Brockovich is in this backstory that she is hard to imagine wanting to end up putting in a performance that is powerful and acceptable (and Oscar winner) as she did. <br /> <br /> Earlier, for the cable, and the characters you do not really care enough are the grooves because it is domestic abuse and no insight of the dark world There is no under that seal to offer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I am sure that it is absolutely frustrating and unsatisfying, without the name of Roberts on the title.
