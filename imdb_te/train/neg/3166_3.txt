I agree that ghosts have a very difficult feeling about movies, and sometimes I enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comic, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'She's Dead Body Over' takes the very life of a very young child very much, and I'm failing in my opinion from almost any thing. The story is not entirely unbelievable and has not succeeded in convincing me either in comic or sentimental register. The choice of major actresses is terrifying. While Paul Rudd is at least beautiful and looks like a nice guy, the taste in the ladies of his character Eva Longoria requires a serious development as long as he seems (sorry), and Lake Bell is very unattractive (again sorry). A romantic story fails from the beginning without good reason for romantic. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane are actually better but they only support the characters. The rest is interesting and uncomfortable, flat cinematography and cheap costumes are adapted from unsuccessful TV comedies. Really worth looking at, remember nothing.
