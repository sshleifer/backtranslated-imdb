It saw UCSB's Reel Loud Festival and was surprised to win the Gold Reel Award. Not only me, there are mixed reactions to the audience. I thought there were many other good films out there, but then I learned that judges in the cinematic resolution and other arts were in the worst places. While cinematography and editing are similar to many other shorts, the story story is not more than your average student component. There seems to be one of these categories of "serious" student films: sex, intrapersonal fight, and eventually suicide - Nick and Kate Cops are out and three. <br /> Oh, and it might be my opinion, but the guy who came from Montsido feels a little fake. Is it with anyone
