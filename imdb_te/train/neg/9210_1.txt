I have completely forgotten about this film so far. The most blatant and worst attempt to show a hobby that I have never seen before. The message seemed to be: "Young people do not use their imagination, they are serious, mad and injured." I thought the unexpected authors of this snake were the form of evil ritual or mystical worship of D & D style games.
