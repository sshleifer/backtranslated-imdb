I do not know why filmmakers have rebuilt the film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen is an outstanding actor and Baldwin is not the only actor. He has no interest in his play. The action in the original "evade" is fantastic. But the remake has not taken any action! <br /> <br /> The film's construction in 1972 was much more difficult than it was in 1994, although it was almost boring. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the way Baldwin was arrested from Mexico. <br /> If I do not have to remake or decide to classify the classic, they must choose an amazing actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
