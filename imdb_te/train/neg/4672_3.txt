The film makes some beautiful sets and a great job as Albert Finney's brutal father. Jennifer Jason is the daughter of Leigh's daughter and Olivia de Havilland is of great importance and does not match both mature and mature in Herres (1949). The feminist-fairy end of the film continues against Washington's newest resolution, whose writer Henry James romance with some of his other novels. As a fan of the old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very frustrating.
