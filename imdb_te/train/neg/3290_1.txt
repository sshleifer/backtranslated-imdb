This picture sucks! They were taken from my childhood, and raped out in the outhouse! The film is very good, I went home and wanted to catch my "Dukes" DVDs and shouted in a corner. The cast is terrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was driving the Stiffler and Jacques car. When boss hog is bad? When was Rosco hard? They're always there! Bass Hogg was greedy and an idiot in Rosco. When is Jessie Smoke? He never did! Now I'm not very wrong, I'm very generous, there is nothing wrong with Chiba, but there is no place in this film! The film is good about this movie and the end credits is the front trailers. It's money and waste of wind. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
