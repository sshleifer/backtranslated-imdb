This movie is a happy, good way. Sometimes they try to shock you by breaking some bones, and it only happens two or three times, certainly it's not enough to make a shock movie call, but the fights are awfully bad. A pistol means that a hero can walk into an open field 10 people uzi's fire with him, pick up a gun, start shooting back and get hurt. <br /> <br /> The vacant guy, the person woke up, lost his memory and struggled with what he was doing. Five years later, memories come back and take revenge blablab. <br /> <br /> Unless you are drunk and bored, your time is not really valuable.
