It is very enjoyable if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are dull, but it's enjoyable. There are those big crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and crab Japanese sing. It's amazingly bad. And the end of telegraph across the entire film is a worse thing. It is imaginable, but when you see the last fight you will be able to roll in your seat. Even this film does not give the opportunity and you will love it. Susan George is fun to see and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter is not very valuable, but her big crabs are attacked. They are the size of big cats. It's a 2, but I love it. For an image, my god, but for entertainment, I give a 7. Did I mention there are big crabs?
