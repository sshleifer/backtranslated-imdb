The movie starts with the audience who are where they are, and who the characters are. And I did not like that movie. All the endless opportunities have no movie director, I find it a very simple and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over really saying everything. I actually believe that voice overs are untrustworthy for making filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about where we are and I hate to talk about what the characters think, especially what's going on. I am confident that the director may find a vision for the director to express his feelings and feelings to audiences. <br /> <br /> However, after introducing bad effects, the most exciting movie begins. Families and members of the middle class are individually portrayed in a certain realistic manner. I think the director has a talent to capture real life situations. For example, a father might feel unusual in order to make his personal calls from the bathroom, but life can also lead us to some situations that seem to be exceptional but more common. <br /> I think the director is a very good observer about real life. After a while the reality begins to sacrifice story-telling reality. I really felt like I had a big headache because of non stop stop roles. Actors and actresses were given this issue and allowed to improve dialogues. The truth is real, but when you say "I listen really" ten times when the characters say "I really listen", the characters are "more than everyone", or "I'm still reading" the plays and book reading scenes I practice I understand that the play and the book in this movie are very relevant to the theme, but the director is in this visual I think it is down to all users.
