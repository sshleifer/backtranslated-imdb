I love horror movies. I'd have to cheese a lot (nowadays, cheese for 9 of 10 horror films), but this is just ridiculous. Terrible acting, horrific writing, totally empty and unbelievable characters (what missres actors!) And lacking enough body count. I will survive 79 minutes in my life. At least the Crook brothers are named aptly. Alicia Silverstone is the only thing about the whole movie. It's absolutely horizontal to me how it's done to Sundance. The plot is mostly unrealistic, slazer cinema standards. I mean, come on! Will a creepy stalker person rush out to get 10 seconds cheap heaps just after leaving their home? Lame.
