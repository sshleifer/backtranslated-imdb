<br /> <br /> The delicate film of de-list Canadian actors is believed to be the most memorable and most memorable of their careers. <br /> <br /> The film was intensely edited, badly edited, and poorly directed. It's confusing, incomprehensible and miserable - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he gave, but only one in this film to do - he really works with a bad story and script. <br /> I saw van Pellekne in a credible way, and the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nose, whiny voice) <br /> <br /> Did the director not see a jazz dancer in a foreigner suit? The fight between the lightning and the orange greetings of Pleaseske is clearly the result of bad actors, the choreographer, praised with special effects that are fully developed. Is there a director in the set or editing room for this disaster movie (not good)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... Do not waste your time with you, you regret it. I have nothing more to say about these waste of celluloid.
