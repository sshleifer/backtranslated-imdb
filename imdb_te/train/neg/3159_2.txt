Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion on this movie but today is the first day I have looked at some of the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me but there are some people who are scary and really like this movie. I do not like writing bad reviews or criticizing other people's opinions but I feel that nobody has warned me that I would like to see if I should watch this movie. It's not a good movie. I really like the movies and I see something about it but this movie has made it in a very short list of movies I've seen and is happy to leave half. If you're really excited, look at the trailer ... I've made a mistake in the whole movie trailer ... then it's shocking, there are some frightening bad conversations to waste time. I love Michael Vaughan in the alias and hate to criticize him but I think it's my duty to stop other people who wasted hours of their life as an image like this !!
