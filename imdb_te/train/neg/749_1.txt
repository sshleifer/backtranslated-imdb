Nu image, UFO and others are made for the SCI Fic Channel, which comes with a budget of about $ 2 million. Some features work with extensive effects, while others exhibit significant molds and still have both of them - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Hines initially announced that the film would cost a budget of $ 20 million, but it was clear that it could not be less than $ 750,000. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are used, many scenes are burned against the green screen, and most effects are incomplete and inefficient. <br /> It's painful to see. The film has a lot of hopes, despite the relatively modest budget for the film, because it is much less directed, much less implemented and misleading, because most people follow the progress of this production. <br /> <br /> When we first announced, we believe in the film and joined the PT's spoken army of Barnum.
