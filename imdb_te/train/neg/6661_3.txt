I first started seeing this show in 2003 and 2004 with my friends. However, at that time I enjoyed a small joke and a few jokes at this event. I was 11 years in 2003, and I was 14 now (2007). As my age plays a major role in how to judge this show, after performing other reviews, the show has reduced the show after the third season. I agree. This program is obscene, repetitive and generally focuses on the same platform. <br /> <br /> The program revolves around Timmy Turner, who has granted two Fairy God Parents since her life is terrible. There is an evil baby sitter. They say that they can not do something in "Da Rules" because this kid (Timmy) and his parents always want some vulnerabilities that can not prevent another wish. There are a lot of lines to keep repeat, like some fake jokes in the lines that the show felt "magic real love, super toilet" or Nickelodeon is probably funny and sometimes decided to put in the episode. <br /> <br /> It has targeted children less than 10 years of age because of the gross conditions and the "kid's humor" that many children do not care about at my age. The character voice option is very good. Timmy has a very loud, ear and woman voice as a combo. Wanda sounds like an old woman. Timmy's father sounds like some announcer or game show host, and Timmy's mother's voice is very much feminine. The attitudes in this program: In some episodes, Timmy's talks are back and spoiled and agile. Wanda is clearly smart and intelligent. Cosmo can not think of stupid, dumb and Timmy's father. <br /> <br /> Timmy's mother Timmy's father ends up doing whatever he does. <br /> <br /> This program is far from reality to get my opinions. Perhaps as a young child, I was able to see more humor in this program, but when I grew up it really grew older. And the accepted sound or "trash" but the display has the mentality that makes you will commit homicide activity toward the characters. Your intention is that this kind of performance is your attitude. Otherwise, it basically hates you.
