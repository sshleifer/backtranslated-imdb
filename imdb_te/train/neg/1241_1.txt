I have seen the worst picture for years! It starts ridiculously and continues in the same way. I'll do it when something happens in this film, and acting is very bad. In the end it saves the picture from a bit lust and the whole flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad picture. Sorry Tim Burton Batman is good but this one sucks.
