I did not see this movie. Filming style may be common to some, but it is considered to be megrain-motivating. I think I might have a very interesting plot, but I could not see it for a long time because I missed a lot. My brain brand of flickering images and stop motion filming. I stopped watching in the middle and did not return for a second attempt. If some of my own lighthouse is home alone, it can be just a ticket ... It is not clear that the lighthouse / film style was considered a spoiler, but I was blacklisted in my first review;)
