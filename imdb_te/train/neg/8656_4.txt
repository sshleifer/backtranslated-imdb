This is the first non-zombie subtitle review full of ive but worth doing a review for this movie. Dinocroc is usually a good movie but unfortunately still a clear b-movie. Dynocroc also appeared great but I thought it needed a little more weight in action and violence in the film, as Crock was shown or in the scene of the show and the crook was shown in the process of excluding or recurring. Jane Lanenecker is hot and the acting average is the best and most surprising thing is that crock caron coughs look like cows instead of cows * cotton. I enjoyed this film glad enough to go there with a sequel than it would normally say about some movies. A total of 3/6 stars and a watch value.
