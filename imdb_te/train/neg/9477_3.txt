It was one of the most horrific clashes ever and only 2 games were saved. Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Fowler, Vince McMahon also against Shawn Michaels. The main ceremony between Cena and Triple H was a wash-and-out, I was asleep, and it was alert, with the Undertaker missing in the casket and the Jackie and Booker T full joke. If you're really a big fan of WWE, you probably would like it if the WWF and the opening days of RestaurantMay 17 and 19 missed out. But I found that this WrestleMania is very much left.
