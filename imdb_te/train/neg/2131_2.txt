I want to see this action comedy with a sarcastic twist (this movie is being advertised) but this has failed me very badly. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I lost interest fast. I'm very sorry for John Cusack, Jon Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tommy and Hilary Duff to take part in the film. I will be a fan of them all but the only time to heal my feeling over this time. One thing I can say about this film is that Hillary I did not recognize Halley very well. It took some scenes to realize that she was. Fortunately I rented the red box for $ 1; I paid to see on the big screen, I'm really mistaken !!
