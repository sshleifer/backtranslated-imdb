This is "The F.B.I." Reid Hadley, starring all-star guest! The film begins with a dangerous (favorable?) Kidnapping, which leads to one thing and another - it refers to the main story, "Big House, U.S.A." Jail break story. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's more like a TV show, more "violent" (for times). <br /> <br /> But - a tour of the cast! The film: Ralph Miqar was sent to prison; His cell members are the following criminals: Brady Crawford, Lone Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading "muscle" magazine), and William Talman ("Detective"!). Honest! When you get an opening scene at the end of the "Voiceover", you know what happens to the "missing" boy. If you do not have that hanging, do not miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (such as Peter Votrien Runaway Asthmatic). <br /> * Big House, U.S.A. (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Micker, Reid Hadley
