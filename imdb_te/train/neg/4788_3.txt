In the third entry of the Fantas series, Mike and Reggie, a black G.I. Jane and Mike's dead brother's soul (he died in the original phantom). No 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, because it is much less inspired and exciting in acting and black comedy Phantas II. I am a stand-up comedian and have insisted on his talent in regency's inefficiency. The humor in the previous movie is very dry and oppressed, so this is a lot like the story better suited. Also, the settings are not terrible here, plus the persistent presence of the longest man (Agnus Schrim) is not clear? Satisfactory half of this time is not more or less half. By the way, it shows the most joyous murders on the screen beware for a seriously cut version. The entire Phantomous series Don Caskarelli's lifetime accomplishment, he has written and directed the 4 episodes so far and is in the fifth production. The first is semi-cult classic, the second is the scary dinner and violence and the rest are easily skipped. Michael Baldwin returns as a mike, though he plays his role in James Legros Fantas II.
