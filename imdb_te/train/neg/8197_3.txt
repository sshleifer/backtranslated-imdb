I saw this movie tonight and it was a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but he is less than a remake of the classic "Santa Claus the Movie" for the funny and movie 80s, but he is more unhappy with the camp or the bad Shinaya Easton song. The story is in the story .The story is with your run of the mill black sheep in the family who returned to face his family kind of vacation but with its fit North Pole. Fred (Vince Vaughn) returns home after his girlfriend (Rafael Weisz in a guest role), who comes home to face his parents and his successful brother Santa Claus (Paul Giyatti) and the absurd high jinks with a sibling contest bit and all The whole Christmas threats a bit. Now if you know about the ending of this film, the hill is imaginable because you think it's right. For acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but ends up more annoying than he likes, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but she plays Santa's assistant in Elizabeth Banks, than a note lesser role but she is not a nursing joke and poor Kevin Spacey Plays a greater role in the role than the other, He plays the same person who plays in the film "Glengrey Glen Ross", but slightly more confident. Paul Giamatti, the two actors who came from this film, have real honesty and warms the role of Santa Claus, but the film is getting worse and you can not blame him and Rachel. Wajz, who plays a much smaller role than most of the main actors, is an insult Both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giatti give this script Better than ever. <br /> In a nutshell, to keep a major disappointment.
