Why is this show so popular? That's why I liked it. I think one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> While it is very popular, I have tried more than once to see and I can not do it through the whole episode. <br /> <br /> For one thing, it's terrible. Everybody is looking at where the annoying point is. They speak in unnatural sounds, use unnatural tones and have a weakened body language. I saw good performances in a kindergarten school drama. <br /> <br /> For another thing, it's not funny. The plot is dull. They are not creatively, intelligent, or funny. Is not a sitcom funny? Why am i laughing <br /> Finally, what's the money about this? <br /> <br /> "Hey Days" is roughly seventy. <br /> What's with Oh and Ashton Kutcher? Who cast this untalented dweeb? Are movies now? Oh, save us all! <br /> If people think this is quality television, it does not bother me.
