Every time, somebody is looking out of the blue and asks, "What's with SNITCHD?" I immediately knew they had just the hidden entertainment case + of horror. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify some points about this "interesting life experience." In fact, SNITCHDD is called a hard heat. I met James Cahill in July 1999, and I was not distributed even with festive speeches like Triyung Square, the most indie attributes of a great little 35mm feature era ... it's a sensational experimental feature deal with the permanent sufferer of the SAG's fine print. <br /> I'm on a roll, and James filmed my little gangsters with 16 mm. And pace break with a $ 25,000 shooting budget. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believe in the myth back. <br /> <br /> Let's call "movie school" for the most initiative. SNITCH'D was filmed at Alyos Viejo and Santa Ana, CA for two weeks in August 1999. Cahill taught drama at the high school (yes, he was a drama and an English teacher ... even when watching the film, or even using the apostrophe title), so the positions and cast. /> <br /> Note LA's Channel 2 Morning News in his cast is atmospheric girl Vera Jimenez, and Eva Longoria's debut, only in Hollywood, the only known dramatic performance that I am interested in getting a picture under his belt. I should focus on her professional commitment and motivate the "let's it" attitude and she is a step-by-step forward. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D Distributed Optics, a few lights or electricity, many boom operators do-jour, and an inaccurate off line for fake. Anyway, as of 2003, this movie was sold to distributors (net loss, I understand) no one was able to get clear picture of what the box (then she's a rising, working name) but a standard Latino gangster to give SNITCH'D credibility Who carried out Cahill's other hobby is due to the ancient book dealings, that is, it is true that you can trust that this DVD is based on its sleeve. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now in a soap, and I met James for a day, he painted a simple short film, SPLIT SECOND, despite the intention of the festival No game played. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was assigned to shoot another Cahill film called Jress in Mexico. I finished this process. Casting, script and staff control is in my role, the resulting film is actually in Direcils, a cheap detective story about the mass murder of girls in Jurez; Despite the arguments here and there, the film was never seen in any festival or stage, although the film was repeatedly distributed and Border Town, with the release of two studio films DVD release on the same issue.
