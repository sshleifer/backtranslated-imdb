The real disappointing from the great visual master Ridley Scott. GI Jane tells the story of the first lady to go through hellish secrets at Navy Seals. The training was very difficult and difficult because Demi Moore trained the film's lead character O'Neill. This movie does not have a specific message or point or it is not able to reach it correctly. This may be a type of women's rights and abilities statement, but it will eventually sink to the end of the film in tired scenes and stupid gun combat. <br /> <br /> I can not really understand why Ridley is used. Many zooms mentioned in the last gun battle in the desert? I really wanted to know what the director saw in that manner, so it was very intelligent and irritating and irritated. When I saw his latest film Black Hawk Dawn, war scenes (they were plenty) were totally incorrect and they were very intense and skillfully directed. G.I. The whole ending in <br /> <br /> This is my opinion Ridley Scott's worst movie and there are not any significant touches that this great director knows. <br /> <br /> I still saw this in Widescreen format as there are still great scenes and patterns in the film. <br /> <br /> They are very few in the film. (Blade Runner, Tlma & Louise, Eliani and etc.) This talented director. I'm G.I. Jane 4/10.
