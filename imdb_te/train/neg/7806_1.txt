Poor Michael Madsen; He must know that he is aware of this horrible film kicking himself. I can not really think of the worries I've ever seen except for amateur romance. It's bad, and here it is; <br /> <br /> My question is: "Hey hell put $$$ at this doggy daiso? At least we saw Michael's sister Virginia nude, but I do not think I would save this sticker too. I want to know for a cool guy who made some exemplary films that the incomplete church sponsors these pieces.
