Fallen Vance begins with the archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper von Dean) in a desert found in a mound of 42 feet tall giant, now you can not see it everyday. Matt is working for Property Developer Morton (Robert Wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on Earth and he calls fellow archaeologist Angela (Kristen Miller) for reasons I'm not sure. If some of the team fails, try to figure out what they have in hand, Morton calls on the security person Ammon (Navid Negeban) to handle this situation. Meanwhile the ancient text translator Rabbi Eli Schmidt (Tom Bosley) translates some ancient text (he will) and is surprised to learn these giants and learn an evil prophecy to bring the world to Fallen One. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, I was personally a fierce film by Fallen Vance personally, until Kevin vanhook, who wrote the smallest character as the hero of the ancient warriors, There's a lot of things that are bad about the technical & conceptual level about Fallen One, the script is not very problematic & it's not really going until the last 20 minutes. I've lost the desire to live almost. Casper van Dean is going to be saving the day and it's not surprisingly coming up, the character's you are as horrible & clich like a clich√©, much of the conversation, too bad & bad as the whole movie predictable? It is not surprising that the mummified giant is coming back to life, waiting for an hour to attract more audience to the audience. It's bad, very bad. You are alerted. <br /> <br /> Director VanHook does not impress, fight scenes are totally terrifying and why are your evil people purple? They see the napkin. It is good to have special effects on a large mommy to give it a bit, although most of them do not have any effect on the mummy (1999) unfortunately, Waste like relief. The mechanical mommy is pretty good idea but it's crazy and no one can work together on the ground, it can work in every other sync to work, in fact I think of a more ridiculous idea. <br /> Technically the Fallen One is not unique, is not unique from impressive giant mummies. The effects are not happy about her. Devil CGI & Water Effects are terrible, it's made for TV & it has performances. The acting was poor, Wagner suffered, which is the only thing that Dean & Bosley's likes are today. <br /> <br /> Fallen ones is a bad movie, there are no two ways about it. I'm worried. Do not recommend any level or any kind, one to avoid.
