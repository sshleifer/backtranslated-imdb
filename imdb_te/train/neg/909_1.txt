Never have to be excused for a movie anytime. As it is portrayed, lit, acting etc. It's very hard to see. Loads of clips are bored. The whole picture shows that the 'normal' person and 'outside world' exist, which just does not exist. And why that bald man suddenly becomes invincible? This film is stupid. Zero.
