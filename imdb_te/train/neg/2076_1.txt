Well I must say perhaps the worst movie I have seen this year! Jokes are very crude (which did not expect from PG movie) (Rated PG in Canada) and they are not funny! With this great cast I guess at least some good acting but I did not even get that. I was a huge Rhine Wilson fan and I was disappointed by his performance the first time. Luke Wilson or Uma Thurman's characters are not at least bit favored and I really think what happened to one of them. This film director (for example Six Days, Seven Nights) I really liked the other movies in the film. I did not expect this way. This film is not worth $ 10 and I strongly encourage you not to watch this movie. You are assuring me that I will do this for the film.
