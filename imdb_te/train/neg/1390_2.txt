I have a big fan of the B5, only catch at the end of the season three. When I was a syndicated, I had seen in all previous seasons that it was one of the most well-known stories on television. Even filler components are interesting. The films were also well produced and entertained to entertain theaters. <br /> <br /> It comes to us 'River of Souls'. Obviously, after seeing all the other stuff, I have high expectations. Martin Sheen will be starring in an Ed-Wood movie without a serious size-fiction story. The story itself may have looked good in the outline form, also made the story board. However, it was apparently disturbed when it came time to fill this idea into a two-hour movie. Without the complete absence of a comprehensive narrative we have no special effects to keep entertaining. They perfectly improved the conversation to fill in the shortest places and stories. If it happened in the regular season, it was the worst of the episodes.
