Badly done. The horror acting and the ending of the director's somewhere out there is clearly no less dull film. <br /> <br /> In the Gizon Film Festival, the film is shocked to be considered for the award. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came from the theater has the same opinion - what is the production of the movie itself? The references to Iraq are not grotesque or wrong. This film was released - very, very frustrating and waste my time. Sorry, a terrible negative review but hopefully some will be put down by the same mistake. If we do not have Q and A at the end of the picture - now it's interesting.
