Like Freddie Revenge, this sequel takes up pretty unpleasant idea and does not go too long to draw a story. Usually Alice is pregnant and pregnant with her baby Freddie, who gives her a shop to hunt her friends. At least the deaths and intellect-fractures from the whole series are poor, so horror fans or comedy fans are not happy. <br /> I'm not all about to tell you about this. It is mediocre interesting to come back from four characters from Alice and Don's characters, but it is not worth watching a movie. Uninspiring and unpleasant is probably the worst in this series, only to the competitor.
