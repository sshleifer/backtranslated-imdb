The story of the real life story is bad. They do not understand much when they show us this bad image. I said bad because there are some reasons. 1. Madonna is wealthy and if she can do everything, why does she fall in love with that bad man? How strong is the story narrative? She is very rich, able to do everything she can, but her husband is far from impossible to divorce. <br /> <br /> The words I love you are nothing in this film.
