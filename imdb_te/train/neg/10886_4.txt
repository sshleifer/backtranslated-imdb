I saw the convent for the second time. I enjoyed it before and I found that a good drunken Friday night film, some gore, some style, a bit of humor and the like. I no longer appreciate it. One of the modern viewers seemed to have set up someone to rebuild Cheeseballs myth as Demons' Night, but lost all the original merchandise. For the record I'm not a huge fan of Demons Night, but there are some things I really dug about. Convent cheese makes but not much of durability. The main girl (the likeable performance from Joanna Pargana), gotten girl and Adrian Barbeau are pretty much like a sweet guest from all the characters, festering offensive jockhood, festering at the lowest level, exclusive. The film is then gravely gravely spoken, and it is difficult to see the characters to appreciate the good points on the film and the difficulty of the absence of inappropriate nudity can be damaged. The evil nuns get lots of original and good sights in design, but the frightening ones are definitely kinda cool, and the image is also a nice overall gore gore. In the end, when the Adrienne barbecue scene is the picture will be the most entertaining cause of all the bad people dead and bashing its a bad nun. Stylized direction also provides occasional good results, sometimes the camera moves very fast. All in all, this is the picture where shining good points for me can not make for things I hated. This is a great fan of this kind of image, but it is not a good time for me.
