After reading a positive review in the New York Times, I look forward to watching this movie. Moreover, I'm also Shanghai, so there's more than one passage in the subject matter. However, after looking at it, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Film pace is dull and unchanged. The director lasted a few scenes for a long time. There is no desire or chemistry between lovers. There's no conversation. A lot of dialogue is required to pay for lack of performance. At the end of the film, you do not feel any compassion for the characters. This movie is not all. This script is weak, acting poor, and edits do not exist. The director tried to imitate some Noir movie genres but failed miserably. A good image captures your attention, it maintains and succeeds in the end without feeling you are out of time. The film never ends. Do not waste your money in this movie.
