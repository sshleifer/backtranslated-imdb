I'm a fan of Spike Lee in general. It may take some time to really get into his "Mojo", but when you see a clear message and a story close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike the 25th Hour or Bambozlett (two of my favorite movies), the film does not have a clear story. I was able to understand the fight between Washington and others well-influenced or influencing the choice, but Lee has not had a real feel for some odd reason. Washington has done a good job of handing him over, but you can say it is not Lee's favorite movie. Lee did not direct the film, but he also wrote. Tell you. Camera work is terrific and contributed to the decay of the film. The entire circle is coming and it is not beautiful. The film with Lee Do the Right Thing is not 100%. It is the brightest and most modest of his films in all of Lee's films. This is almost as if he had created one instead of the Hollywood film. I do not know if he saw money from the right thing and walked with it or what? But the film did not show its true talent. <br /> <br /> For anyone looking at the movie, it is possible to stop watching anything that Spike Lee has directed. Do not make me wrong, I see exactly where you come from with this picture and why you would like to back it up, but Lee will grow up. His work is more of her, and you can see the transition from the desire to make money with the intention of doing good films. It took some time to see the 25th Hour, but when I was doing it, it was very bright. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an incredible image into a man's journey into an unknown image. I guess that's hoping to get out of 'Mo' Better Blues. This truly dark journey into a person's life that has never really grown up, but instead I got to be being Denzel Denzel. <br /> <br /> He is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I will consider him to watch the Sydney Poetier movie, but not the film to show his talent. One of Spike's sister's love tastes. I do not know about you and your family, but I do not think I have sex scenes with my sister. Who or how the actor is paid, I can never do it. This is not what I want to see, but obviously it's different for spike. He went ahead and showed his sister full nude picture without any apology. It was sad and it also made me blush. Also, this answer to me requires someone. Flavor Flow What is the introduction of this film? So, sitting on my bed and ready to start the film, suddenly there was a voice from the previous spelling studio that made this movie, then he agreed to himself. It was not built for the rest of the story. Once again, I thought Lee made money in exchange for realistic talent in the film. <br /> <br /> Dancel and Wesley face similar difficulties in the film. <br /> <br /> There are two great scenes in the film. Do not make me wrong, it's a bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every lane. The scene is forgotten when Bleek accidentally mesmerizes a woman with her. He constantly went back, Lee was actually behind the camera proving, causing confusion. This is a scene where you can lose shuffle due to poor scenes. The other way worth seeing is the introduction of Lee and the way the movie ended. By keeping the same speed and direction, he gives this tragic character around the full circle and gives the opportunity to change his life. The rest of the film is much worse than these two seconds, if you do not go blind, you will not see it. <br /> Grade: ** *****
