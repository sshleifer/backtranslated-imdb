The main character's name (Fr√º) is the German word for "women". I do not know whether it was deliberate or not, but it was grossing some of the German audience at the Phantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But the film came out. It's not for gossiping, it's a horrible movie for heaven! More than one sense is a terrible picture. It's a shame that a premise like that is wasted with terrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definetely not for the clarity of the heart!)! It does not even need to show all the things shown. I'm not even morally obliged (because movies are not really work or function), there is talk about what's shown here, but it's a whole new year in the whole "Violence Movement"!
