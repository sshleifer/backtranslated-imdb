If you liked the first two movies, then sorry to say you do not like this one. It's really worse and unnecessary for the video, perhaps making a TV sequel. Wayne Ezlinsky (Rick Morrisis) is still idiot but still lives with his family and his own company, Salsinsky Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne Stupid's statue and his brother. He then decreases his wife and sister. Adults now have a way to get kids home to get them bigger. The other two reps that contain one or two new things are pretty good, e.g. A toy car roller coaster, swimming, etc. Pretty poor!
