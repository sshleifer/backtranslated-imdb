9, the movie that I was waiting for for months ... Then it was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the development of 9 story and strange character. All the amazing action sequences in the world do not make for a symphithetic character. <br /> <br /> The strange and occult scenes are not the only thrown out space, but they are angry. Story about robots and scientists ... will it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mysterious symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of answering instead of the awesome scary storytelling? <br /> How and when, when, why, and .... Asked questions only when you care about it and it's less and less to stay away from the theater. <br /> <br /> The film is very frustrating because of the depth of the story .... The story is good but I see this film in the movie. But filmmakers rely on the name of CGI magician and Tim Burtons. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
