It is one of the most interesting events in WWII and the war behind the front row of dry and clean feature filming. The storyline that killed Hitler was bad for the movie's bad play. Tom Cruise wants to be the highest rank commander in the country to question his deepest thoughts and traps in the country. I believe Mr. Binn would play well. Generally speaking, since 2004 the film looked good as a cheap copy of a good German TV movie "Stauffenberg", but no film could be close to the film on the subject. However, the film will definitely get its financial goal with the pop-corn audience that plays Hollywood fast mood blood and shallow art values.
