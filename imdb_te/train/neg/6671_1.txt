I started this film well. Even if the real acting was not completely out of sight, I thought that acting was symbolic and all the characters. Father did not get enough information to really feel his pain for his enmity or to build up for his enmity. I see him in a scene that you appreciate her for density, and in another scene he takes her head. Another problem with this film is that it is only marginal, and ultimately losing all the attention, and I'll lose it. With such long films and painful ending, no film can take just 7 or more of the performance to just a performance. We are seeing all the quality of cinematic experience. The ending of this film is pretty cool and I have just thought seriously walking from the theater. The film took me back.
