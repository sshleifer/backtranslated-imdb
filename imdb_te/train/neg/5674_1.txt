My God, what's going to happen? An Owl Boll movie and positive comments? <br /> <br /> It's nice to notice that reviews of boll are coming from new ones. As I mentioned in previous Uwe Boll reviews, I see only his pictures, one day he was hoping he would do some good. <br /> Oops, the seed is not that day. I'm starting to make a slow start in the horror film Seed. The thing to remember is that the way that all sickos of the world viewed the video or the net of various illnesses in the net is the way that ..... or so Mr Boll believes. I do not know why in the first 10 minutes of the film the real animal abuse and murders are needed. I understand the feeling that Seed (killer) is enjoying a sickness and such stuff. But Mr Bole does not mean why he wanted to show real footage in the film. Maybe shock us ..... Well, I'm not a disgrace and can handle anything in the picture. Nevertheless, I do not recognize the real animal cruelty footage being a little fun. If you're trying to shock me, it does not work. It reminded me of how the world was in chaos because such things were happening and allowed Uwe Boll to continue with movies. In this case, 70/80's (cannibal Holocaust) can work for movies, but not for today's market. <br /> <br /> In this film, give a very inexpensive feel to all rounds like Blood Right 2. There is no large amount of money around the product. <br /> <br /> In general, Mr. Bol has been producing a good story because he is treating bore shots of police officers looking for different videos of seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each one of these videos ends in the victim's rapid decamp. It is very boring and tedious. <br /> If you sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be treated by walking to police officers. A very dark house to catch the seed. The lighting here is terrible and Uwe old 'I'm not using a stable cam' with Fisco he did with Blood Right 2. The police officers always look like stupidly die in ways that point up to the point as the CD caught. You need to see this view to see it. Cop tells him that he may have shot Seed. For some unknown reasons, the police will not shoot him. <br /> <br /> From here we will treat a stupid execution scene, and then the seed will kill both children and adults. <br /> <br /> If Seed survives the cops (and why he is alive, why not shoot him in the head?), And then out of seed ground, then some killing a random woman with a hammer and kidnapping a kid. Trying to make it plain stupid! It's not even the Hollywood horror stupid .... just plain mute. Uve Boll could not direct ****. Anyone with any ounce of taste will agree with that announcement. Anyone watching this movie and anyone in the way of shape or form in any way requires a serious consideration for themselves as a person. <br /> Once again, we treat the UB garbage that is unfortunately, directed, directed, produced, produced, and scripted.
