* Warning - No Plato Spoilers Forward, But Cinema Spoilers ... * My famous other hired me thinking it would be a wonderful romance with all the cast. Wow - very wrong. This film requires an overdone, overwhelming and overly sentimental film to release the student film after 15 years! The boxing date in the box began in 2005, but in the first flashback sequence I noticed that I was looking at clothes and hair in the early 1960s, and especially in the late 80s / early 90s. It seemed to be reminiscent of the rest of the movie 15 or 20 years ago! We're trying to be 60 years for the 60s or 21st century ... then the main character's adult colleague, and he looks like a boy in the pastimes scenes (although this is a different, old-fashioned character, whose youth is in retrospect). All the flashbacks, which were filmed in the 1990s, a full student movie of this same title - I was totally confused until the small image also saw the special features I had! It also has a commentary that has raised all of the little boy (actually co-worker in the 2005 scenes). In this way, this film is a shell story shell wrapped around an old, back cut student film is not clear to get it in the running of the theater together. Shell Story, filmed in 2005, mostly finds herself a wife and lover at the dance class and promises healing and redemption at the dance class, assuring him that he will be present at his place (at the beginning of the 60th year of the promise of the deceased person "in the fifth month of the fifth month of the new millennium On the fifth day, the episodes around the old picture in 2005 There's no need to shoot these new scenes and the plot is nothing but the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats Ad Nasam on every new scenery and new image-expanding cliched action. You never heard about this film, the famous cast - it's terrible.
