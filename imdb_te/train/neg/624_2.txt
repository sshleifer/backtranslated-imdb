The director mentioned in the film Behind-The-Scenes, which loves horror films. He dedicated them to other prominent directors, such as George A. Romero and Tob Hooper, along with Dario Argonto. Basically the film is dedicated to those great directors to give your mother a piece for Mother's Day. Casting the first thing they did wrong. Cast people ACT. Also, one wrongly, not the cast of the 40-year-old man for the role of 18-year-old monk. That's right, he has been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people who see their friends are out of their hearts and amusing. Or a person cuts the ear in an ear in an ear (like a hawah), and his girlfriend just goes, "Ohh .. your god?" Scarecrow itself is very character. <br /> <br /> This film has a ransom factor ... Oh wait, it does not. <br /> <br /> If you have to watch this film, just watch the rock and roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a really gnarly song dude.
