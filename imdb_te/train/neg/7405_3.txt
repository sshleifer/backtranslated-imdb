I really think they let the quality of the DVD product get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie shops and for the second time I finally tried to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried. <br /> Does anyone have this problem? It's really hard to give an unreasonable review of the image after going through such hassle to play it. For one, I did not see a Finnish horror film so I sort of bummed the film was made in English. Since it never cleared what was wrong with Sarah, she just came up as retarded and I really hoped to just shoot her in the face of someone and go away all the terrible events.
