2001 WWF Survivor Series <br /> One of the most deadly events in 2001. Probably the fact that it did not follow much of the last Survivor series. There is only one Survival Series competition. And that Survivor Series match lasted 45 minutes. Moreover, anyone with a working brain is dominated by his team with Austin and The Rock vs. Rock. And the event does not launch me before the preview. No matter who is going to die f *** ink is no matter who is. That does not necessarily mean all of the hype. <br /> <br /> With respect to the remaining matches: The first match reflects his European title on Christian Al Snow. It's fine to see a good fast-paced match and a good match-winning heel. William Regal versus Tajiari Boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. The Edge vs. Test is good but not great. Tag titles are the best match for the steel cage match evening. War royal went for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. Women's title match is not great. No, not slight. The main program must be the most hypocritical competition in history. Despite the loss of the alliance, it was estimated that each constituency was returning after five months. This match is poor. Rock 3 was removed and Jericho 2 was removed. Rock was also caught in his acting when the invasion began. Jericho end the whole tournament. I'm going to have 2 if they want to be deleted. Everyone knows that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker just falling guys. 7 matches for Survivor Series are not enough. If a Survivor Series is never as bad as this again
