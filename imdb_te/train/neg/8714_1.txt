I can not stop laughing !! This movie is very funny and stupid! But, it's very fun, it never minds! In this movie, you do not have to pay attention to anything! Acting is the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are identical - rubber (oh, I have to see a stick with a T-Rex head for a moment). Expensive is from Karnas 2, T-Rex is the same, but ... Some scenes his head is great and it looks from the kindergarten to project failure. Action fast, sometimes very fast, in fact I talk about fast editing, so that they can not see rubber dinosaurs so that they can be edited very quickly, but OOPPS! Lately, they are rubber! <br /> <br /> Rick Dean in this sequel is the only interesting thing here. <br /> What can I say ... if you do not rent ... watch with friends on TV, it's a lot more entertaining!
