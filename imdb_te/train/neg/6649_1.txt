Well, honestly, this movie is great or good even delusional or director, writer and producers knows and tries to raise the bass in the film. I saw the movie because a friend did it and it was terrible. I was an actress and worked for big films and independents for some time in the industry and the film bore me tears. This film is obviously different because in "mice and men" I am very strict because it's such a terrible ripple story because they have to sue. In an industry that is creatively bankrupt for Hollywood ... someone is going to take a classic book and film called "Mice and Men" and destroy me with a new spin bugs. Actors, accents, dialogue and direction are enthusiastic and writing is tough. If you want to take your new spin in the existing story, your new spin is better or better than the original. I do not like this movie yet.
