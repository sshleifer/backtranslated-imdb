One of the Leamer wedding films you see. Its time period has a lot of smasms, so it has expired before the theaters hit. Race stereotypes are like the Honey Youngman joke, where they are at least bit funny. Molly Ringwald, what else to say. Give a clue of silliness, because she will put bandages on a ten cap and keeps it as a rag, because she will not have me, she will destroy a $ 10,000 wedding dress, and smiles her neck ring pretty much at her moxy than everyone else. Its a helluva cast included, how to check how heavy the Ally Sheedi. Wheeeew!
