I saw the 3 episodes of Caveman, and I continued to look forward to seeing why. <br /> <br /> For me, this show has just fallen into commercials, without realistic comedy. <br /> When we were sitting around watching these programs, we all thought of what we had expected. <br /> The attitude of the cave-woman to the woman is actually big, yes, that's right for us. </ P> <p> <p> I think it was a pretty good reviewer, but I say, Cavemen is a comparable old show, my mother , Car. I will give 1, because 1 is better than 1 and they actually spend money on it.
