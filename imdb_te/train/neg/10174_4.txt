When I was finally released, I saw back in '94. <br /> <br /> Since Orion has been in bankruptcy, the film was not released a few years ago. <br /> <br /> As I have not seen for a while, I remember a very slick picture. I discussed whether or not I should go out. This shop is neither interesting nor attractive. 3rd American America Graffiti Simulation. <br /> No shows can be seen. One of the greatest despair after the local newspaper critique best rating.
