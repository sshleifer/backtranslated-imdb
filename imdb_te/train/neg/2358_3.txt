In 2001's future, Freddie was followed by Elm Street's last surviving teenager. Any fear of unfunny trials at the humor and unnecessary celebrity camoules (Rowenne? Tom Arnold ?? !! WTF?), This episode involves Part 2, which has always been raped by demonic children. Wow this rubbish piece. The great legendary Alice Cooper can not get away with the stench of the film. And does Freddy have any daughter when they are hell? The whole picture is radically ever retarded in unilateral way, shape & form. <br /> <br /> Go to the 3D scenery and jump to a nightmare choices (the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set can be found for additional items for this image) ) <br /> DVD-Rom content: trivia game; screenplay; and web link
