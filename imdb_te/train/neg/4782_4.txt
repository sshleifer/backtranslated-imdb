Was the first time seen 12/24/2009 ?? 10 to 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas Fluffy for his family to take them for Christmas so that the emotional Christmas can not really get the fluff. The three children in the family were then Washington D.C. to deter the then-president Herbert Hoover. Run from home on the trek. The Trek offers a handful of stories, such as a hobby and a puppet with a puppet, which makes a kind of story like Disney's "Run on the Animals" film and is quite similar here. In the end, no details about how the President's family has helped, and in my opinion, there is another deterioration in the film. The film will ultimately bring tears, but it will take a long time. The film does not need to be the original TV movie (according to IMDb), but is there any obvious fade-outs that looks like this? So I'm not sure their information is accurate. All in all, this is a simple picture with a joyous Christmas story (which could have been more complicated) but blandly portrayed and without a lot of ingredient.
