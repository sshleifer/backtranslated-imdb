I wanted to give the benefit of drawing blood early doubt. The moves made by a naked woman and the painter, Diana, was a kick-donkey-vampire movie to paint her and breathe her blood to use it for her art. This early stamp is wrong. Oh, Troma, a kind of unusual quality: sometimes they are junk-food craft (or sometimes not) worse but funny and some competitive. Humor (ie who is the father of the character Jimmy Durante?) Are the weakest and smudge in the direction of the Sergio Lapel bargain basement. <br /> It is not without trying him, o Lord number. He makes a lot of effort, a big part of the problem. I'm blind my eyes in many cases, and his DP really is the basic 3 - sulking in my seat, as he and his producers make money for the lights, but they are a former student filmmaker and enthusiastic director, as they used in the film: Think of whether or not the point lighting can be understood. At this time, the film producer * scripts are not too funny or horrific (and it's not) or in extreme grotesque periods, along with a very poor sound design (or a lot of random laughing humming like the art gallery scene) Lapel can also be overcome if the song's unnatural mix is ​​included. <br /> If it's not a good film at all and you're a vampire die hard (or just a vampire), it's a low rental bargain substitute for grapes, or a slightly better improvement of 1972's Blood Freak . Overall you have good ways to waste your time.
