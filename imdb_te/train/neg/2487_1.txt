"Rambo," in some "Miami Vice" Cut down the budget of about 80% and if you have a large periard of ten years old boys and you have so much access to the "penthouse". Cap and former Commando McBain (known as the bus, and Macbain, who find him as insane as they are coming) hires a stolen & hidden American supertank in Mexico. The hardbitten seize with the tank was made. Major O Rourke (Jones) & McBin's former love Devon (Fleuigel), the dominant officer & now for the unmarried militants / spies / drug peddlers, who is grotesque, blah, blah, blah. Action movie with perceived sex, drought of action and not too sex. The running joke is McCain's shot by killing all the bombs and keeps the bullets memorable. Apparently the authors do not see "the magnificent seventeen" ("like the man who faces the man"), and Macbain does not even think of acting intellectual. Even for a budget action, there are long-range shots during production values ​​dialogue and very little movement. The main campaign, tank, is silly enough for an Ed Wood product. Flegel, who has a blonde Julia Roberts (she might have a very big role in "Crime Story" than Julia) might have had to go from butt-kicking & back frightened with an urgent notice. Jones, who's in the spectacular range of movies, hits right here pretty much hit. Both he and the bus are going for some easy money and a laughing couple. See the talented, future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," "Once Upon a Time in Mexico"). Even the most lukewarm for a flawed pleasure, "bulletproof" is still sound enough to play when you leave your home, but people think there is someone in the house.
