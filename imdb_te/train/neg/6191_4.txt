I saw this movie, and I was able to get my hands together with each other - including watching dramatics in some dramatic research. Cinematography is very much like music. Unfortunately, all life has been removed from this article. I've never seen a horrible role of Mr. Rochester. His basic characteristics are gone. Where is his wit? Where is his hobby? Scott's Rochester Rochester's foil is similar to the character from St John, the novel. In fact, the actor playing St John's role plays the role of St Jon, who needs to look at the scrap pieces or to the ceiling (which he does at all times). I do not know what they think. The film would like to vote a little more on the basis of excellent music and cinematography but George C. Because of Scott's performance I can not be honest to see this film for a long time.
