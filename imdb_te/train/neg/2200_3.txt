I love the evil shark movies. I really do. I laugh at them. And Siffer Chanel had a marathon in them, their new original film, Hammer Head premiered: Shark Frenzy. Based on the previews, it looked like it was going to be very fun. Especially the remake of the creature of the bench, really. This is the shark attack 3: the previous show with Megaldoen's performance, which is fine in the film Shark. I'm in a mood; I'm ready. Take it, hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! <br /> <br /> It is very bad, the ideological reproduction of my friends. Suspended a seductive girl The shark-human hybrid embryo was strangled to a table with the mad scientist intentionally throwing her head in her womb ... Jesus monkeys. <br /> <br /> How the plot works My son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with a puppy shark because the sharks do not surrender to cancer and regenerate by dialects Oh I see human race I created the next evolution! I know! Reproduction let iki! But if the shark janyuvulanni vampire my son, sending it into the heaven of his small forest to keep the heat of the rape of children, he keeps eating him. But check this out! Between random people, through some twisted plot twists, my research ended on the island, the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died! I bet he'll do! All this leads to a very touching and heartfelt reunion: Woman: You're going to impregnate me? Mad scientist: no. He. (Referring to shark-person in the tank) how sweet. <br /> Do not see this movie. Never.
