I do not think you can be very bad in this regard. What do you get with bad actors, fake organs, and three stupid stories? <br /> <br /> The first story displays the bad quality of the video and the acting is really painful to you, especially if you are a grand bun on a bit of ears as a grandmother at the age of 25. Plus, the man is okay, but the woman is just ugly. "You look very good!" NOT! This is a werewolf I say one is the best one out of all three, but it's not all that impressive because it's all bad dresses. Woman is good enough for Halloween after the face on the but it is not for a wolf image. <br /> You get worse stories. There are two lesbians in this later, completely ridiculous. Overall "I want to be a wolf" "How can you do this to me?" It's crazy to say. Now asked for more! <br /> <br /> The third is no point ... It is not yet interesting that nearly forty-five minutes running and boring story makes this story and the whole switch stuff. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... some can not hear, it's stupid. Animals like rat or pig are stupid. Can not they use lioness sounds? Can not imagine, use good films. Well, I'm good with you = you enjoy B-rates. Since I'm a hardcore companion, I've got this movie and I'll buy any Wawwolf film and it's only a must watch, but it's just me. If you want eggs, do not waste your money. I will not ask you!
