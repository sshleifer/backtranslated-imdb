<br /> <br /> I think this remake trailer is absolutely guaranteed. /> <br /> Jovovich to listen to the voice of the lazy American <br "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." he says. I am sick. The set does not look all the Roman ... it looks like the backdrop of some great actor's Hollywood building, and Roman clothing looks like cheap garbage you buy at a suburban clothing store <br /> <br> /> Sun rian ashes do not know that a movie trailer, his mind is fully alarmed with a fifty-year-old young Hispanic women. <br /> <br /> When I saw the acting, I heard the random actors shouting. "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!" <br /> <br /> Gerard Butler, who is 40 or 50% of the trailer in random sex scenes, and well-known actors / actresses like Courtney Loves, may seem uncomfortable or topped in their minimalist ways 0 will go up. <br /> <br /> Courtney Loves episode She holds herself as her usual dumpy fracture whore self that leaning towards a door mumbling about the moon or something. /> <br /> Karen Black ... Incidentally, just troubling <br smiling, you are screaming visugucendutunnappudu. <br /> <Helen Mirren ... she's original, and she "Caligula" was forced to return to ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I particularly like the "love" (and love, I mean hate) eniya of the line, "... j00 kaligola disabled is something that we * think * .... * j00nalo * look like." /> <br /> It is also honest kaligala of the four <br, that I have ever seen, "art" as the worst, even worse, even worse, the most exploited, the proud self-pieces were inconsistent. Although Gore Vidal hated the original calligraphy, he did not name it for the worst-pile, or how much his name was paid, how much they paid (even if it was a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer ever.
