History is fine but not part of the music. <br /> <br /> If John Adams thinks comic is luxurious, if you feel that you have a funniest relief, <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson are the only characters who can only afford the film. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and slavery are their historical <br /> <br /> It is not enough to overcome the lack of music in the musical group. <br /> <br /> The rest of the songs except for a few songs are not worth the breath.
