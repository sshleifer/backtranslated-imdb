Actors did a good job of playing their roles - especially the mother. However, when the film progresses, I'm looking forward to their performance and I'm not careful for the people. And, at times, I felt the pain again and again through an irresponsible and hands-free way. This daughter is a 17-year-old bath, with celebrated days of celebrity men and dance nifty (full of "snatching" finishes). The son is a self-respecting person, he is very frustrated for a relationship and friends - so far he throws the drug party at the end of the movie. Both husband and wife are frustrated, but do not put their energy into their old age relationship (which spares her new partners), although she is "throws" her - gay-oops!). I felt that I had a hard time caring for all the characters and such shallow impregnances I needed to grow. I think the author's endeavor is to show the full engagement of the capitalist system and the holidays. However, these characters do not belong to the average Western family, and it is perfect.
