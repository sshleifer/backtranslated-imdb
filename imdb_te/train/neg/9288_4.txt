Half Past Dead featuring Steven Siegel in the lead role is a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a live-to-video sequel, an action movie without losing nothing, but has the ability to win something. It is less fun than the first one: in all respects. But even though it's worth it. If you would like to watch in action movies or popcorn sessions, even if you would like to see the former WWE stars on the screen or watch the sequels, whether they are live or not. <br /> <br /> Kuppt has done a good job, while Bill Goldberg is less than average and think he has not done the job. KUMPT is a good comedian, I said. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, Sony does not have a great product. Cinematography is a disaster but is acceptable in the whole direction. However, if you want it, look at it. If you see, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you do not either lose either.
