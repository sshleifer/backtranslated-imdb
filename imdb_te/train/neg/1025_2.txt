Only the question I left behind. Why such a great star cast this movie? Why is it bad to write, is it completely unrelated to all the audience? Why does not it have any sense? Why is it good that the studio needs to have a good campus and "Hollywood" hell out? Why? Movies never understood why they started a good turn into the worst pile in the time of release. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a Bachelor's Degree in Journalism, I hope for the whole story is just a spicy for Osman winners, Freeman. Completely ridiculous. I think ... the script is likely to have a probability, but the death penalty turned out to be a clich√© and terrifying. Just. No.
