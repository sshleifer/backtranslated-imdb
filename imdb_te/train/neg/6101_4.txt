Nearly two person play, and the performances of dialog and leads are important. Which is not good. In fact, if it was originally designed as a two-person drama and worked in a movie, it could be strong. <br /> Anyway, a weird vampire stripper that looks a little autistic (resulting in a very romantic looking at his crappy home). He wants to be told about her daylight light. <br /> He's good to find someone with a one-day job, or a poet who is portraying the words, but they may not be hot bot. He wants to do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good), he intends to feed her at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the sun will rise at any moment. Even though he says he can go without deadline, it will make him hungry. Additionally, he says that since he learned about him he did not let the stripper go, but he went to find out what many others did. There are so many disparities. <br /> <br /> It is so weak that this vampire will live in the house, with all the time in the world, I feel a job, or fixed the place bit by bit. He is not clearly a wealthy bloodthirsty man. <br /> <br /> It is considered remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of Damon's Dance. Although Kat Shia has directed, she is pretty bad, although her other films are directed by Carman (Striped to Kill, Stke II).
