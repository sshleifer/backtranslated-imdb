I see again, I'm physically ill, this film is very painful ... you believe in this in mind, belief and other times. They are called "recreating souls" here. <br /> <br /> This story is repeated with pictures like "Heaven Can Weight". It's also very well done. <br /> <br /> They had to waste the talent of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neill and Mary Stuart Master. <br /> At least this is a beautifully-featured movie, language-knowledge. The only redemption quality of this film is about.
