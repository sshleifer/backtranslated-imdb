This movie is very frustrating. <br /> <br /> The characters are very cool. He is the mother who is the main character, but everything is "mother". Well, she's happy with her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband dies. She goes to visit her son and meets this hunk that sleeps with her daughter and sleeps with him. Until this part, the image is correct. Not amazing, but it can be seen. Guy is fascinating and who can blame her? Well, it's not a lot of moms to sleep with your daughter's lover, but let the allegations on the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> "I started to like this movie and she always wants to be happy with" cheeks "in cheeks while working at her son's home, if she is the only way she gets, The only thing she has learned is that the guy is clearly not very interested (actually, she feels sleeping with her volunteer activities <br /> <br /> She was disappointed when she insulted herself very much. She Craig tells something "I'm in a bald kiss" Ari. <br /> <br /> This film is offensive to women. If it were me, I brought with me the same satisfaction and emotional pain that is too low is to purchase a small object ... :)
