I thought Zombie Fleh Eaters 2 was a good horror film. When a terrorist infected by a stolen chemicals, captured by US military commander, this corpse is burned, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Immediately infected locals become carnivorous hungry zombies and a group of soldiers on a holiday must team up with a group of tourists and they capture themselves in a damaged hotel when they try to kill the living dead. I did not find this movie as good as the original film, Zombie Flush Eaters. But it's still a horror film with good scene. I did not think it was the best in the series. 4/10
