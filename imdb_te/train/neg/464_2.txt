The film is not funny anyway, it tries to be funny with slum humor, the film is just about 2 hours tortured and bored. Throughout the whole movie I'm thinking of something, "It's going to end". One thing you have to give them is that there are very few funny moments, and I've given you all 2 stars. It is unreal and almost every old blonde uses the joke in the book, which is not the first time funny. It is basically a picture of Blues Blondes and a record of Jokes's overall recurrence. <br /> <br /> For the sum of it, this movie has been bad for everyone, watch, it's just bad.
