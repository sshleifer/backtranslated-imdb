Spoilers of both this and the Matrix. <br /> <br /> I am very fond of the original matrix. This is not a deep movie, but it is well-known, fun, and a soft spot for Hong Kong's struggles, although it's the philosophy of Fishburn. <br /> <br /> In the original story, Neo is the happiest cube worker Anderson of the secret life. By day, corporate lazy, and night, brave hacker. Finally, he forces his actions to choose between these lives - he is expelled by the machine or he has started a safe and unforgettable world. Interestingly, he once had a fantasy, life rather than sucks. He had his girlfriend on his side and his family colleagues, but he lives in a processed swing, sweaty clothes, and a real skungy bit of machinery. <br /> <br /> "If I'm there" to the questions that are raised in the audience's mind, _I_ impossible? If I were "The One". <br /> Furthermore, that Agent Smith is a wonderful bad guy, we carry with us the fears of authority. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to Matrix to share his good news free of charge. <br /> <br /> The film is totally unsuccessful to complete through the original film's ideas, and I can not believe that I would like to make these changes in the absence of such poor scripting and poor editing. <br /> <br /> When the dialogue is at fifth grade level, many words have fallen off randomly and I believe that they can understand what they say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> Fischer loses his "advisor" role and does not have anything to replace it. <br /> <br /> Zion people are not particularly <br /> <br /> Special effects difficulties: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the Matrix, you feel that Neo will be lost, and he has become something to survive <br /> <br /> In the Matrix Reloaded, he is a particularly portrayal of the video game's perspective character. <br /> <br /> The fight on the freeway appears to be very fake, and that's not that interesting. <br /> <br / <br /> As I said above, the fight scenes were incomplete. <br /> <br /> This rave was a long time - everyone in my row at the theater was watching their watch. <br /> <br /> We have good dance and good mantras Took a look, but we do not know about the pictures, or do not show that we care. <br /> <br /> However, the hack, even if the creator of the self-confidence to the business will be blacklisted. It's unclear, the script writer has not clearly understood, and the time and passing is the killer waste. The creator's speech may have taken place in the tenth, and more danger "to the rebels to give place, so they do not destroy the matrix, many people who do not believe, the matrix is ​​that the earth does not even support the people in Zion, but only the rest <br /> <br /> D. A man can create a new Zion from Zion, Tall emu, kottukunnamu double blow. Anyone who argues that it is deep, and to ask for the transcript of the sentences to try to break. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "and many reviewers said, Skip. It does not save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Critics who think that the second and third films are "deep" may actually see some really in-depth movies. Perhaps a book or two in rhetoric and discussion can be read and perhaps a bit of philosophy. <br /> <br /> This film is not difficult to understand, but it can be difficult in the stomach. <br /> Scott
