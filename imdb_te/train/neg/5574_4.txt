A good example is how "Gaddyla vs. King Gudora" can ruin a great idea through tragic things like fake patriotism. Here, pilgrims from the future try to destroy Japan, local leader Godzilla replaced with their puppy monster, three-headed golden dragon king giorora. They fail, but eventually Godzilla fights with the Girdora. The battles between the two behemoths are very good, but the picture plots holes and all the stuff about "Great Japan" is really stupid. The creators of the film have not even threatened Japan's enemies with respect, they are stupid big sleek guys who easily repel by the Japanese. The good thing is that ultimately Godzilla and King Gidora destroyed Japan, which is one of the two (actually two) ridiculous foes in the brilliant battles. But until this war royal, the film is really dull and curious.
