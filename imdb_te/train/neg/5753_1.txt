... is a distinct lack of blood for a movie that seems to be trying to get into the market as a horror. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London is one of the most horrific shows I've ever seen - achingly self-aware and clumsy of his "descent into the maelstr√∂m" of madness. Oh look at him blurry! Oh look to drink him strong souls! Oh look over his head in his forehead, and see his head! Oh look his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh listen to her husky voice! He should be a violent artist / writer / intellectual! Oh, yes, the poet shirt comes out - this is another boy he thought Byron. (Or po.) Oh love ... Anyone this guy does not give a manual "how to work better" or they do not pull out a cardboard box somewhere, a small plastic toy that does not work in a suspension gift bargain-bin grain's brand. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is beautiful, and very much Briar pink, but yet her acting shoes has yet to grow, but because it melted my brain with its awful London exhibition. In the film she holds all of her roles, in fact, her overall performance is very sturdy, she is hardly struck into lines - she's probably responding, trying to neutralize, and Jeremy to run London's. If the character's character is confusing, he gives the best performance of the piece. He seems, quite simply, right, but more than that - he is sort of depth, I believe he has life beyond the two dimensional quality of the remaining characters. <br /> <br /> Huh, I like the Poe, and when he is on the screen my mind wanders and can trace - he has a lost interest in time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are an avid blur - all the common irony: a perforated blonde who is a floozy best friend; Smitten by the local police who is a bit of a dork; Probably the oldest man who has the most orphaned interest in our heroine; The scheme is old witch, etc., yawning and gaping. <br /> <br /> With the lack of blood for the horror film, they have no themes (and London's role is very difficult - in attack on Po writing). As another reviewer suggests, there is a probability: murder, promise, is actually a surprise, but instead they cut away from the problems of a skirt and violence (it is the wind that blows on the victim - black cut! It is probably the best in a noir traditional traditional horror And it's lovely when it's happening - this is the beloved convention, the opposite (Fun and funny) The slasher image of the pingulanesis / motion / madness - along with fake glazed holes and acute coyoic eye decorations - the legacy 'it is just bleak, or the editor can cut the quasini at the last minute and cut it out.) This is a long time mental thriller: It is two, or neither (something new and exciting), k Either way, you failed it unsatisfactory. The horror element of the whole film is epic folly. <br /> <br /> If I am this editor (if anything) s / he will be drunk on the subject - awkwardly foreshortened scenes; Scenes appearing in scenes (this can only be a poor script). Director & Cinematographer - There were some weird shots and frames, I thought I was grateful to Hitchcock or Browning, but just crazy (again, fine in a noir, but it is trying something else). <br /> <br /> "Do not I do any of these things?" "He said. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for me, unfortunately I got a little bit of a little bit, slightly lights up, and I made a little bit of silence - it's very poor, I can not recommend to the public. </ p> <p> <br /> Please do not waste your time or money - take a real horror / thriller movie or a copy of Poe's fairy tales, Incadaniki than you could hope to be the most enjoyable and frightening night.
