It relies on the idea of ​​the hit of the original 80. <br /> When we saw it destroyed by a UAV right at the start of Sunday it was set in the modern day. The weapons of the UAV are not. They may be but I do not think I ever tried for real. We can see a computer that is formulating this operation called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We hacked his IP address when he hacked "Hawker" Will Fermer (he was good in chemistry and electronics) and his love interest, all) and was hacked by Will's 1st attempt. <br /> <br /> Wills is not a hack (he helped set up an account) with money from his neighbor's bank account (Mr Masoud), and then we decided to play the Dead the code to play the Global Thermonuclear War. <br /> <br /> Why did the Ripley Shuttle shut the machine's machine exactly why it was not explained (he was only an online game he was playing?) and felt he needed to wrap all the power in the entire block that lived as well. Why a Target Terrorism Agency can observe this, and it is possible to question. RIPLEY is activating his mobile phone? I think it is not connected to the PC and he can not play the message if he really does not answer the phone, so there are very bad "hacking" science. <br /> <br /> Repeat agents come to the Masoods home, take him away & will be given a cover, which has a lot of money. You can search for a car license license plate that is not a "hack" that you can not enter the DVD. He does not have any authority to arrest or seize Ripple agents who catch Dennis at the airport when he is searching. Will's mother did not "steal chemicals & bio agents". And although she does not have the right to force or arrest Dennis. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the US is afraid of being arrested as a different country with different laws regarding any crime in Canada. <br /> <br /> All the action taken by the computer rogue go and taken against Will, his mother & Dennis does not grant a government agency. The first appearance of any hacking skill in the phone frame film we're going to see, we also seemed too easy for a hack such a powerful system into Ripley. <br /> <br /> "The idea to read a computer lips that is not related to the ridiculous concept that Ripley & Ripley will keep track of a cell phone during the underground is stupid looking at them all in the airport & <br /> <br /> <br /> Stephen Falken Another reference to the original film was the design of RIPLEY as the founder of the original, The Joschu Project. <br /> <br /> Let's also see WOPR that we're going to help WONR. Falcone and WOPR rarely used everything (the same explosion will kill all of the killing and killing of Russians very quickly. It is a self-contained weapon capable of counterfeiting or weapons It is also possible to create a compatible computer system <br /> <br /> Rashts of such orders But it is still ridiculous and unbelievable that IP hacks are not done by Ripley, he suggests and implements an idea from his friends. It is not only Ripley's operating, but the temperature it replicates (it bits to the bits Especially after) a wonderful cop containing Joshua as a backdoor Ut any thoughts on the film and wanted to remain and be very disappointed with the screams of the author. /> <br /> There is a terribly good riddle Y play the Dead code and we see a Decktamination in Ripley (telling 17 minutes) when we see a countdown, when the garbage is not to keep up with their own timer? Ripley's attack mission against Philadelphia (with my opinion quite easily) and decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and transformed the missile to Phillie to Washington, where RIPLEY lived. The idea of ​​a nuclear transfer does not recognize what she's doing to make a replica (if she has this lesson in the original film if she has not known if she's already familiar?) The original film. Ripley's report contains their cop out of Joshua's exact words at the end of the original movie just goes to show how much original ideas they could not come up with. <br /> <br /> If you want to suggest fingers for bad & abducted thoughts, men should be blamed for Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. It's an awful movie and good.
