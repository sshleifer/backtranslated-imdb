At the beginning of this film I missed it, why it would not seem so unpleasant. On the other hand, I know this story because I have studied the fall of the Roman Republic for years. Once again, I would not like this film too. <br /> <br /> There are many historical errors in this film. Although this is not correct, I do not think I'm trying to make it right, in which case it has been forgiven. The strange thing is that going to great chaos to sometimes be historically accurate is confusing. Antonio's marriage to Octavia, and later putting it two scenes. Why is it even brought to the plot and if there is no advantage to Octavia? And in some scenes, he was called by Antoenius by his original name (Marcus Antoniois), and his other strange English name was Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Despite the historical flaws, this is not the main woman. She does not have an honorable ounce. She is crazy, dramatic, and completely out of control. A clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a silly young man with PMS's bad case. That 95% comes from poor acting, but 5% from poor script writing. Most stupid dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you're not watching Antonio and Cleopatra, you have seen the mature versions of Dawson and Joe from "Dawson Creek". <br /> If you want to see about this period, see ....
