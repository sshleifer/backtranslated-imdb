I saw this film on a WestBunch American Airlines flight. It's so bad that it actually seemed overwhelming for the flight. (Who accidentally encounters who she does not love a movie about a woman who killed every Elvis impersonator?) But it really got screwed at a million different times by poor writing. Elvis's mascot at the end of the side is a gangster sky scene that resurping going back to a casino bad scene on the roof of a casino, then moves together to form an "Elvis" alliance, which then stars a bolt immediately shoots a bolt of lightning at them, crash through the ceiling sending. Bad ... really bad. This theme for the whole movie. I like to avoid all these costs.
