Carnosaur 3 bad ... very bad. Bad point where it's funny. I'm trying to convince myself that I can not believe anyone in this world can be entertained for serious reasons. I mean, come on, the cover is also bad! OK, special effects are certainly ridiculous. The "Carnosaurs" are really ridiculous. A scientist tells the soldiers that they will move the soldiers very fast, and when running them, they walk at the speed ... A rubber suit attempts to drive him in a rubber suit. And the explosions are funny (it does not have any other word to describe). Initially, a bullet hits a jeep and the guys "what is it?" And other explosions are also ridiculous. But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story. You can not imagine a good story (or, I do not think anyone who's renting this movie is a good movie) but try to make sense of the story. I mean, how difficult it is for a story about killing people about killing dinosaurs. If you look at it, it will be very difficult. Oh, and if you think you can make your commanders believable commands, tell these awful, awful worst writers. I mean, would a sick man make the cheapest jokes after one of his friends die? And they are very much. And if you feel that the film is at least action-packed about dinosaurs killing soldiers, wake up !!! This film is very dull. Carnormers (who invented this sluggish name) attack (you can not see much in boring action sequences). How do the soldiers think how to defeat them (they try to work hard at most serious scenes, but can not be persuaded for the second time). So, they attack the carnosaurs, but their thinking does not work (another ridiculous action sequence). Go back to Planning (some sluggish jokes) with another funniest scene. And this, and, and goes on. And do not forget acting in a deal like special effects ... and story ... Oh OK, this movie just sucks from A to Z.
