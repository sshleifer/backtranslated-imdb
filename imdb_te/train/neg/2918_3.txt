After watching the film, I stayed with two awkward commentary about the film: Why did they play Chen in this "McGuire Hitman" and why the Lee's ineffective idiot did? Following Chen's background, he grew up in an underground Cambodian orphanage in a bloody war, where they learn to kill wild dogs. He gets in a cab and this scenario begins at the start when it starts to run, showing that he does not know how to do with a seat belt. After this scene, he had a similar situation in a dumfood restaurant. He is not illiterate, he is hungry. It refers to Chen's sturdy body but is scarfing down food for two opening scenes in the film, one of which is the low deck floor rice porridge on an old ship. In the first ten minutes of the film, Sin Chen is malnourished-edited, unmoderminated, and his only "dog" is a kind of fighting style. In spite of this situation, Chen was awarded with each police (pressing a metal tube shovel to beat a man on a head that had a chew's girlfriend) and some super human power (50 <br />) Lee's character now ... Well, at the end of a metal pipe, lb block concrete, on the head of the police chief, was shot on the chest., I get, he is depressed, he can In the first scene he runs into Chen, and he is almost 15 feet long, but he's got to beat again, and for a moment, they try to make him cool, Seen face to face, Chen face to face, 10 step While the gun is holding a distance, his dear friend and colleague will slowly sprout five minutes with a long knife in the neck. <br /> At the end of this film, Lee dies and once again fails. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem is that the filmmakers make a sense of the audience with the role of Chen, who is just "killing to survive". It would be much easier if I wanted to kill innocent people across the whole scene of Chen. In many of the killings he killed, two men intend to kill him, police chief and lee. Others are not eating, boat owners, taxi drivers, and police trying to arrest him, do not kill him. Overall, Chen's role is a cold bleeding killer who kills his desire. <br /> <br /> Many people use the hundreds of dollars in this film? Go to some of the director / camera work when my 3 stars come in some good shots. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: One of the nut-hugging Chen fans. To me, "dog byte this DVD"
