<br /> <br /> In this movie I came from the cinema, it is responsible for all the problems of women. Every time a woman is depicted in a film, she is lazy, obviously ignorant, or unable to publicly understand some poor person. <br /> <br /> But, it's a comedy, and a piece of art, so it's just one's opinion. Even though I do not agree with it, they still deserve it. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, but some comments made by others are plain stupid. The best picture of my feet.
