There are two types of roles in the SHIELD: People who try to do the right thing and do the right thing, and continue to pursue their own self-interest, bringing people and people who can every sinful sin, and everybody is the only hope for everyone. More than any other performance, there is impersonation and self-delusion about the SHIELD. Unfortunately, the leaders of the hypocrites and self-guilty demonstrations, and such ordinary art-fiction leaders' losing or catching inconvenient immunity and they come up again, this program has a stunning camera work. Main ins and fade outs are always excellent. It's really art work to see. Unfortunately the story is a cartoon, complete desire fulfillment of the unhappiness of violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> The hero, Warlie Brothers cartoon character, always pulls Elmer Fades (who does not support his frauds and crimes) by pulling everyone with him in a failed scheme after a failed scheme, attracts the role of a good woman who can support the upcoming role in the show, , And always scrap your ears with his annoying self-justification. Another policeman may be hurt by what he is doing and because of his actions, he may always blame suspicious cap, despite his schemes and extensive lies and doomed plans. <br /> <br /> As the 24, this program depends on the season and the calculation of the season after the season to draw its story. Boring, unbelievable long stories come into the storyline of each season, which feature the skeletons' rogue acts and the indefinite cover-ups of the bloody, distorted parts of the meat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the author of the writers Hubbis creates letters in disguise while trying to repel the audience's sympathy. Sometimes, they want to see Shane as our enemy. Sometimes they want to see that we are a poor mistaken spirit. Sometimes they want us to see the wick as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want to see us as a poor person with a golden heart. Sometimes we want to see them as mere jerbebel. <br /> When they sit in her and talk about her dreams with Shane, they feel she finds her sympathetic and tragic. <br /> This is not a reversal. Once they showed that these characters had destroyed the lives of other people for their own ends, and that's it. It's nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. However, each supermodel is incomplete to produce seven seasons of male giraffes who run a criminal syndicate from the police station on the right side of their beds and every nose.
