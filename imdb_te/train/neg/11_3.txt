If you see Corey Large's information here in IMDb, he plays Sebastian Cole in the film "Reload" (as of June '08). <br /> <br /> "When I see this morning morning, does not Sebastian kill me? I'm struggling with it and I'm sure I missed a few plots, but overall, it's really weak, and one of the strongest parts of the film is for me. Since, I'm also a bit surprised by all the people commenting on beautiful girls.
