It's frustrating. While people do not have any substance, the main character Martin Cahill has zero ransom values, in fact it is everyone's sleeve summary, including Jon Woitt. I do not recommend this picture to anyone. Despite the artwork, violence is unpleasant. Filming black, at least print I saw this category fit. A disappointment.
