A note to all the authors of the memorable ones: Read this movie. <br /> If you have read your dialog dialog in this picture, please unmount your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I do not have high expectations, but a Christmas ornament factory. The mystery can be resolved very early and the movie becomes sexually straight. I stopped looking at almost 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the first break. My wife, who was a Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave her first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a company town. The main business firm Aiken's jewelery, all kinds of decorative decorations. The company's fiancée has recently elapsed, so the company may be questionable in the future. We'll soon see Noel on Wall Street more than Maille Street, and Mysterious Justin who got a date with Noel after a big snowman growing up in Justin Carr Crashes. <br /> <br /> If Alison makes Eikens good enough for the board, we have our hero. <br /> <br /> If you can not make all the stories through the first commercial break, this is a holiday movie. Perhaps this is a good thing.
