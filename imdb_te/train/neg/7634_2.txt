It is the kind of film that shows the lack of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers. <br /> <br /> Two male cops (one or more of you, as you see), do not worry if the director's desire for "sound American" is not cheated for a minute, if you do not see it from a serial killer movie Murders are more complicated than complicated. (See "Los Incon de Strasbourg" two years ago). The scene with his pregnant wife - in the same way it is considered a counter for the mouths of the rest of the areas - filmed. To capture a PG 12, paint the Gori Autopsy and a big lovely love scene. Hence the attracting of a huge adolescent audience. The violent and absurd ending, Quote d'Azur, it's really dull silence.
