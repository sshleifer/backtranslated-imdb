This program is terrible, jokes are all terrible and worse and worse. At least in the beginning, I always enjoyed one of the biggest fan of Corner Gas fans, but in the season, when they both came into a rump, the jokes brought out everything and the characters did not have anything. Well at least Corner Gas is good at first, the Little Mosque on Prairie is usually the terrible Blonde CBC comedy that has nothing to do from the episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, just because I'm honest with people who live on older people or audience? Perhaps jokes and they work there? I do not know a guy who likes this show and it can not stand, jokes are completely predictable and the letters are less developed than the corner gas. All successes in this event are totally Muslim and I feel better because Muslims and the show are fully displayed.
