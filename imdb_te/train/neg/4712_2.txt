This presentation is perhaps the biggest, ugliest, most common steam pile I've ever seen in children's programming that has become really successful. The main character, Johnny, I'm supposed to represent a normal kid while I understand it, is not like it or hesitable. The jokes are dull (meaning "alas!" Not sarcastically, it is not funny even for the first time, it is not even beautiful) and there is no form of primitive intellect or inspiration. Finally ... it's just plain ugly. While children often criticize artistic talents, they still love eye candy. I can not see the show, because in a way, the art style is just ... bulky. Secretly, indeed. Just plain coffee. <br /> <br /> I do not think this time will be broadcast. I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and when it comes back my hopes are increasing ... I really lose old cartoons. Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls ... Take It Back. <br /> <br /> Just put, I advise you not to waste your time in this show. I believe that really good cartoons can also be experienced by older children. And it does not cut.
