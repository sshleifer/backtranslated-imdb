It's available in "double in double feature" from Dark Sky Films, and since I've finished "Barcade" I've also seen it. <br /> <br /> We start with two young women in the streets of some foreign towns, but where are they? They see necklaces from some Chinese marketers, stop the Chinese-style dress in the shop, but do some Aztec dancers see it? And all the while, however, these girls are following the two boys, who eventually get the stealth drop, which they do not have along with a forest run girls while they are town, and they eventually catch them. It seems one of the girls has a coin string around her neck, and these guys want to find loot, and where did she get it? So, in the flashback, we go back to search. And she knows this coin? <br /> Now, when the two women were about ten years old, they were sailors of their sisters and their sister's boyfriends, in their tanks, bringing the little boy back to his home, his grandfather came out and gave him a "kidney" Invite a young person for invitation only. But not everyone has tea, Todd leaves the boat to check younger games, and when they are away, the boat is blowing, and their friends secretly disappear when they return home. <br /> <br /> These "gracious folk" seem to raise their own vegetable but wait for the meat to drop meat for a spell and provide herbal teas. <br /> <br /> But girls and Todd Island, but now, they're there, walked through their captors, and they're there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one has ever shown girls. There is also someone else on the island, and thugs will begin to secretly die, one, and since there is only three, it does not take long. <br /> <br /> Two of the thugs are angry with speed problems and every bit is left with a happy ending. They are happy with the outline of any acting ability. Although grandfather Hank Wadden appeared in several films and TV shows, the Hillbilly-type family acting was not even capable. This act is confusing, the locals are more confusing, and the island is found in Southern California. <br /> What is this hell? I'm not sure, but is it worth checking out once that you can (or say it) to think of it? 10 to 4, very hideous.
