I saw the whole movie that characterizes William Hurt, Natascha McElown and Desree Nosbus. I'm glad that I do not know about being Peter Weller. At the end of the film I called "Peter Weller?" Excellence for the magnificent performance of Mr. Weller. <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is bad, the writing is bad, and there are shows from Nasbach and Wellers, and Supper. <br /> The scenery and arrangement are interesting, and Weller is awesome.
