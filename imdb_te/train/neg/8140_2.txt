The film was called Mystery Science Theater "Night of Stage". That title is less misleading than "bathpipe". In fact it is more precisely called the batperson. I'm worried because I want to be good for rabies. It's not really clear. It is clear that he and his wife make a cave trip and he is dirty by bat. Why does not a scientist need to study bats?

Eventually the person kills 3-4 and his wife has kept him and you separate him instead of the sheriff who is investigating the killings.
