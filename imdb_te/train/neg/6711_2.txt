1993 year. It was long before Philip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. I know I will be extra in a movie with him? I actually pay in "My Boyfriend's Back", which was filmed in the Austin suburb of Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (the producers got a change of heart!) I was in the theater scene. I went to see the day that the film was released in theaters. It's more than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you may want to check it out. "Dead of Dawn" or "Dead of the Dead" is not even close to quality, but cheese factor is sufficient. Ciao
