This image is either nothing new or something valuable. After watching it, my wife and I agreed that the studio took control of the skin and could be considered less fun if it was fun. This is a good example of a "concept only" film - they have a concept of an image and other details are imperfect because executives know it will make $$ based on the initial concept. The film is about to escape from the jail and the parole is going on. She no longer hates dogs but is programmed to adore them - she was unable to hurt just a pumpkin. It will not last long after her release and she will return to old ways. <br /> <br /> The most annoying elements of this film are the supporting characters. Wadsworth's Voice Eric Idle Bird hated me - and I'll take into consideration a tough Python fan. This was evident because he gave him a lot of money. (There is no other reason). Cruella's short-self-esteemed servant, Tim McInterney, is funny in the black crossbuster shows, but here he is totally wasted and unpredictable. And it should cost a few bucks to get Gerard Depardieu but he was totally wasting as well. <br /> <br /> There are also some other supporting actors, but how the characters are written poorly and I try to prevent them from my mind. <br /> <br /> Overall, you will see this move to make your kids feel televised.
