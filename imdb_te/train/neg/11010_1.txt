This film is not even eligible. This is a complete waste of time. It's cinema and money waste. This is insulting, but everything is provocative and unpleasant. I think my spoiler is read by everyone. Full frontal nudity and frustrating language. But there are no plot, the actors are terrified, the sounds are terrifying, the actors are small and I'm also excited to watch this movie! <br /> For the only reason I rented was Brian van Hollt (only the fifteenth part of the route). <br /> <br /> I think this is a mistake on the parts of the directors and editors, but they only repeat the same sections two or three times, and only add a new sentence. <br /> <br /> This is the Head of Eraser Head, the most disturbing image of existence. No plot, no funny. Even though it was funny. Do not see another image.
