The concept of its pedigree must be a more enjoyable image than this. Without a lip-smacking collection in the cast in the cast - what spectator does not eagerly anticipate a movie that brings together Lemmon, Launcher, Kovacs and Ginkgold? <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts are not necessarily ridiculous, because Kiss is stupid. James Stewart is a good comedian for his performance in the films from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he can come out of this mess over others. Maybe except the cat.
