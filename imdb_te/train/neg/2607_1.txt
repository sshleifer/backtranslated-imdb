I have seen this movie recently and this book is low. I blame you for this poor screenplay and direction. Some of the components were forced into force due to obvious reasons (gay rape scenery). After reading for the first time I saw the movie and after 20 years I really read the book. As I read it and I found it to be a little clumsy. Many different ideas have been introduced for any purpose ... rather than sensational episodes. In Communics, at Communism, I would see the attraction that was generated at the time, which I thought was 'sensitive'. That's not the case or maybe I look at two or a bit things now differently. The film tries to cover many aspects of the book, resulting in some of the meaningful readings of the book. Nevertheless, this film is very difficult and it's never done.
