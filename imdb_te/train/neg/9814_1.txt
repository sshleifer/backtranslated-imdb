This is the kind of movie you regret put on your VCR. It broke some strange evil of Stephen kings' film "Misery (1990)". <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the 5.2 score of this film has come, because there is no story and there is no story, and finally when I finished the cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is going to be released as a small movie instead. <br /> <br /> Let's look at this movie, make sure you make some movies. With new batteries in your remote control, you're going to do a lot of fast forwarding because ... do not worry, you will lose anything important.
