This is an excellent example of a growing problem with images. Why is the background noise and soundtrack dramatically tight than the conversation? What is the feeling? This film is not alone. Most movies do it now. 2 years old, I was surprised that this was something wrong on my TV, but I got a new TV, it's back. <br /> <br /> In the English version of the film, the woman is constantly hiding because it attracted more attention. I told Jean Reno "Excuse me, do you speak up or get marbles from your mouth?" I hope. If you're watching it on DVD and if you have high school french, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> Reena is very good because Leon is very good. People rake about the scenery, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
