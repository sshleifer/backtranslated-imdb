I did not read Lincoln's biography, so it's a perfect shoot. <br /> <br /> Lynch is a brilliant, honorable and savior of our country, which can cause me to use uniformly different and unrealistic worship images that spoil ungodly godliness. <br /> <br /> Why did they portray Lincoln as a buffoon? <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda made a wonderful Lincoln, who played his role as "Away Shooks, I'm Just A Simple Person". <br /> <br /> [[Bushi Junior] campaign, we think he is "just a simple person", so he does not care that he is a great and special worker - but it's the whole story. <br /> <br /> Film depicting Lincoln as a normal (almost simple-minded) person, Lincoln has just passed a law and stated that the film does not have any interest in the law - just the wrong idea that the rights and mistakes of the law. <br /> <br /> In the film he is not a very good defense attorney (he makes lounges and witnesses fun around his feet in the table), and the result is largely determined by chance / luck. <br /> Furthermore, partly because it is Republicans (in response to some games presented by Democrats) and because it's just sentimental, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. Do not waste your time in this movie!
