Sacred cow, what is this movie? I'm not the producers of this film, how to take a 250 word book and convert it into a movie. I guess I do not know either! <br /> All of these children were reading, and some were dressed in fringing, sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and kaka jack. This should give you a good idea what you think of these Hollywood producers. I said, it's interesting, but the spectacular visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you think that kind of funny) I know children. <br /> <br /> Do not look after your children, do not rent a DVD. I hope Dr. Sussez's ghost will come and follow the people who made this film.
