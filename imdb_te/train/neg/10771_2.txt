In a few years, children did not watch movies, so I missed "Time Come the Tigers" for the first time. ("Bad News Bears", even though I've worked on other people like Financing, "Warriors," "Man Who To Be King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" for the film in the 70s.) Now I check old or short films And find people who have gone to great careers even if they are less than great images in the beginning. For a few minutes in the film I went to big and good things and did not last for the last credits to see if there was a young actor in this film - it's interesting to see his / her look that makes no interest in plot and acting. Less and behold, I spied Wes Craven's name in credits as an electric gopher. He had already done two or three of his early shakers but still did not create Freddy Krueger or starred in "Scream" films. Maybe he's okay and can help on this film. In the film "Aesop," Fred Jay Lincoln is astonishing in the films that have played a rare role. F.J. Lincoln, from the '70s to a few years ago, appeared and produced in adult films. He is associated with the adult satire "The Ozpopones" and the title is more ridiculous than all of the "Tigers" attempts to combine with humor. How many people are sleeping at the wheel of the film, letting the fact that a movie star is placed in the children's film.
