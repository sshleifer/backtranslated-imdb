Why this is the cause of many homeless people. . . <br /> <br /> If stupid producers are in trouble, they pay their money to do different movies because the film is even worse than white chicks! The Little Man is a lame man who plays a role as a baby midget. It is a sixth story story. Although this idea is still not very bad, it is not the original and original of the cartoon episode. It's funny moments but some of them are over and some are just stupid. Acting is very bad. Is directed. Anyone involved in the film should be ashamed of themselves. It is racist and midgets too risky. I mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, filmmakers make fun of them! What they will do is really hate me. They see little children as infants. And for a role of a midget who acts as an abandoned baby to get some diamond in the family. It does not need its lame to show that. It just is not worth it. Do not see this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
