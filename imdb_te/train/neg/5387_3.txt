<br /> Now when it seems interesting, there's never been there. <br /> <br /> People are going from one point to another point. No action, suspense or any horror and characters are pretty hearty, so no attention to what happened to them. <br /> The film is pretty boring for everything. <br /> I'll give it to 3/10. <br /> <br /> It's not a staggering chopper camera work. If music is not really like me bad movies and acting is not horrific.
