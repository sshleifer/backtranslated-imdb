A clear B-Grade effort to earn money in hostel / sauce sensation, my expectations for the film is low (really low!) And still disappointing at every level. Acting was so unfortunate that it was not even funny, the plot line did not exist and the only scare was I was watching 1 hour 21 minutes watching! I found 34 people rated 10 stars. I suspect there are only 33 actors and crews. 34th probably the mother of directors? - I'm sure she will find it hard to go more than 2! DVD extras feature an "Making Of" feature for an hour. What question raises, "why?" (Perhaps this can be used to show what not to do). Avoid all costs.
