You can not get past the idea that this film is still unbelievably terrible (OK, so Katie Manson did not reach the family, and died at Altamont), though these boring characters personally saw every significant moment of the 1960s. I thought that the "writers" locked themselves in just one room and examined and investigated the films "Forest Gump", "The Wonder Years," and 60th of Oliver Stone, and again. A Canadian television critic criticized the end of the first episode "Head Spinning". He is right.
