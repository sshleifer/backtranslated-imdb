While surfing the channel, we found this movie with its compilation edition. We were horrified at flat acting and principle story. We have found weaker car scenes, unreliable shoot outs, and tire-foam and cardboard crushing crashes. It is even more delightful to see all the recycling scenes from the front of the church in front of the church, "Dantes Peak", where the storefants fall on the main street, overpower collapses, and red truck bricks. It's a good smile, but it's surprising to the viewer if it is not intended to be a low budget spoof of disaster films.
