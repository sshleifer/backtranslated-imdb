The standard procedure for Swedish movies begins by clearing out the window today and by starting the path to the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stanham have been looted by the most effective "military style" gang of looters. <br /> <br /> In the Swedish movie, the cast was created with the same people you saw and saw again. Michael Perbrand must have been in every Swedish film in the past few years! Perbramont is one of the few who are breaking up here (as he normally does) but I'm right. Problems with this film are mostly around the story. The first of all thefts is considered a background. But it is more about a young poliomain to prove herself in the male world (she did not do a thousand times with a good actress instead of Sophia Haylin). There is a completely unreliable story twist near the conclusion that Aliens landing is as acceptable as landing. But still, I think there is a very good touch considering it is right about half asleep. <br /> <br /> Finally, the main problem is similar to other Swedish films. This type of action and suspense (mostly Hollywood) does not meet the standards used in other movies. Comparison is cheap and weak. In my opinion Swedish filmmakers can focus more on the plot and acting, and they forget about trying to make "Hollywood action light" as they are now. This is another unforgettable effort from the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
