Villages are unexpectedly hanging on the lieutenant-governor, coming home as she lives in a family. The two children eat breakfast, the elders move the villages to the retirement home. Bridget has an awful-looking pancake sandwich with cereals, eggs, bacon, strawberries and syrups as Andrew is rarely seen. The two children are then discussing the villages and telling Andrew Grammus to go "out of the lawn." <br /> <br /> Brittat and the village dolls have a drama Tea Party with Sweet William in her bedroom, then a living doll is unexpectedly coming out of her bedroom closet mirror. The curly hairstyle figure is mentioned in Huggins and lives. Bridget gives the Hughes baseball cap from Andrew's room. Higgins is hiding under some laundry when Bridget's mother arrives, and then moves the huggins in a washing machine in a washing machine. Bridget saves the huggins and dries her hair. To discuss the problem they have to get older in the villages and move away, Huggins says he can talk to Bookworm in Huggaland about Briggett since he knows everything. <br /> <br /> They go through the mirror to rent in Hugeland, but in the mirror of one of Bridget's tennis shoes. <br /> <br /> If you walk along a shoe, Briggette will walk in the hog land without shoes. They soon meet Hooghly, a hippopotamus in Hageland. Huggins Hugsy baseball cap gives. They also meet Tickels, Bubbles, Imps and Tweakers, and all the dolls sing on the song while sitting on a bridge. Haggi lives in a large bookshop to see Bridget and Haggings in Bookworm in his Hugwang. Bookworm deals with an "old encyclopedia" and learns that old age is cured by eating the fruit of "young tree". However, there is only such a tree, and it is in the country of scrubs, ruled by quintz queen of Quartz. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bridget and two toys Gulp, jump down the hole, and tumble out. As soon as they walk down the sidewalk on a sidewalk, hear the glass breaking sea, and come off aside when the gravity ends sideways. They face "hair monster", which appears as a masodon, four teeth, and burns its trunk. But Hugs goes boldly and the monster turns his name Hodgepodge into the elephant. Hodgepodge is under a spell by Queen, and Huggie gets a loan, so they go back to Hodegepod's castle. They enter the castle, the powers of the demon, the Queen (Queen Admira), and Bridget asks some young people. The queen refuses, then she eats one, and when she looks in the mirror with hand, the brands are about her good looks. Hadadgadge when he was the Queen of Fandom he should be "digested." When the bridge indicated that the bridge had bad witches might have pimples, the Queen suffered the bridge, and ordered three others to be taken to prison. <br /> <br /> The queen of the tree leaves the rooftop in the room by putting the queen in the dome. <br /> <br /> Hoppops keeps in jail and using his "noodle" (trunk) to pull the prison door down, leaving him and his two toys behind. They put the bridget up, the dolls surrounded her, causing Bridget to restore. Before they flee, Bridget's left-hand keyboard finds the Terry tower, lifts the dome, and some pick up the cartridges and sit them up. The Queen grabbed them, but the Queen's hand was trapped under the drowning climb during the Bringget's reach to the key left on the floor. The queen suddenly loses the berries that give young people a very old, and it seems to die. Bridget will soon go back through the mirror in her bedroom, but tours at the bottom of the mirror combine berries on her floor, and the berries quickly disappear in the smoke. Her mother and Andrew called for a farewell to the village, who are going to retirement home. Andrew falls in the villages of his usual grumpy, strapy fa√ßade and housewife, saying that she loves her, and she did not want her to go away. <br /> <br /> Their father moved, and decided to keep all the hugs and seven men, including the principal, Ant Ruthie, to keep the villages there and pressure the villages. Louis Cardinals hat begins to explain how Briggett gave Huggins to Huggins, but Andrew does not want to hear her believe that she is her fantasy stories, so she is looking in the bedroom. Bridget holds the cap secretly by the mirror, Bridget holds a hat on Andrew's head, Andrew is ignorant, and leaves his bedroom without saying anything. Bridget waves cheerfully at the mirror.
