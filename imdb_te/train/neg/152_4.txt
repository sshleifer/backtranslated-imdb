You can consider some facts in the debate as spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg could not get the Oscar for this piece, and the academy voted to be right. (Best Actor Nominations and Other Actors ... I do not know but it is hard to justify what they say and give you what you see in the final product). Spielberg is so fictitious, so meddlesome that it directs. The difference in the art course I read in this movie was screwed on me: "Sentimental honest emotion is honestly applied, sensational sugar and unreal, false opinion of life." This is over the top sentimentality. When two people in real life began to read simultaneously, there were examples of this type of faux behavior as they were sitting on the couch of letters like Sally and Shug Avery, who were found on the couch that came from Netti: crowded men around Miss Mali's car and then flew the birds Such as Rptito jumping; Harpow falls through the roofs of the various buildings he's working on (the less slit slapstick gag); All the forces of attendance from Juke Joint to the Chapel are enchanting by the singing of the singing ... and above. There is nothing real. I was even surprised if I chose Harpo's name as his wife, Sophia's original name, "Oprah," back. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's honestly rendering action and emotion can not be possible. The Schindler's List is amazing, I'm deeply impressed, and I've saved private reality for most realism, even though the story is a bit counted.
