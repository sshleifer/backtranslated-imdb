For some reason, many young couples first split up to see who can meet the status of their camp by the Italian Alps. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds an ancient ghostly gladiator's skeleton and captures the spirit of "Tyranus" when he keeps on the corpse helmet. He then spends the rest of the movie in which he hunts his friends and hacks their organs to add some dishes to bring them back to life "Demonicus". This shot on digital full moon release is a stupid, intolerable, horrific acting and sound and a poor alternative to the Los Angeles National Forest Italy. However, thanks to the unpleasant smile is very high. Kindness should be considered to believe Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and embarrassing line delivery, cutting the knife or worrying about Narot Latin Gabbardion about ghosts and resurrection. Oh well, at least he's not too boring to the rest of the cast.
