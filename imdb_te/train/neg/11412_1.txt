This image is too bad, you can not imagine it. The acting is worse than in third class soap operas. The film is the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. There is no mutual understanding between the soldiers. The story may have been removed from a Bravo photo story, the conversations are wooden like Tribeedard and the holes in the hole are larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But it is not necessary to satisfy audiences these days. The actors are a former Miss Switzerland example and the main character is also hanging (woah !!) and is definitely the abuse of drugs. It's a real cool man! Especially for young and 12-year-olds. But the media created an atmosphere in the witch because you did not allow the film to deny because you do not go along with the other `sheep 'because you are manipulated by the Pier group dynamics by saying utterly that you are a nerd. Exactly when I was in the soldiers, I was exactly the same as what I was doing when I went to the Army .. Every cheesy act of having medicines and coolness. I love the army. I was there and I hated it but this film was bad for cleaning a sticky toilet with a toothbrush (I suffered a lieutenant because I was forced) that every film was not going to be sophisticated. Sometimes you have to be entertained for a few hours, and I think about the problems and its bad stuff. But these types of films can greatly influence young people by showing them a cool lifestyle, in fact it turns out to be just stupid and foolish ignorant and arrogant idiots. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I'm quiet so my opinion is not very popular. > <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
