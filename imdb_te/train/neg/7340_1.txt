Impressed! It's the worst SRK film and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I do not like the novel, but this movie is getting worse! Very bad music, and worst actors (unlike SRK of course, he could not even save the film) and was not quite right. The director knows this is very confusing, why do you know God ... Perhaps he is very surreal and tries to be reliable. <br /> If you've got a few hours of losing, do not watch this movie, please! (Continue to search for your own welfare!), You will find something to see!
