Being a fan of silent movies, I waited for the first time seeing this picture. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> As mentioned, the long, long, commercially available film for Maxwell Automobile. <br /> <br /> If the handloom scene was halfway in length, I enjoyed the movie more. But it's too old to get older. And I was spreading in reality films many times, without a viewer's happiness, what is the Mexican bandits? I mean, they chase a car through the mountains, a car that is traveling more than a mile per hour, yet can not they hold it?
