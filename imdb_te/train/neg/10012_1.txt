This film should be in line for the most boring image of years. <br /> <br /> The murders in the film are of interest to the film but are not of interest. This cast is not bad but the script is just plain terrible, I'm totally surprised in this movie, thinking about how to look this entertainer on earth. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film are very intelligent. They made a boring movie but hid the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People go to blockbuster and probably look at this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Daph√≥ this should be good and should rent this movie. (Boy they are in a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like to go and rent this movie, some people actually enjoy the movie but I watch the movie with the movie
