I, like many other Bachchan fans, are eagerly awaiting Sholay's remake. This is not the film. Thank God they do not let them use the name "Sholey" in the title of the film. Ram Gopal Remake is not worth the title. Camera work, positioning, clothes, totally out of dance, all of the conversation combines to make the worst image I've seen. If the cast of the cast is accepted to make the film, you will need money and you are surprised that Ram Gopal is paying a lot of money for casting. Not only is the non-payment actor, the ant, the same as the first film. Abhishek's character is totally ridiculous and Ash needs to pay for a wedding? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not be bothered by this movie or DVD.
