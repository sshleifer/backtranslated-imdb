I love music, but as a Dickens fan I'll hate this thing. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Are hungry boys who have enough strength to sing and dance? Falling London Poor to Fagin and Dodger Sunset? The novel is not sure. When I recall, the cheat man was publicly executed and Fagin was lunatic in prison. <br /> <br /> Olivier Reid is so weak as Sykes, doing little to represent his badness. Still, Mark Lester is Oliver, who sees across awkward and inactive, but you're really surprised if he's the main character. His character did not help with the help of the best they could do while singing in a girl's voice. <br /> <br /> Self-respecting Dickens fans: David Lean's magnificent 1948 film or BBC-6's mid-80's. Avoid this bloated whitehouse of a musical.
