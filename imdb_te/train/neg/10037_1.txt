I never thought that the standards of Yashraj films will grow to such a limit! The film has an unreasonable storyline, which is not of interest. <br /> <br /> Said is played by Saif. Kareena has improved her pictures, but it is not a good actress anyway. Akshai is good. Anil is also good. <br /> <br /> If it is considered "comedy part" of the film, it is very small. Yashraj movies can make this kind of worse because the last few films have been made soaked up? It has a very good picture history. <br /> <br /> In total, I was disappointed with the movie.
