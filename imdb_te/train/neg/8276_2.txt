I knew that this film would be amazing, but I thought I would give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it was a probability. Unfortunately, the movie dialogue is very fake noisy and cheesy. I thought that Akfresh paid some money for the production of the film, because they were some of the suggestions seriously. The Aquafre code has a shot that can not help you, but you can not help but notice. Perhaps people should be angry and focus on how many times the aquafra products can be dropped. The film has its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
