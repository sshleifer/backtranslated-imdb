I'm browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this film. The child had the fanatical memories of the book, I decided to check this out. This is a movie that you really are playing. <br /> It's not worth looking at it. It's very boring and unhealthy. I also think that little kids are that way. The book has no magic to have. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible, but do not ignore ten minutes. <br /> There are lucky moments. The role of the witch is not very good. These kinds of families do not have a big deal. Older children, we should not look deep in things, but it's the whole movie that has been written and produced by people who have never before seen movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, "I really do not care how to finish this film and read the book instead.
