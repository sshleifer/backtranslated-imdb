I'm partially a fan of Miyazaki work. I mean "partial" because most of his movies fall into two categories: intelligent, and boring. <br /> <br /> The film is suffering from basic issues such as Miyazaki's recent film, "Haww's Moving Castle". <br /> <br /> The first third part of the film is related to the disclosure of this post. -A set of apocalyptic world story, and a very interesting story about actually unraveling. From then on things go to the hill. The middle part of the film is designed largely by thin-covered eco-campaigning, and extinction of Japanese animated films wasted by relying on endangered spirituality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a totally different picture, What's left of it is obscure (this is a common myth that shows Nausci when I was flying NASCI - I saw a sad blue-generation copy, poor color), but it is less sense and finally left me confusing.
