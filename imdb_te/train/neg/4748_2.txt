I thought I needed a lot of work (especially plot) work. Parts of the film are western and unrealistic for attempts to produce an eastern expression in the film. <br /> <br /> At first, when I told Shen Wendy that China would help her study her history, I am very happy that the audience will enjoy some. Information about Chinese history; But the film does not show that the silver is actually read in Chinese history. <br /> <br /> Instead, Wendy's only practiced the way she remembered what she studied, which made me frustrated and frightened me. <br /> I'm really sad, roles moon cakes - moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good tastes. But they did not mention its real significance. The Anton Festival, who spoke about any relevance to the Moon's cake, could not explain them or go deep. Moon Lady - they mentioned the myth associated with the moon. Myth is the first of ten sunshine and how everything grows, but one day has gone up to ten suns, drying the earth with increasing intense heat; So divine archer, Hu, only made nine shots in ten sands, and only one sun (different versions of nine horns in nine suns) remained. Because of his heroic support, the pill of his immortality was given, so that he would have raised up to ten counts, but his wife, Chang-o, stole it. After stealing, she fled to the moon, where her rabbit met. Then she came up with a thought and brought the cat to the rabbit to lay many pieces, so she spread the earth on the earth by immortalizing her. (There are some variations of this story but in my childhood, I have, too, heard about this version). <br /> <br /> I thought about this as a culturally conscientious program. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Teachers with monks fought with the idea that Terra-Kata Warriors (statues like the life of the soldiers) were of importance to Chinese history. The Terra-Kata Waters acts as a connection of the Chinese past and the monks preferred to destroy the connection to the monuments is too westernized (anywhere must be killed badly). <br /> <br /> Wendy, she does not have a complete Chinese knowledge to be Chinese-American and has no problem with destroying these priceless artifacts. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is Westernized because it is all about monks and shen ... That is, it is rated by TVPG due to violence, which is about Confucius cooperation and harmony. <br /> <br /> The sanyas seem to be more precise to avoid violence and attempt to work peacefully before resorting to violence. <br /> <br /> In all, the producer, the writer or the director did not complete their research and instead employed a deadly and effortless job. I have suggested that they will stop streaming the movie or they may shoot again in the movie, so it will have more accurate information; However, I give credit (2 stars) to eliminate a sequence that is both Asian and Asian and smart and quiet.
