How can you mix this honorary star of young British actors and come up with a pile of film manure? The terrible script, the frustrating intense camera, was pretty revised, badly played badly. Rice Ippans only attempts to fill his role in life. Another "distinct" evidence that sometimes "different" is equal to "deck". Why fail to make money to read scripts? Help yourself: Excluding yourself and doing something else - like a mallet hit on your knees. It is less painful and fun than this film!
