Wherever the director realizes this story, somewhere somewhere is not exactly wrong. The film to rebuild one of the most beloved movies in the film, fails in every aspect of film making. Even the best of artists can not tuning, and the film goes to show that the film is just a big mistake. <br /> <br /> Editing is poor. Dirt is directed. Acting is not in this world (OM)! <br /> <br /> If someone paid me a ticket or gave it to me, I can not see the movie. It's a free burger.
