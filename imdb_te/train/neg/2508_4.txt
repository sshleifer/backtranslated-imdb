About the time they released this movie on DVD. Some people know that I will reveal this film due to the film of the Dreamers. <br /> <br /> The DVD release of this film, I am very disappointed with any special feature, 5.1 DD sound. If WB is up, you can make this stuff better. The audio and toy quality in this film need some serious help. <br /> <br /> The WW did not make the film. They may have placed the CD through the mode that contains all the songs they have on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I would recommend buying this DVD. Yes, because it's a classic image. But WB has to add some special feature. Take notes from other group images, The Five Heatbirds, or The Temptation You can just watch the show, and the sound in both of them is much better than this DVD.
