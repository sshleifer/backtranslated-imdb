Steve McQueen certainly has the most loyal fans out there. He certainly knows an attractive fellow, the most attractive big screen ever. But McQueen can not save the turkey of this shot with images that appear as a brown camera in the real areas of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new kid who has no criminal record, a bank robber in the other gang. There is more than a broader indication that there is a homosexual relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He did not like all the other criminals, especially because there was no criminal resume. Steve is also a girlfriend girlfriend in Molly MacCard and Clarke, along with her crane Denton and James Dukas, hangs with pretty tough characters. <br /> <br /> There are two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Sticks who exploit the Great St. Louis Bank. Guggenheim made mostly documentaries and sticks never made. Steve's performance as one of those two jokers is best suited to performing Marlon Brando's simulation. <br /> <br /> The film may be the worst by Steve McQueen. <br /> <br /> I would like Dick Powell and Four Star Productions to sign him for already wanted dead or alive. Except for dressing for this turkey, people ignore.
