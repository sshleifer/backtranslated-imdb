Anyone who is interested in this comment over the age of 80 for this film, I think I should say something about this. I'm not a producer of the product, a thought-provoking dialogue or an eye-catching movie maker. However, I am saying this movie is good. I do not know why I do not know ... I mean there's almost everything you want out of a horror film: blood, outrageousness, accidentally humor, etc. According to this testimony it should be my favorite. Furthermore, Zombie 3 is an image. <br /> <br /> You scream on the screen. When the girl left the man in the army when the girl breaks out to find their car water (these spoils do not worry so nothing). She walked into an abandoned hotel or something I see. Did she know that there was a friggin lake in the middle of her building ??? Yes she goes out for a lake and goes over a lake. Why? Cuz wants people to know that she is not the answer (who does not leave there cuz) when she is called: "Is there anyone there?" <br /> <br /> I have given this film more than 1 star because there is a reason. This is really how good it is, since I have a few times, because you need to look again, since it is over-the-top in every aspect of the film. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this film is not blood, it is the Gore sea. <br /> <br /> Also, there are many exceptional creatures in it: one zombie-baby (with an adult-sized hand ???) and an amazingly flying head just to name two. <br /> Do you think the worst and cheeky movies you've never known when you try and you thought of '50 sci-fi movies? I believe that zombies like Zombi 3 and it should be on top of that. It has all the aspects: Scientists argue the government, the warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, the fight against the armies of the monsters, and so on. This is the 80's plan 9! If I want to buy it I can not say that this money is waste, I think it's a lot worse. And if you find the worst to imagine Zombi 3 underestimated, it's not all bad. <br /> If I really do not like it, it does not say it's impossible. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll hate this movie. Oh, psy. Killing Birds (the older brother 5) rules! (Should I dispel my loyalty?)
