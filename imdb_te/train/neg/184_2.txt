Mann is photographed in Alberta Rocky Mountains in an incredible fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give delightful performances because they are always visible. <br /> <br /> When you came to Hollywood - Dayson City, a marshal of the people of Yukon (yes a Marshall!) and come to a maul to enforce the law, then gun farmers control the town of the city? <br /> The Klondike gold rush does not have anything similar to the Canadian side of the border. <br /> <br /> The Canadian audience is prepared for the type of Rauf's Refer Madness, enjoying this ludicrous plot, or shake your head with grumbling.
