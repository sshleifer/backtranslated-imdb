I do not know who wrote the script for this film, but since the first moment I was frustrated. In all possible decisions they will be made in the mountains, why do they make a decision, which is the most dangerous? Why do criminals work worse, do they get a large amount of money from the bank and stay away from it? Why is not the main culprit helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab money and fly away with a hostage chick? And there are more cases of inappropriate behavior. I like to give this image 5 points for nice picture and great scenery scenery, but due to the logic behavior of the characters, I can give this picture 1 point ...
