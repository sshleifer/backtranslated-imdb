I started watching this movie waiting for some tolerant Hammer horror movie Venezuela ... I'm not too far away. Clemensed Gore was a fair amount, and they threw a lot of nudity, but the second half of the film provided some counterclockwise. Sacred cow, they were originally thought of in the story, and did not completely drop the predictable predictions. <br /> I mean, the "thankless" nudity is not very grateful after all, it fits the story and setting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, like bad image, but bad movies go, it is more shady than a shady shade than Lost Women and Robot Monster's Mesa.
