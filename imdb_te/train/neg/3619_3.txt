Usually a young boy (Jake) has a zombie in his room and has a family that his parents are fighting at all times. <br /> <br /> The movie is less than a soap opera and suddenly determines Jake Rambo's death and killing the zombie. <br /> <br /> Well, when you're going to make a film, it's decided to have a thriller or drama! The movie as a play is watchable. Parents are divorced and arguing in real life. And then we have the jack in his room and it's completely all of the ruins! I thought BOOGYMANMAN was going to watch this movie, instead I saw a drama with some meaningless thriller scars. <br /> <br /> For just about 10 to 3. Dialogues for playing & parenting dialogs. Jake for shots: just ignore them.
