Spiers: I gave this game good reviews how many people are surprised me. It's awful. The script and voice acting alone can destroy it. Gabriel and Grace are very unlabelable characters in this game. You pray almost to their deaths. And all the worst, there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in the Beast inside. <br /> <br /> The absence of true vampires is quite disappointing. If you look for Anne Rice Style Vampire story, forget it. The story of this game is very small with vampires. <br /> <br /> In this story there are radical, and pretty many blasphemies, the views of Christianity. I'm amazed I got off the drawing board. I'm not even Christian and I found it risky. Most likely, the story centers around a search for the sacred grail and burial treasure. Abducted a royal baby who was in sight, really pushed to the side. There is no urgent sense for Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, he would never ask for the baby for the first time after the first few blocks. <br /> <br /> Graphics are very bad. Characters move with duplicate speeds by tapping the letters better. They are chunky and old. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace is difficult to get out of this horrible game engine from The Beast with Infinity. I'm not really sure why it's a terrible move, but they do sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel thinks how his best friend Mosley thinks he is more of his sister and that he does not feel himself. And he realizes that he really is sleeping together. But he almost ignored that time, so unlikeable throughout the game. His conversation was the worst in the game. And he is constantly making stupid sexual discoveries in any sport the whole game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be Dear John Letter. <br /> <br /> I realized that the story was annoying and boring. I hoped a royal baby story that kidnapped vampires. And I'm looking forward to seeing and fighting vampires, perhaps Gabriel or Grace. But not. Instead, the story focuses on the writings of the writer of Christianity. No shame. <br /> They have elements of great adventure for me, instead we have got it. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting parts of the game are at the very end. In the end we have some action style puzzles. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this game. It years ago, when I got out of it it had gotten back, and I hated the game engine that I have unveiled it for so many years. Recently I filled it to see what I missed. Now I'm sorry. My favorite characters were destroyed. I hope to have a fourth game to win the series. I think it's time to come. It is a terrible insult to end the series with this installment.
