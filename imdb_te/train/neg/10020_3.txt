Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' Over-Haiped, Stylized, Production. Tell one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, Mass also rejected it. Why? The script of the films is an ambitious 2 year old baby. The king of the script and the great script could not even make any great director at all times. Tashan is seen in a very successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars. But if you blade the script, nothing on earth can save you. Bad! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, a leading actor. But how does he play this role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact his only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor was never hot. She looks stunning and you stand up, all of the leaves. Saif Ali Khan did not come here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Fawah and Yashpal Sharma were wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring image. You should avoid films that fail at the box office.
