I finally found out why Dr. Cox exposed, because the only reason I commented. While we all have been aware of this week this week, Dr. Cox showed these images in a different order. Our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving nurse Roberts shakes his head to the latest episode Dr Cox to die. For some basic reason they have to be regularly shown and they have forgotten that they have escaped continuity. For shame, scrubs. They have made the mistake. I remember when Elliot was trying to date Scott Foley and wet her 2 seconds before her hair hits the water. I tried not to notice these things, but it should stand on my favorite show.
