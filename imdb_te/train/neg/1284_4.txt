The film is a tall structure without any climax. Most of these people are not in their minds, or there are no majority. Way too often this film came out soft. I did not say soft films are bad. But no matter how much sugar you have, it should not be empty in T-bone steak. The film is supposed to be a revenge for crime against a culture, but it is a small bar-clash. One of them is just a knife. Tim Roth's role (and yes, he plays well). Rob Roy is a weak "hero" without knowing how to use a knife and is "insulting" the way he is insulting. It is a play this movie has periods, but it is best to go to the nature of Scotland nature. This is a short short burst of my book called "soap".
