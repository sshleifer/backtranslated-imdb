Please, financial assistance - spend your money elsewhere! Summary of the film: The First Lady cheated her because she was murdered by her husband. That's it. <br /> <br /> No one is expected except Cuba and Angie, who does not know anyone and runs a mass murder conspiracy that is completely free. <br /> <br /> The President's, defects a killer's bullet in Cuba, which is particularly fond of some specific points ... This is the picture of the Cuban and Angie watch from a news camera, and They see ... a clue. <br /> <br /> Speaking to the President of Cuba, They will go a long way to save the film. There are PSM comments that there is no conspiracy. There are more than one in Cuba suit. The PSM then includes the FBI, CIA, and NSA in the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> MS Archer, First Lady, is a craptacular artist. Cuba would not be painting, and she said, "You're very close ... come back ... Look from a different angle, look from my perspective." Can anyone miss that clue?
