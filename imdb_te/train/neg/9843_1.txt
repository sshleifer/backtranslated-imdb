I only hate Robert De Niro's film. This is a stupid movie with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian de Palma's mafia movies should always be similar to Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved de Paul's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma at two different times, with greetings and the wedding party. Even though the wedding party was okay (I did not see the greetings). <br /> <br /> Playing the screen is really bad and unfunny. I can not even smile for any scene. The funny style of the film "Black baby bin" is also a chance and I do not like the scene where a person's sexual organ appears. So, this is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen! Just the worst. That is me aversion.
