You may or may not have heard, there's no real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. The title may ask why such a thing has been suggested, but this is really good because there is no other meaning about this film. Stories or plot never happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the fight between vampires and zombies, It looked like an 8-year-old girl applied. The scene was completely out of place and was out of place and had one of the characters struggling with a hedge trimmer (I was not kidding), but they used chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly the poor film I have seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Every person who is responsible for the production of this film is not completely abused. I learned that it was totally produced by 11 years. <br /> <br /> Really, despite all the criticism here, I really like watching this movie, which is a very bad movie, and it is very ridiculous. There are errors in it.
