Is the lowest possible possible one star? That's shame. Actually, I'm going to the IMDb lobby for a "zero stars" option. A star is also giving way too much to give this film. I've only seen microphones dangling on the head of the tank at the station? And acting, or should I say its lack? When the casting director arrives in town, it is not obviously a talent factor. My little sister Elementary School Talent Show offers great range and emotional depth. And those fake Irish voices are like nails in chalkboard. The only thing that can make this movie worse ... Oh, wait, there's nothing, it's not exactly right.
