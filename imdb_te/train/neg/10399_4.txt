One of the major drawbacks in the film is that the UPPs are satisfying to make fun, while filmmakers fail to recognize that they are not one of the mockers. This is one of the symptoms of the euphoria, the misunderstanding which they are adequately advanced (UPS) to understand the art. While the film understands and dislikes this feature, only those who love these images are proud of the likeness of the likeness of the dinner as the roles of the dinner are played. If these open-ended characters in the movie have a video library at home, I'll bet that American Psycho will be one of those movies.
