Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film will be curious at most levels. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon of the Poor) goes around Mexico, Guitar case of Bunders in a Sanford home killing his bloodthirsty gear wave Antonio Desperado. He chose a dirty "hunters" along the way (pills to become a vampire), and some men walked out to stop vampire vampires and they did not give any baststrey about her or her search (walking the sun and walking in sunlight and making her a custom to allow her to do so ). If you see the first Vampires, you already see it and make it much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies. Apparently, I think he's his main and incompetent past making his horror classic. His only good film from The Live (1987) was Vampires. All else is completely sharp, it's desperately cheap and up to the depleted ghosts of Mars ... and now these waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Carpenter Crony Wallace proves that he can not write his paper in a paper bag with his paper. Actually, Yans, Garons and Recycled Textured Script. I hate every role in the picture? The whole picture is not a single memorable character. How does this happen? This film is nothing to recommend it. DVD display is not good too; </ p> <p> Compared to Jason X: "Friday 13th SPACE" is a masterpiece. Now you can create a sequel and franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an amazing DVD menu.
