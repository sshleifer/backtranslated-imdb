The entry of this drummond is not continuous. Most of them are their victims, postponed marriages, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that occur in endless darkness, because the characters run from one location to another. The house looks like a city. Leo G. Carroll also has a clear suspect that no one will even see. He acts as a stranger and rather suspicious, but drummond and does not seem to take them anything. <br /> <br /> I know Alji is a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Ratburn Sherlock Holmes, he is incredible to imagine anyone with a taste or intelligence around him. Does he have a history behind him to explain how Drummond has become colleagues?
