<br /> <br /> James Michener is a very disappointing film based on the novel. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando's performance is even worse. His southern draw is ridiculous. He sounded like an elderly Southern lady roast coming home and found me laughing when he spoke. Brando is the greatest of the previous movies, where it is reduced to the laughing stock. <br /> <br /> Tyrone Power in "Witness for Prosecution", where Brando should be nominated for Best Actor instead. <br /> <br /> This film, which deals with racism, deals with the American government's effort to prevent marriages between American soldiers. <br /> <br /> Brando is facing Stone in this film. His anti-ties with Pro Prost are formed when he sees love with an Asian woman. The Lord only knows why Red Buttons and Miroshi Umeki supported Oscars for their performances. Nothing about performance. The performance on Umeki's screen was small and was depicted part of her without much. The film is well-directed by Mico Tako, who played well with Brando's girlfriend. She demonstrated great emotion as an anti-American, which found love with her role as Brando. <br /> <br /> In the World War 11, her face was unhappy with her father and brother losing laughter. She did not realize that she was in her dance. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott is the first known brother of Yvesobel in love with the girlfriend of Brenda's first love for "The Ten Commandments". Ricardo Montalban was wasting her appearance together. Pantria Owens, Brando's first love, has shown depth and faith for her performance.
