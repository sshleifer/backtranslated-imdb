It's a simple time (seventies), a simple place (San Francisco), a man who can make a cruel cruise cruise crucifixion into a simple picture of Christ, Dream sequences and inter cut that never end up on the Acid. <br /> <br /> The film is the worst example of a big, artistic, sloppy, gruesome, artificial school art frame. In the mid 70s entered art. I loved it! This train accident of the endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverb echo chamber acid guitar leaks starts once you can not take your eyes up to the ridiculous and absurd finish. A really crappy acid trip with your parents on its kind of a cross between Jesus Christ Superstar, and a water bed beyond the valley of dolls. <br /> <br /> "I'll tell you the plot because you can tell what happened to the past events that have continually crossed the cross or <br /> <br /> "Logan" shouts in the public allocation and is a really annoying iconography filmmaker around the most silent film crew. It looks like a really bad orgies, like Richard Dreyfus has an assistant role as an accountant. "The Suzanne" nominative character is a wholly elegant staircase and completely insane Comfortable "artist" character By h, goes completely insane. Either too much of his work or his paintings of ovartikto awful to excellent. Of course all of the terrible naked Susan. The coincidence of some of the other characters in the show, "the man" to be attached to the letter included a cigar. Suzanne is also hot for everyone. He made a statement. Everybody has to hate "man" I really can not figure out what to do with the story. There is also a mute girl. Trust me that the mute girl finally pays off, its incredible stupid.
