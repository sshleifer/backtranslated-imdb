Super Dome is one of the surprising images of why it was made. The whole plot is trying to suppress the superbow and all the efforts to stop them. The survival of Tom Selleck and Donna Mills survived to me. However, the most frustrating thing about it is that there is no football at all! Avoid it if possible.
