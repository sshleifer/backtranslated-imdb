The script for this TV soap opera was very bad, and Hopkins had to play as an undergraduate drama student to bring some life into some script-dead character. I do not know whether I am the director's intention, but Hopkins' sano vanity, fear and lack of self respect. Real Siano probably had everything, but why would you make a movie about him? Mussolini is a bit more convincing, and his long way is close to the truth down. Eddie Mussolini is plain ridiculous (because of Sarandon's, but due to fake script), the alleged hero of this accusation is the main character. See only when you enjoy the Venezuela soap opera.
