A slave girl and a poor farmer in the life of Good Earth follows in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story was great, but I hated that Angels had decided to star in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as a farmer's father. <br /> <br /> Asians could not afford Hollywood's racist beliefs. The main characters. Angels take the look of Chinese to be equal to the Anglo-Americans playing shoe polish in their faces to play.
