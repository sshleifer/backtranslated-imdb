For my 8th birthday, Cassam was given a book version, and says that book reforms are always better than the book reforms, but this time they are wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the film, Max is a young boy in the film and a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> I'm bullied by neighboring kids, which I do not blame them because he's a small canister bag. <br /> The story is just plain stupid and very cliche. <br /> When I was 8 years old, I thought it was a sly idea. . People who have worked on this film should never have careers after surprise wards whom they should never have because of an embarrassment. I am more likely about how the film will succeed, but you should already know when reading the plot.
