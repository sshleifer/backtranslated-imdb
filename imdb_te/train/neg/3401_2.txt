I rented this movie about what was not given for the Academy Award, but after watching it, it's easy to find out why it did not. <br /> <br /> In this film a young child attempts to get involved with the death of his parents, in an accident (the picture is not clear on this) and how his grandfather used to tell him the fairy tales. Fairy tales contain only the bits of interest in the story, but they are so small, and do not seem to have any point really. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale is related to a boy who is trying to get a magical pucca for his dying girl to save his life, but the boy was delayed by the first time by delaying the flavor he was a few seconds late to save his girlfriend - grandfather then the boy He says he is very impatient, but it is a defeat As a result of his failure to do half of what kind of slow. The perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> Even though Sky's photographs are beautiful, this year's fairy tales are shot in Stardust Sky and another beautifully photographed image.
