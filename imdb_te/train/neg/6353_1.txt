For a comic writer, Woody Allen really allows the viewer to view the viewer with this little effort in character development. There are some entertaining moments, but their diner will not hear tumbling tennis balls. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ferrell wastes his time, failing to display his funny delivery. Amanda Pete did well, but again, the film does not have a moving room in this movie. The film is too big and dull, but if it is not managed, Radha Mitchell did. <br /> If you enjoy the movies in one sequence and one of the scenes and do not really do anything, their writer can sometimes write conversations in a conversation, then you will like it.
