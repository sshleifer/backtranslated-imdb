Visually? Very sure. I see this good for a while in some movies. Sky Captain and The Tomorrow World use fantastic cinematography, computer graphics and creative future designs to create a historically well-known world. The time period is 1930 or early 40. The film tells the latest attacks on New York City by stealing generators and stealing mechanical armies, and for some different reasons. In addition, the mysterious disappearance of relevant scientific minds. Who can stop them and save the world? Alright, it does not take the leap of faith to become a skyscraper primarily hotter by the head of his reporter with his leadership, and with his loyal, totally effective odds in both of them. No ski captain is in story and graphics in the atmosphere and graphics. The plot for this film is derided. It is said that this movie is going to be a concept like serial serial earlier. They have a lot of stories and bad performances - but none of them are and I'm not one of them, budget and big names in the film. One can think of two Academy Award-winning performers and Jude Laws, but Sky Captain sinks deeply. Despite its aesthetic look, I thought I would end up with the movie and I was able to get it in my life. I am very interested in the story that created a bit of interest. I do not care about any of the glib films. Paltrow is just awful. Jolie is a joke with virtually no substance. The law does not have a single-liner tradition much squarely on his limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not even Smith, Mel Gibson, or Wesley Snipes. At least for me, the sad thing about Sky Captain was that it was too little delivered to deliver. I was frustrated for ten minutes in the film - waiting to hook my interest - and it did not come.
