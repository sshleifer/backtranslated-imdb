The loyalty to Peter Faul gave me this horror picture (1) it deserves. (For this matter, the credibility of Mr. Fall was to watch the film from head to tails.) Even if you forgive all the glitches, this is just a "columbo" film for the poor created for TV. I watched on TV for free. I hate hitting the bucks for printing.
