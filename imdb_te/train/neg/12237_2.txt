Original Clamation Rudolf: Pretty good. Original Fausty Cartoon: Need a little work, but it will be worse. But in the July Fourth, Frosty and Rudolph? C'mon! Will you be there !!! This is an image that has not been made. This is bad. It did not really happen any special holiday except for July 4. This was especially bad because of the affair with Frost and Rudolf's Christmas Season. And any song will be destroyed by singing too much. Often the songs this movie looks much more than it really is. The film has attempted to combine two Charmmast Time characters with American Traditional Holidays (which seems almost "limiting" to the US), a lot of meaning and a lousy storyline. The result? Bad picture that can not be viewed at any time of the year. Even if you like Frosty and Rudolph I would like to invite you for this film.
