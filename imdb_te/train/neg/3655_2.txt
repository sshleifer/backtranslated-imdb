Oh my, I think it's a single cheetah that I have never seen before. I'm serious, it's one of the ultimate B-movies. The first proof is not $ 5 DVD. Oh no, this is very important for you. <br /> <br /> "I lived in the 17th century Japan, Samurai, whose name was Maya. He was sent on an epic journey around the world to obtain 5,000 muskets from the king of Spain. A violent storm in the sea was intended to buy their precious gold weapons and almost all of their lives Maya has to fight with all odds for survival and his beloved Japan ya The tempo should be safe. "It is" a multi-million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents, "it said. <br /> <br /> I saw another movie. It's not epic, and it's not exactly a multi-million dollar. No, 'Shogun Maaida' really has the crazy adventures of the enjoys spoken Maya (Shah Kosgi). He's not really a shogun, but it's not important. What is important is that he had been reading a fortress in John Clacy 'Monte Python and the Holy Grail', and he was well aware of his ability to go from intense scenes to show his samurai mind powers. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is the show's cozy English assent. The film does not have nearly everything that makes a good image, but it's always delivered by some of the coolest Engrish voice, always che cheep lines that make it up some. And honestly, do you really need anything? Towards the end, you can carry the 'Shogun Maya' and the last line of Kosogee and repeat it again. The tape is probably wear before you're tired of one line. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Very very cheesy.
