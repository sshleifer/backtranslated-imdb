Apparently you can do anything they can offer enough money to an actor. I do not know how much John Rees-Dave's earned, but he would have to apologize for his fans to have a relationship with such a rotten film in a lot of money. Special effects The effects of the 1950s B films are still in the cast and the remaining cast is even worse. How bad it was when acting gave a second best performance in my opinion as a child. English is terribly serious and I think nobody could really speak English just remembering the script of words and reminding them how to make their character "like life" and trying to make both the real two.
