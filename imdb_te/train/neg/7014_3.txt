What a waste! The film may have been really good, but the writing was, in particular, the worst, and the main characters were shallow and unwell. Mike Mayers is good, and the historical past of the late 1970s has been well documented, but overall, the film is a waste of time. Instead, the watch movie deals with similar themes and the same basic time frames, the great bookie knights.
