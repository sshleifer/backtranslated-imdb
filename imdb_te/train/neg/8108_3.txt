After reading this book I have a lot of meaning, the idea that the book has given me no idea. It surprised me that Kaffmann also liked this book if he successfully did something. Where is it too easy? From the very first scene, music removes most of the dialogues and feelings, and continues through this film. I think the producers feel this story is light, with the music playing right through the cinema, but they are totally unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Instead, we give music to everything we feel about movies, so that we are flowing over them and weigh more for everything. <br /> If this adaptation fails another example is embellishing the story line which has become more dramatic. In this movie we will meet Tamas at Franz Street, who is going to see Sabine. <br /> <br /> The conversation / passing entrance that does not occur in this book makes Tom's story more lighter. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples here, the story has changed, the imo for the worst, but because this book is complete, it does not change in the movie because it is a rabbit style. Would it be astonishing than just writing about the movie, even though it's generous reviewers in their minds to write their book and film experience in mind? This is a movie that is unanimous. I recommend reading those who read the book. For those who have said, I will waste your time and probably end up writing similar stay-clear alerts.
