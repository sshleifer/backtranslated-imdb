After seeing the product of Canadian / Iceland / British 2004 of "Beowulf & Grendel", I thought it was a wonderful and wonderful idea, and I came to this - the first of the 3 new Beowulf films of the year - with shakes. As soon as I heard "Viking" I saw the horns of the horns, and I was upset. These are migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never dressed horns on their helmets (horns kicked off your helmet to your enemy and then the brain you can easily). Then there is the Grollland's Palace, which looks for a movie, not about the 6th-century Denmark, about Greece or Rome. Several historic periods that look like swords and armor appear to have been cut from earlier movies. I found the weapons used by Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven" and a character from the "Beowulf & Grendel" windshield steel craft reproduction film! Outside of the basic story of the original epic poem, the writing is tough and acting is completely wooden and astounding. The largest Uu is a secret-weapon crossbow that completes scene of scene and exploding projectiles that have been purchased from Iraqi rebels. The special story is that he and his mother, on the steroids of Beowulf, never claimed to be crushed from a shield, in the poem. Thanks to the gods for the Buzzoo crossbows! I have gone, but I'm not.
