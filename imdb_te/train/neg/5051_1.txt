I am amazed and disgusted by the people who say that this film is very accurate about Vietnam, and there is no one there ever. The film is true of the entire Vietnam War. Becoming Rodney King is true of all the police officers. Yes, bad things are happening (and), but usually people like you and me. They are morals, they are not killing machines, they do not have all the drugs. Aggression is not an exception in Vietnam, not rule. They are rarely more than "hype" will lead you to believe. The Oliver Stone Vietnam War has a knack for creating movies featuring this brutal bloodbath, but is actually more dependent on Star Wars. If you honestly believe Vietnam's generalizations, learn yourself a favor and truth. Fact: VM Kong and NVA have done very bad things to South Vietnam than any soldier in the US Armed Forces. Fact: During World War II soldiers were more intensely hostile than a soldier in Vietnam, and they were honored when they came home. Good Americans working in this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; It is a great disgrace to say that there is a "more real" imagination of the truth, even if the war is fiercely resisted from political perspective.
