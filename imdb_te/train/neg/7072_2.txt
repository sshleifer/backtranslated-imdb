I should pick up a reference when I saw a Fred olen Ray film - but I thought 'he should be better than his ordinary rubbish', I wrong! This is the worst image target for children. The performance was awful, humor does not exist, The Direction is the worst I've seen so far & no special effects on the 1950s Disney film. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 80s he once lived a life of hope. <br /> <br /> I do not see a sequel in 1999 <br /> <br /> You can watch a good kid in the movie / Kid or movie 'Honey Eye Shark / Blade to You' br> My 19th rank: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> The kid is a cinematic rating: - 3/10 is the best!
