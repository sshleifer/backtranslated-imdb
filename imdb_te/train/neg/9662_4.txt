I usually read reviews before I watch a movie. I did not do anything before I saw the TLB, and I was very surprised at the IMDb average rating. I found the story lacking. <br /> <br /> "If you are willing, the injured soldiers looked at me very easily, especially with a low budget. But prepare yourself to laugh ... As Olympic gymnast, some guys are thrown in the air. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> There are scenes that have close fight, shouting and German <br /> <br /> When they speak of a single actor / voice actress, they all have exactly the same sound, and this is just a 'typical' German voice. <br /> <br> I definitely do not recommend this film to have someone with a sad and wheat quality, except for people who just want to laugh.
