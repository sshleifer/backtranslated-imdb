Songwriter Robert Taylor (like Terry) "Dizzy, Slap-Happy" and the otherworldly Norma Shearer (as in Consilsu) can not be seen directly. "Her sun is shining, even when it rains," Mr. Taylor recounts. Mr. Taylor spent his voice in his grief. Finally, with Palm Beach Casino Shearer's frequency, Taylor "I love you!" Shearer brushes him because she is engaged as George Saunders (Toni). However, to fix a gambling loan, Shearer hires Taylor as "her cardboard lover" to jeopardize Mr. Sanders. <br /> <br /> The title of the film invites a clear and appropriate three-word review: "Her cardboard movie". Shearer's last film performance was among the world's biggest actors from "The Who Gets Slaped" (1924, another Consuelo) to "The Woman" (1939). To be fair, Shearer felt that the MGM wanted to see the audience. <br /> <br /> If Shearer continues, she may become a better actress than "prominent lady"; apparently she is not interested, <br /> <br /> Her cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cookor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
