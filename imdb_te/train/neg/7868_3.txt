I saw many of Guy Madin's movies, many of them liked it, but it literally gave me a headache. John Gundebeck's edits are very attractive, and, rather than a tour-the-force sequence, displays the headlines of a head, and interferes with the ability of the actors to communicate with the audience. <br /> Another thing that I did not like about the film was cruel than the previous stories of Madin - despite his darkest aspects of his films, his sympathetic characters for the characters gave an extraordinary sense of humanity. <br /> <br /> Since the IMDb is required to add more lines of text before accepting my review, the guy playing "Guy Madin" is pretty much angry with his facial expression.
