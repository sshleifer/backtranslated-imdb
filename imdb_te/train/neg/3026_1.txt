Domeno became a model bounty hunter based on Harvey's life. I say 95% is fiction. I always keep open mind when it comes to movies, but when this film is clearly visible throughout the film, the movie has lost all the movies, I can not stand and it's topped, the heroine of the story is hoarse and an arrogant b. I wanted to end with her being shot in her head. It's very frustrating, too elegant and the way is very boring, and I really think it's not something big-time directors do based on the life of some ignorant snobby brat who need movies based on their own or author's own imagination.
