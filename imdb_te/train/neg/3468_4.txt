A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (Diza-Ish Molly Ringwall!) To complete the horror film that she tried to make her mother (the drunkenly Kylie Minogue!) 12 years ago. One interesting plot selection to say at least because it knows that there is no worry in the female directors for any Aussie Horror Fan. Molly had to kill the original mentalist in the original set because the film was a curse. But she is back because she needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse still exists and people are "set." Cut is an Aussie effort in the modern "slasher", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting on the table. In fact, it was halfway to Wes Craven's 90s film filmography. The film is a law "scream" which loses the world name (except for Acey's name-slippery - Jane Campion ... see how it's not funny) and "very real or this movie" is "New Nightmare." Editing is bad, music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the film will have a sense of humor: at one time, the girl dressed in the filmmakers is talking to the owner of the house they're shooting now: "Do not worry, we have your own home, it's our own," he answers, "this is not for me, As you live in a dump! "Ha! And enough of Molly's ridiculous one liners do not regret this rent. "What food do you coke here?" (When she was traveling in a movie professor car) and "who knows who I can buy any tofu?" (The first thing on the set) and "Where is Hell my agent?" (Oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her.)
