Rogers purchased the movie at bargain bin in the video store for $ 2. <br /> <br /> I am enjoying a good movie and it looks good. <br /> <br /> The film was very clearer in the 1970s. Unfortunately unfortunately the story line does not follow and the image is very much done. In fact, after watching 45 minutes I turned it off and I saw how slow it was a week later. <br /> <br /> If you are in B movies, be it for yourself, beware that this movie is slow and not much <br /> <br /> Really happens, and I can not tell the hero of the story too much <br /> <br />
