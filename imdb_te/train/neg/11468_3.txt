I do not know that Rakesh is killing people, revenge and revenge, and my god is absurd. Orkos is very precisely the film is not a cold-blooded killer, it's silly. Orkos is very clever, and does not let me down, but they know me and understand a sense of how they are capable of. So I told him how awesome it is when I came out of this film. So I am at least somewhat amused by it. Personally, I would recommend going to Jaws if I wanted to see an animal-killing-humans kind of film. But if you like something like me and look at something from realism so far, I'll go ahead. : D
