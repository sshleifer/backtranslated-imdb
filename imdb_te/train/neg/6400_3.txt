Priyar and Gleason's comic strip tissue-thin plot, weak script, tedious acting and the dog did not preserve the funniest continuation of compilation of this chaos. It has very few memorable moments, but it is very dry. As a child I remember this as a lux-warm vehicle for two actor-comedians, but the flow and sense of what was being told in each scene and how the entire plot was never something strange about these relationships. Looking back over many years, it screams schlock-a-mania. I do not worry about the racial controversy because I look at the film with a little intimidation. The scenes are a combination of two minutes of comedy bits (not very good), but in the relevant series, the local watering hole is very clear for me. Between scenes and scenes, no poem or cause, converts feelings and inspirations into the dam, no one ever thought that the concept was excluded from the screenplay. This is not a gemstone to begin with. Both actors have no side effects, and this disaster has never happened. Maybe my sense of humor is very refined ...
