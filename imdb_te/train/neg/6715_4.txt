I entered the theater, which was an entertaining pass if I was 90 minutes entertaining. I am not entertaining or enlightened. The film did not make the mind of what it thinks and would not be much. Some funny lines and some wonderful presents references (400 blows - come for this character!). While the characters are treated with great respect, thirty homosexuals get it worse: all the exploits, fat, sad, slabs. See Parting Glenses, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over The Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia If you are in mood for a movie dealing with gay contacts. <br /> <br /> You know me. <br /> <br />
