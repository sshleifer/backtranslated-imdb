I like silent images, but it's very soft. I can not say that I am worth the hour as I have said. I do not think any version of the film will come close to the book itself. And the kids do not try it out, they may be freak. And the woman who played Polenne, what is her age? 38? I know that labor laws are still different ... but people should come.
