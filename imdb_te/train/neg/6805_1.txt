I saw the movie 10 minutes ago. Wow I believe what I have seen yet. <br /> <br /> When is this film so bad? If I list all the errors in the movie, this review takes me a lot of sentences. (Very funny flaws, though because of that bad) <br /> <br /> The commandos assigned to protect you aircraft with amazement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hey, you know, <br /> <br /> But when I look at the film very hard, how much worse it is to see how bad it is,
