Oh joy! Oh joy! Very nice another movie! Or, I thought. In fact, this one goes straight to the "so bad its good" phase and, sin goes on, "Its good was bad, but they are screwed up and it's just plain bad". <br /> <br /> To start its path too long. Cut half an hour and it may be more reasonable. Then put in the ridiculous conspiracies as "he'll be great if all the food and the mission fails because he's sabotaging the mission to save the land," he said. Duh! Or "speaking bomb" plot finally appeared in the Dark Star. Like the Dark Star, the bomb is a fraudulent one. "Add a dash" out of a kindergarten play we can not work our way and you have a brief solar crisis briefly. <br /> <br /> The light relief is in the form of Jack Palans (or Jack Pants, as we called him), whose sole purpose is to drive a kid around the desert and when the boy's father comes to pick him up ... Between driving and photoning, Jack breaks down with nonsense and is thin and struggling, but it contributes little to the story. In short, he's the best bit of the film. <br /> <br /> "My most controversial line of distributed straight-forward" is when he meets Charlton Heston, when his eldest son is meeting for the first time. His award is that his son is over his cobbler and a Captain Kirk's synthetic thrust Comments out slightly "out of shape" when standing there with the gut. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, it is a little less to recommend this movie, and I thought about Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> The ending of the tips is this picture more and more, if you are foolish enough to see, for enjoyable. <br /> <br <br /> <br /> When Chuck Heston is on the screen and speaks, he is emptied by telling a line from the Epsie Planet by Ndi, "Get me out of your dirty feet!" <br /> When the leader of the woman emphasizes (it's a lot of time), she hopes that she will have a gas connection and will soon die. At the end of the "broke of the ship" scenes, tech / engineer guys keep hoping to not afford a Scotty-ism "You can change the cannae physical laws!" <br /> <br /> "I'm halfway out of it and I'm not able to perceive anything, or the plot (though it's ridiculous) Do not worry about tuning for some, you will not lose anything.
