<br /> This is a review of the English release by Disney, Alison Lohan, Patrick Stewart and co. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this film to be good. Really really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and I'm excited to see it after seeing all the lovely reviews of this pre-myaya. But I was amazed, I looked at the quality of the film and was surprised. The next films are from well-designed plot, 3-dimensional characters, and from the best movie music ... well ... forever. <br /> <br /> There are positive perspectives. Like all magic films, it is very unpredictable with a tremendous fantasy / science fiction setting, which is dominant insects in the post-apocalyptic world. Naucia can also appreciate the animation of some distance from other films. (Miyazaki's subsequent films are not beautiful and fluid) and the English voice acting performed very well. <br /> <br /> But this film ... just not ... is good ... the characters are all on the cardboard - from everyone in the middle to the relentless evil Tolmekians, from the saccharine sweet little Nausicaa. Once you've seen everyone for 30 seconds, you see everything. <br /> <br /> Then Hiyachi is playing my favorite movie composer, but Nausca does not do justice to him. Half of music is over 80 keyboards in overdrive, and generally it enters and suddenly does not help with visuals. <br /> <br /> But before he waited, I asked Hiyashi to compose music for a lot of music. There is a great message with this picture, right !! Let's save all the environment! It's very bad that you hit the head with a big sledge like this. Nasika Hughes has a scene in a tree. No, really. <br /> <br /> I am very sad to talk about how dull this film is. But for some reasons other reviews on IMDb to admire it. <br /> <br /> If you're an individual devoted to anime, the music of the 80s, and the plants in a tree can increase. Every Arbor Day, maybe you prefer this movie. Otherwise, save your money to his next movies, because they spend a lot of time.
