I love Westerns. I can see them all day. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is my favorite time. This is because it is displayed in the CMT and I see "Silverado" probably for the 8th day just for the other day. However, this film, Shilo Falls is no doubt in the least Western countries I've ever seen. Acting is terrible all around. Explain at the end of what they see in the suspicious compass. Katina girl who looks good on the good part I think. The dialogue seemed just deliberate to make time to make an acceptable length of the most noticeable long interrupts. This movie is not worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. If I had such a thing, I thought I'd rent and rent a refund. I hate to say that I can not see the movie in the end, because I finished. That's so bad that I stopped half way. Please do a good job if you decide to do the other for the director. This is a picture of the ability to turn people into the Western population.
