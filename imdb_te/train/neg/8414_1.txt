Yes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled storyline praises Hollywood style and has taken scripts from improved Making-in-the-To-the-Music-Industry Films. <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. <br /> For more questionable "talented" Beyonce drawn, glamor clothing and choreography = more money. As a throwback style, you have to congratulate the original groups (without digital voice and Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's intervention will make this hypocritical garbage.
