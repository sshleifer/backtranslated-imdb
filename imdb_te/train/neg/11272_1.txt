... the first film I had to walk. And the cast and pre-screening of the band (I'm not involved, I'm quick to add). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br </ P> </ p> </ p> <p> Very worse, woodworking, the essence of awful actors, all of which are combined without a plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's cast was a bizarre, almost joke. <br /> <br /> When I leave the screening, the director and producers are drunk in the bar outside the cinema. <br /> They could not sit it again. <br /> <br />
