Well, I bought the zombie blood bat trilogy thinking the vacuum crying is fun. Without it fun, that's what it is. The movie is really mindless and does not have any plot or character development. The primary problem with this film is killing and gore. In general, every killing will be exactly the same. ZOmbies can not afford anyone else. Yes, it's OK, but you also need to kill some original ones. I mean I got really lame, every kill was exactly the same, exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love Gore, and Gore did nothing to me in this film. It's just boring. The storyline, again with the same person, is the same lap. I also like this film. I shot on video gore movies ... like the red neck zombies. But I'm not a kid. The film has good points, but none of them are available. I have helped many flood of "zombies" and there are as many as 100 zombies, they are so many people who have participated in and participated in the world. But overall it is a terrible film.
