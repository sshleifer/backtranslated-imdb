Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. It is a sin that was used by people who do not know what they do with them. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe 2 things to anyone who can read the number of my post reviews. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a pretty person in the low budget movie, I'll usually point them down. So now let's get this route now. This is a low budget horror film I do not like. Acting, for the most part, is terrible, ridiculous of the effects, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as I have seen worse this year. The resident cute boy ... Docs Miller (Bog) won that gift hands down. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he's not just a sharp edgy body with nice eyes and a beautiful butt ... he can actually work (as well as he can in this unusual film). <br /> <br /> In the version of Cliff Notes, there is a story (do not worry, I'll try to give it away) <br /> <br /> A film about two surfers (cute boy and his friend) Will go to remote island to portray the documentary. They do not know that they are not lurking around the island, but a big salt water crocodile. Crock shows, turbulent is good, and people eat. <br /> As I said earlier, this film is pretty blows. It started very well, but soon evolved into being silly and stupid. A main character is a meal (rather than a joke), and the rest of our heroes at the expense of the victims becomes a liner. Also, if this crock is at the top of the two food chain of land and water, what are all the sharks around? If this thing is to eat a 40 foot boat, I do not think I can stick around with some skimpy sharks. The FX is some of the worst I have ever had to displeasure to see. CGI is horrific, and they've also managed to screw up animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. Crock Hunter. They look like crocodiles. You can not clearly explain this judgment by the manifesto seen at the end of the film. And what's with the pirate / drug pusher gang? Another reason to rip a woman's top off? <br /> <br /> Cinematography is funny we have low sub-categories. Alligator and it's sequels, Lake Plasid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, which now have "over-sized crocodile / alligator" films to get their own category in the blockbuster. The big crocodile is good. Lake silence is good. I also think Tobey Hooper's crocodile is good. <br /> My grade: D-
