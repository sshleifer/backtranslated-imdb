Well, let me start by telling me how this film is undoubtedly, and I can not stay away from laughing with its perfect stupidity. <br /> <br /> I do not know very well, especially by bassinger, but the script is really, the mind is really boggles. <br /> <br /> When it comes to dll actually proven murder, then it goes downhill. The half way through the movie is that the protagonist pulls out of her toolbar and of course lobbing it at the head of the person, she decides to kill a screwdriver, car jack and eventually kill a victim (in a sinking ship) in a row. If there is a final song that I can guarantee to you, I will eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film for those who want to just make some good old fashioned, scary filmmaking. You want to watch the scrap yard with a person who's planted from a wooden leg, every time I get it.
