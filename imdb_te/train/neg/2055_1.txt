There is no reason to waste your time with this "film". The original said it all and still has it. You can see that this remake is ridiculous to do something about reading the book or doing some research about the story. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister may have done a good job! Holcombab & Edgardon, where the KS story takes place, there are no sets, positions and locations like Kansas. The actual participants are original riveting from shooting filming for the use of weapons and the use of goods. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and Cinematography by Conrad Hall ... is now available on DVD on the original DVD. This turkey is dead death.
