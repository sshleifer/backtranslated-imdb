It's not art, it's the inner city, politically correct campaign! Jindin's political impatience is unforgivable ... people can not be seen as individuals, but as members of the community. <br /> <br /> It's some of the most influential Australian film I ever remember! Each message is a tired theme, loved by a message, sophisticated left: Aborigines victims; White men are violent or alcoholics; <br /> <br /> When a four-man who loses fishing, the woman's body (aboriginal, naturally) and trout catches her in the river for several days. It is a strange decision that men are not nearly as likely to be animals. A man who decently briefs ... he lives with a bisexual woman - because he prefers to catch his child - eventually moves to a more fashionable price point, but the bad rednex that lives in the Australian landscape and inside It is a picture of the sophisticated towns that are scared, as it is the ignorance of the nation as its contempt In the landscape, the life of the country is a little overwhelming in the background of a story, which is apparently exaggerated by Bush's distant views of the mysterious music. Announcing the dominance of the knowledge of left-wing towns <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <These arts Samy ID of the product, beautiful, lovely sunyamainadi popular by people, this is a tremendous defensive projects (separated from real life as much as possible), constantly, people want to see the people. <br /> If this film is a stinker it does not matter, they still pay. <br /> <br /> Avoid spare time and avoid plagiarism. The more socialized commentary than the original entertainment, the pan deserves!
