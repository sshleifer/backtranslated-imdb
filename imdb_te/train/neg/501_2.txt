The suspicious Count Richard Marrakech (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart) was shortlisted in the '1902' in Ireland, which is considered to be the common English title La Candida as La Dangeza or The Bloodstar The Dance Leeds. Three of her actors working in Kora (Christa Nell), Penny (Lydia Oligi) and Rosalind (Martia Damon Catarina Chiani), her castles actress Evelyn (Patricia de Roche as Patricia Woolly), was just a small island on the coast. Evelyn was reluctant at first, but was persuaded when it was accepted by the accepted venue Samuel (Leo Valerio). Once Marnack tells his guests to cut heads off their cheating wives using a festive knife for both his father & grandfather & it is a feeling that Evvine also ran away a lot of the current Count wife looks exactly the same ... long ago weirdo had to worry about the servants It turns out that someone wants to use the knife to chop off some heads ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production is Alfredo Rizzo & Full, Complete & Full Finish from Full. First of all, let's start criticizing the title, Blood Scarf The Dance Leads, because I can not ever see any vampire or any kind of bleeding, no 'Leeds' anytime & absolutely no dance or dancing. It takes less than an hour before anybody is killed and murderous Mystery begins to take shape, La Sunggica Condado La Donja's first hour plot is small, but uninteresting like anything there. The best thing to do is to think about the most boring cartoon romantic movie you've seen and cut a lot of soft-core pornography, bad actors, bad dubbing, bad conversations, and a little bit of soft-main sex & lebble & nothing. Yep, it's really bad. Mystery elements are worse, people do dirty things for unseen reasons & the excessive complicated "twist" is the worst thing remaining, The Sixth Sense (1999) Director Rozzi does a OK job & La Sanguisga Conduce la Danza actually has a nice look & feel, it's a nice look I feel like there are scenes that show a 'storm' rage outside, although I've used the 'Stam footage' despite the obvious low budget! So this image will fly from bright color to black & white. A hug and her friend has a delightful scene that she talks about her breasts, which she thinks has complimented her friend, the scene that it is very fond of, it's uneven & the best moment of the images is easily embarrassed by the 70s romantic dialogue! There is less nudity & sex / lesbian scenes are very tame. <br /> <br /> Remember, however, about blood or gore. The head of the head is not different from the head. <br /> <br /> Technically good movies, the job is efficient enough. The color of the film is good and cinematography is good. The film has been dubbed so it is difficult to give feedback on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible and are much worse than conversations. <br /> <br /> La sangraga la daunza is a horrific film, it is dull and boring with the title of an extremely misleading title & really confusing stupid 'twist' which, in any sense, it is about an hour away. If all of the euro horror fans are better than all of these films, do not waste your time, it's one to prevent anybody. Trivia Note: The horrific experiments of the Nazi robbery / horror movie of SS Last Days (1977) directed by Luigi Batzella and his most significant role was a police detective in La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza.
