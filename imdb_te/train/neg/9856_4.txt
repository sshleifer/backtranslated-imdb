In the "Munich" fame "Romulus, My Father," Eric Bana, in the autobiography of the upcoming Age Age, his son Raymond (Cody Smith-McFay) played a German patient who was struggling to raise in the Australian village in 1960. His wife, Christina (Fran√ßa Potente), is the main obstacle to family stability and happiness, and her marriage violates her wedding vows with an unintentional offense. Despite her exceptional behavior, Romalus refuses to grant her divorce, and the Moscoyist hurts herself with the hopeless expectation that she will return one day. This is, unfortunately, a good and mind-blowing rammond Witness to the wedding crisis - and this is reminiscent of the film (which is developed by the Rhind Geitha later). <br /> <br /> Whenever I congratulate myself on the romulus, my father, I will try and honestly, I can not enjoy it, some good performances for the movie, it is not enough to deal with the passing story and the passionate passing, it's frustrating the audience and the people on the screen Disappointing. A serious slice of life drama is one thing, but addiction, insanity and multiple suicides (when each individual attempts suicide) will recur unforgettable downbeat walls.
