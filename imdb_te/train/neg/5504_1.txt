<br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood once again get rid of a classic update of a classic? <br /> <br /> Mr. Magu, the Avengers - awful!) <br /> <br /> I am generally enjoyed by Christopher Lloyd, the mischievous character of this character. Our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unspeakably so enjoyable that his character in the character is almost criminal. <br /> <br /> The director has the fastest moves, shouting dialogues and the "one-take" slap stick comedy. <br /> <br /> They told everyone to act as if their pants had red ants. <br /> The falt must be in the lipt script that is responsible. I think the author uses "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", an example of a fine comedy script. <br /> <br /> This film is great. Very sad about this movie. Appeal to small children. I'm not sure I've prepared for anyone's children. <br /> If they were to remake "My Favorite Martine", why not add some timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com is not a factor in "zero" to give rating to its readers, it's only a mind to explain this mockery. <br /> The subject comes from this movie, paid by actors and crew - I think.
