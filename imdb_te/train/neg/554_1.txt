This film is awful. The screenplay is great, it's useless for the script, and the sex scenes are also useless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film is totally absurd. The film was filmed in dark, shadow and monochromatic style (one la "War of the Worlds"), the beauty of the original film was very disappointing. The breeding character of Greg Morrisy displays a facial expression throughout the film. The turns and turns of the original plot are not woefully worn here; Only the few surviving antiquities. The unique highlight for Sharon Stone's performance, such as Catherine Traaml, is reliable in this sequel, but it is not enough to correct other errors. The only conditions for "Basic Instinct 3" are to agree to join Michael Douglas's cast.
