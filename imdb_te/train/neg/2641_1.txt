Nearly every storytelling in the film is unrealistic and unsustainable. This is no comparison to the real human story of dead and dull. It is the parody of Hollywood, with a Denzel Washington film, wobbly camera shots and trumpet music bits that remind you of vision, racist stereotypes, gestures of famous people in completely unnecessary and funny shots and clothing catalogs. It is useful for the elements of zombies that can be derived by looking at names of celebrities in the sense of life. The good thing in the film is that it's the ultimate credits and funky song. Feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
