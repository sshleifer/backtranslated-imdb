If you're looking for eye candy, you can enjoy the Sky Captain. Sky Captain is a video game incorporated into live performers. Visuals are nice and interesting to look at the whole picture. Now speaking, visual skies are only good in the Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes later, I see one of the worst films ever. I hoped the film would be better, but no interest was achieved. Thirty minutes later, the desire to go out was growing and growing. Now, I have over 2000 films and that number has seen that number five times. <br /> This is the second film I feel was running throughout my life. <br /> Acting --- No one else. Three major performers are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other image I have walked) is just awful in the title role. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying to make a lot of commits to backfires on his face. The last article I read, was thinking about being a parent at home and acting as a mother. After this show, I applauded that decision. <br /> <br /> The story --- Soap opera is well written. <br /> <br /> The story behind Sky Captain starts bad. Everything is put in Special Effects Story, acting and directing is very painful. <br /> <br /> "Phantom Menace" has a good performance and does not tell it a great deal. <br /> <br /> The movie should be given to "0" from "10". Do not pay the theater prices and wait until the video is released.
