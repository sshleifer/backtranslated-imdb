The most pathetic piece of crap in movie history is not an easy task, the candidates are so plentiful, but Nemesis 2 is my personal favorite ever since. Funny, so again I laughed so hard I was literally rolling on the floor so it got rented the next day again. (It usually happens when I find Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic". <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm totally confused that this stupid home video has always been a productive step. And there is no clear connection with the first picture. <br /> <br /> The hero has the same name, but this time is playing "Alex", The fluency is so slow-paced and sensible that it makes the sound way more interesting than it really is to call a chase scene, which is just the longest chase scene, which is really all the plot that has taken half way to stop guessing all the cinematic muscles and barbarian-nomad dresses. Conversation examines the quality of it <br /> <br /> The horror movies are usually tough, but Nemesis 2 is a really high-intensity perfect mix and a completely mutually exhaustive, which is really fun. Rent this movie or buy it, you will not be disappointed!
