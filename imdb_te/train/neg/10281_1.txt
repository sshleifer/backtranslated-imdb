Carly Pope JJ plays the newly encouraged food critics, whose attractive, frustrating mother moves with her. JJ, the secrets of this order of events, then the owner of the restaurant, Alex Blackmail, instead of reviewing her dying restaurant instead of "probably". Alex unexpectedly falls when the mother warms up for the daughter. There are many problems with this picture, the characters are 2-dimensional around the world. JJ is a self-serving, hateful character, her mother's surface and shallow. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are bitch and opportunistic. The suspicion of a 50-year-old woman who can not be a male without males, bad, bad, bad. Acting is uniformly frustrating, the script is enthusiastic. The arrangement of New York City only saves images. I do not recommend this movie.
