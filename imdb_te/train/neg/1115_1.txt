We looked at the local video store on this shelf, and we are happy to see "Coppola" in Credits. The film has raised interest at any time. I can never work if there is an attempt to make a fierce film that fails, or a serious film that fails to be a serious failure. In general, the whole product is very unsatisfactory. Especially the sound is completely terrible, especially scenes filmed in the small bar; The conversation is far worse. Very frustrating.
