My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever made. Surely I've watched all the way in the top ten of them. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed some of "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other films. I do not care much about "Cujo" (which is very bad in the versions I saw and I can not say what I often said people) or "Pet Semetary". <Br /> <br /> But this mess can not be a total mistake in every way. "The creatures" seemed to be made up to 9 years old. <br /> <br /> "One-Linear" is also gonna be us, not remotely entertaining.
