Please do not watch this movie, even if you have deleted the sentiments. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's right with this movie. I saw it on a friend's recommendation and literally drained my life for 1 hour and 48 minutes in the room. Poor performance, stupid direction, weak storyline and curiosity action sequences - and you get a "double impact" with this combination. At least not achieved expectations. <br /> <br /> I learned a thing - Van Dumme can not see Action Dreams. They are the pure waste of time!
