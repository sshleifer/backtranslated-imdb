I had to say that it is very interesting to watch this movie, and when it was released by the 20th Century Fox in the 1970s it also popped up in the list of many critics of bad movies and it felt like a sensational disaster, and this only interest was greatly strengthened, I saw just so bad.Upon Have to see what the image has done, I think I have my answers. I do not have to say that it makes for interesting viewing, acting, directing, and sarcastic that the script was supposed to be so totally lop so bad. Racquel Welch seems to try to make a film, but after the opening sequence of sex change operation, the film goes so far that she can not handle this task alone. Uncle Buck loner John Houston absolutely no help, as he licks and screen leers, he looks like he sometimes wonders what he does there like wonders. Rex Reid bounced around like Myron, Myra's Alter Ego, and also saw his own celebrated masturbation. Bravo for the first performances! Farrah Fawat is a dumb blonde; She certainly persists in this role. However, undoubtedly the most cruel character goes to the west of May. A 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexy veterans seemed more favorable for the horror film. I can not personally put this cast; But in this film, nobody comes out looking good. Direction seems to be so bad and unmistakable, this film is not just bad, but also boring. Some of the older stars throw in the old movie footage, and the picture becomes more disconnected. Everybody has enjoyed it, and I'm glad I did at least, but the disaster feels that Myra Bricenridge has always been as good as it was at the beginning.
