When I attended the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX I was interested in Big Rig's title and explanation. However, as soon as the big rig ended I left the seats. The Big Rig has many "big rig" drivers, who deliver the goods that are run in the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of the people. Instead, the story guides the story guides like the pictures in the story, but should never be done. For the most part, we get lost. We - the audience - is not going somewhere, and like the direction of storytelling, somewhere ending but without direction, location, or plot. Why are we here? Where are we How did we come here? The intent of the directors who run "manually" a group of people who feel the story is volatile and "unheard" and "invisible" is obscure and embarrassing. The problem here is in the direction of the truck drivers instead of the directors. Directors bring their own linear projections about truckers ahead and then just edit the image to ensure just guesses. Overall, although the film lacks no tension, the film is too long (to be a 15-minute sketch), did not answer the big question of "so what", and the whole movie is more "enlightenment" (as suggested by directors) outside the campaign " Nothing.
