The cast appears to confirm that at least the average film. So I sat for 102 minutes distrust. Apart from Ed Harris, no one has acting skills. Sean Connery, which I usually worship, must have off-Dale during the filming of Just Case. <br /> <br /> The movie will look cheap and unrealistic. It's breathtaking and the plot is unexpected. <br /> If you do not really do anything, the resolution will only watch this movie.
