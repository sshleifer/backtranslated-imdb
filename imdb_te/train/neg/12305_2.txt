I'm looking at this movie right now in WTN because the TV channel I turned on when I turned it on. A young stud / drifter by Corey Sevier (Washboard EB) is not a very reliable and very boring story about wife (Alexandra Paul). There may or may not be a plot. Corey hit his shirt too and blowing Alexandra. I get the feeling that he should be good, so he's with Skinny Alexandra Paul. As I said, he took away his shirt and I just got a glimpse of the butt because it was not so important. The soundtrack has a lot of socks, it's just painful.
