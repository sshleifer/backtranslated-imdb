I bought this DVD without any previous reference, but it's covered by the names of John Huston, Rockwell Welch, Our West and Farah Fawat. I recognize the Brazil title is very strange, but I look forward to seeing a funny comedy like "Switch". Nevertheless, the storyless storyline. Myanmar Brynrichridge (Rex Reed) is dedicated to surgery to change her sex in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood, claiming half the property of Myra Brockridrid (Rockwell Welch) and his uncle Buck Lohner (John Huston). In the days, Myra and her marijuana, Miran kinky sex, she is raising a small couple in her uncle's academy. At a certain moment, the screenplay is very confusing, I believe that the entire story is a mind-blowing journey of Myan, inspired by suspicion. Unfortunately, the bewits of Rockwell Welch and Farah Favette are not enough to act in the film. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher Ate Serto Potto" ("Man and Woman Up to a Point")
