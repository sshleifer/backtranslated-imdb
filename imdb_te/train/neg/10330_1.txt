Wow, here's the end; "Cinema" without action. <br /> <br /> In Seattle's true low-budget setting (do not miss the joyful flying saucers that are sometimes flying) we find a no-brain hardware that seeks to take revenge on her childhood. Plots and actors are also remotely real or interesting, and attempts to steal money to make the "matrix" primarily from other films compete with stupidity alone. Yes, we see some walls and slow motion shoots (around 45 seconds) but these scenes are cool, now and then with the efforts of Stupid Hardy when you are joking about male incompetence. <br /> <br /> If the scenes are thought of by the previously unseen cast at the time of shooting and, yes, we also have a number of leads that are nowhere to lead. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as it can probably get. In fact, it is not necessary to take seriously, but perhaps I can not save some of you and save you money.
