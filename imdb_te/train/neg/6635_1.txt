After four years, "Welcome to L.A." with Art-House Snooper, Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wants from Hollywood. "Roadies" is a frustrating wheelchair and Freet-boy Fragas, who completes barrels barrels, horny harpies, art carnits in a meat loaf at wheat. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W Redfish!) Actually has a rather pleasant presence on the screen and maybe he's really working in a small role (in good movie), but Jalman King's script stereotypical Red Neck is humorous and helpless as Meat Loaf Wide-Eyed and Moronica kept. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie perform all the shows - and see all the trouble. They are definitely, "Roddy" a bad tour. **** from stars
