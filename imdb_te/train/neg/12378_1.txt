Creepy & lascivious wolf. The young "red" full make-up, and wearing a very small shorts & garments. Get about 20 minutes and realize that it could be a pedophiles dream come true. "Beat Up" music sounds a lot like something I want to hear at a strip club. I actually think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Obviously, I'm happy to see this with my daughter, and I do not think it's normal for families to enjoy fun kidding romances together. Very bad, it's very sad to be sold as a family film, Joey Fatone probably will be embarrassing to it. And what is the campaign as a "special effects miracle" ??? See the low budget of the effects, do the terrible gawd.
