As a casual listener of Rolling Stones, I thought it was interesting. No, the film was very young, in 1960. For me (anyone born in 1980) it seems to me the hippy purist campaign is worse, but this film is not for me, but I'm not sure people in the 60's are active. I guess I had plenty of drugs with Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so I felt so much if I worked with them to get to an end of this godly awful movie. I did not see any other films for the directors, but they suspected that they had directed a sort of style, which was a TV show "EuroAirish", which gave a feel like a horror film, badly directed and not realistic. This is my only good impression that I have not wasted on money, it came free with a Sunday paper.
