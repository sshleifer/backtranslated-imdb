<br /> <br /> The initial promise has been made, but soon the thriller (or an imaginative love story) and the only reason they make the story is very clear: 'Undetected, childless bad-boy' to fill in space in their women's watch market Andyei), creating another recurring hash, weird beauty '(Paula). <br /> <br /> Without the need to waste any time building the original story, filmmakers went straight for money-shot. Tassi follows a string of mysterious and heavily moved love scenes, including hypocrisy / poet's tall wheat. A poet called Andre's 'poet', a poet, must have attributed attributes - but when we say heavily, it is harder to believe who he is and what he says - or attention. <br /> <br /> For the story of a bironic hero / antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - these are not entirely here. This is not a modern day phantom of the opera, what happens when a weak and rather crazy woman (with loose filter sage) is a nasty guy, after meeting her, as bunny as sandals? <br /> The presentations may have saved this image, they are no better: the male is faced with looking sexy and 'otherworldly', no matter how forceful or ridiculous; And his part of the poor Dougray Scott appears to be in an ashram as he shambles. It's not his best work. Gyurzen Prochkov 'Wasson', and Andrew Lee Patts brought a young photographer / brother who was interested. A good movie was left by the sister and instead saved the brother.
