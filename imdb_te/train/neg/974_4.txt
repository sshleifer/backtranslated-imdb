This film is fun and can be interesting from its description. But let me do it a bit down. Follow it very slow and hard and see what happens. The filmmaker removed the individual pictures and threw them into the air and they went somewhere (they were not exactly in the order). Also, no consequences have been filmed. I have seen a little different Korean pictures and have seen a good part of it and need some idea of ​​the different viewer in the distinctive Hollywood film. But this one befuddled me to an end. This film is for the second and third time and it has not done anything yet. I do not really understand what the filmmaker is trying to say. To show a simple worldly part of a person's life, I'd succeed. But I'm seeing more. No need to say, I can not recommend this movie to anybody.
