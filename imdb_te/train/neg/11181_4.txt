The film is two stories: a call-girl, political murder of the other elite-class political party. <br /> <br /> If the script is awkward with good dialogues and directional empathy, the role of public relation played by Al Pacino, the concept of play, the performance of AL is memorable: how many members are a powerful and fearless man ("The Godfather" ) As a little servant (see also "Danny Brassco"). /> <br /> Actually, the big young lion has become a tired old. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing to be a very awful movie because it's put a starlight on the skill of al. !
