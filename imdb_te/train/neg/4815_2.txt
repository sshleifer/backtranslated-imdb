Most of the comments I have seen in this movie are the reprinted title titled The Winning. <br /> <br /> Many scenes of the witch still have many witch scenes and these are still bad. I think the witch's added nudity has added at least some fun value in many ways! But not cheated-there are only 3 scenes with nudity and people standing around different types. <br /> <br /> The film is very critical, it is very difficult to criticize the first. The conversation is terrible and simple from the Troma Locker. At least the thromma is the tongue in the cheek. This straight-faced boredom personality. The performance is worse with her superior pitching voice-over voice with Pamela Franklin (who you believe in Innocents, Flora!). Wells is just waiting for his payment check. She did not know why Pamela felt she trusted in her film so the other female lead was a creepy face! The doctor is pretty bad. He suffers as Jean Wilder. <br /> It has not been properly filmed with editing scenarios and editing is unstable. Because witch copy and paste job and it's not a miniature. Only lighting is OK. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear the horror new soundtrack which never stirs. <br /> <br /> The mother of 'ghost' is even worse, but the actress is very happy with her performance. <br /> Really, this film (at least witch) is only airy. It's pretty unwatchable and it's very sane fans and I actually found it mind-numbingly dull! <br /> <br /> The best bit when the credits rolled - just enough good enough for the film like the PLOGUE is not so good!
