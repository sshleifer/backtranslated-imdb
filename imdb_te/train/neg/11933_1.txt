My kid makes videos better than this! I lost $ 4.00 to rent this thing! There is no date in the video case, clearly designed Wellbring; And, even worse, there is no product date to the original image listed anywhere in the picture! <br /> <br /> The film is out of date and is not abusive but it is not exactly when it happened. I'm surprised that someone takes time and money to sell it as video. It caters to students who counter-culture, anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-away and abandon culture in the 1960s; But when you read the back of the video case, it does not indicate that you received. If you make a mistake by making a mistake, it may look good on drugs, so that your mind matches the wavelength of the minds of directors, phosphider and fengler. When you look at the state of your mind, I can tell you what is better after the first scene. So, knowing, I'm sure you'll be asleep for a long time before the end
