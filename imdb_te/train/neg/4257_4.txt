"Dracula II: Ascension" is a story of a group of medical students who came across Dracula's body. A secret stranger appears and offers students to raise $ 30 million in body and steal its blood for auction, rarely refuses. Even students have been disappeared from the Vatican by the vampire killer! "Dracula II: Ascension" The most entertaining horror film has many bugs. Characters are a dimensional and acting are beautiful. There are some good gore effects, such as a really good double deposition scene, but there is not enough violence to my will. This film is quickly boring and memorable and if you feel that you like modern strike images, the weather vampire chili from the 60s and 70s "Lips of Blood" Such as "Bride of Dracula" or "Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural" Some may be just 10 to 10.
