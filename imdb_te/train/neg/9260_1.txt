The film only connects to horror, which is awkwardly ignored. I'll sit it again and separate my finger with rusty nail. It's also flat for a TV movie. The cast is boring. The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand. The two conspirators did not make such a film as one of the great secrets of the 20th century. There is also a scene that is unclear to include in the Omen franchise, which is filmed in slo-mo and is the smallest in the paid payment. If you are tempted to see it, pop it, set your alarm clock 90 minutes and get comfy. With any luck you quickly dodge, and the alarm will wake up after the worst. They are, this film.
