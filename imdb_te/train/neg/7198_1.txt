After Jorg's Disney's witty-live action gorge, I have a lot of hopes for the film. The main disappointment. Thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. The film is slippery liners, idiotic (and meaning) product placement and the gadget rely on the most disruptive sidekick in the car. I've taken two young children to see and get bored from their minds. There is only one bad standby received from this movie.
