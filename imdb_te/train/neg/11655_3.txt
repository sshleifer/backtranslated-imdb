I was very disappointed with this film. I thought "Scary Movie" is a great image and it's not very good and funny. On the other hand "Scary Movie 2" is not boring, it's not funny, and sometimes plain stupid. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / Amitivle Spooff is probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Now that I am not the first time in all of these films, I agree that I am negative because I can not see all the movies that I have seen primarily. But bad humor is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Really good time for this movie is good, it's a good joke. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the same jokes again and again will be repeated again. For example, the spoken bird. Well it's the first and probably the second time is funny. But it has fallen into a state of irritability. <br /> <br /> The opening between Wheelchair Guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was originally fun, but it was repetitive and stupid and crisp. <br /> <br /> Some jokes have also been repeated from the first film. For example, I think Cindy (Anna Faris) can be called "Scary Movie" because Cindy has been dating her boyfriend for a long time, so he's blue balls from Neal and he's 'creamed' it's funny. <br /> <br /> Bathroom and sexual humor during this time are usually the first time more fun. <br /> <br /> In this movie the torment is not annoying, there really is no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm Shorty Weines) is the funniest character in my opinion in the first film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Vince's family and their humor. That's why the film is very disappointing. . . They are far more funny than endless Scott Jokes.
