Otto Primingser directs this light to the eagle. Bohemian Jean Seborg and her equal Bohemian wife father David Neven holiday with Natti Milene Demongoto in southern France. Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a depressed woman, learns Kerr's success is hard to resist. As Nevanne loves her, Seborg is good and leaves her (including all her dengueets with her in the past). Even though she became her second bananas in the life of Neven, Seberg was a precious revenge on Kerr. Preberger tells this story from Seberg's perspective and connects black and white with close color scenes. Cinematography by Georges Perinel is amazing. The film has some heavy hand directions of the primer, although rarely allows any close-ups, making it harder for the actors to really feel. Arthur Lorentz wrote the script and it was filled with acidic dialogue and funny scenes (mostly bird-brained Demongeot). SÃ©bourg deals well with him, but Nivin is appealing to him ... and he did not perform any chemistry with Serveg or Care. Prestitution really steps out with those casting. It's a character made for a nearby person to Charles Boyer. Jeffrey is similar to Horne Seberg and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliet Greco sang the title song in Paris Nightclub, playing her. The great titles include the Primerman Regulous Sal Bass.
