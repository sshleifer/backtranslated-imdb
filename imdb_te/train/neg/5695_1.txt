This film is described as action / joke. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the introduction of the funniest female leadership begins with the simplest storytelling, which is very small to hide the compounded end. Moves between comedy (specially used description) and surreal play with contextual adult scenes thrown in the film. The main woman (the title of the angel) was less and the script was not reliable enough to be an actress, playing the role of the character's character. James Ballusi is the only one who can lead his character well, but leaves the poor script too. One to avoid.
