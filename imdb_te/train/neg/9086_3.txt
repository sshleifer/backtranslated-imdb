I have learned about Romer's appreciation for the last works I consider as great filmmakers, and the general audience is usually artistic failure (like the latter of Renoir or Chaplin's movies; yes, "Politic des Autowers" is also on its dark side). But "Last Moors d'Asti and de Sedidown", Roger's wish he could have been his last film, was the last aging film to make this tradition permanent for great directors, with Ruffell's "El'Arsty", with ridiculous aesthetic signals, witch just Rossellini The parody of the last films (made for TV from the lives of Descartes or Marks) As it looks. <br /> <br /> In his version of "Persewal", the film is the real scene to give a re-evaluation of what may be the classical representation of the middle class of things that Roemer refused. The director apparently changed his mind when XVII century was involved, and the film actors like 1600 farmers were telling the text around the contemporary trees and landscapes. But all the more lunatic than Lushini and its fake trees. This is not the story stupid, but the way that combines naturalness with the Ruhmer artistry is that it becomes involuntarily funny with most childish and enthusiastic (and I do not speak about the frustration of the actors, the annoying and sad comedian attempts <br /> <br /> The Radical Beauty of the film Finally it looks like joke, for the TV with the Theological Scholastic Discussions (sic!) At the beginning of the film, the original French area of ​​Roger's story now teaches us with modernity, so he was forced to make the film "El Asteri" in other parts of the country. "Still, I'm sure the film is more modern and interesting, Roger still has the same storytelling signals and artwork A modern area with nayalu citrikarincinatlayite the same story. This film, like some historians, but to a lot of this last and sad rohmer sinimaphils navvutuntayi picture.
