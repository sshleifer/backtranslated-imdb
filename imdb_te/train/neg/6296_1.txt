The film was interesting; <br /> <br /> I have read this book many years ago. I've informed you that the featured plot outline has been very strong. <br /> It began to look at it. In fact, I did not bother looking at the whole thing ... totally bad - bad performances, bad acting and characters that can not be seen instantly - it's the location of the film, I guess. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this feature.
