Joe Dawn's early line says everything about this film. It takes place on Malta Island (a curious island) and Joe Don Baker can be found as an Italian thug. Joe Dron's character is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and he will shoot, arrest, and arrest people acting in the film. Everyone in the film hates him, and everyone likes Greedan Clark as everyone else. I'd like the film Greedan previously, "Angels Revenge" because it is a Shirne for The Year boys of the year. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
