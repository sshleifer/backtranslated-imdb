I heard Duges of Hazzard reboot with current actors and a great script, "I'm fine, it's not better than the first, but we see what's going on." Well, I saw what happened. I saw a classic, ultimately 70s / 80s show that was insulted by Hollywood. It is very sad to see that the Hollywood script writers could not come up with the original. They would like to see a great show featuring a great target audience, and try to make the classic show "Remake". Hollywood Heads ... It's not awesome !!!! However, more about the show. I think I can act as a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stifler from American Pea) than playing Bo. I'm confident of John Shinidar, I'm sure how to portray his role and how to do it. Also, get it for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How far can you go? Love Luke is a garbage jacuzzo actor to play. This made me sick. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, smart, sexy, strik, opinion and a good IL 'southern girl who played the original Daisy character. She is increasing the roll model of every little girls! Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart donkey, a 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke - (thanks to the toy and jeep!). Daisy is never blonde. Why was she lifted? Jessica Alba has played the role of a great daisy duke. She can speak to a great South Indian accent, and she was superb, and had a wonderful job. However, I said the film was badly bad. I do not think it's ripped off by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they have to pay my money back. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (original series) you will not see this movie. You'll be disappointed. CMT (Country Music Television) plays remakes of the Dukes after the night. So go with your TIVO's set and the real thing, Hollywood is not a simulator on the big screen.
