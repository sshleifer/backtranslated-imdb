The film actually works from the very original idea - I did not see Nimps thrown out of heaven in the horror film anyway. However, this idea is not the way to implement; We decided to go for a trip to the forest area for some reason. The fact that the forest lived by these nimps is more interesting than another forest filled with rednecks / actors / teams. But really, the monsters are just a variation of the usual horrors in Woods theme. Many of the images associated with the film do not have the same good idea - and it feels that one of its brains wears in just one. The only real property that can bring the monsters to the table is that they are beautiful women who are more difficult than hardy grasscross that they want to flee. It's fine for a point; But soon boring, and the complete absence of any narrative around the central monsters ensures that the film does not come out of the 'horror trash' category. Though The Evil Dead Forests are in the mainstream horror location and in the films such as The Blair Witch Project; It still makes for a fantastic horror arrangement. This is one of the biggest assets of the film, because the Forest is a well-known expression - the only problem is that Dammade's forest does not have much of its sleeve. Death scenes have shown an imaginative lack of speculation, and it is not true that all the characters are clutterly clipped because they expect to kill them rather than expecting them to be out. The cast is primarily made by children, but Tom has a role for Savin; Who unfortunately does not enjoy the Special Effects Department. Only real highlight is related to staff from nimps. Naked ladies appear great, and if it is not for them, this film will get very boring very quickly. There really is no recommendation for this film; But if you want to be a hark's daft horror film back in the eighties forests, you'll get some fun here.
