I sit glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, and still keeping a diligent eye. <br /> I'm waiting for the next awful special effect or the next amusing clutch plot factor to find out how to make this film. Image, staff vs each other action / science fiction / shoot-em-up / good vs. Never watched the bad image ever made, and seeing cool things and said: "Hey, we can do that." For example, a car in a mile that looks like a road with a shoulder meant for parking is a car protagonist, a glamorous black guy who is born in the gallbladder. The car will also break the pieces of land before it. My big beef is very clear with these images. But in my bad books it really is the difference, and the lack of reason for many things! For example, a flying troll, capable of harming the opponent, in extreme ways, takes place on a lone military truck that carries an important VIP. Unnamed security guys with guns get out of the truck, they are already dead. Then he saved the VIP "You can not leave this truck under any circumstances, do you understand me?" He found the beast that killed his 3 friends and was beaten in almost the funniest clich√© fashion. Then, without any obvious reason, logic, meeting, and common sense, dumb assassin gets throwing freight! It does not matter what happened in this movie. The transparent acting distance from the movie, as well as the bad camera work, and the things that you go: "Wow, it's very cheesy." Shirry Appleby saved 1 from this film because she gave her an idea, because the audience enjoyed the experience, sex appeal.
