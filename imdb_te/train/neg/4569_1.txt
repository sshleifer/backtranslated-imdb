I can not believe that I'm worried by allowing the Munich City to take care of it and take part in this program. This program is like a slap in the face of real-hard work law-enforcing bosses. I have never seen anything stupid in my life ever before in my life. If they were a comedy, it would be a matter, but the reality is not the smallest of the lie. I saw only one thing and I was scared of what I saw. I'm going to get into the chase of the feet with the little guy a bad guy. There was no joke. Nothing in the program is close to the real world. Muncie City, Police Chief, and all officers should never be humiliated by their heads and they should never admit that come from that city. It's no wonder to stay around on TV
