I saw this film at a local show a year ago. First, I'm going to say that I am very good. Casella is a very talented and amazing cinematographer. I think this film is good as I have seen. I can not call this horror movie. It's not a horror film, putting in a shattered ghost some shots. There is no secret, no suspense, you know you've done it all the time. <br /> It's a play. You know what the two sides are full picture. <br /> And tagline, "Revenge can be worse" .... really? ... they are many hundreds of horror / thrillers <br /> <br /> Many of the people in the film know that I do not know people who smoke. Their donkey, I give my honest opinion.
