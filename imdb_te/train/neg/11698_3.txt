This move reminds Tales from Crypt Keeper. This is similar to people's thinking. I always think of them in a cryptic story. The same goes for bad acting. Very bad acting. Many people do not like it and I do not expect much. I'll see a Stephen King movie anytime, because all his films are horrific compared to the novel of his novels. I have read Shining and Carrie and they are great books. This is how Carrie has played as a true story and the entire book is a group of reports and theories. It's very good. But I realized that the novels are nothing like two films. Closures then the image versions are very different. I've changed many novels from his two novels and the conclusions are always cheesy. The worst thing I was doing was the worst. So cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the truth. I suggest to everyone who wants to read Stephen King novels to watch his movies before hand. That way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I want to do it with all the novels I have taken into movies. I'm sure if they make movies that are real good books ... and the screenplay went horribly wrong.
