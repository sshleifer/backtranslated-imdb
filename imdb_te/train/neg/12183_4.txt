Christ. Continuity to one of the most chaotic films of all time, it is exempt to at least exclude songs (to remove the vengeance of the unsustainable "tomorrow") but the boredom and unreliable tradition continues. This time, Annie and her friends went to London and were caught in the Buckingham Palace or some of the similar shuttle blasts in the Zone Collins plot. The oddity of the film is that there is a weird anti-discrimination attitude in the name of the film: every time a little bastard "leapin 'lizards!" I think my teeth will be crushed dry. The picture is only a memorable line ("Unhand me, you're stupid intellectual!") And the fact that it is not recommended to be the original, slash and plodding.
