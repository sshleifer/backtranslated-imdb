<br /> <br /> In the 7 terrorists (including former marines) using a pistol. Then, she will get the whole earth. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; We're talking about a simple, scared, and very well-composed flight attendant. : D How about sleeping / gassing everyone's full proof (according to the script's logic) and someone from his team have the plane fly, the attack / rescue team is the leader of the responsibilities. Only he wipes out the plans and decides at the SPUR the moment when terrorists, or terrorists, guns will lead to the fiery attack, not knowing how to change the plans and instead of terrorists, or how many, and his whole team is not easily secure. Yes, it uses old nogging. Then decide to use the sleeping gas. It becomes useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> The film would be nice, however, I could not stop myself from seeing and getting surprised, what's next? : D I think but imagine all the wonderful, unemployed script writers themselves thinking, it's not fair. LOL! : D
