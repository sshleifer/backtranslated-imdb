Oh, what can I say other than that, ugh. I rented this movie because the original Vampires were named Sequel. This movie may not be any lemur. Apart from the plot, acting is bad.

He was sitting somewhere between 3 feet in the middle and woke up the woman crying. He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. <br /> <br /> One of her lead roles, Joe, was bitten by a Vampire, but she had these "experimental tablets" in her city of Mexico, she was good but her body temperature was lower than room temperature ... <br / > <br /> Hero outside the monastery is killing vampires outside the night. <br /> <br /> When he returned, he was surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery that night.
