Chok begins as a rock band called The Chok for a club, which runs under the Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker) at Nightclub, called the club 905 '. League singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & Guitar Player Mike (Jason McKee) is planning to tell other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), no longer needed. Once in the club Dylan is made but the mic does not appear & converts the show into a disaster. <br /> <br /> Juan A. Moss is producer and director of the band that they can not get any worse when they find a dead body in the cellar, all the doors they can not get out & they can not believe anyone like a mysterious killer. Chok is an authentic number of teen slashers not really authentic. The script has some surprisingly good character by Jessica Dolan & Susanna Lober (the most horror films written by Linus ...) Some camphor genre is much better than a modern shot in horror that is very slow in that and boring also has some interesting role It's not anywhere near it. All the usual teen slasher clichés seem to be a really poor twist that looks like a good looking young people who can keep separation, split off from the victims, get some murders & something jealous as hoped, but you do not have a lot of feelings when you think logically (they can not do ) And things to do worse Killer hours you do not want to boast, even though it was too early and I was on the spot. Then there is the fact that Chok thinks that the manufacturers are entertained by the endless view of the audience (well feels endless looking at it) The scenes of young people walking around the dark corridors are nothing but the scenes that I take before it starts to become tedious, The calculation of killing is low, but first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but they all decide to just go in randomly divide & go on their special ways (a bad idea when a killer on the loose), the pace is dehydrated <br /> Mass Allowout, this film is not exactly right, but he is a basic occasion using some unpleasant posts Production editing techniques such as slow motion or frame skipping alu. Gore levels are really up, some blood splatter, someone with a hole in his chest, some bodies & someone impaled on some metal pillars. At the end of the dead, the ax was killed, and ultimately the good example of the film does not actually show anything. The film has a very rocky soundtrack about rock rock band, some really terrible and terrific rock songs used. Sorry for the rock fans but my ears are just the worst of noise pollution. It's not scary, the actual atmosphere and the lack of blood & gore is the perfect film when the rest is bad. <br /> <br /> With the budget of approximately $ 1,000,000, Chock's good product values ​​are not cheap for low budget horror movies but it looks cheap. Was filmed in Washington, where Spokane is called. This is one of the most well-known films in acting, no one wants to win an Oscar but it's not half bad. <br /> <br /> Chock is one of the weakest twist endings ever and the Smith Teen Slaser, which includes crimes against blood, gore, violence, nudity & corpses. What's the point when a slasher is not any sex or gore? That's the only things worth looking for for the average slasher, right?
