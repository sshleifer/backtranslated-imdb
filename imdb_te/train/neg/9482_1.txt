Do not even waste your time, let's just pay rent for this piece that gets caught! It's beyond me how it happened. (I do not know why there are at least 10 lines ... I have already captured this worst movie, but, oh well ...) They are awful, acting like all the necessary lessons. The plot is weak, the end ... feh! I think cinematography is not entirely sucked ... well, maybe the sound is a little bit okay. One good thing is that if they could make this film, it could make some money, and the screenwriter could have an idea with the original idea. So, you take all-heart! I guess I have the same actors true ... If these people actually paid, then you too!
