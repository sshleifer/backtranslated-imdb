Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story", Jean Shepard-her alter-ago, Ralphi's commentary, has become a true classic. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story", however, is a Sheppard story writer, but it is not entirely attractive, and the characters are no longer with the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> "My summer story" is basically a mishmash of mediocre and interesting stories that are not just plain, it's the hillbilly neighbors and tops fight. Charles Grudin, who I usually like, is not very clear in the role of his father (originally maintained by Darren McGavin), and his role may never be forced. Kieran Kulkin is a poor substitute for Ralphi, and the little brother is all but forgotten here. <br /> <br /> When she loses her luck with epic housing in these stories, she is just as unpredictable as she is a film manager with a gravy boat, and paper-narrower length. Not too undemanding but "a Christmas story" can appeal as a sequel, it is very poor one and is not worth many people's time. 10 to 2.
