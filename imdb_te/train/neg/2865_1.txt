Normally I'm not minus and this site means if I give this picture -3 out of 10 I really mean this hated the movie. I'm alone in the darkness of Uwe Boll and I'm still worse but at least my opinion (at least Stephen Dorf shooting made me laugh so I made a bit of ratings) has given me a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Now the heroes of the movie are good about the BTK killer, but they have done a good job. I looked forward to the start but I was very much forward because it was boring to death. I love killer movies and they can still get some cool deaths if they kill me. I'm not a fancy film expert, but if he sees this, he'll shoot me and kill me. Sorry for rambling but nothing good to say about it, if someone has taken a camcorder and a movie .. This is a disaster. <br /> <br /> If I do not care now, I will crawl into a corner and go back and fear that the life of this movie is scary to me It reminds me that ... it's not for life
