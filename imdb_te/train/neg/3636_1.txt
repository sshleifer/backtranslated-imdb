I realized that I was very open to foreign films and I was trying to do what they did, even when some things were lost in translation. But simplicity and "intelligence" of this film are boring. I've really felt no matter how interesting to make a picture that shows a normal day or time to have any point. Earlier I saw the movie. There are tones about society, racism and some wishes ... but it has South Park. And while watching South Park it really moves me to feel a sense of emotion. The youngest I have ever experienced after the first five minutes is the closest thing to do with the emotion of the film. I like each picture because I rate seven or more distinct images. I gave one to this film.
