Not a good sequel, but the original punch is not packed. A murderous screenwriter (Jud Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his own novel CABIN through the lake. Still killing the brutal, but the film is very cheek in the tongue. Any kind of humor is not kind of funny. The whole project holds the quality of a haste and is on the Nelson Top of the times. The script was about to rewrite the script before going to the screen ... it happened to this script.
