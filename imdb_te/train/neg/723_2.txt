I can not get this movie ... is it a musical? <br /> This is not a serious play ... it's not good enough for that performance. <br /> <br /> Hey Golberg is a quality serious actor .. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to be awake through this tumultuous movie. Speech on discrimination and the term "tribute" to the students died during the momentum of students. But it's fun to be fun and it's even worse as a documentary style film. <br /> You look for yourself, but I hate it
