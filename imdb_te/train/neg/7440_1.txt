I'm going to go back to record for the second figure, after years using the IMDb to see movies, the Nacho's image, an account created and a comment posted by Abandoned by Abandoned. This is the hands down the worst picture I've ever seen in my entire life. This place was on the verge of existence, and nothing included when there was no "puzzle-pieces". Acting is ridiculous and the writing is embarrassing. How did this picture come back and got it completely beyond me. The only saving grace I can find is the fraudulent and repetitive use of the word funning of Anastasia Hille. (And clever sound design) I would be against a difficult decision I was facing with the option of seeing this movie again or mauled through forest bores. I'm disappointed that I can not give 0 stars.
