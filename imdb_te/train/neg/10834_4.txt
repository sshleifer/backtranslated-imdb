Sorry i missed something? Did I go out early? I think the first ten minutes of exceptional (and dubious!) Stories are "this is classic" but there are all the hills! Acting William H McCay is amazing and I have never seen it seem to be bright, for every movie to look good and good value is worth. All the stories interconnected, and suddenly I look forward to a big moment here. The author said, "How can I remove these stories beautifully? I'm alone, it's raining frogs". I like movies, I like strange pictures but it's just odd and boring. 4/10
