Working at a video store I see very few movies and in case I try to see some of the big movies. One of them was disappointed. The initial idea to tell the story of a black-paced vessel mainly during WWII is some merit. However, the film's primary location in less than 10 minutes than watching a movie is to tell about racial tensions in the Second World War. An underlying story about the ship, crew and their exploits in the war. This is the primary thing you like over the film over the subject. The men who work in the US Mason face the difficulties facing difficulties facing difficulties. These films should not focus on the achievements of their country, the Navy and their country, and make a film that is racistly filmed during World War II.
