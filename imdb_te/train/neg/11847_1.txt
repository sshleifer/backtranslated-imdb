I was scared of how bad the movie was. It's a low level for Hollywood artists at the beginning of the 20th century - a modern or (gap) cradle that sets rock to rock. I thought I would look worse than that film. Period. <br /> <br /> The first is a terrible cast: Epiay ezard chaplain? Sorry? Peter, do you pay something to this person? Jennifer Tilly as Lola Parsons ?? Kirsten Dante as the Marian Davis is a sacred smoke, these people can not even begin to capture the look or sound of the time they say. <br /> <br /> Last film performance is a good film, but the disaster & the rest of Bogdanovich's pics are no better. Welles & Hitch & Ford wore a long time ago. Still good for TCM hosting.
