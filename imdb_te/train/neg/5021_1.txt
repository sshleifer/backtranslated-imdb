This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. This story is boring, dialogue is worse and acting is acting. I'm not sure if this movie was a result of a school school home project, but it definitely played like one. This is not the most successful in the main attraction that the single is trying to take continuously. Horizontal horizontal camera pans are a cheap and uneven way to hide the cuts.
