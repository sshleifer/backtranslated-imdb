Yes AWA Wrestling can forget about this real show. For the first time they had a short interview with Marty O'Neill, who appeared as a nose-ridden "Rock N Roll" buck Zumfee. He then sounds silent when he says "back in good times" or "madman" when he's mad when he is "madman as madman". Although Ken Ren√©nek watched his wrist after going to the WWF, "Jyotishus" Jimmy Garvin called the mouse chair, though it was caught in his youthful soup, which was a verbal face laughing my chair. Larry Nelson came on board after he climbed the ship, which led to the improvement of Phillis George. Then Dow McCoy was the best wrestling announcer who made each match exciting with his narrative of blows! He then paid a higher payment through the Minnesota North Stars hockey team. Razor Kent who can not forget Kent Kant, who misunderstood words and phrases, historically, when a wrestler is big "Hayes is big!" After Nick Bokquinkle used the helpless opponent "he dismissed him" or "he" hit him or "jumped up". (WWF) they have Rod Tornard, the style they announce is great but different.When a wrestler removes his boot on his forehead, he is "wretched across the front-e-lob" or a wrestler AWA unfortunate, complex, meaningful, highly scientific wrestlers AWA (WWF) after Larry Wells Phillis?) Nelson Sway And I'll talk to someone else or completely ignore him. (WWE did not take him intelligently!) Greg Gagne had a good cookie wrestling boots when he was looking for a tag as he wanted to get it to the nearest restaurant. im Brunzell is a great dropkick artist you wonder why Greg is always his partner. Jerry Blackwell (RIP) is also a superstar wrestler, but you wonder if Werne wins against him. (Puhleeeeze!) Then Vince McMahon appoints the Gagnes employees, who has won squash matches for most. I'm Gagne's family now Wrestling Real!
