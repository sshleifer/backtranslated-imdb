The Hall Roach Comedy Short, a tough winter, the eleventh-ninth and eleventh talkie in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals". Here's a demonstration for the blacksmith for the Black Comic Step Street Festival, going to his shackling gang. Fareena returned to her love letter from Mail and Stepan told him to read it after reading when he was going to school at night. This is due to his girlfriend in Penns, so now he has to fill his ears with cotton because he is too hot to hear! In another chamber, Weisser gives instructions for Mary Ann, who makes Taipi out of the radio, but he goes back to the kitchen, confusing Marie On with Lice Anneser's Seagull Rice Pudding and Spanish Tomale Tabasco and Lux ​​Attachments! After the concussion, the jockey and the rest of the gang help themselves with the terrible taste but the most beautiful ingredient, as a result everyone is stuck on the walls. When they try to clean up all the mess, sterin will work in different tubes and electric outlets, such as telephones that combine variable tools' functions, vacuums, vacuum, rings and music-playing refrigerator! End. The mendering nature of this "our gang" I've just described is a powerful Steppton Fachit film short series pilot that has been short. The description of the loser Negro's narrative is just fun in small doses, and this is not the case and is considered to be the most dangerous today. Even though the final scene was very confusing, the results were very blocked, and I laughed a bit. So the essence is a curio that is worth at least once in a tough winter. By the way, the real name of Step is Lincoln Theodore Perry.
