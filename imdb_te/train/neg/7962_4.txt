Sequels have a nasty habit of disappointing, and the best credit I give is that it maintains an old tradition. <br /> <br /> These three stories are not good from the original Krepsho. <br /> <br /> The three are the best of all, a wooden statue that comes to life in revenge for the murderers who murdered its masters. The second story is about a lake monster which feels more than a floating slap, which makes you wonder how anyone was scared of it. The third story has a guest role from Stephen King as a truck driver, but an undisclosed story of a victim in a road accident from a deceased person for a broken man. <br /> <Refer instead of the original Creepshow, or if you've already made that happy.
