I expect to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop, but disappointing many levels. First of all, the story is recycled almost inexpensive. Secondly, setting, acting and story are not very authentic or reliable. Third, there are very good black actors to choose from than these standard picks. How about some realism? Third, there are very few hip hop songs entering - if any. Nothing really looked like the center. Overall, the film was a great disappointment, but the editing style made a very interesting and nearly worthwhile film.
