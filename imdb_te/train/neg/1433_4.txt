The pictures are great and reflect the landscapes of Canada. The story, on the other hand, is very boring; Like a love story in a boat on the Titanic, my eyes have a love story in the woods. I did not think that Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough but it's a bad thing.
