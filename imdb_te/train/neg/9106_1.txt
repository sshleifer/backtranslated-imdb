From a very early sequence they can hardly notice how smart and powerful 'cruel intentions' were imitating and how flat it was. You can also notice the terrible option they have done by Robin Dunn as Valtomant ... In the second scene, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers Katrine and her mother in this movie will see you two best. Catherine's first film is not a blonde and you can actually spend a little romantic story from the movie Miles, and you're already in a formerly called Daniel and Cecile, where it is called Cherie ... how much is the prequel. Then it turns out to be like a low budget 'wild things' and our O-my "turns" picture. As I said, Robin Dunne is a very bad choice. He is not a bad actor, he's good .. he did Charisma Ryan. Amy Adams is one of the most talented young actresses in our opinion. But with all the talents in the world, there is no way to save this trash. Overall, the "motion picture" Beverly Hills, like the 90210 episode. 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jabracker' were stolen. Yes, they used the score from JAW BREAKER ... did they leave at least one thing? You want to pass this. If you want more ruthless intentions, see Stephen Freers Dangerous Liaisons.
