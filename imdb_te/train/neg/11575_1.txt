I'm familiar with the wonderful book of 'Goodnight Mr. Tom', and it's only recently when I get the chance to see this habit. I have made positive comments about this, so I have so many hopes. <br /> <br /> When this film is finished, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> This film is not a good movie. 'Goodnight Mr. Tom' is a very poor adaptation and lost a book of 4.5 / 10 book. Specifically, I found that there are not a lot of some great scenes in the characters and book. There were not so many conversations, it was very fast moving and moving very fast, but I was always worried about the fact that you could not see the bond and love between William Beach and Tom in this film. Casting is not as good. I thought it was really good, but it was so different! Worse less saving, one of the worst I've ever seen. It is a good remake that is 1000 times better than this rubbish pile.
