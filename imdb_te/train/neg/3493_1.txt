I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I'm compelled to warn the potential audience that this film is awful. Just terrible. I like Shah Bross movies (I'm not an enemy), and I have high expectations in this regard because I'm on the list of many "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I'm now convinced that all 10 best listings are cut and paste jobs.) First of all, there's just no action in the film. Most of the talking about the movie is a wonderful feat, because it's fine thinner. And the action may also have an impressive return in 1978, but it's normal by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: they ship the DVD is terrible; The movie is horrific and it's not even 16: 9 better.
