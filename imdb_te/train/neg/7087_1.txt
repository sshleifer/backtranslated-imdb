I'm not usually writing a comment on the line, but it's the worst picture I've ever seen. It's not only just shot as a soap series ("young and restless" really filmed by experts), but it's awful cuts. There is no action for this. <br /> Here's an example: A man wants to kill his main character, because he shot him and killed him. So (after loads of garbage) Here they are: The guy puts a knife at the throat and says something like "You're dead now". The main character then said: "If you kill me you told police that you are threatening me as you died". So (killer) goes like a person: "Oh no ... cops are following me! Oh ... my god". <br /> <br /> Remember: just one example. I can not believe that this film really exists. So: If you ever want to see the WORST picture ... go ahead and I recommend it :)
