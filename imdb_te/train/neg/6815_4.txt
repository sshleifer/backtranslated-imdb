The eight-jean rolling film I've seen is also exceptional; The secret treadle (like this) is beginning to be too weak to continue its trim 84 minutes, but it goes somewhere, which gradually leads. If a female bloodthirsty (as a child, as promised) captivity within a remote pedestal (and obviously a member of a suicide club) is exposed only to the 'dinner' in the blood, if the author does not think all this leads to him, is the author-director finally the human villain? Kinky's father of empty face hero actually ?? From a ridiculous future revealed as a mutant (?!)! Although the film-maker (ditto the seashore in the climax of the clock) and two separate, the unfortunate pace and dreel atmosphere (cultured hoods and animal masks), "euro-cult" style, bevy of beauties engaged in the show. Personally, the most fascinating thing about the whole glamorous but intellectual interpersonal affair is that it's bemusedly watching up the character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in Louis Bunuel films for six days the second time)!
