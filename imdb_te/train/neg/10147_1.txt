I usually commented (I read the opinions of others) ... but this is the comment I have mentioned ... I saw this film by the worlds like Action, F-117 and other high technology, but some first minutes and I changed my mind. Lousse acting, louis vuitton outlet and a big science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just do not worry ... <br /> <br /> Any comments from users on this site and I usually check the ratings ... 3.7 points and I try this film, now I'm wondering the WHO rate of this film by giving more than 2 points ???????
