As a girl, Henoco left her small village to Tokyo and left behind two of her friends, Faaia and Zoire. Suri was surprised to find that she was dead when she was young. She was afraid to learn that Zeori was secretly resurrected by the island of Sho'o, along with Fumia. Boy oh. I love Asian horror and I feel like a nifty actress in a hurry, because I've rented it. Unfortunately, if I have to explain Shikoku in a word, it is "fruity." The film is silly, boring, poorly portrayed, unexpected, and more, incomprehensible. Kuriyama has a minimum screen time of resurrection Sayori, and her character is given less to work.
