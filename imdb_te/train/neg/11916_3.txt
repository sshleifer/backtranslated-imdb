Sam. I thought I was using a simple script font instead of writing their ancient book curves. Acting is most apathetic at times and is more dramatic at other times. Why would "supposedly" kill two suspicious silent doctors who helped him immortal? Is it for the heck? And really need to show Lilith's motorcycle when she's somewhere. We get it! You spend some money on some third-rate punch rocket rentals. It's not that you have to show all the time! The "Faith's" cave looks like old-school Battlestar Galactica with some old minute changes. For some 30 seconds, we do not know publicly for 30 seconds in the show we are talking about, with some scenes. Everyone is a throwaway character. Puzzling characters and a little more memorable storyline is one of the very bad ideas that I will be exposed to with this tragic event. Avoid if you do not go to bad movies.
