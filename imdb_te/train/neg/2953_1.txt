These reviews of this movie are not so bad. The film does not have Leonard Part 6, the Battlefield Earth and Giggle's guilty pleasure. Those films are entertaining in their awful situations, but this pile of dinosaur manure is very painful. I'm not in this too much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex refused to get into a $ 35 million dollar film The New Line Movie Theater. They cut the risk of sending the most expensive straight-video-video film directly to the video in decades. <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> "A woman named Katie Coltranne A Idiot Dinosaur named Cap and Theodore Rex is reluctant to stop him after a group dinosaur's death to stop him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the plot you have a picture of its mystery. And with her performance Theodore Rex is annoying, and his male behavior is thin after five minutes on the screen.A lot of jokes are around him, biting people and biting with his tail (with danger and intent.) I thought the thief was bad but took Theodore Rex back : Vopis's career is the worst <br /> <br /> I do not see anyone to be happy with this monster, but I do not see it when I saw the film. I watched a movie wreck written by people who had some affectionate praise for Howard the Duck. Humor is at that level and the theodore Rex looks like Barney's tremendous cousin. Completely painful from start to finish.
