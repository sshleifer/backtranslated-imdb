I'm a filmmaker and a bit of a dark and fierce feeling of humor when I take home "My Ranks ..." (I did not give any DVD cover, instead a dubious controversial director, Chris Morris, a "short film featuring scenes") . <br /> <br /> The church is repulsed to see the scene in the church (especially his famous TV series, Brass Eye pedophilia) and there is no benefit to Shack because we are well aware of Moriss's contradictory attitude. <br /> <br /> The runner's commentary is the norm in a novel idea (as it is a runner, which is often an interesting and bold angle in the filmmaking process), but this tragic thing is not here. Instead, some people are hesitant about the actors to heal, as the dogs do not have really big movies pretending to play. It is very interesting, but the same frame celluloid is not valuable. <br /> <br /> There is a simple description to say that the movie is going nowhere. It relies heavily on its superior style with the cost of strategic, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely, leaving it unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> There are movements of fake-Caffcasque surrealism in the film, but ultimately it fails to persuade. , Fun, enlightenment and just irritating up the irritability. If you want to see a great deal of small film, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's Its a Wonderful Life" by Peter Kapall.
