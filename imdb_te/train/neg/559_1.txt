I saw this film at the London premiere, and I say - I can not expect much, but I hoped at least something entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" is a great movie and is still something of an "smut classic" but entertaining. <br /> <br /> This late Friday or Saturday night has disappeared in the movie, there is no delayed sequel. Sharon Stone is still brilliant? Well, let's put it this way - for a 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. Is she beautiful as she is the real one? Her face is clearly plastic surgery, and in this film her haircut is somewhat unappealing. <br /> <br /> She does not appear soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original way - this is a vicious mischievous person and the whole point of Evett. Terribly bad - and Michael Cotton-Jones (usually a safe director - who did not do great work but did not make the best movies) officially delivered his first true turkey; <br /> <br /> I heard this movie went through multiple editing sessions, and in the beginning it was very clear. Nothing makes sense. The whole plot is a cosmic chaos and end - oh! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (I'm still imaginative, though.) I've seen "Gigli", "I've seen the son of Mask" - and with my own power, although I do not see this movie "smear" <br /> <br /> Five minutes before the film starts The rest of the people in the theater, <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically, it is very difficult.
