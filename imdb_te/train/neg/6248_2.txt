<br /> <br /> When talking about global warming, something quite strange happens: the science window and "belief" and "consensus" are the subject of discussion. <br /> <br. <br /> <br /> Instead of encouraging intelligent discussion, he continued to debate on "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> If you are trying to sell the world to sell the world of trillion dollars to stop global warming when you're trying to say, there is a problem with telling the scientific fact. <br /> <br /> It's nothing but it's probably some people, or it's the next ice age that has more revenue and we're really lucky that the planet is not boiling. <br /> <br /> We are asking "belief" in "consensus". Keep in mind that any scientists will be banned from "consensus". The scientific inquiry is misleading from consensus. <br /> <br /> Einstein does not "believe" in consensus, not Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> Why are many researchers coming to the ground by asking tough questions so frustrated? <br /> If global warming is not very objectionable, some of the theories are not intimidated. <br /> What's going on here? This was the film I had hoped for al Gore. <br /> He chose to increase his support with the true "believer" of "consensus".
