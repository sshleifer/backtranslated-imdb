I think this film is of relevance because today Sophia Loren's film started. <br /> <br /> When she created the film in 1953, she was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> I would like to see Sophia Loren's opening work because I have seen this movie. I was shocked when she came to the camera that her skin was bronzed in brown decoration to reflect an Ethiopian princess. Certainly, today, it is considered a cartilage and must be made in film production. <br /> <br /> In fact, Mrs. Loren was very annoyed at the painting of the skin in the film. <br /> If yes, the real opera singers make this film Yes, this movie is good. Then, the singing and true facial expressions of real artists are clearly visible. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Loren was good at the age of 19 and still has this picture. It is also performed on stage. After all, we do not see the beautiful young people with the "old opera singers" singing stage stage from the back of the screen! Do not succeed in using heavy-weight opera singers. The J. G. Wentworth Company is only one of the most artistically produced television commercials, given the professional singing of the stage singers. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is also producing quality of quality. <br /> <br /> The production company must add English language subtitles to improve the film on DVD, so that we can not speak Italian. It helps the story and teaches more than 30 seconds to introduce scenes more than a storyteller. <br /> <br /> This film is not a heroine of Idea, nor is it an opera. None of her co-stars along with Ms. Sophia Loren was not recognized or remembered by the author. Instead, if you're a fan of Ms. Lorraine and watch this film and want to see her at the age of 19 - whatever the product is. <br /> <br /> Lorry from Illinois
