Another failed attempt by the funniest science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script, and described the poem, but I am sure it is by some 17-year-old teen who felt it was awesome to have a scene crossbows in an image. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that piece, I lost all hope. Then ... they set off for a heorot that feels the ship the Christopher Columbus traveled! When they reached Hiroot (which is considered Narss Made Hall) the Idiots' s science fiction group decided to make a hiroot look like a big rocky castle. When I saw that part .. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this film to be good, but science fiction still has a good movie, so I do not know why my hopes come. Oh .. Grendel and his mother are also stupid. (This commentary is about "Grendel") If anyone from science fiction channel has a good advice here. Not every film you say about a big monster Half people can hurt, no science is about fiction! And yet, cut out the less-radial actors who like Steffen Baldwin to stay in your films! It does not choose the movie, but it's doing amazing !!!
