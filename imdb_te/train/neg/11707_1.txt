This TV movie was originally featured in the 2003 Women's Channel. As a person, why am I trying to see it? I do not know, but I checked my head. The director and writer Simon Gornic should be shy to give him the injustice. He will take away any strength and confidence that many boring women may keep on doing him. There is no Joyce hijer as a bore wife. I can not wait to leave him. Her vengeance is closed and stupid and motion in the film is very confusing. Other Femme Fatale is Nicole Hilltz, about the cold guy you'll ever want to meet. She does not promise our prominent guy to go to that monkey over her looks and her acting is very clear, only one could not miss a fool. Definitely a loser. Tempo Lock is very beautiful, but slowly slows down the yellow band left by his own husband, acting as a loser by David Delaise. Anthony Denison is a slightly smaller owner than our hero with our losing cast. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or I should say the victim, it's not good. At first I thought he was a bad actor, but then I believed. He did not leave the ground and was repeated throughout. When a woman and two women were away with it, I became angry. Beware of this men to keep men down, men and get away with murder. LMN Channel. Beware. Note: After seeing a second time in error, I am convinced of my early ideas. Especially on the author / director Simon Gornic. I still believe that he should be humiliated by the male species and knock the horse. Grims only saves Timbi Locke, who is unable to show his talent with the awful act of Jenkins, Heser, Hilts and Duloise. Plus the stupid plot only makes it worse. Gornic's film and his vacant stars. Please note that LMN does not show this mediator again.
