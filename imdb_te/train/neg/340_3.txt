I played the role of Eddie Murphy because this movie was well done at box office. I thought he was his first film from "Beverly Hills Cop" when he was hot. Pg has said that it has earned more than two hundred millions and it is R and it made about 80 million and it is not all prominent. I never saw a big Eddie Murphy fan, so I did not work for another reason. This is Eddie as a sort of lost child finder. He should look at the golden child or the world is in a terrible danger. This plot is very bad, but bad does not match the unique effects. I have seen good things in the 70s than some of these offers, Ray Harihausen made good things. However, due to Eddie's main reason for watching this movie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this and stupid to keep him in the "Lost Ark Riders" sequences. I hoped for a fish out of the water impact, but it did not work for me.
