Anyone who watched comedy central for the past few years can see ads for this movie. For the first time in 2001, I saw ads for the film. It may be funny, but I did not order the number of calls on the television screen and see the first picture. A year later, I was at Tower Records, and "DVDs with less than $ 20" collapsed, a copy of the film. I decided to buy the DVD as $ 6.99 only. I came home, put the disc in the DVD player, waiting to start laughing ... I was waiting a bit more. <br /> When I say this movie is terrible, I agree with almost every other comment on this page. Sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, UnderrGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is the worst piece of muck and my opinion is the worst image of all time. No stars.
