The storyline of the film is pat and quaint. Two women travel in the Middle East and find themselves. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a movie about Middle East and Central Asia, this is terrible. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers did not research or unbelievably lazy when filming. From the beginning, and much better wrong, as they are known in thirties, and since the conversion of the 1890s and the conversion of Afghanistan to Abdul Rehman Shaw, <br /> <br /> The second is Tehran, not as Tehran, although it is understandable, the geography of the region is relatively different around the city than the large city of Tehran, which is surrounded by cities around towns. <br /> <br /> Third, Persian, which is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan, never heard in the film. Local speakers who speak non-German speak in Arabic. The 'Persian' guards on the border are, in fact, 'our haha ​​rajal' (not a man) and 'paper' as in Persian. Moreover, the love song between the Indian princess and the main characters is clearly in Spanish. When speaking in the garden, one of the main characters uses the term 'ferdos' and 'jeyhan' and then makes some instructions for drugs. In the Qur'an, the Qur'an, the Qur'an and the Qur'an and Qur'anic verses in the Qur'an speak in Arabic, Iran and Afghanistan when they meet in the desert. Its use is primarily religious, with some use in education at the time. <br /> When they stop in Iran before they reach the border with Afghanistan, they are totally different in the Iran group. Their tents are usually bedouin with carpets and high profile decorating the walls. If they are not a cleric in Iran, people wear turbans is very unusual. Arabic is clearly spoken from early greetings of 'Ahlan wa Sahlan'. Unlike rock dirt found in the arid regions of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges, they find the cable in the desert, they are sand. In the summer and spring there is no light green scrub that covers the ground. <br /> <br /> "There is no water in this film and it is still a weak and simple place. It is not as real as they are trying to learn when they come to Nirkistan, but it is still born and does not have any real progress, as nothing but the initial and World War Two were broken apart. Ksiptanga, beduauyin of it except in the deserts of the best footage and the Levant, they mistakenly considered, I am a star, not a bad movie.
