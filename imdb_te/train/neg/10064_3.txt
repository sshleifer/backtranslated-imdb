Pokemon movie is a horrible movie. Unlike the first, this is not a good movie. Graphics are polite but the story is flat and a real drama is not built. The first one is mutually decent between characters. Tracy's broke and subtraction is bad. Tracey does not really have much to say or do, and does not give comedy relief, rather than a brisk. Only the good points you get jelly on the gray, and it's fun at her early shirt when she's called her sweetheart. Overall, this film is not for rent and a little picture before my wife did nothing. And we will take into account the Pokemon fans. Well, maybe next is good
