William Duffo, and Robert Rodriguez's promises because I rented this movie. I guess after seeing the film's name on the cover (as an actor), the film is good. If Rodr√≠guez claims to give his name to his film, it would be like a movie to be a good one. Wrong mistake is wrong. Worst editing from "Man's hands of duty" so far. This is no way to modify it and it is impossible to follow it after the first 30 minutes. I do not know how Duffy and Rodriguez participated in this film, perhaps they would have to pay someone else, but they were a good way to do this. Apart from this, the film has only two minutes and Rodriguez did not even speak. If you do not want to see an image with poor editing, poor acting and confusing stories than my guest, do not say you did not warn.
