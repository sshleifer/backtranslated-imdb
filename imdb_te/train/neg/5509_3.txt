I was greatly defined as any kid in the 50s and 60s connected with Disney. What happened? They can get whatever actors and actresses they want, their best time. <br /> Disney desires the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they screw things up! The film is the worst. <br /> <br /> Disney does not even know when it's good or bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> I am the only reason for the talents of actors, 10.
