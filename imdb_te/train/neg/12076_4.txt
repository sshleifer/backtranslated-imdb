You know all the "hamlet" story. I will do it. <br /> <br /> It's not quite simplistic (actually, it's not great). In truth, I find a good but overloaded play of "Hamlet". It's also not the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" are ten times better, not far behind. "Macbeth (knock off your tops, from his drawer, puck, over!)," It's not bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <Br /> Okay. . . Choose a movie and win the Mike and Bates card game. . . They ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, Daddy yadda yadda. . . And prepared for MST3K's most boring size-up episode (as approved, I did not see CC Ones). <br /> "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" It reminds me of a line of Mike from "Future War": "This is probably the album of small, disappointing films"), SOL Crew had many good fractures. <br /> <br /> Here, the reflections are flat, the host slots are good (and mutually), and the movie (not that bad) is actually BETTER (ie, not a camp like "Prince of Space", as a quality film, than its MST3K version ), I know that the display is bad. I laughed (last time I saw many months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times throughout. I tried and tried to make it fun and fun - but I was not. Occasionally the only line, "Hail the Boss of Queen Dilbert!" (And the humorous line of that episode, well, when he's been) - occasionally, every 10 minutes or more - maybe I'm moving a lot. The second time I tried to see, I did not laugh at some jokes and gave up before forty minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is not terrible; It is German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and the dubbing is not great, but it also does not cause the movie to hate. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; Yes, three for the MST3K version. <br /> PS: Why MST3K!
