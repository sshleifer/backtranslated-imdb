The 11-year-old Catholic school as a "lapsed Catholic", but not until the 35 years of Mass, except weddings and funerals, I thought I'd get a kick from this. And I did. . . For the first two-thirds of the film. Strict church school teaching, sexual harassment, etc. - It's authentic. But suddenly, this film has become meaningful. Really understand. Now you look and see before I hit pedophilia scandals. . . <br /> If I know about those abominations (such as the Catholic term!) and coverups, perhaps I will not be offended at such evil and hateful doves at the Catholic Church. A few years after I rented the video, I will not rent it again with a new perspective. It just left such a dirty, nasty, ugly flavor in my mouth. . . What have I experienced with all the actors church, they really do not hate * or they are separated for a cash check. It is a very anti-Catholic film that is offensive to those with respect to the honorable glamor of Catholic education. '50s are not great teachers because I still do what. Whichever of the nuns, I learned how to read and write the English language. They remembered us. (How many children can today do simple arithmetic in their heads?) Truth, there is nothing more need for America's success. Caduvukovacca? Can YA Add / Subtract / Multiply / Divide? Great. You can get the degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic Education As you know about your lifelong and Catholic "mythology", you stand in good stead, as you continue your studies. <br /> <br /> Such a great cast, such lousy, rotten script. <br /> I thought I had mixed emotions about the Catholic school (and not, it was not "bad" - believe me, the nuns taught me well). But if participants in this project are willing to participate in the film, they must have the bad (ie, stupid) children sitting in the back of the room.
