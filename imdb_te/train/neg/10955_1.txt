This is the story of two people who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey'. At the local Cineplex Odeon the posters for the film still seem to be odd looking at the same time. <br /> <br /> These two songs feature films with monkeys. <br /> <br /> When they see this film they have been for a long ride. When action scenes are needed, some monkey has been replaced by a stunt MAN. It is clear that this monkey was not trained in Shakespeare's performance. <br /> Maybe Buff can use Monkey with Affleck, perhaps to help guys like Jack Chan or Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, the film is a magnificent martial artist and jet luke moth like Madin Madin. Matthew Modine argues that some of the jet lee does not come close, the camera tricks prove that he is every bit better. If the film is not clear that the film can not handle the film, the film will be a real star in Matthew Modine. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is some dorky kid who developed a bond with Modine and a monkey? Kid finds confidence and is it possible to meet a girl in the film? <br /> <br /> Mathie Modine also gets jealous with this one ('I'm a monkey second sonata' using the pick-up line does not seem to work with the ladies) <br /> <br /> Two guys a phone from Matthew Modine Call came 'seven days.
