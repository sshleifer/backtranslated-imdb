I was really looking forward to this film based on the previews and the press received, but after seeing it I was terribly disappointed. Slumstones Todd Solandz is a full-fledged film with a burst of family reality sands toad's branded comedy. As the story progresses, each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I miss the point, but I am happy as a person if this movie is an example of every girl's growing experience.
