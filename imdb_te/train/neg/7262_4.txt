This violent film has some really wonderful ideas, which, if apparently been executed, grew out of spaghetti-western folly. Unfortunately, hell is the worst edited films imaginable when calling a town! The characters are stretched long, the characters are long, the performances of the cast (and the notes) are pretty different. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) revolutionary, wiped out a village, a priest (!) ... Ten years later the village "Mayor" is run by Telly Salawas. Stella Stevens revenge for the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin is looking for Landa Shaw. They all yell at each other very much and they all shoot a lot. Fernando Ray is also in it (the blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are strongly uneven. Landau (which really hates here) also has a slang for challenges. Shaw and Ray prove that they are not really hated and Stevens looks pretty foxy (if not a bit between sweaty illness).
