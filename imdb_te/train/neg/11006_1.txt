The film is not well-known as "Slapcop" Wins Offer (who has also written, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafucoco - "quality". And a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), a rotten corpse, necrophilia with black market embryos (which has a person taking a scrap, has to go out of a jar), lots of homosexual jokes, superhero and forced abortions mastery. Skits are not considered to be unhealthy, and the film is crisp and hard to be stupid (like "Batman and Rymer"). <br /> <br /> I am really convinced that a group of 8 years old can make a lightweight movie with a similar budget. <br /> Clearly, the film comes through the "Slap Shot" Vince case against Scientologists. Frankly, I do not know who to root for this case !!! Apparently, he alleged that some Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sunk this film. The thing that is repulsive waste from the beginning of the movie and the 99% unfunny (by comparison, Ebola is ridiculous) ... and this is the nicest things I can say about the movie. <br /> On the way, it is wearing a diaper with Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") and participating in a dumb fake porno movie. It is amazing that his career could overcome this.
