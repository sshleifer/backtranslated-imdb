<br /> If you want to make a bad horror film at least some blood, gore nudity. There is a blood donated by a bloodstroke in a Halloween shop. Lesbians and hookers are neither nudity nor sex. <br /> <br /> There are no editing effects - fades, gloves and so forth. Slightly shorter sequences appear for a while. <Br /> <br /> Terrible music by bad metal bands. Its websites take the ultimate credits. Rubber masks are only referenced by rubber masks connected to the "actors" face. They do not even bother to apply their neck, hands or wrist wheat decoration. <br /> <br /> I would like to give you a good 10 years with video camera. Rent or see this movie, except how to make a low-budget video.
