I'm a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors ever, but what he's thinking when he makes this film. Usually I could not blame on screenwriter or director if he made a bad movie, but in this case it's all for him. The perfectness of the film is his fault. This proves that Heston also did not make Shakespeare's story interesting. I wasted two and a half hours in my life this evening, and I can not get that time back. It's the worst Heston film ever seen. If you're a Shakespeare fan, this movie can be entertaining, but if you do not waste your time, it will worry in the long run.
