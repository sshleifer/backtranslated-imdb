I'll buy or watch every seagull image. He fell into poor stories, bad camera work and walk-through personality, he almost lost me, came up with some good pictures. Some films ago he remembered how to do a good movie. Now he forgot. The film is radically dark (at any level you name it). It is slash & gas here without the obvious noticeable benefit unless it is understood as a warning against the military. <br /> <br /> Seagal has used too dark and others voice most of the time too often to have a stand-in in his sights. Sadly the only character of the character is a bad guy who killed his guard to escape from captivity, and then ruined all over the place. Where to place an armed guard in a holding room with a prisoner? Anyway this bad guy is at least colorful, and very focused. If you like the king of that thing is too much gor. The evil people looked at me every time like the same gash. I'm happy they do not suck blood from their hapless victims. I am going back to my summary. It's basically a horror film that turns into action movie. Daddy 6,2006
