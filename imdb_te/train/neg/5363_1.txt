I'm not worth the bad script of this film, except Janine Turner, bad fantasy, stupid plot, mute-husband husband and immoral divorce settings other than bad acting. If you have not seen this film before, it's not worth it. It's good about that Janine Turner has done a good job. Terry's husband won a lot of cases and became a smart-ass defense attorney who also earned murderers. He feels he's too smart but he's just a nut. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and cheating on her. Nice girl huh. Yes she is a real peach, not. Any day at her beach
