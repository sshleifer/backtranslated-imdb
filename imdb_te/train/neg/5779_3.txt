<br /> <br /> I love movies with Bryan O'Hallaron, they are funny and enjoyable. I think it's great when I see the name of this title and genre, it's really nice ... slashers or some other gore movies ... but I've read a preview and it's good anyway ... but it's not ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion: the movies they try a little more comedy movies or overseas autopsy, they are something. This is empty. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
