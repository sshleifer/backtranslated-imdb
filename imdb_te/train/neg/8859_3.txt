The ugly shot to Joe Dante's 1981 classic, the poor script and the enthusiastic sequel. "Howling" was one of only two or three good wolf-films and so far it had 'rewarded' through a series of harmful and undeurable sequels like one. If there is consolation, "Stirba" is only a continuation of the name and does not necessarily relate to the letters or events introduced in the Dante film. Where is the theme revolving around the bloodthirsty worship of Transselvanian Werewolves? Mainly female ones? Under Stibba. An eye-blink in the blink of a feminine old woman from an impressive super-pass (appealing beloved) and changes all the hair when sexually provoked. Christopher Lee is tired of her arch-foe actively. His role ?? Stefan Crossco ?? A occult researcher traveling to Stirba's kingdom lost her friend to Toodelf Cult, the American couple. If you're looking for a specially slum gore and an inappropriate nudity ... this is your picture. Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we are also being treated to exploding a dwarf eyeballs and vile image who pierced on a patent fence. However, if you want a little material or depth, you'll be very disappointed. Conversations are embarrassing and there is no tension to figure anywhere. The script writers are constantly confused with vampires (transesilovian settings, garlic, wooden bet ...) and Dancing's beautiful balcony is unfairly exploited as the only gimmick in the film. At the end credits, it is very curious and meaningless (less than seventeen times, according to my fellow reviewer Dr Gore!), Repeating a repeat of a shot, which rips her top off. Music is okay and some scenery is beautiful. I was talking about the early credits and the strongest statues in the dark dungeons of Stibba's castle. Which is a huge mess directed by Philip Mora ?? To me related? His single most valuable film, "The Beast Vitin", was released three years earlier.
