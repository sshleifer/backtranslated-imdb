I was the first Superman film to appreciate a film executed by Richard Donner as a master. I'm also alone in Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... It brings Richard Donner to the cut of the same film, even if it is still sinful. <br /> <br /> Superman's world, infidelity requires strong doses, but Superman 2 expands far too much things. This is not the subject of Superman 2, because the script is insulting the intelligence of a first grader. Unlike the real Superman, the characters do not have plots in a sense, as they have zero inspiration to work as they do. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or absence) is performed at least incredibly. There is so much to criticize, so I do not bother. I condemned this film ... perhaps in Slater Sticks in Lester's Version is suitable for the Morani script based on this film. Super Duper is bad.
