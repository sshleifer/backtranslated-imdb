Time corridors. The picture you can see is that you are looking for a sophisticated way to commit suicide. Some use guns, ropes, or gas, but do you want to destroy your brains? No longer wait! Time corridors are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: The idea is to work with Christian Clavier and bring you a lot of fun. This poor thing is that I do not miss 45 francs. Sometimes, its evaluation system is to look at absolute zero. This film deserves a 2/10, but only because I like Jean Reno. He was very bad, he also starred in Ronin. I think he will not like him ...
