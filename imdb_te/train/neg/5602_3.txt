"Stir" comes from Stupid than a spooky movie spoof funny. Believe me when I say, I love comedy. Especially comedy spooks. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" Trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Agility" and "Spaceballs" are my favorite comedies. "Pandonium" is not there with those pictures. Many of the scenes in this film cause me to be surprised by silence. There are a few laughs in this movie, but when you see comedy, expecting a lot more laughter than a few times, this film is going to do everything. Geez, "Scream" was more laughing than this film and it's more of a horror movie. <br /> * 1/2 (from four)
