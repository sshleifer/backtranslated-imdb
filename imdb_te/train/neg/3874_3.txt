This film is very predictable, in the whole time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent, and some other big twist is still coming. But ... it's not. He keeps working with creepy, and she keeps on ignoring it. In her place, Mary found the most important evidence, and she still trusts him? And that "hanging bait"? There is no trap. She was faced with him, he said, "Forgive me, someone should go to kill" he left, and it's the end. They try to use other suspects, (like that old carnival girl), but they are fully developed. Actually, all the characters grew. They have no depth, and the setting is just plain strange ... who will hang a recycling factory ?? Its choppy and nothing improved well. For example: when she occupies her position after beer, and he finds jags and runs her and he catches her and sexually engaged in the car ... what's that? Her responses were not filmed. She was scared to be practically raped in the car - but what we see is her bathing the next morning. booooooooo It may be very well .. sooo very good.
