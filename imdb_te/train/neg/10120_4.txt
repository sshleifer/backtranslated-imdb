This Hitchcock film is very similar to his next suspense films and it looks like a very old fashion morality story. They believe that a young couple will gain their heritage. They spend money on traveling around the world and live in a very pleasant presence. However, after some time the excitement deteriorates and the couple are sprayed and understood in their existence. However, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they will lose everything - because they appreciate life now and end up very happy! What an odd, crazy and preachy movie! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively low compared to productions afterwards - hard film acting rather than poor sound quality.
