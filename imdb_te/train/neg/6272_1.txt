Snippet of a conversation that offers a nasty, bambling lady assistant of a prominent scientist to his beloved maid, before attracting three unbelievable mute college girls in a building for behavioral editing experiments. Meanwhile, in the local bar, people sing and dance for 80s rock rock songs. A biker punk is a sexual relationship with a pinball table in front of a group of people, and then attempts to rape the virgin Jessica (Debra Hunter) from another biker in love with a biker (from Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in banner with the assistant ! Back home, Sorority Bebos have sex with men from swimming, shower, change clothes and bar. <br /> If you're not enough to entertain, a hilarious theme song ("Nightmare fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) warns that "warning!" Just like in the SPACE robot and recommend hitchhiking in the best ways to get men! <br /> <br /> This painted Florida mess is all in multiple perspectives. And, could not the NYPD Blue Detective Jill Kirkendall turned one of the naked bimbos off CNN Newsstand Andrea Thompson? That's perfect! It began in 1982 and added new footage after the video release in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
