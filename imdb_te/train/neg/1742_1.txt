Well, recently I have bad runs with Hindi movies. I asked the video story guy for Afran (Prakash Jha), but the new release is not yet available. So I got to fix for this. It turned out to be the blunt Hindi movie I have ever seen (and I've seen quite a few). Bollewood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb has negative ratings, I will give Garam Masala a -10. <br /> <br /> I have seen TV show about the funniest premiere in Mumbai. All the usual celebrities and their sides appeared. For some strange reasons, people would seek good things from Piadaranan. I do not like hulchul, hangman or his other pictures. Hulchul, probably from Tamil or Telugu, came to your face fare, with other feelings except in Bollywood. This latest episode of CXXP has proven this guy no brains. Who is the director of Bollywood who is a director ??? <br /> <br /> Now the movie. A romantic consciousness turns into a unanimous woman-hunting. Two fashion photographer (not a note entry, where 2 ministers work for a gossip magazine and share the office? Now they are copying their own stories!) Some cook or chef for multi-lateral love for a magazine share Dodos seeks to help in search (or multi-tasking + Multi-timing). Eventually what happened, I do not know. I switched off in the middle. No ridiculous waste. I can not even believe they are released. And how painful it is in their own slums! What motivates the audience - NRIs who are poorly illiterate Indians (last millions of 700 millions) or in the forens? It does not matter in any ways. <br /> <br /> You can not write about anything, but the usual bag of f-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is better than image.
