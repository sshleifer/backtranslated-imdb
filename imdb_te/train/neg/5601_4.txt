For Luisio Fulzi, I've had a star Claudio Casilli because I only saw it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​prisoners condemned is the rollbell, Logans Run, Blade Runner, and new movie Death Race for TV ratings. The "Kill Bike" action is funnier. "Training" is a snooze festival. It just never caught me and made me care about someone like "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Select one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off.
