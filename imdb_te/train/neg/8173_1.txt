One of the most boring slashers .. If you can also call. Although it's kind of a completely opposite portrait, I can not see it. The fact that you are looking for a small group of middle aged in the woods can not afford. They made these films for teens, so who were they targeting when they actually did this sleep-fest? My favorite piece of the film is the cover art and it is the only reason I want this movie to be part of the Suspense Classics 50 movie pack. And after seeing other movies in this 50 pack it finds it somewhere else. If you're in the mood for a good slasher in the woods, I recommend Just before Dan and Final Terror.
