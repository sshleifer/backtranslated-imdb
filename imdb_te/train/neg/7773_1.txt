The film is a good mantle: 9 people are facing their fears of earning one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not become a good film. The way the dance scene is too long and there are many scenes that are not really understandable. Some of the scenes are not just an indication of the camera in women's body parts. Acting is very bad, but some lines are majestic. Strangely, it turns out that at the end of the movie it turns out to be a 5 minute Western, and finally, many of them turn out to make sense of the rest of the movie. The director seemed to have previously added things because he thought it would look good while ignoring the plot of the movie. It's not just a lot of feeling. Dancing down the hall is the only creepy thing for older people, but it also does not come close to make up for the rest of this mess.
