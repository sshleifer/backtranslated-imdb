I rated this movie 1 because the plot is so unbelievably reliable. Judge for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> A boring, computer-generating computer virus sends a code via television screens and computer monitors. Code - In the form of light - Your body's 'electrical system' can access the eye. It forces the cells to exclude calcium from the cells. In a few seconds after the infection the patient reaches his neck, the tunnel develops attention, his skin becomes the whites of calcium, then he falls, and his hand and throat break in the cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When a braille computer expert learns that the Braille output device is trying to break the code - hands are handled - the device is set in a very high voltage, which can cause serious injury to the skin of the expert head. The virus also realizes the invasions against the remote controls and the keyboard of the ATM. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was stopped by throwing old desktop PCs on a rock and some people were able to electrocute it to his broken computer and his feet in spilled water. <br /> Oh dear ...
