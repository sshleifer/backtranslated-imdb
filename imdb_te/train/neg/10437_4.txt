A fantastic odd but exciting comedy-drama about a strange young man who wants to be a bird by Houston Astrodome. Quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman with extraordinary letters begins with weight loss. Cinematography is some prevalent, Shelley Duvall sees a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman sees every inch as the sight of Bud Court of a "mother bird" (Allman and producer Lou Adler describes her character!). Staple, Bud Court - once again, after "Herald & Mad" - the real original; Michael J. Pollard, the Court is not at all intended, unusual, dealing with absurd and alert, and a tough act to remove. Unfortunately, this is one of Altmann's misfire. He can not play like a cast and a performance, but he allows some false inspirations and he allows the dirt down. ** from **
