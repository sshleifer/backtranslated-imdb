Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you leave this far better. I saw this on television and that's why I do not need to drive cash. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly and slowly. Although it is the first 30 minutes or so reliable, it is ultimately more reliable. This is very questionable if a senior soldier like Lieutenant Waters does not follow direct orders. Yet, if his parasite is left, he will. They know that he is putting them in direct danger, and if they follow him they will die absolutely, but the heck is our left. Remember what he says (remember, despite direct orders). <br /> Still, there are some good scenes in this movie. They reserve some villages where the entire population is killed by rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or the others have already been killed. They took the trucks left by the rebels, its strange part. They go on foot rather than walking. Since the roads are not dangerous, there is no explanation for this. Anyway. <br /> <br /> The film became insult to the brain, and so totally unbelievable that a team of 7 soldiers could destroy many insurgents, hart or killing themselves. Eventually they lose some comrades. They have to fight with an army of 500 or more. <br /> <br /> They fight against a very large army, killing hundreds, some of them are loose. And they have rounds and ammo round. Never run out of it. Grenades and Claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and an RPG. Where will they get this stuff? What is it around or what to bring? They also came with a laptop that showed off the operations of the enemy rebels. And this laptop will have a battery going on for days. Really? <br /> <br /> I think you have closed your brain completely and the rebels are a little bit of idiots. Otherwise, skip this. It will save you time.
