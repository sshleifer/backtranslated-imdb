I need to say that Priyadarshan (which was released as a very good Kyonky directing venture) is a worst movie, it does not have a certain storyline and focuses on the body scene by launching actresses and some silly comedy scenes. I believe that Priyadarshan is very repetitive in the comedy films like Govinda and David Tavwan, and even after giving some good entertainers, they have lost their audience. Try some variations in his direction. Give us more of Heperi and Magamal weekly than giving scars like garam masala!
