When I saw Monstervision in Joe Bob Briggs TNT I watched this movie. Even this film was not enjoyable. I taught video production and I thought my students never made this bad thing because I saw it until the end. But it puts all my intestines on it. <br /> If you get the original image, it's painted thin, it looks and is more fun. <br /> If you see this movie in the baggy bin in S-mart, it's a Wrightless if you get it back.
