This film is great, you mind - but it tells a bad story. Stella is very worried, and does not learn the best. Her husband is a wonderful snobby and short-minded. I did not learn it anymore. Is this true? Somehow, Stella realizes that her daughter is shy about her gentle courtesy and dress, and does not mean that it does not fully understand the downline? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman, and a very good mother. Giving herself, so her daughter is largely associated with a group of snacks, which is frustrating. <br /> We may be common at most of the time we see people - people are beer or two people, a player enjoying the piano, dance - but this is a kind of morality. "I can not live with our baby!" Leave me alone. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: the unwitted working class can not expect to climb to the height of the upper class. And it's just a load of hogwash.
