Can you ever say that there are some movies with no recombination features? Answer: Yes, and it's one of them. The horror movie 'The House of the Dead' director Wave Boll has now cast less talented eye than another video game adaptation. Did not these guys get it? For anyone who does not understand, here is the black capital for you: video games do not make good movies! Acting here is the best, standard. Set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which has its horror movements) the film does not have the atmosphere of the upcoming Doom, no danger or fear. The pacing and plot is confusing, and the script printed paper is well used as a toilet paper. The main criminal is director. Usu Boll uses a paint and brilliant camera of a monkey using a paint brush. Honeymoon zooms, accents and pans are divergent into the overall daunting affair at unpredictable moments that viewers are disorientated and frustrated. The film which was set for the first time in the film was to be a great secrets in modern films. Avoid all costs.
