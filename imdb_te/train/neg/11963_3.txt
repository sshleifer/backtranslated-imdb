I was like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie because he praised Allen King and they were funny. I thought I had seen Billy's pictures but I could not remember this, and now I know why. It's full of cliches and deceptive emotions. You can smell every upcoming scene (and go!). Billy is also very often funny. He is too busy to talk with duplicate tears or show his fury when he is so fast with his father. Alan King is very fond of him and subplot about playing extra role in movies. But it's a coincidence that Billy was just visiting her father to see a big health crisis. Or two busy doctors close their customs to the moon in LA. And when the end comes, the boy, it will come soon! Although the authors have found themselves to be shot in one corner, there is almost a death scene. Very humorous disappointment with some glimmers.
