I saw "ShakeDown" because it is called Erica Elenak. She is as sexy as ever, but she plays a second sonata for Wolf Larson. She has more functional capabilities than she has allowed to show up here because it's pity. When you see weapons that are mostly armed with Larson missing machine guns and seeing him only weapons all with a revolver (that never runs out of those bullets) it's rather easy to have endless shootouts that become especially monotonous in the movie. Earthquake effects are good, but there are also very vague motion and poor CGI explosions. Ron Perlman tries to become a mental "spiritual leader", but he is just as boring as pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo, Ellyaic, Perlman or Larson (assuming any of his own) to make this appearance want to give it to others, which is only worth the rent.
