Firstly, though the movie is moving quickly, they're only $ 60,000 budget, but it's nice to see if your sister is dead in a lake, pulling a gun around him, wasting a bullet, wasting it and killing him slowly, killing yourself, killing yourself? Plus you discovered after your sister was dead in the lake and found a clue and found that the killer was not the hand that clue why do you kill her with the police? When she was acting as her sister, the waitress at the end of the film, she told him badly at the end of the film that she would meet him somewhere and tell her what she had been dead and what she had done for "proof". I do not know that I'm not happy with the end. The film lasted for a long time and the performance was good and the end was bad! Do not waste your money in this movie because you will not be happy to write a review here too.
