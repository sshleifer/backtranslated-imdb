If there is a hell, it will have a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing again and again for a permanent loop. Many marvelous actors - a hopeful one will help Danny Glover, Alfred Wudder, Kevin Klein, Mary Lewis Parker - Mary McDonnell's presents (which remembers his remorse for all eternity). . But not. Apparently they were incorporated with other serials made from Macdonell. The whole affair, majestic, extreme, and insulting (if you are deaf or who knows, you should be ready to take a look at the funniest TDD scenes for your blood). GRAND CANYON is filled with wicked, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to understand / understand / sympathize or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are better than gene pool and are undesirable. There is no plot to talk, no character development (no one can develop these people), no break-out performance, and the most curious writing you'll ever encounter in a movie. Great thing about GRAND CANYON Its title. It's a big hole of an image.
