Historically inaccurate because it's too bad west. It looks like Jack Slade lived and died in Idaho, Colorado Territories, and Montana in the back of California. It provides everything you know about this mysterious "bad man" and "good man". The script is terrible; There is very little direction, and lousy acting. Dorothy Malone was completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven does not know how to paint this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade is a very good platform line superintendent. He feared his hard to drink by his local towns. He struggles when he is drunk and faces other problems in Virginia City, Montana. In order to insure that he will scare them again, Jack Slade will leave the vigilantes immediately after he ignores their warning to leave the city. It's a terrible picture. I can not recommend anyone to see Hollywood Butchs History, but to this day no one has ever seen this movie.
