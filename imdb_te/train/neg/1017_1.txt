Oh dear god. It's terrible. If it is bad, then this is there. This film does not mean anything. It runs across the map and is not clear what it says. It seemed like trying to be like Batman. It actually takes away that 'Edison' is not a real city. Since I live in Vancouver, I can not afford watching this movie and finding these places. Why did not they make a real city? The only thing that is good is the writing 'Tilman' in which John Hardy did a fantastic job. He is the only actor in the cast and the role of his role in the campus. It's unpleasant to see a great bad guy with John Hardy's on screen, and the film is a wash out. Very bad. Hopefully anyone will see something important, and at least John credit to credit the credit, and appoint him again as the main bad guy to turn around. List.
