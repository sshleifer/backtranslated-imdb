As long as Spaghetti Westerns go, I die if I'm not discouraged by this man artist. This is not a bad thing in the movie, but I have some brightness and no flash in other SWs I have seen. Guy Madison plays his best role in the lead role, but does not have the attraction on the screen that it needs to take on the screen. With a significant exception, the remaining cast is not particularly good. The direction is enthusiastic and offers a few moments I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> The exception of the cast I mentioned is Rosalba. She is a bright spot in this simple picture. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb page for this man is not wrong Rosalba Neri Jennie Benson does not play, instead of her role, Melin is a list of IMDb credits for the film I'm not sure how to make Rosalba Neri errone for someone named John Bora.)
