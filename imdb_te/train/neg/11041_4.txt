Performance Average. It's not laughing especially for me. However, I think Courtney will really bring down. She does not look natural. She has these three ways to talk, all robotic. She does not speak silently (with no charm), she usually speaks (with no charm), or she usually starts to speak, and she begins to speak gradually. However, her intercourse is "Let's pretend I'm yelling because I can not be too loud on set". <br /> <br /> <br /> "It is hurtful, you can not really get her personality because she really does not generate emotion and is upset." This is a husband who is doing these stupid things, And she has no reaction from her too dry and plain acting.
