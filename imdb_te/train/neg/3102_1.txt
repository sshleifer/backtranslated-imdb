<br /> <br /> If you look at it scary, an innocent movie with monsters hand-made dolls. <br /> <br /> If you look at the comedy, you have a lot of humor that is flat and just lame. <br /> If it is a romance, you can not pull for a whiny hero if you see this move. Remotely entertaining. As demonstrated by demons are obvious puppets and the film is another attempt at the film of Gremlins. But it's the worst looking monsters of the genre. The critters looked pretty good, so the Ghoulies did, heck even puppets from Munchies looked better than this. The characters are very rare in this movie. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend always complains, they are a trick friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend of a spaz. At one point in the film, the leader and the military man fighting the throat ... the film is just stupid. Waitress tells me that when they are in a terrible club scum (which is not a club, but a diner) I love that scene and there is none among them. Give me a break, I am 25th am younger than any of them.
