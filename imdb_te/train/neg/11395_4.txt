That's not exactly a new story, but this romantic comedy concept will work. A young man (John Cusack) and a dead gorgeous woman (Kate Beckinsale) find the door open and wonder if they are intended for each other. Although two others promise ... oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A few Saber in some places, but Viva La Love. I was almost riveted because of being a romantic. Cusack is on the ground and snow starts to fall, and my favorite scenery. The end is very sweet, but very deserving. It was not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but washed away by Beckinsale in hell. Prominent support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett has played the worst role I have ever seen him. Eugene Levy on the other hand is quirky and funny. See it with your soul mate.
