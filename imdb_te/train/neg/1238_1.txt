The Tim Burton rebuilding of the original "Planet of the Apes", from 1968 (and Charlton Heston), is far from the original quality and plot. <br /> <br /> Certainly the Special Effects 1968, but not writing. The characters are boring and dialogue is awful. The "Planet of the Apes" toys in the Target were all in clearance bin, and before Christmas, I sat down with the whole movie (and gratefully for rent). <br /> My advice to everyone: See the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" movie.
