It's really awful "B" movie. It's unclear and often embarrassing. The plot, the primary performance "Making in Business" routine, is almost non-existent. In fact, the film does not require just one to highlight some of the famous musical groups of 1942, including the rise of the war effort and the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slacks. Every group gets about the standard three minutes, exceptions are Mills Brothers, who guarantee two numbers. Un Miller can not dance until the last few minutes, and she is less likely to lose her role in the edge of patriotic campaigns. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film, in my view, was done in the Duke Ellington section. The band will be standing in awkward positions and playing on the train. (At that time the band was split in the deep south, railroad.) Johnny Hodges appeared next to the Duke and Harry Carne was also spotted. In the final moments of the film, the trumpeter / violinist Roy Nons falls on the camera and takes a "uncle's uncle", wiggling his eyes and wiggling his head in Willie's best films. This tribute is truly sad for modern audiences, especially jazz fans. Some movies are not seen.
