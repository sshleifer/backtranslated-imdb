I thought I could give this picture to zero. Cheesy effects and acting. The only reason for watching this movie is to see how bad you are. Start with a kid playing the brain. What a geek! I can not believe Mullet! Then he was talking to himself. I thought the movie should not be silent, but still. In fact they also had to bathe me, not what I wanted to see. But Jared has done a great deal compared to the Special Effects Department. The crash from the bear is something I can do for myself, and that's fine. I suspect Gary Palsen has nothing to do with the film, and this film is not even called Hotchat. Finally, I do not think the author ever read the book, I saw nothing. I think the book is great, but this movie is as difficult as a smelly goat!
