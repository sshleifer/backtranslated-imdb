And I thought the film was bad, with the difference in the time of our film, one of Nicolas Cage's greatest actors. Do not blame him for a terrible script, give your self back back if any idea of ​​what the hell of the film is doing. A cross between the village and the crappy script. Its eye starts to catch up, and as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and does not start about the end of me !!!! What is it Nicholas Cage is the only thing in the film that has the ability to be funny in simple comedy and strange situations. If you go to the blockbuster, it's the only one that you see, save five bucks and go back home and put some into the fire, and why some people ask you, the stupidest thing that comes to your mind, and where you go!
