<br /> <br /> The film has a lot of promise, and the plot is relatively interesting, although actors, directors and editors have been able to seriously reduce the film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad about the writers, it may be good. The performance is very engraved, very few characters are believable. <br /> <br /> Some of the editors have clearly learned some new editing techniques and want to splash the whole picture. <br /> In almost every scene there are a lot of close 'elegant' edits, which are clearly indicative but annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
