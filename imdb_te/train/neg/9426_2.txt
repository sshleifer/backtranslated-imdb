After opening credits, there is a black screen for a minute. One minute no, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. When she and two college friends were driving for a rock concert, after most padding, they beat something and cut off the road. They awaken a wheelchair-bound old lady and a cabin in her offspring. The killings are a very sad sin for a predictable video Nasty. The crazy and imaginative unfolding twist. None of the participants in the chaos will do anything again. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sarah gets uninsured, and Laurel Monson is full frontal at the show <br /> <br /> My grade: D
