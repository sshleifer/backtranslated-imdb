The screenwriter did not correctly try to recreate "Exorcist", but in some Blah-Blow love story you could get ill rather than being engaged. This whole film does not have any material. But it can be dismissed by showing a group of people about what covers. Most boredom I left the theater but the dumb film ticket was expensive, so I had to face the frustrating panic that I felt I was continuing. <br /> <br /> They use computer graphics, (It is intended Iga, I hate CGI to) just have to destroy the film. Some people are horrific in film theater because it's a brilliant film "thought-inspiring" and "slow-paced-action-because it's a brilliant picture" when it's a hero or a thoughtful idea of ​​a beautiful boy H is a lovely promise of a boy and a religion as a priestly Ledger A post? It sounds like an uninterested feeling. Oh and there are some mumbo jumbo about "sin-feeder" (the film is actually named "baby-eater"). The concept of Lam did not matter but the film took a seriously "baby-eater" thing, the film became pathetic and illusory about how dark and intelligent. <br /> <br /> I know that in medieval times there are really sinful ones, but this film sounds just for cheesy. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong in the film and I feel why I watch this movie. If you really want the horror of the depth, you can see any of Rosemary's Baby, The Tenth, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibals, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or Romero "Dead Trilogy". The Nonsense Dialogue intelligence is not equal to people, but mainstream filmmakers consider it to be a cinematic cinematic genre of people who think a hilarious movie like Hulk. If you want mind-numbingly boring horror, look at the order. The film looks like a roller coaster ride.
