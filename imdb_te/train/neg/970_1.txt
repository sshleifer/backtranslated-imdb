Usually I'm not sort of scary by horror movies, but this film is exempt. How this picture came to my mind! It's a very simple picture but at the same time overly efficient, it's a real standout for the girls dad coming down the hill, which leads to great weather and some shocking moments. Another seen family photo I did not imagine and I jumped out of my seat! I recommend everyone to see this movie, so the lights will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
