In the U.S., there are fewer movies about Julius Caesar or Rome not set for a while. Hollywood's knife and sandals myths are largely Christian background, which makes it harder for previous Roman history (Spartacus is perhaps the first exception to this rule and has faced some resistance in Hollywood because it does not exist). /> <br /> It happens before Caesar and Christ, but it is interesting to see at least one of the pictures on the Italian peninsula where Rome is the only city to be set, and remove the hated king. <br /> <br /> It is not a historical film; It is not peel, and product values ​​are not rock bottom, acting and cardboard cardboard. I can imagine what kind of dialog is in Italian, but wood is very much in English. <br /> <br /> I do not see many movies of this genre, I missed the 60s Hercules films. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: If I see this film at age 10, I love it. It is. At that age, I went for anything with the Romans and with the knife. So at least, this film brought back some childhood memories.
