A body in the body sees the body trying to kill the body, but they do not open what he is trying to do. After this we will enter into the future and we follow a group of pre-school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they choose one of the most grueling ways. Let's learn about this coward who is confused by Jupiter, but she closed them because they had previously dug and discovered some strange moments. So will she come back from the tomb to take revenge? <br /> Oh what a great and always horror story! Well, I hope I'll say it. And 'hoping' is as good as it got. This is an unforgettable, so supernatural horror movie I really watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first view. I'm surprisingly, I started making some stuff on. But then again and again and again and then again and again will again return to you again and again. "Nightmare" is just another type of field, which adds some changes to the group.Oh, please give me a bit fresh, it's not entirely original, but it's a formula and a very tired J-horror movie. ! A nasty looking, revenge chic spirit. but it alertes a kind of old, same old story and jolts.This despite my negative feelings aliens audiences with murky lighting of gloomy atmosphere, while deaths are apparently bite and some realism are displayed when popping in its gruesome and creepy visuals . One of the girls was a blood-bogged experience in the scene involving the fiery spirit, but when I was not really trying to shock I found myself rather coma-inducing and I thought about getting some closure eye. There was no interest in that shock between now and the moments. Because the mystery you may think is not really quite the one, the uncertain story is just flat and the characters are a self-centered bunch that you do not really care what they really want. The confused story should focus more on the spirit than these soft characters that have a confident group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by taking too long to get going that it is maddled and overflowing when it comes to its climax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> It's nothing new, it steals the idea of ​​reflexes, but you'll notice that you can last some nasty tricks. However, despite the odd effective winter, I was helpless. A standard effort was round all I expected, but still it was equally missable.
