What's wrong. Very bad. If the sniffing of the catering table on an image set, at least, whether or not - I really criticized independence of any kind of film. However, this film ... Oh dear. <br /> <br /> There is no need to panic more than frightening (self respectable thing) and it is wrong to try to make it more important. And it's fair, it's more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but by far. <br /> <br /> If Gore is the point of the film, can not you see it? <br /> <br /> Make sure you know how three sound men work at least one device. <br /> <br /> Your main maniac smurf doll in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, which you can rent very cheaply. <br /> <br /> 5) Have a person knowing how to use the effects and other cool programs to use in every two seconds after each. /> <br /> 6) Kudos to get girls off to their altars but after the next time, we get girls who have tops to see what we've taken. <br /> Help the story tell the story or set a mood. This kind of film editing should at least sell gore costumes. <br /> <br /> A chamber suddenly found in the stomach of the characters is not intimidating, it is sad. <br /> Some good things. Not all acting is bad. Jack was great and I liked acid when she started fighting again. There is some niche image, unfortunately it is thrown out to the screen without a poem or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a good image. I also like Fatworld's moxie. Next time, now they have the image of the bushes under their belt, I hope all aspire to something better than Coleman Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
