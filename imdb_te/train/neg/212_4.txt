The reality is closer and more depth than "breakdowns", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a pretty dull performance. Again the film has a cash in the 'breakin' craze, but we give some entertainment from at least three young friends and a younger brother, a plot of life in Queens in New York. Everyone has their unique talents. <br /> <br /> Laten, the story, and his young cast are also struggling with their characters. <br /> <br /> Choreography again becomes sharp for both club and street scenes, but only one of these is finally "flat end" after unfortunately showing that the movie is really interesting. <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
