What should this be Remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's role? What a slow, depressing, boring, who-a-damn movie about this people !!! Just sit and just painful, I turned it off before it ended. This is very clear when Cheadle sender is assisted; I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychic role in everyday life work? We think that's deep, I guess. Why did Sandell give Sander a violent rebellion against him? If they are such friends, how can they grow? If the chair is under control, why does he ask for advice on the street? We did not say that. Thus the Fisher King is a better film in a number of levels and why it is succeeding. 10 in the average of 10? I do not agree. At all. Top films are also lucky to get the highest rating, and are not eligible to stay in the same universe with these worst.
