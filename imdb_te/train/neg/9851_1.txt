The dreaded David Lynch is no worse than the "chaos" and "brain dead". The innocent "Tom and Jerry" throws the ball, as in the cartoon (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bounces around. There is less character development. It just starts to climb the "strange level", in the climax of the whole chaos. Above the fine actors do not suck in this regard. They do not provide nothing to work, and you will be wondering what's going on 85 minutes of total, unbearable. I would recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs, except when I completely drain your brain into the wrong way. - MERK
