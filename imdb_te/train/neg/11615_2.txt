Although Sam Rockwell was a fan, I was surprised when he saw his name in the credits of 'Joshua'. Heck, I did not even know that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the film. So the film is not watching the movie without a movie. Rosemary's Baby, 'The Omen' or any other demon Kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it has fallen flat. Slow, slow, and flat. However, in the hope of hope, I end up on how it is determined, the final climax will show a slight light on this topic. Okay, I agree, it's a bit (a bit bit) but no old conclusion. And no less low budget movie, or at least how they are designed. Is a person coming ?? You can not see the drop, you see someone falling in the blood of what's on the blood. Has a person been hit by a cab? You can not see it, anyone will see that the bike is holding and complaining. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or a lack of funding for laziness or special effects. We have a crazy mother, a "rich" family, a workingaholic dad who is trying to balance everything, as a kid? Joshua, who may become a transgressor and become a newborn child. How many days do she look at her alive? And what about it? Are the above rats or Joshua? Does his mother have nuts? Is Joshua's foolish man new to his family just jealous? Did he grow up as Michael Myers? Or will he take his family to the brink? I do not think so. They can be believed before they are nuts, and I do not have the so-called "acting". Unfortunately, just any questions were answered, and only open doors were closed. I'm sure that's the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty of good kid-gone-wild movies to explore. Joshua is like the mini-me of the antichrist.
