Gore Fest of the last 80s a little interesting featuring some nasty slugs as a flavor for this human blood. If you can get past the ridiculous past of the whole thing you may really get some little pleasure from this. Acting is awful, and there is only one to portray this story between the ghoure slug attacks, but the film is not completely waste. Special effects are actually very good, and the gore is well done. It reminds me of the remodeling of Blob, perhaps it is known to everyone. Overall, you are definitely worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I do not suggest you watch this movie when you see this story.
