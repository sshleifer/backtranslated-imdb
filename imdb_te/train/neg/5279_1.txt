My friends can usually stand up with a lot of disappointing movies, but it's too little to see for the last time. It's just boring and unrealistic. "Hot" girls who starred in the film are not even watching me. <br /> Acting has been on many occasions ... yet many times bad. The most cruel role in the overall picture you want to die is the main character's best friend. More and more I saw more and wanted to break my screen. (Did you know the fat ugly kid that I was talking to) <br /> <br /> This plot took place several times before they wanted to sued by other film companies. Okay, this is a good idea but it has all of this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film can be viewed only by saving any abuse from your friends. Or, if you can not do anything absolutely nothing.
