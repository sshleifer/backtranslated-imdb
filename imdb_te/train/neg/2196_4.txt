Bread (or head) is not one of the more unpredictable budget exploitation movies in the early 1960s. It is difficult to imagine how this controversial sexist script was written without self-parody intent. And the male lead, Ginny Leath repeatedly expressed themes - the detached head machines, I-Vs and the tables kept alive - simultaneously with the exploitation and criticism of the film seem to ensure that gender stereotypes are intended. Shades of under-rated boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> There is a big deal of gender and frustration with an army of ants. Dialog hyperbolic, over dramatic and unbelievable, and acting is just ok (but not stable). Why did I give this film 4? Because some thought went obviously. I can not say exactly what the movie really is trying to do, but it feels for the bright and darkest darkness (blood and gutts without the audience's desire). Another special and interesting feature of Brain is that no heroes are really in the film, and none of the characters are unique. <br /> For all, it was initially painful and disturbing since the 1960s American pop sexuality survived from a woman's perspective, but survived a deadly car accident. Her lover threatens her with fresh, high quality, body and forced her to live with her. She had to fill her without understanding this and forced her to be almost as cruel as her boyfriend. Oh, there are some vague suggestions for the 1950s / 60s cliche about the misdeeds of science. <br /> <br /> B is recommended for gender studies for science fiff buffs and graduate students. O / w is not recommended.
