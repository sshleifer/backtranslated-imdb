Slow, boring, very repetitive. We are not surprised that Weinstein Company does not buy this. This spurlok should eat more MacDonalds, and leave the product when filming herself. There is no way you can see this and have fun. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make this idea a 2 minute movie with a feature. I have forgiven this movie. I can not see anything with the name Spurlock. It's completely rubbish. Such filmmakers must be on YouTube and never allow the distribution agreement. The film claims that when it comes to purchasing American customers and their shopping shopping and products, it would be wrong for the current recession, and money supply in the system will depend on a healthy economy.
