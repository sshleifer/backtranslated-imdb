The plot is acceptable but simple, namely, the beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man throws with a mental hunk and then attempts to cover it up as the psychedelic stalks and blackmail her. But what's going to happen from there is intelligence. Despite the resources available to the normal couple with money and influence, our privileged heroic and heroine are just a domestic, their lawyer and local police (they can not say they can not do anything). They have private security personnel (housewives or housework, chauffeurs, etc.), when the private round-clock nurses come to the rescue, fatal injuries, both man and wife are stranded and alone in their building. Our heroine has a dounob and our hero, the brains of a businessman, behaves in a very unlikely and irrational manner. This is a crime for wasting production for the audience who wasted their time with the mix and wasted the talents of prominent actors Oliva Hussey and Dan Murray (what they are thinking?). And, insulting on lifelong TV for insulting audience intelligence for this warm submission.
