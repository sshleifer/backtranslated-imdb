I think Jason Lee will have a huge potential, but it's a dangerous vehicle that attempts to break down as a star. The storyline is awful, comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think for relief, in the past, because they are very lame jokes. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot but still recommend that I watch the photos of the film instead of the picture. Save your time. 1 star.
