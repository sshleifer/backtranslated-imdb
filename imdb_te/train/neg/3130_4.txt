I have gone to the film and really like to make a line. I felt that there was a lot of probability on the premise and I thought it was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I took this movie. This is still a drop of expectation. The historical content of this story is glowing and the end is a bit cool for me. Acting in the film is very wooden. Most of all, I give you 4 a good idea, but the movie movie has a bit more attention to the fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I did not want my two-hour wish, but I did not know that I would recommend it to others.
