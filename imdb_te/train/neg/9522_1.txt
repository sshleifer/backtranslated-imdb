Wow! I remember the very awful pictures of the revolving around high school in the early 1980s. They usually have some victims of the story and most of the 27-year-old actors have appeared as a student. When I saw the film, I felt a bit of nostalgia in the 1980s. But will I learn that the film was made in 1989? What to say! Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, which is just bad. The plot is preparing to close the city's high school and all the buses for internal urban high schools threaten the bus. Odd no, the students at this school are both rich and prosperous. In fact, the main character lives in a building. You wonder if you can not find a lot of money to keep this school alive, and they do not hear asset taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. If the school board they can raise $ 200,000, they say the school will keep alive. So seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you can raise 200,000 dollars but instead of preserving college, do you have to be a senior to preserve high school? Why are they closing the town properly before the end of the year? And ... ahh forget it, this film is stupid and made in 1989!
