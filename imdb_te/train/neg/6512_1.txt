I can honestly say that I was upset with what kind of filmmakers, and without any regard to the healthy appreciation of the documentaries, to sit through the entire length of the "20 Dates". I do not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. I will say that even though Berkowitz's Hyper and Woody Allen-Style article is very painful, You are some lazy who wanted to lay off the coffee or wish he could afford it. And it is obvious that Berkowitz has a bad idea, some of which describes his attempts to document the documentary financially. I'm sorry for disgraceful disguise like compliments, but I'll give credit to Berkowitz for this daunting piece having the skills to convince some idiot to finance. I congratulate the boundaries & intentions of the film here, but Berkowitz also shoots himself in terms of himself and misses at all levels. In closing, I'm sure many of these female colleagues are unable to settle down at the date of filmmaking, so I questioned the reliability of this film. Hey Miles, I first loved your film ... as Seinfeld's episode or directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
