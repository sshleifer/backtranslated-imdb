<br /> <br /> The film starts with a simple comedy-hero film. It is about the boy chosen, there is no parents and schools are deeply in love with # 1 girl. Nothing in the picture is not surprising, there is nothing you can not expect coming in the picture. Toby McGuire shows us that he is not a good actor or any actor in the world can save this script. Maybe children at the age of ten may enjoy a movie, but it is a bit violent at a younger age. You can not stay away from thinking about movies such as X-Men, Batman and Spawn. Those titles are good. I walked for about 20 minutes! Even though the thing is good computerization, but it's not in the Christmas tree! So my recomendation: Do not look at this movie even if you paid for it!
