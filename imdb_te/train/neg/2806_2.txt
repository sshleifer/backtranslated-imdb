The movie is the worst kind. In general, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with Plasma Screen and it has long deceived the security of the museum. <br /> <br /> The plasma screen, which works for less than 2 seconds on the watch battery, has the internal resistance required to provide the required current. <br /> <br /> It is possible with a dozen large car batteries and an investor, But that system is not enough in the case. Sorry sorry, but it is not acceptable. I am surprised that the rest of the movie is not very good and why not being able to donate a budget gift.
