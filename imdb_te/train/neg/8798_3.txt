I have at least one story with a story. This does not happen in the film. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of the pineapple cans collector. An elegant wig woman removes her sun glasses. The film will fire at other people in the beginning and why we can never find why. After almost 30 minutes she disappears completely. There is another cokastian woman who purposely purifies an apartment. Mammals & Papas 'California Dreaming' is very fast (I love the song) and there are endless scenes at a fast food joint. The dialogue is mostly related to diet (pineapples, chef salad and ordering drinks ??). <br /> <br /> Many of the actors have weighed heavily on the film. Because most fast food is used. It's deliberately a romance - it's not such a thing. I wonder why I did not hit Fast Forward. Did I wait for something important to happen ?? It does not. Perhaps the film is only consoling - the scenes have changed so rapidly that you all seem to expect to be inefficient.
