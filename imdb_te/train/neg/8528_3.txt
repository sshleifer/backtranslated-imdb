The poster is inscribed: "When he was born he was 6 years old ... in the 34 years he would travel a lifetime." Amy was an American born Israeli, who was diagnosed with muscle weakness at age age. When he was 34, when he was not in love with his 22-year-old, he decided that he would live for 6 years to come to the United States to face the doctor. He wanted to show the surviving doctor, and he wanted to have 39 pounds. Why? <br /> Naturally, it is the courage to live all his left forefinger with whom he can move, but why is the doctor so angry? Who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother that he had no longer lived long enough for people with his disease. What is the point of showing him at the old doctor's door? Why is the journey of his lifetime in recognition of this old doctor in America? We have a lot of interest in Ami's life: how can we make those animations with one finger motion? How can he go through the daily lives depending on others? How did he keep his doctor's assessment? How does he treat emotionally when other people see him as a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let him show his old doctor's door to show him that he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
