I am a fan of his first album. This film is a disgrace to him. Except for a performance by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thomson, the shows are just terrible. <br /> <br /> Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony, and Jarvis Cocker are particularly annoyed. <br /> <br /> When I did not see my wife sleeping and went out of the room in the previous movie, it was difficult for some interviewing departments to be forwarded through performances and poor camera work. /> <br /> Mr. Cohen songs <br, Jennifer Warnes, kd Long, Billy Joel, Aronne Neville and Willie Nelson have many people to be brought to mind, but the choice for the show is just another attempt to explain Leonard Cohen to his insight, talent, and intelligence. <br /> <br />
