Why did I waste my time with this movie? There is not a single funny joke or line. Slapstick is also not mildly funny. I mean really, the vacuum sucking from the pipe sucking? Why is the National Lampoon named in the film? <br /> <br /> Even Christmas Vacation is better than this (I thought the movie was so funny).
