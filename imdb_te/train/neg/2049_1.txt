At least I was able to sit through it and enjoy mocking the image which is just a surprise. In all honesty, I guess rather than the cost of DVD case than the whole movie. And saying that Boogeyman is the same director, that new version just came out ... nice touch guys, it's me that the rope is misleading me. The only thing that bored me more than awkward acting is the copycat his haircut. Usually you will only see that kind of hair on the ten year old boy and character. When it reads, it looks like the film is drawn to a D + grad student of an excited film that uses the movie technique to portray the film .... Sometimes, the lower the buddy is greater. By way of I have been led somewhere or lost by random plots turns that are unexplained. All this makes a bad image but when the end itself comes close to pulling together, well, it makes a spectacular bad image. Without a doubt this is the worst picture I've ever seen, and that includes my friends' French final video of the senior year of high school, but hey probably means I'm a bit bias, I mean I did get an extra play. PS I do not even think that a star deserves ... not even half. For you !!
