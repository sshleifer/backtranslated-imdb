Poor Tobey Hopper. He has directed all the time horror classic "Texas Chymasov Massacre". Since then everything he has done is terrible. This is probably the worst ... and so much is saying. It has the ability to make man (Brad Dourif) things (and people) catch fire ... or something like that. The original idea (the "Firestarter" for anyone?) It's a real mess ... literally everything is wrong! Curiosity acting (even Dourif!), Asinine script, loust product values, crappy special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! A must ... is not even good for laughing.
