It's the worst speculative garbage. H. Ryder Haggard's novel is very entertaining and dramatic. Producers of this nonsense image are not closely followed. Well, the old novels are not sacred, and if they have one's own feelings, it is better with me. All of the things that should be able to stick to an original changing the changing and unpleasant and watered-down clich√©s. Although they are good at least two of the film, they are also good with bad actors and if they are filmed with casks made of cardboard in a studio. There is no imagination with no tiredness. <br /> <br /> The collectors of the Victorian novels should buy or make sure that the film is in the picture. <br /> <br /> If you read your novel, and if you decide to watch this on TV you may have hoped - in the houses of God - this is a waste of money to buy. An old buddy witch in Gagl's book and some ancestors of Golum became a good pals!
