The middle path to concentrate on the rain is very low. One would love it, its honesty, its liberal perspective and good acting, or divide its clear campaign, medium dialogue, cardboard characters and overall trend. The bore, worth acting, and occasionally only occasionally come in the next category, and film and drama are not related to the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war. The writer is Lillian Helman on the side of the angels. Her plays wrote to people who shared her opinion, and she rarely explored the author's ideas and ideas that were not already present by the audience, except how terribly it was "on the other side". Although I found a hundred percent contract to tell her what it was - in the Rhine - I can not stand the way she still says. While her characters are not true, and she shows a certain facility for the way her talking people speak of having true brightness or realism. She's nothing new to say. A few years ago, the late Mary McCarthy of Helman's reputation has long gone. For the theater that is dead or terrorism and good old days, I'd say badly like Angels in America, a peek at the watch on the Rain, which was sixty years ago in the theater.
