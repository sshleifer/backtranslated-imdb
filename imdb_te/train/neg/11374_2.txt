I can not relate to this film. It has failed to engage me intellectually, emotionally or beautifully. The conversation is too thick and unwilling. I could not meet it and that's why I did not care about any characters and it's hard to find that it's very positive to say about it. <br /> I need to know more about some of the vague facts of Catholic theology to understand it properly. As an anesthetic, I'm probably alert to the best details of Catholicism, but I've seen many images dealing with the religious issues that have influenced me as their backgrounds are still universal to human condition and do not rely on special knowledge or beliefs.
