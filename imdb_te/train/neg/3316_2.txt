It was the first Ivan McGregor film I saw outside Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Since then I became a very big Ivan McGregor fan but I still can not forgive the existence of this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] My sister is always Jen Aston Fan, subject to various scientists, Emma is one of them. I always thought it was boring, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this terrible composition, I had to confess that Emma was delightful and lovely. Evan McGregor is almost a benefit in the film after hacked and sliced ​​by Frank Churchill. <br /> My recommendation to those who are far away in English play drama ... go to see original. If you're an Ivan McGregor fan ... I believe by immersing this film, you will miss five minutes in a crazy hat and a bad haircut.
