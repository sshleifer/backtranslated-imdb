As an Altman fan, I'm searching for the film over the years, with such great actors, it's at least a little intelligent. <big> It's one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thirstfully haphazardly and improvisationally hoping that it's all in the editing room (or it feels) threw together. It's not. <br /> As Malton is outlined, this turkey is famous for the first appearance of Alfred Woodd's, who are the outsiders vets around her. Excluding all costs, avoid all costs. (It's easy - it's never going to be in the video - my knowledge - and its cable shows have Halley's comet's frequency.)
