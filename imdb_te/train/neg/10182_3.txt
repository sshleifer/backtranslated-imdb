Well, think of the title you think is a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well but it was so boring after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a parent to leave any length to get what she wants for her daughter. The problem is that only her daughter friend girl girl. She always wins the tournaments, so she pushes her mother to "eliminate". Speaking of a "murderer", the girl decides to be roughed up a bit. So actions were taken but she was finally caught up. <br /> <br /> The cast is awful, and the film drags for a long time without ever occurring. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this time. <br /> <br />
