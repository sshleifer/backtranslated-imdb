This story is equal to ET: an earthquake run on Earth and tries to return home. While on our planet, it creates friendly relationships with humans. <br /> But ET, rather, play, humor, poetry, this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> In this way, you will find some funny scenes (the town's first scene, "Cosmic" Slay toaster) and casting is specifically for "Dock", as "Mac Fly Fly", and auto-funny He prays to the visible harli. Eyes on the cake: Main title Danny Elfman did, and like each other great composer, he also recognizes his "voice" before being credited.
