I stopped in five minutes when I gave Beowulf a double-shot, automatic crossbow. The crossbows do not have telescoping scenes, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in the hand-to-fight. Terrible, woody acting and eternal darkness all sized fiery oriental films can be broken. I have only gotten a few minutes before my gall bladder has grown up, instead of loving Lucy again and again, what I'm really saying. <br /> <br /> But you can make it a TV movie and get out of there. <br /> <br /> <br /> A mockery.
