Do you guys secretly? This movie sucks. If you're really upset with the transparent versions of the original films, you probably have surprised the film (I know what this film did last summer). The first 30 minute film was based on a typical story arrangement; A group called cool young people is delighted with their vacation in Florida and they behave like many young people. The only insight we have incorporated in this topic has succeeded in portraying the daytime fall in the adolescence of the characters. The second half hour of the film is a small momentum and begins to launch unprecedented killings near somewhere. The third half-hour film is definitely a mystery because I would have liked the film because I have to be thinking that the movie can still be interesting and original on the left. As for the story, it can be easily explained in some ways. Go to Florida on vacation by a group of young people. When they are busy, they start slowly (and I mean slowly) because they find a sort of silly secret. The only thread for murders is that all the victims are a normal secondary school's matriculate. But one thing that surprised me about this movie is how much Betty (who is not sure about his name) looks like Reese Witherspoon. One thing that surprised me about the film is that it is a jump from my seat a few times. Does it work of art? I boo'ed "because I've just dropped a glass of orange juice because my 12-year-old niece was about to go through the guest room door .. the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece ???? <br /> <br /> Do you know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you guys, but I'm not ..
