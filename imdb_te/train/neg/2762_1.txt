... there is no one watching the movie. My husband and I went to see last night. It's just a small theater, but there is usually a good amount of people out there. Not this time! My husband and I are the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst I have ever seen. Yes, CG is good, but it is. Acting, script & dialog, directing, editing etc. As we stayed alone in the room, we thought we were unlikely to talk at the time of the movie. That is how bad we are to remind ourselves about the mite morphine power rangers, Godzilla, mortal combat and the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> We see Rita and Lord Zed as commanders of the Soron army. <br /> These creatures are ridiculous. You can not introduce the forces of Dino / Dragon / EFT loaded with cannons without an explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide range of characters, but it introduces them in three hours and develops them and is not in the hour and half. <br /> The scenery transitions are terrible. I do not fall asleep during the movie, but it's a very simple plot, I'm missing plots holes. <br /> <br /> The characters are due to the Caucasian Americans, but the badly written dialogue in the broken English script. <br /> <br /> The last scene that redefined some of the movie's value ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... she did not know for a long time in this life. He did not seem to be very worried that he left in "morder", not knowing where he was or how to get back. <br /> "Oh, and why not dress up?" Asked. Sarah's soul appeared as she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth. Another thing ... All 3 reincarnations of the main hero characters brought back to the job. Sarah completes her work and moves to the afterlife. Jack will do the same. Why did Ethan get trapped? He left alone, without a girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him get back. What did he want to do? Send smoke signals? And when he comes back home, is he returning to his job? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money in this movie. Since we have to pay, we have stayed late, but when the credits hit, we were on the door.
