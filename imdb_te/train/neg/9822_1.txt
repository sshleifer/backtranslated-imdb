I thought I was beaten in the film. I could not believe how totally I could be, and I thought it was good because I had a full movie. This is really a horror movie. Fearing that I was missing for 4 hours in my life, I will never come back. The other two hours I'm losing. Tell people that you want to torture to recommend this movie and tell them that they will kill suspense.
