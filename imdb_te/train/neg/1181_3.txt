The film became a long time after a long time ... angry, mystery, etc. It has a great deal of film making, but ultimately failed in every failure. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful booklet with 2 Still DVDs, Stills, Interviews, Blues, and Extensive Interviews. More than a pretentious director. For those who have heard about it or those who have never seen it, this package looks awesome, as long as you see a movie. Disc 1 has edited film, translated into English but translated into good visual quality. <br /> <br /> Disc 2 Directors have a cut, an awful shift, in French. <br /> What can I say about the original beast? The handmade hand of the Kermit frog was very difficult and surprising.
