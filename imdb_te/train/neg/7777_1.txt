My grandson once looked at it as a beautiful image for children. <br /> <br /> When he lost his little bear iceberg, he was in the water and he was trying to catch up with ice. <br /> <br /> My 3-year-old grandson does not like watching movies with these words. For children. The child must be friendly. I guess. Warning that Warning Brothers and G will be Dropped by G I guess I will not have Cuss Words. Many places do not have the words that fit this image. And the film drags out in many parts.
