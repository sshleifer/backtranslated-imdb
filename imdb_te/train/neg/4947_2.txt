The producer and producer of the little worst pop Hitler, such as Germany's brutal composer and "I Have You My Heart, You Are My Spirit" felt the need to tell his story - and kindly he decided to take a ghost writer. The result is a funny book about his life. Well, more or less shaded image. He did not deny that he was a selfish donkey, but the whole story originated in his own nature. She did not say that she had probably lost her ex-wife and not in hospital. <br /> <br /> It was his funny style and a huge success after appearing as a jury member of the German version of "American Idol" - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> It must be at the end of the story - really. "Deutschland Atlante Superstar" (DSDS for short) came up with a horrific idea to make a film from the movie, in the hype of the "Idol" TV program. "Dieter - Der Film" <br /> <br /> I rarely found it funny and saw a movie that was totally unsuccessful. Nobody gags really point hits. Although Verana's voice is still high, Nadel's voice and speaking style is immediately on my nerves. Apparently, the kid, speculative and long diamonds will destroy any motivation to see the film within a few minutes. The film's content is a sloppy movie simulation written by sloppily by a ghost writer based on Bolen's vicious memory. They could have used this freedom to make almost everything. It was considered satirical, but they failed. The story is not entirely interesting and the theme guarantees that the whole movie is not surreal that Voice Boehn himself is not true. <br /> <br /> It is not bad for the release of the film. The probability of some of these archaeological contractions has been far higher since the DSDS's average success in the current season. With the "friendly" help of Germany's largest yellow newspaper "BILD" and the TV station RTL having anything to do with the disappointing situation, yet unbeatable performance "Vetten Dos ...?" <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - definitely good cartoons and a story are actually worth looking. /> <br /> Thus: 2/10
