Hay for all <br /> <br /> You can not really say much for this film. The basic plot takes some friends from a man (Brandon) work to go to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday. After flipping a girl on the way, it will start badly for all of them. <br /> <br /> The storyline is only possible (even though Brandon is the actor, I might be wrong here) and it's unbelievable, and consequently. "Clown Killer" does not need a sadness for himself as a mental killer. Unlike a dark, mysterious but not many brilliant predator, we offer a rather nasty, nursery rhyme-singing buffoon that appears to be going through a small medium life crisis. The only thing that guarantees the writing of this comment is that the sex scenes and any gore in the film (the quality of the film has some fun from me). <br /> <br /> This picture comes under every possible set standard. Since I shared it with some close friends, I have removed some relevant entertainment values ​​in the movie and it is good to say that S.I.C.K is ashamed of both ratings. <br /> <br /> But, of course, (and with the benefit of compliments) a star rating for this film is more than legitimate score. <br /> <br /> 1 star per person.
