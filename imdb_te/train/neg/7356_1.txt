With this flick touch, I started into an image that started at home one afternoon - otherwise I would lose it. <br /> <br /> I saw the existence of Lindsay Cros and Jay Thomas - both of whom are good actresses - and this look is valuable. <br /> <br /> Joe McLollan is a little less than she can recommend her talent, she is bosom like Jane Mansfield or Anderson in. Unfortunately, her acting prowess - at least here - Garfield or Davis may seem to be comparable to Mansfield and Anderson. <br /> <br /> The white rat of the young nut case, the owner of the cat, the owner of a young nut case and a group of the doophus (including the young bean case), and the absurd ending to insist in her own home, and a bio-danger facility . I am waiting for at least some scene or plot element to be able to induce realism, belief, or some empathy / sympathy - but this is not in vain.
