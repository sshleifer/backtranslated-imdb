Oh Lord Oh. This film ... it's terrible. I'm a huge fan of horror films. And most of the time, horror movies other people are bad, I like. The performance that played the role of 'Scarecrow' is amazing, I said. But this plot is awful. It makes no sense! It has a lot more gore and initially having an unnecessary (and rebellious) sex scene. I believe the director is trying to talk with 'shocking' or what, but it's awful. They add to the festtering garbage pile called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I forgot who I am who I think is too little about them. In the end, this film made me sick. If you do not want to watch this movie anyway, please.
