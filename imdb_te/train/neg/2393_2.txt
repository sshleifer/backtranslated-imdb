I read Tom Robbins. I liked every word. It's full of sexy, funny, and glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when watching the film, it's because I can not believe a piece of a dull, sour, happy junk. How was this done? I read this book in Hollywood and read it under "Guy Priod - Women - Lacebayan". (This is the title of the Library of Congress topic.) Now more than 12 people who read the book know what real lesbians can do, and any real space travel is more than STAR Wars. <br /> <br /> The book is clear - one in Hollywood said, "Oh Oh, Guy director or Gay People suffers." So they handed over to Gus Van Sant. But nothing is against the man - but he really could be - he does not have a clue how he is a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took the entertaining fantasy of the simplistic person of the offender girl / girl action and turned it into a disappointing, literary-minded lesbian power recruiting poster by malewoman. It's like turning an Oscar Wild comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. <br /> <br /> The main evidence for Goose Van Sant is that it is not sure what to do about the origin of the source. His voice allowed him to be hired as the best. The true subtext of the novel (the fantasy of the straight man, not a gay eagle poster) has led to his ignorance but bad but not the options. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Pat Morita was very fun in Happy Days. But CHINK cast him as wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat morita has no idea that chink is very funny person. (Gus did not tell him.) The pat also known as chink. . . Well, SEXY !!! In the book he is not a wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's like Hugh Hefner! He is a Randy old goat and he knows a lot about the nubile and pleasing Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. <br /> Do you know that in the book, they are not really lesbians, you know this is a person's fantasy? <br /> JOHN HURT "COUNTS" Well, he's gay friendly guy. But he's a serious, Shakespearean actor! You want to have fun and camp for this character. Hurt the Goofy guy as Countess for John is tragic and sad. When I wear Paul Schwarfeld Thomas More, I will be heading for a mourning and headache. "Now, Richard, you have lost your soul completely and yes, funny like John Hurt Caligula (and pretty gay). <br /> <br /> < "No talent, no training, no problem. Except in the book of Bananza, is fun, fun, happy, more (different), and loving. She is sad, passive, expressive, and frustrated in the film. For her taste for women, Robbins in the book keeps like this. "God knows I love women, but it does not take the place of the person to fit." Uh, Gus? Do you read this book? <br /> <br /> Uma Turner is "Cisco Hancock". It's a tough character. The book Sissy is really exceptionally passive and shy heroine. However, a more talented actress was able to make Twinkle in the eye, or a swing in her walk, suggesting the hidden strength or secret happiness of her adventures. Uz does not pull it off, because Gus never said that Sissy was happy to be a hitch of a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays more as she is in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This film is sour and dull. I scribble, Gus van Sant!
