"New Best Friend" is another entry in "stealing another woman's life". The best of these is "single white girl" and "hand that rocks the cradle"; You can catch almost any afternoon in a lifetime channel. For some reason this type of identity is especially for women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this kind of story. You can change the woman badly in the beginning and apply her audiences to her compliments and implement her evil plan. Or she uses the misconduct to make her look good until she is badly revealed in her atmosphere. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of "New Best Friend" did not decide how they would play it and wanted to crash things and start shooting. We first meet Alicia (Mia Kirchner) for scholarship money in the college financial aid program. We know that she has a bad guy now and she suspects her next step. But the director and editor apparently revealed that, and the next 50 minutes, we've misused that we think that Alicia is a good person. <br /> <br /> It is not about whether it is false or introducing the sole element of suspense, when the director and editor wasting time and wasting time with a sense of vulnerability. <br /> <br /> "New Best Friend" from the Teen Movie Curse of the cast to depict undergraduate students. There are really two large parts, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirchner). They are 31 and 26 respectively during production. It works almost as she plays Alicia's Messi version for the 26-year-old Kirkner, but she is transformed into the brilliant version of Alicia. Monroe's star is just a joke, Nicolet Sheridan trying to qualify as a classmate in "Lizzy McWire". <br /> <br /> Problems have a lot of debt as this age problem is spreading to many supporting roles. Headley and two other rich party girls (Dominque Swain-Age 21 and Rachel True-Age 35) Undergraduate roommates in college. They share a building (as their student home), better and better than a building in real-world-new Orleans (considered to be more unsuitable than soccer moms). Alicia moves into the building and begins to receive Hadlee's life. At least in that way Swan finally has a Lesbian sequence since it gets a roommate from her own generation. Swann's supporting performance "New Best Friend" and "Kirsthner" her love scene is fantastic, very cool and it is not good if any of the other categories do not suit it as a good director <br /> <br /> The unexpectedly hilarious story, the dominant sexy and nonstop parties' Line-up, everyone went ahead with a shot of Amagia on the bed in the hospital . More than half of Kirkner's screen spun in her note with a hose. <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
