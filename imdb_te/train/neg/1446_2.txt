The film is the complete hero of the original classic novel, which failed to capture a completely adventurous adventure spirit. The most terrible American Patrick Swayze starred in British nationalist Alan Quetermarmine despite his nationality's clarity. <br /> <br /> The film is more conveniently suited to the Hollywood-accredited mold. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet familiar with the film, the film is very unfortunate and is painful with the terrible depression and action sequences. <br /> <br /> All was already a very bad collection of images based on King Solomon's Mines and the legend of Allen Quarterman.
