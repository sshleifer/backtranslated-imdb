I kept awake last night watching this thing awake. It is used to show how film schools do not want to film about what I can say good about this horrible film. The correct character does not develop, wait, I'm not even sure they are the characters. Set-ups hockey and azon, and spit-screens overly waste are sometimes unable to synchronize with alternative shots. If I give this a zero or minus rating I will do. <br /> <br /> It's a sad example of money made by Hollywood waste, now I'm wasting time thinking about it.
