My family and I tested the underdog the night before. And unfortunately the underdog (like my four-year-old's like it) is a hot rod that looks like an Oscar valuable item. The only thing that can save the film is that if Evelel comes out of retirement to take him into a movie. But I agree that Soundtrack is good. I'm not sure if it's set in the 80s, but with the majority of music from Europe? No one knows. If I were you, I would pass. Stay home and look at the test model at your local TV station. Or if you are dead watching, under the influence people may have fun.
