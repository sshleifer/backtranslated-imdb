I'm Irish and I'm in Denmark for a while so I look forward to going home last week, so I can see the interview. <br /> <br /> The film is a first ml. <br /> <br /> "The most fruitful person in Ireland" is not very bad, but it's definitely some of the elements of the film are actually quite fun, including Calm Minnes American-style garde. But this film is completely misplaced. The camera bounces around and constantly tries to give an experimental look to the image as a rainbow drama in the zoom-in, zoom-out movie. But it is not. This is an Irish lock, stock and two smoking barrels and it should be baked. This should be a smooth move from one shot to another. The film is just sloppy and thrown together. One of my friends told me they were following Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He gave a good performance as the Dublin Dirt Bag, but it did not match his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best show is from Dierdre O'Kane who plays sexually upset middle-aged woman who was denied by her bank manager husband for a young woman. <br /> <br /> I think earlier that she needs to fear her God. She should focus more on her acting. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look forward to these comments because I said it's great for many people. But before you reply, ask yourself: If you are set in England or America, can you think this film is great?
