Very bad, I really liked Kristen Clock and Gary Bassie. But the director failed to do so. There is a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off the hokey. The director did not do his job. Promising action comes dull. It seems to be a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV claimed by 1996) is not just worth the time to see it. Another director made a better job.
