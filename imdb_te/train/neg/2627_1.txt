This bomb is not just an 'explosion', humor and absurd situations. Truly, the fantastic fireworks. The reality is not one of its strong points. I'll give it to 1 to 10. I did it zero, but that option is not allowed. Sorry, but Litgo and Sutherland need good characters. But then at times we need money. And I'm still relocating to that Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nixon was brave enough to accept that it was a turkey. But if there is a turkey, this film is not even a gizzard. I can say "I can give my money". I can bet if I could. But premium services, there is trouble in the subscription type.
