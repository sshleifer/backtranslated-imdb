You are fouled by my tough statements about "Femme Fatale" / "Guns N 'Grieves" films and filed! Now comes another race of disappointing rediscoveries: Ninja Movies! Many of these I have seen before, and let me tell you, they will not crack until all! They usually do not stick to the point. This, among others, is not realistic! What was a ninja when Russia prevented a nuclear Holocaust? And this is not even a "martial arts" film, should it be? Do you have plenty of firing sound like an amazing action movie? Blood is the first cause of love of this type of death? Do you waste your hard-earned cash to sing a woman you see at the top of the tank? Answers to these important questions will be found in the NINJA MISSION, which should be in the Martial Arts section of your video store. For more nonsense ninja fun, try to check out the Godfrey Ho movies by Trans Gad. How did you get it, it's promise! Hardcore Ninja is only recommended for slaves!
