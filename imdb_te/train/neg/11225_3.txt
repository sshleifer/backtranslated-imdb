This documentary is the reconstruction of the past few years Betty Page's (Pygmy Richards) career. Tennessee's most famous pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and photos, slavery and cat fight "gilli flicks" fetish. Irving Klaw (Duck Flyover) ordered Betty to do what was to be done before the camera in his movie Star News. Notable photos or "stag pictures" were not naked, but Claus was charged with distributing pornography and ordered to destroy them to prevent prosecution. Surprisingly, Betty holds a worship at her career level. Jet black hair, blue eyes and a glass figure wearing feather gear or a girl next to a masculine girl with decades. In addition, she was shot more than Marilyn Monroe, and the second most famous photograph of the world, Elvis Presley. The Betty Page of religion disappears and devotes its last years. This film is actually pretty good; <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is amazing in his own right. Bra, drops, garter belt and hose will not hurt her in the picture at least. Also cast: Jaime Henkin, Jonah Strain, Emily Marlin and Julie Simon. Indicate that this picture may change your heart rate.
