Geez, another lifelike movie, but once again is not exactly the worst image in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it's pretty clear who is responsible, and it's generally very predictable. Even worse, the past few confusions were confusing, and the viewer said, "How long have I been working?" One thing I like is that it seems to be "good and good boys are good, bad people are bad," and sometimes it's bad, not bad, of bad people. Hadley did not make her sense of justice, because she did it because she meant a job, and the competition was removed. For Alicia, it proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them really "come", "it is" a painful and terrible death. The "burning bed" is a great example, but the difference is that the evil in the "burning bed" is right for him. But did Alicia "come to it"? <br /> <br /> Some people say she does, but others do not agree, and law is not usually. <br /> For acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job like Mia, but others are different from their roles. They are not mostly wooden or just convincing. The music is great and if you like girl / girl action, some scenes are good and steamy. <br /> <br /> "I can not act in this movie, but it will happen, but I'm not surprised if the sequel suddenly appears. It's like an Evil, tears and terrible for all the people, then I do not think she's thinking "Yes, I woke up from the coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? OK! And the charges have been dropped! "Hadley should not have been in jail anymore, even if any of the murders she has ever done since she actually happened.
