<br /> <br /> Killer Attack Tomatoes is a "simulator" of the evil monsters, which is worse than spoof movies. (Very little story) tells about tomatoes, they rebelled against those who deal with them badly. Generally, they spin and grow up (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know person is covered in ketchup. These actors have never created these images, so they do not have any point to name them. There is a person appointed to the government to try and stop the evil of tomatoes. He is a master of disguise and a girl and a black guy who dives. However, there is another woman who spies the first person to serve the government. If you do not understand it well, you will understand. The film is not good at first, but it is not fun to laugh at stupid assault scenes. The film is terribly cheezy, even though it is the whole point, really hurts what could really be a (reasonably) entertaining image. At one time, a large waxy tomato "slides" on a rare plank with wheeled wood on it! I recommend the movie if it has a cheerful camp value, but it is not even in this horrible movie. 2/10
