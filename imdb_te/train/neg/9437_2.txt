While watching movies I was never really considered a "student", I saw them, and made an impression. But all have been deleted. The film is without doubt the most ineffective attempt in the film I have ever seen. Every kid in the university should give this film a handbook with "How Not to a Fil a Film" to be the next Spielberg or Tarantino. There is no film, and filmmakers do not have enough efficiency to watch a movie that is visually appealing. It's been a while since I watched, but I have to watch overhead tracking shots in all the early sequences that I say. They never end! It almost pulls your teeth and is not just too fun.
