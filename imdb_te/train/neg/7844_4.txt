Nobody would go to the movies like The Hills Hey Hue Eyes and Citizen Kane hoped to come second time. Very low rental horror flicks, same Roger Ebert Dead "Dead Teenager Movies." <br /> <br /> <br /> The Hills Have Eyes 2 certainly qualify as Dead Teenager film, where only young people are given a surface form of military trainers. <br /> <br /> Some of the questionable facts have been raised in the film review "It's a Movie Only", but I have always been a good believer that all good fantasies have been rooted in reality to be effective. Hills Ice Haw 2, we're confident that the main characters are training people in a training exercise, but they look and speak like high school kids camping in the desert. The dialogue is alarmingly and frequently obscene. <br /> <br /> Though the films are not nearly as comparable, I thought of these "soldiers" in the platoon fearing and afraid of fear. <br /> <br /> Rather than the rifles and fatigues about the characters, the radio provokes: Radio transmissions are held like young phone conversations; A colonel is called "hay, ashole" by a private one. And no one has a slight idea to do, or what kind of command structure does, things start going wrong. I would like to see how true soldiers like James Cameron, the soldiers in the Aliens, the pure fantasy film, and those futuristic marines, despite their fantastic conditions. <br /> <br /> I started looking at a picture as a level 5, and confirmed the strengths and weaknesses of it. You must allow concessions to materials; A film is not as good as Star Wars the Godfather, in equal terms. <br /> Hills Hey Ice 2 If you are a pretty awkward exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is less than a normal dead teenager. Movie. On a technical side, the film has good product values ​​and is very well made from that perspective. Scenes intended to shock, or are usually intended to induce urgency or suspense. <br /> <br /> When you look at the Hills Ice Hus 2, the horror is worse, saying it is worse than death. <br /> <br /> All of the usual fans' luggage, or every film they see will never lie to the best ever or worst Ever all the time. <br /> If you do not "get" the horror, especially in the dead teenager, it may be a good time for you. <br /> <br />
