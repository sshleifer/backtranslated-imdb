American Pie is out watching: Beta House and I say, this is a trash pile of rubbish. The first 3 American pies were hilarious, not the last 3 jokes and the American pie. <br /> When you find beta house from the title of the movie, about a brotherhood, newcomers, girls and most of them fall in love. In fact, the person with the chickens stifler trying to complete another obviously impossible task, along with his homosexuals. It is dubious and super duplicate. Its just really speculative and the plot is weak. To see who has gotten the whole thing on the two sides of the college battle: horror acting + crippled script + America Pie franchise = the total waste of time! This film can not bear. I will give you ten to two, it's very nude and pretty like the 2 funny scenes of the girls.
