Roy Rogers was cast as Jesse James and his appearance alike, gambler Man Clint Burns. George "Gabby" is a former friend of Mr. Hayes Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. <br /> <br /> Gary Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are two journalists looking for stories about an elite team, an elusive boycott. <br /> <br /> In fact, erroneous recognition / hypocrisy is developing, from Rogers a "dual role" article. Rogers is as beautiful as ever; But there is nothing that really promotes this presentation more than usual - there is a possibility to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance. St Louis journalists include Mrs. Stom and Mrs. Payy. They highlight this image. The songs are good, but badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> Jesse James at the Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hays, Gale Storm
