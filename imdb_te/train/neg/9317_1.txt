I bought this from the blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter was too small to draw the disk * t, but the film failed to mention that it was low because it was harder than Paris Hilton in a home video in the video. Talking about home movies, making them a fair game to be released as movies from time to time - Use movies and technicians used by script technicians and script writers - not more - add your friends and lute-ideas, weekend, luxury product generated with a £ 8.00 budget Down the stairs with a Casio Keyboard (soundtrack) Tayi - then take it to the house alone, some poor SAP (me), desperation slap on the shelves. But here I have cleared up - I fast forward this, and on the one hand it is ready for Hummers ... Darren Day Horror 'Hellbride' (£ 1.99 home and another blockbuster) the next night. Now the film looks like 'The Grimm Weekend' as The Exorcist, so I returned to the Grim Weekend to say that viewers are happy to catch some of the list of superb IMDB boards. Sure enough, once I got on difficulty, pain, and horror grim weekend is the complete chod on the toast of learning, I could not have fun, enjoy it, and get down to the funny stuff clearly. And it is very much. Check the boards. Then check the image. Hell, it can also be valuable. AWWWWW CRAP!
