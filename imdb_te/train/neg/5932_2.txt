What kind of documentary artist has failed to include a single song about a musician? Unlike countless other films about "Ray" or musical artists, half of the theater (or on the couch) performed great songs themselves. Here, all tracks contain covers by unpleasant characters, and these characters fail to catch Cohen's slow and attractive style. More often, covers badly sang folk versions. <br /> <br /> Interviews with Cohen are more or more with other musicians and individuals. The film rarely covers Cohen's own work (always singing) - reading letters and poems. The film does not really capture many years of artist's life story or about his development over the years. A big disappointment for a big Cohen fan.
