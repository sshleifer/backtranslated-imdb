Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely slim sequel in two fantastic fantasy films. The film offers predictable spell-casting special effects, but fails painful on all other borders. All the actors are very silly caricatures. You have to be dipper to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is speculative, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. In the end, the film will reflect the images of the old Godzilla, one of which is a special (rather, another) ghost with special special effects and a gazzling head than the big shabby. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what the worst fantasy fans are - in this case someone is a little extra money and a successful formula. They can not do it again: cash cow now dies as a dodo.
