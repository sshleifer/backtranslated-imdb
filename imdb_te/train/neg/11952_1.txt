<br /> <br /> Instead, "Dr. Detroit" gives us the masquerade as the busiest professor of Ayrroyd. A conflicting, violent pimp is called only a rival. That's bad enough, but he has classes to teach, host a school dinner, to attend four ladies in the evening and a pink dinner (or something like) to attend. Not surprisingly, Aykroyd was overly disappointed. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Acroide met his future wife, Donna Dixon. <br /> Seven stars. You see Aykroyd, "Blues Brothers". You need bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
