The film was heavily dissolved by Steven Seagal's existence. Or I say Steven So-Mood! Seagal gave up someone to cheat his voice for the shots that need to loop the sound before it's too good or too stupid to dupe his own songs. Some of these films have also been made before, but I did not think of this! The film is very good to be honest, the script may use some work, but the parts of the film appear to be a real movie! <br /> <br /> This film is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It is better to become a cartoon without seagull. No trouble. Anything more on a buck for this! I honestly think this is the last time for me and Seagal. Did it take me a long time to realize this?
