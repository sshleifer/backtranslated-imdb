"It's not like a big mechanical toy," commenting on "Jaws", initially told a story. Well, "Blood Surf" only wish to have a beast like the shark of the "jaws" series. In other words, the Digital Special Effects Terrible of the film. Acting and direction are not improved; They are more suitable for dudorant or bubble-gum trade than the horror film. The attitude of the people who worked in the film was not only for the genre but also for the audience. This film only encourages movie producers to offer more of this rubbish, more poorer horror genre destroys. (* 1/2)
