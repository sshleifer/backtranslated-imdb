This film is very good ....... I'm really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. From all the movies he was the only state enemy, and he was one of the worst directors of all time. Richard Kelly (Director of Donnie Darco) gave the film the top priority. <br /> Now I am a genius in my eyes, but he has learned to take part in this role. <br /> <br /> Now I love the new characters of Mickey Rourke but I have a terrible story and it's look. I love Mickey Rourke, but he has been there for a while and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knightley, I think she's slightly overrated. <br /> <br /> The film is bad at all. That's the ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seattle
