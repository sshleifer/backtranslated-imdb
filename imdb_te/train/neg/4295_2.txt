It's another disappointing and boring movie about AIDS and tragedy. It starts out very unpredictable and imaginable and continues throughout the film. I kept waiting for the pickup, but unfortunately it's never been. Acting is okay, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste your time with hotter-time actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of titles, I missed 1/8 of the film. If you have never seen five gay films or have recently been dealing with homosexuals, this film might be interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-the-mill low-budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
