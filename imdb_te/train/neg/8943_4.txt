John Wayne & Albert Decker is competing for oil rights in the Indian landscape, taking Martha Scott out of Utah, USA in the Republic Pictures film. <br /> <br /> With its characters and its more advanced setting, Wayne & Decker West is playing old and new categories. It is based on the story of Thomson Burtlis written by Einarr Griffin and Ether Hill. Albert Rogel directs his career as a workmate. The truth of a beautiful mundane story is protected by its last third, thankfully taken action and we are treated with something similar to a pulse. The light hearted approach to the Romantic Strand does not sit right, and stunt men who do a fantastic fist fight ragle between two leaders can not hide. But hey, stunt men always need their moment of glory. George 'Gabby' gets solid support from Heis and Wane, usually having his screen pistol, has a very sunny attraction. However, it was better than the typical Republic Budget, which was only interested in Wayne enthusiasts in the 1940s. 4/10
