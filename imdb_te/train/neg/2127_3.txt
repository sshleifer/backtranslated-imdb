Why? For one reason, the opening of the song "Bye Bye Baiden" was never a much more attractive picture of any film. She can only repeat her repeatedly (in a different state!). Both excellent. See it rent. Everything you see. You agree, I'm sure. <br /> Everything is really cool about it, sorry, it does not need a remake! Jason and Vanessa have been rewarded with admiration, as well as Tyne and Shirley. In fact, in this new version all actors and singers are like giving their 'all,' but trying to improve in "Casablanca" - it's just not done! It's also hurt mentally to compare yourself when it tries to congratulate the remake, and it will be smaller by the fault of the actors.
