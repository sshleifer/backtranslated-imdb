The only ransom's quality of this film is that it is bad enough that it's funny. Everyone in the film is seen in the romantic industry. I saw good acting in low budget pornography. After this classic scene I really rented gay sex: Jim: See your donkey nick: you will see you together (together): I left behind! <br /> The first action sequence shows how terrible product, but its really kind of funny: good guys have weapons in the transformer! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it all off, they do some weapon swapping scenes with a couple of M-16s !! I think they have a budget shortage for guns, not good enough to go around between good guys and bad guys. Fight scenes are all poorly coordinated and fake as hell. You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade for its own explosion. As you walk inside a helicopter, you can not shoot any kind of shoulder missile. The weapons that you have abandoned suddenly do not look back. It is still stupid to throw a gun out of the bullets. If you do not know how to reload them, the big slow trucks driving in the first gear make it difficult for the action scenes. I can not really believe that movies like this actually produce. The film is a nitrous oxide or happy.
