Baba - Rajinikanth never forgets his name in his life. This was a film that caused his downfall. It was released with a lot of hype, but the producers and distributors were badly damaged and caused serious financial losses. Rajinikanth had to pay them individually for losses. Immediately after his release, he entered politics, but failed miserably. This is a bad movie with terrible acting, bad-quality decoration and curiosity screenplay. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a sick person. I saw Baba one of the unfortunate souls, the first day of the play in the play. The audience is very bored, most of whom have been left before the theater. Sorry, I do not recommend anyone else.
