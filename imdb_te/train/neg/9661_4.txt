I want to say that acting is bad, but I think it's directed. I have never thought of a Highlander (this is the same director), but it can be blamed on the 80s. <br /> But it is not with any excuse. Shot people when exiting the trenches with a man in front of him! <br /> <br /> This is an American Bullitch commented on the innocent time line, strange war tactics, cutting sub-pars and poor visual effects. The German General was practically afraid of his own American private possession. <br /> <br /> Get ready to swallow it in small amounts. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible but yet certainly a sub-par battle movie of all things.
