If you're a self-appreciated connoisseur of Cult Cinema and / or bad cinema, comes a certain point in life ?? Early sooner? You have to watch "Killer Tomatoes Attack". This is an inescapable accuracy as one of the most dangerous horrific films ever made. However, a small but necessary detail, "Killer Tomatoes Attack" is intentionally awful. Mocking Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds", this was clearly a zero-budget parody and I never expected director / director John de Bello for this movie. The film exploits the contemporary popular trend of "environmental horror" films (plants, animals and nature are rebellious against humanity) and introduces the less horrific type of vegetable imaginable as unwanted killing machines. A secret governmental agricultural scheme that generates large and tasty tomatoes is terribly wrong and there are reports of nationally-occurring tomato-attacks. President and scientists will form a special Forces team together to fight the Juicy Encounter with secret agents with special areas. The first half hour of "Attack of the killer tomatoes" is quite entertaining. It is a very original and funny, simple-shaped vegetable sight that is sinking from the sink and attacking the impressive housewives. Including several memorable moments such as the first half an hour of the theme song, "Jaws" tribute and the infamous helicopter crash (see Trivia section for more details). After that, the whole thing turns into a tedious, constructive and suffocerably conservative mess. The quality of jokes is awkward and innovative from the latest and innovative and is not always funny and there are many characters and sub-plots. Individually, they are slightly better product values, most over-the-top Tomato Special Effects and famous actor John Austin ("Adams Family") mad scientist Dr. Grangein. But, as mentioned earlier, the actual view of the real life at some point does not actually matter.
