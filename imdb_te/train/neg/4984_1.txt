Actual "les vittators" are original, fun, interesting, balanced and accurate. LV2 should definitely be "the first worst of a good image first trash". LV2 everyone is crying every time, even if it does not work the first time, it repeats with five hopeless hopes, which eventually becomes funny. LV2 is a terrible simulation of LV1, except for the course that is a parody discovery. If you loved LV1 do not see this movie, just look again LV1 !!
