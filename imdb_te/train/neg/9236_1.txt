I'm in the millions of people who think of Carrie Grant fans, but I can not think of the same reason to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Many fans would agree that many fans would be very happy to chase and catch Carrie Grant in bringing Katherine Hepburn's baby. Here the idea is that the director or the authors try to rebuild the character, but it will fail very badly. I read the comments as to how good the "creepy" Drake was, but I felt a very light description. <br /> <br /> The film does not accept all 10 comments and I do not know. <br /> <br /> Give this a wide berth, unless you are tortured.
