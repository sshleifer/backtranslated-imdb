It's a nice effort but it is very pretentious and boring to rise above the low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets is almost complete, but at some points it fails miserably. I used a small budget that I was expecting. I want that story and acting is very good. You have a lot of episodes that they see on the target and it will be great if they really hit those marks but they can not. The confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD Transfer too. It does not take much of a movie to watch a movie. I had to shut it down. It is very boring. I can make slow movies. But make them attractive in some respects. Visually, story-wise, acting, etc. Since it is not in all sectors, it has not been added to the experience experience ever experienced. Probably the filmmaker's next attempt may be good.
