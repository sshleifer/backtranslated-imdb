This is an image about animal cruelty. In the pursuit of a marathon race, we see images of extreme animal abuse, literally a horse in slower motion. The person who made it was spiritually thrown out of the cemetery from the burial ground to burning / burning, which is still dead and tortured to death. This is one of the unhealthy and gorgeous movies that I was annoying at. As Jean Hackman and James Coburn near the end line in their dying animals, we're supposed to admire their soul to finish the race. I want to keep producers and director in marathon race; About 20 minutes after they stop breathing, I decide when they are done.
