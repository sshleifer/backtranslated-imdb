What can I say. Kamal Haasan is terrible. He works very well, but a terrible story along with the terrible story. Directed by Goutham Menon. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the film. In addition, they do not believe how horrific crime is true. The film is not practical. Gautam escaped from the stories. But both Kamal Haasan and Jyothika are also good characters. The villains are too arrogant though their performance is bad. I thought the movie was a Sunday night afternoon, and you can see with the family. You can not sleep in seeing this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a great job, so I gave him 4 out of 4. His song 'Partha Modile Nellie' was confident and soft. Besides this, great cinematography. Overall, it's just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Haasan, who rejected this film, I think.
