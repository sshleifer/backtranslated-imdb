Suppose that's what I've done with a cult classic of jokes inside Munchies. Although it was the nature of the funniest story and characters, I thought it was awful, it was probably very good (and ridiculous). <br /> Munchies, many audiences have already suggested, there is something in the Gremlins parody. Therefore, all the instructions for the movie. The archaeological excavation begins at this time in Peru. Still up the comedian who offers any sarcasm or witty jokes at the time of the film despite his career plans, is the unpleasant dupuss of Paul, holed up with his father in the caves. His father is an unusual type of archeologist, searching caves or mummies or caves, but U.F.O. Proof of Manchis come into the picture and stay there. Hiding in a rock's shaft is an ugly small mutation, which appears as a gaiting rubber toy with a girmo voice. <br /> <br /> They call him Arnold, put him in a bag and bring him home, so that Paul's father can show proof of additional geographical life. <br /> <br /> He is idiot Paul, Arnold (a bet he made with his father, if he had lost it, it was a community college off to get a 'real' career). The creepy rug, with Cecil (television veteran Harvey Carman), seemed a surprise to his neighbors. So, he and his lazy son, some airhead hippie type (they seem to have made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go and capture Arnold. Why? Get a rich quick scheme of course. And in fact, Cecil's son is too dumb to look at Arnold. <br /> <br /> After some pokes and products at Arnold, he is more lucky. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. It's just plain terrible. I was drowned in Munich and I thought that the people who were always after them had killed Paul and his girlfriend. At least in this film is a way to get rid of all the bad performances that are joking. Not to mention the poor special effects found in hand puppets. And really bad writing all around - it's not even funny - that's not even the young cop that can really give homicide implications in your eye. As I said, the good men, if they gave the real budget and the good actors, they could get rid of the good name. Pass.
