One reason is that this story is smashy video, Nick Cage plays a sleazy way in the churches- sex plays Johnny, and the other scenes that tastes the flavor (as the scene in the laundry room) taint the image. Judge Reinhold as cuckold okay- but its themes image of degradation and revenge does not work well. Still some have seen it because it is a good movie for trivia contests.
