There is nothing - the film is terrible. I've seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchoo movies, I know the characters and it has serial origins, but it is still godliness. Nevertheless, Peter Sellers' intellect is still shining with his character Noyaland Smith, with a cheerful fa√ßade with grief, tragedy, and strengthening; It puts it similar to Van C Helsing's Peter Cushing's description, but it is tenth among all Cushkin's "Dracula" movies screen time scenes. The film may be unique if the 1960s Shangers TV program performed in a more serio-comic vein like the Bubba HO-TEP. If you're full of Phu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is what you need to look for, but it's passing to anyone.
