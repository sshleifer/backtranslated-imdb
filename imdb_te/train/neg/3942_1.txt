Oh my God, no terrible movie. All the right people involved in the film, unfortunately it is not worth looking at. I found it free in my local library. I would be more worried if I paid to see this. This movie is not worth watching. How to ride a turntino with such a slow, incomplete image. It's no surprise that it can not get much distribution, everyone involved should be ashamed. I can make a better image with dated camcorder and my big toe. Boring beyond, I really hate it. Tarantino has some standing in my eyes. This should be something unhealthy joke. Do not worry with this picture. You have to see some suggestions and kill them.
