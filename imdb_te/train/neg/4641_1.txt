I sometimes really like secular films ... occasionally people (talented people) meet with good intentions to build an image and for whatever reason it becomes a disaster. <br /> "Plan 9 from Away Space", "Manaus-Hands of Fate" and "Heaven's Gate", "Rachel's Attic", the only worst image of the decade was thought by most people, . <br /> <br /> Boy, I do not regret that decision. This film is bad ... it's bad that it is not as pleasant as the usual bad movie. Acting, filming, scripts, etc. are much worse than the low budget porno sound: the sound is totally terrible, "plot" is totally incomprehensible, "acting" is ridiculous ... it's all waste time and money. <br /> <br /> This rude nightmare has a rotten apple, and a pornographic movie with a "mad hat" tea party. <br /> The lighting does not exist. Many "sequences" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is just the same. "The author-director" (I use the words closely), David Tyber, tries to get Kinkin with slavery scenes ... But if they are not very curious, the results are ridiculous. There is some nudity, but it is such a bizarre quality that acts as a sexual repressive act. <br /> <br /> In this film, I will never go and do all the flaws and shortcomings of this awful waste. I know that this rubbish piece is really bad, even though my negative comments are (or maybe because), but I trust me in this case ... I'm worse than what I said, and you definitely, unexpectedly experience (and spending, Or rent your money if you waste).
