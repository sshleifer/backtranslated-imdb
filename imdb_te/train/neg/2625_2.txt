The film is awfully, acting, directed and produced. But it's campy so semi-watchable. <br /> <br /> The storyline (which is smaller) actually makes no sense. Barney's drum character is a true comic relief in this film and tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian supporting actors can be seen in TV commercials, none of which does not recognize anything. Clairmont is almost entirely filmed in and around the small village. (About 20 miles south of Toronto) I found several local milestones / divisions / buildings. Shortly before I was demolished, the shot of the drive was now shot on the "Oshawa Drive".
