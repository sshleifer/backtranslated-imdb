I really love "Frankenstein's Curse", and I need it to "ruin Frankenstein" and again need to cushion ... even if it was not without Christopher Lee at this time. My greatest disappointment is that this film is not only without Lee, but it totally makes it without Frankenstein's monster! Is it Lee "We can not get Lee, we will not have a monster at all"? Why do they do that? The whole thing of the monster is half the fun! The film is dedicated to Baron Frankenstein's study and his exploration of completing experiments that he initiated in brain conversion before ending in hospital. I found it very weak to deny the audience to undermine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, however, is absolutely fantastic game that is pure evil, but this film is very ridiculous. In this picture. As one of the most beloved actors and nutritious sweet men, he certainly could play very horrible menacing and nasty. The support is of skill in the cast, but there is very little, even the young physician and his fianc√©e are blocked into the help of Frankenstein. Some of the comic relief to introduce a deaf police chief and introduce him to his side, then they will be completely eliminated from the movie! Why? We led the police believe that chief baron is chief antagonist, then we believe it will be a young physician, and it ends with the victim of the brain conversion experiment of Frankenstein. There is no tension, we have not invested in "living", but only marginally unsatisfactory because they are very clear to set up another sequel. <br /> Also, there are not actually "horror" elements. Yes, there is a helmet in the beginning (off-camera), and we treat cutting off sounds of two men's skulls off (again, the camera off), and the most unsettling and completely unnecessary rape scene (90% of which, again, off-camera). I understand that I love the audience, because their imagination is worse than what we can show, but if you want to give us a monster, at least let's see some of the "horrible" things you choose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br There are a nice shots, but otherwise generate excitement, atmosphere, or suspense. This same director returned to "Kurs" in 1958 and I thought I was brilliantly directed ... Suppose I was uninterested by this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is the fourth of me from me for sure, for the powerful, nuanced performance of Peter Cushing ... beyond that, I recommend this picture is worth less. Instead, my suggestion is to look at the "Curse of Frankenstein" and see the really great Hammer horror movie.
