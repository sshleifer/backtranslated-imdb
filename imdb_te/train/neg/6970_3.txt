If it starts with a bit about the title now it's kind of a cliche, so I'll wait on that. First of all, I wonder why kids stupid things like spinning on these movie gains and breaks bottles. Then I realized that this was a message film, the message was beaten by children and that was not the case. What are the things that you ask for? Things like a huge insect monster grow and die a bit of turbulence before they die indirectly "killing the monster indirectly". Now, the promise ... blue monkey ... it's nothing blue or any kind of simeon. I scold it now like cheating or anything. There is a big bug / crab / idiot / subject before a chain of nurses chasing a picture on the cover. That happened but I wanted monkeys! I had more nights enjoyed a few nights (just before the half drunk in Cask and Creme's Brandy in mind) in the mood for a more hijack 80's style. Not so much. If you like snowboarding monkeys or blue objects, the picture is not for you. Take this rental if you have bugs and good reasons to hit the kids.
