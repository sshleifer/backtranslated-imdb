When I was seven years old, it was unclear that many moons ago watching the trailer for this movie. It appealed to my innocent feeling of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take this movie. They were adult adults, they told me "not sure! It's the worst group." In fact, I was very disappointed that the first kid in my block was "Incredible Melting Man". <br /> <br /> It took us a little longer - maybe two days. I forgot about "Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment has deteriorated. Twenty-five years have passed since my thoughts entered the front. While surfing the channels in digital cables, I found the film's long-lost relic. My curiosity piqued and I finally decided to get involved in this fruit that my parents prohibited. I have to listen to them. "Incredible Melting Man" is probably the worst movie that man has ever known. It makes films like "def-con 4", "metalstorm" and "freddy goat finger". Do not make the same mistakes made, and listen to your parents if you are banned to watch this movie. They were right.
