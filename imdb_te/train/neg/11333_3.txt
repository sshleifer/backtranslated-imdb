This movie is just the worst. Although directors claim to be part of that culture, it is still very bad direction. This thing is very interesting and in fact I agree with bad acting, they are all enthusiasts and can not pretend, but the worst thing about this film is dialogues and very unpredictable and innocent directing. There is no time in the film at all times. I thought the directors wanted to make such a film (it was their first feature), in fact the story they never said was not the story they say. I met Ben (one of the directors) in many cases and he was a nice and intelligent man, but he did not make a director. I'm completing "American History X" clocks, but somehow handles a story shipment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Uberberberre Main Lizard Film Das Experiment Das Weiss Rossen Max Manschensult .. <br /> *** For ten people, due to subject and photography
