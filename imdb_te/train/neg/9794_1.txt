I do not really have any basis for some of the Power Rangers televised programs to be remotely interesting. The dress is totally ridiculous and the people playing in them are completely foolish at the same time. There is something remotely interesting about Power Rangers. This is a high-priced television commercial designed to sell cheesy plastic garbage to unbelievable children around the world. From the notes, I have banned in New Zealand and from what I have seen, I agree with their decision. Avoid all costs this show, it's terrible and funnier.
