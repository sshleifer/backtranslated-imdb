The King Maker movie about the actual (citation needed) events that occurred during Portuguese invasion in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Even though textiles and art direction are good, this film still fails to influence the audience. Acting is very poor, especially. Some actors are trying to tear and the tones, both real and fake, are very irritating. The storyline is also very dumb and very stupid and it looks more like a history lesson. The film did not even hold reggae and centuries old air, and it appears to be a painful attempt to make the Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> Do you think the final? Costumes and Art Direction breathe fresh air for the film, but the execution was poor and the actors could not even make natural explosions. In short, the film is more like hullabalu than the script.
