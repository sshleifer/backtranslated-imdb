I started to look at a sample of movies I give a 1. Almost all the movies my wife made me see. Can he have confidence in his taste in movies? However, it is typical for Teen Teen Girls, but is much less common than normal. Once again, the author broke the cardinal regime of any film. He / she has made the main character unlikable. She starts with her friend initially being a b * tch, and she realizes she is about 30, mainly a sh * tty person (affairs etc.). Why do we feel this person f? Well, we can not get in the past. Jennifer Garner is about as attractive as you can get without some sort of variation. I do not know if it was her fault or the writer's fault, but my character is beyond my reach for frustration. Here is a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are not entertaining, they are harassing. When they dance to "Thriller", the film has got a very awkward moment. The Holy Worst is painful. It initially showed that the dance was practiced. This explains why she knows, but with the entire club all the people? Oops !!! Macarena is more reliable! Suddenly she's totally ineffective and she has no job to do her job and no one's notices? The role of Tom Hanks in "Big" is the job of at least one child. This body-exchanging / child adult overnight movies really get out of hand, and this is one of the worst ever.
