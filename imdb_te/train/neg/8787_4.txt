When I saw the TV announcement, I first heard about White Noise. I do not know it yet. I saw the trailer online and I decided to go and see it. Now a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought this was the one I wanted. It is Michael Keaton, and he is rocks. Unfortunately the film has not been released. It tried to be another sixth sense or echoes of stair, and was a failure. It has a very good start, but repeats itself in the middle and ends with a thorough twist that no single monkey can pull out. Unfortunately, most "scary" films now rely on big sounds and bangs to make the audience jump. This image may be even higher. It's a shame because it's a good idea.
