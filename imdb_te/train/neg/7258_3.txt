The graphic film follows a culture and you have to look at one of those word's features. The belief is probably difficult, but southwest is a rural community in the Arkansas, Fouke, myth is true. The story is documented in the documentary style with a commentator by Verne Steiner, and was shot in real places where people spoke to the original. The plot is changing, but in the late 60's and in the late 70s many visited the Bigfoot-like creature who traveled to the Creek Creek. This creature, which has long been a three-legged and 7-foot-long creature, has periodically caused damage, and many in the society frightened the 'Bejars'. I personally crossed the small Boggie Creek Bridge in 1974, and the hair on the back of my neck increased. In fact it is about 1 a.m. By the time I arrived at Srivastro, I was laughing.
