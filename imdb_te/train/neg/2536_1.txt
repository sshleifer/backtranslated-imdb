My wife and I finished watching Busha AKA Booth. In some parts of the film she fell asleep. I took a stroll with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is too loud and hating that it's impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, I know Regis Filibin and William Shatner sing Caraco. He also has no ransom properties. <br /> <br /> If you do not do me wrong, I love Asian horror movie, but booth is very irritating and really scary. Make everything worse. If you want some good Asian cinema, see a Tale of Two Sisters or Share the Mirror. Avoid a booth like a plague, especially if you are suffering from migraines.
