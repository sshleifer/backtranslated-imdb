I loved writing about the story, but nothing. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard-hitting dialogues from the movie but "hinglish" is only funny as 5 minutes after its overkill. I was so complimentary about the 'keeping-expecting suspense'. But it is speculative ... um mm, the image of the Yash Raj (?). I would have liked to talk about the edge of the edge of the edge, but I did not like most cartoons. <br /> <br /> The film is perfect for all: 1. People try to commit suicide - I promise to hit you on the edge. 2. Sado-masochists - The film is much more effective than the silly-worn hoard in the Da Vinci Code. 3. People looking for alternative ways to spread terrorism - leaving the hall and the audience are in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Pierce: They have more power. If the audience deserves no money to spend money to watch what movies - it is. Most plastic & green algae - almost all other organisms require a little more IQ factor than the cinema. Following the film: The film is clear, his own race. <br /> <br /> Things to do with the film: 1. Story 2. Choreographer 3. A Screenplay 4. A Stunt Coordinator 5. A Story (I Have Already Wanted ?) 6. A Director - A person who is not mentally challenged (even though he has a good job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Plague - Avoid all costs. <br /> <br /> In the case of Kareena Kapoor - English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes clear for obvious reasons. - "My heart is empty", "Chalya Chaliya Chaliya" turns "Im a flute, im boyfriend, a wa haulbund" .. Priceless. /> <br /> In short, I have Tashan, opposite a ribicle cube - the cube player wants to increase IQ, Tashan promises to lower your IQ and it's just over 2.5 hours! <br /> * Sigh *. You might be wrong.
