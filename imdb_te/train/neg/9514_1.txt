Please forgive me about these films that teach us that the crimes are fun and justified. The desire for a couple with a desire for a couple with a desire for a couple, and a group of high school pupils, completed their Dawson Creek brand teen agenda, complete with the Genkvise soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This is not even Ferris Bueller's 'Ferris Bueller' ... I see the traffic light change. <br /> <br /> Betty masked girls meet a friend with a Richard Nixon masked friend, where only one scene is anywhere near the value of the entry. It's a surreal moment. <br /> <br /> But I have a tooth for the rest. At least I can apply some benzacine (Tim) to stop pain.
