"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved films of many people. The ACS viewer was able to take a point where some of the films had been up to date. <br /> I'm awaiting (and awaiting) the sequel, "It's Runes the Family". The film was released twice and was taken at last minute. <br /> When it finally arrives, IRITF is a total failure (and I guess). <br /> <br /> Sets and cinematography are not only fine, but directing them completely, lost the mark. The film is no more than a cash flow of lazy actors, lazy writing, and disconnected acting. <br /> <br /> Jean Shepard, one of America's greatest mockers and storytellers, has made us a wrong prayer of the warm intellect used in the ACS. He was over-emulated, and I did not know why I never knew. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting on IRITF is inconsistent and forced. Actors can view the ACS, but do not register any of them with any intellect and nuance in the ACS. <br /> <br /> ACS is always a real fund, but a sequel to insult Jean Shepard and ACS fans to be called IRITF.
