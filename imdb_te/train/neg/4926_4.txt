I saw the film for 2 reasons - I liked Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men are forced to bring a beautiful dumb picture. I thought Dracula was actually a rebirth of Judas Iscariot, because he explains his disagreement over all things Christian, but most campers do not understand this idea. I really saw this film as a guide to pay his dues before truly talented Gerard Butler, and the legendary Christopher Plummer is a way to remind people (he and 5 other people in the film) that he still exists. I actually enjoyed more than the DVD on the special features on the DVD.
