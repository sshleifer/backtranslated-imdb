This film is not funny - like great stars, they will be forgotten and caught up in their own stardom. You'll come out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to almost the Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" - wearing high heels, a mink coat and a pretty hat so he belongs to John Klein as the hotel manager who likes to dress up just shining moments. Rest: Forget it!
