I have seen this movie now, no matter what time. The film is speculative and slow. It's mainly Mormon's bad news that playing basketball granting bass. Rather than watching this movie, I must have a root canal. Comedy shows are clearly sponsored by sponsorship / funding. The film is likely due to the horrific behavior of Mormons, although they show church-granted basketball, but it is rated as PG, and the true nature of entertainment is not transferred to the film. This performance is terrible, except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's performance is absolutely unnecessary.
