When people saw me after seeing this bad movie. It is not close to the MST3k level refining, or a theater midnight viewing or Disney Channel Late Night Filler. The only time I want to jump from a ride at the Disney World (or in this case Disney / MGM Studios) is to catch a jacket of Dick Tracy from toys, which breaks into pieces, and tour guides in the throat "eat this! " I've never been so frantic in the movie, "Nutty Professor II: The Clumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinematography? There is no baby here. Reviewers say "Oh, but it's also a comic book," I know the color of Gordito several weeks later in the sun. Very enjoyable about it. Beatty tells him that jumping around this landscape and talking to his watch, himself, and occasionally that other actors start shooting a sequel. To be fun, I once saw this movie, but my pain is not a man, not a god.
