Never before has this picture been done on the internet but the idea behind it is the idea behind the evil. Unfortunately it can create quite confusion in the days of the all-called-wring hands on the web in general opinion in general. From the late 90s we learned that someone could create a virus that could disable a computer. It's just enough to do anything bad by remote control with its cyber equivalent of exploitation with violence. Spam without any violence is basically what your money will be split up and it will last a long time. These days have passed and used the real names to be doing something ill with illness, using real names, looking worse for the Internet-leading to social networking sites or chat room, and this is bad and child porn sites. So the idea of ​​a film that invites people to click on the name is the same old thing - where a site is called a horror site, it kills people who enter their portals. The story is boring if it's confusing and comes to an end. The exact image on this topic that is destroyed by the Internet Service Provider is not yet made, but it requires a lot of money to be paid because it can not be closed when the money is earned. Calling this horror movie is not misleading
