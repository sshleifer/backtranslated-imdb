Amy Heckling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a simulation of the 1930s gangster films made in the Warner Bros. tradition. Michael Keaton acted as a middle aged gangster when he caught a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) continued health problems, so Keaton suffered a crime as early as age by Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargon Richard plays Demeter Boyle and Keaton to rival the offender, eventually rising through the ranks. Joe Piscopo had a hilarious turn to Danny Vermin, yes it was right, vermine! Griffin Dunne Keaton's younger brother became a lawyer, Glinis O'Connor, his wife, and Marley Henner Keaton. <br /> <br /> The film starts greatly and slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and hypocrisy, the film is owned for the first half, but it quickly loses steam and degrades to mediocrity and obscenity in the second half. Keaton bowed to his best impression of James Cognoney. Stapleton has many vulgar lines that are not just so abhorrent, funny. Piscopo "once" bit does a lot of time. Several actors try to capture the fortress, such as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuis, Street Vendor, Alan Hale, a desk Sergeant as Jr. and Sudy Bond. The second half is a hit or miss television show type tone and will never come back. Closing the scenes is a timeline to use the Gorgana Twenties, such as The Call of the Wild Clarke Gaudi film in a marquee in the movie. I thought Hickerling was better, because the target audience would certainly have to know about the actual 1939 release date of the Router Twenty. 1/2 of 4 stars.
