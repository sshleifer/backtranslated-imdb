I tried twice through this movie, the first time I succeeded - and it was like pulling teeth - and a second DVD failure despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? <br /> If you can get a dramatic court scene, it takes up much of the second half of the movie, you make it, but at the time it's hard. There are some interesting discussions made by "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. <br /> <br /> It's good story, well acting and such .... But it does not spark in the first half and does not seem daunting. Walking closes and ends up the end of the Lincoln. The viewer from hanging there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln is more interesting than the film.
