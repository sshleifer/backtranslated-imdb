I can always say something like a hit. I see or heard it, and get a good feel. I did not feel good looking at the preview. I'm not enthusiastic about the film and I'm surprised that it's rated one of the 100 worst films. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me was the title. I have a problem with ebonyx (I'm black by way), but they could use a good title for an image and use the bad grammar title at this time. I listened to the dialogue, saw acting and made all the faces I could. <br /> <br /> I also think that the dance movie background is overwhelming. At least "You Got Served" is better than my opinion. Even the soundtrack does not thrill me.
