Many brides were secretly murdered at the altar, then stolen their dead bodies on the way to the corpses. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. Prior to each ceremony she recognizes that gift, and the bride is a powerful drug that has been handed over by the rare orchid (derived from the groom). Patrickia is said to have raised Orchid first by Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a deserted estate with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for crimes, by putting the bride in a suspended state, using his gland fluid to keep his wife from being constantly young. Dr. Lorenz attempts to deceive Dr. Lorenz by Dr. Foster (Dr. Lorenz is working with a medical mystery surrounding his wife), which eventually leads Patricia into the clutches of a mad doctor. The film has a very good opening reel, but primarily with many shots and other weak scenes. The cast is good, Walters and Caffeine are well deserved, but it is life. Today, Rossael plays a role in Count Lorraine as a character with several stereotypes of Hollywood primary dannas stealing his appearance (even if one does not even consider his monograms). Weaken and end. Rating, based on B movies, 4.
