The film must be taken back from all the shops in the world. The film has a record of the most challenging film I've ever seen, with the boring, dull, unexpected characters full and having an intangible voice for every action and feeling constantly with a major character with such a disruptive attitude and dry voice. When I pay the money to own it, I have a responsibility to see it, and how I'm concerned. My head hurt terribly dull characters and their meaning, the plot across the lower lives. A group of children with zero knowledge about anything, all the chaos and everything bad, all have terrible conversations, trying to get the date of the girl in the lead role. Boring, so much my friend is shaking with hatred and red with trouble I'd thrown away Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I did not return my money back. Avoid like a plague.
