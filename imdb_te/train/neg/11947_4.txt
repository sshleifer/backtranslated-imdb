An interesting change from scratch. The film is more intuitive. You're asking yourself what happened to your killer. There are some good episodes by the film, the first half starts off slowly and then picks the pace in the last half. The film is all about happy. After 22 years after the events in the first film, Norman Betts bats out of the shelter for a motel, but when a woman claims to be her real mother, things start badly. Perkins again plays the role of an older Norman, and in the end the scene was fantastic, he was very strong.
