Even though I did not want to see it for work reasons, I was never before the first 10 minutes. And I sent the parts faster. '63 image version is very high in relation to all. Yes, I read it very confident in the original drama, but it's no wise to change the script in '63. It's tall, it's dragons, the songs in this version and the movie version are boring and unexpected. The "Kids" version in the '63 version is a very fun and surreal parent humor is a true classic. Kim is very old in this version, Conrad * looks terrible * This canad can not dance, can not (he can not even be in tune) and just repel. Elvis Presley really had before she started her career. For other actors, Alexander's Tap√©pe he danced and I waited for Dolly to be fully seen as Mamma's. See Staphton's performance in a movie version to see the same time that the person who understands comedies has to perform exactly the same role. This TV version is not a waste of anyone.
