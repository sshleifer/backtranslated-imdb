Generally, I am a pretty generous critic, but I'm very bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful shots, but they are very bad to waste this sinkhole of this movie. "Dogs" is not entirely an action movie and a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around a blank love triangle. There is no chemistry between the couples, between me and hers that there is more serious sexual feel than love, and most of the dialogue is just silly. It may be a problem with translating, but most importantly, the term "flirt" reminds me of the 8th grade, not the head on the head, but also for the valuable value of love forever; I also thought I had beat the head with air metaphor. All the audience is given less about the characters that really care about, and the overall low emotional investment. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *** <br /> Now, icing on the cake. Or rather, adding injury to the injury. The end is really one of the most fierce, ridiculous ones I've ever seen. The guys have their stunt fight and are strong and mutually talking and hacking. Oh, and it starts with snow. Incidentally. Oh, and then Me (the dog in the heart) suddenly came out of the weed. Then she throws a dagger that looks like it takes 5 minutes to reach its destination, slowing down the comfort of a small amount of blood. <br /> <br /> Well, then I guess I guess finally, because she threw the arrow in the chest and caused death. Jin sings, sobs, having her body close, the screen goes empty. I, and people around me, are doing chickling. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but ultimately failure.
