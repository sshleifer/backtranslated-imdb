Last score ... who cares - it's a reality show. <br /> <br /> "Joe Millionaire" is their most stringent fraudulent reality show, a television disaster, which does not love the audience, which is the pandas, epic ratios for lazy TV audiences. It's not just for faux, but for the American viewers who actually see it, the next day we talked about the worst. You must be ashamed of yourself. Because Fox promotes this waste because it does not make any money except for people's consideration (and ultimately it's super bowl numbers!). <br /> <br /> I have been used as a strong supporter of Fox. We like the likes of me and the ones who like the quality TV to help build fox back in the days when the kids and the Simpsons were married. Convenient enough, now that shows but 6 weeks with current management. Gail Berman "Terror rule" is often called. Network launched the war on the scripted TV and surprisingly enough, it was fans. Many people who helped build them in the beginning. Now, we have to fight for good performances, but fight on their own network. It covers the mind. Fox Nothing, what makes sense in the last 3 years. "Titus", "Futurama" and "John Doe" (NBC can restore "BoomTown", but Fox does not lift this pitiful head, they only have the only show with another shot this season). And the reason they can do all of this: waste of junk like "Junk Millionaire". They say, "We do not need TV fans, we have reality shows". They do not know that they are a big audience with this waste and they will not let the latter leave the latter. To thwart the foundation, it eventually kills the network as it re-arranges the ABC. <br /> <br /> This program is a joke. Here we have a fantasy in Classic Fox Gymic, which offers something different and experimental to us, but then offers something in any way different from anything in "Bachelor" or Big, Fox has gone into mainstream. The end and "twist" (quote / unquote) showed that their sleeve had no ideas. Now we know how different these programs are, all of them know that the same cornball, the fairy tale ends. Because we were in this competition they came to see a group of sluggish actors who pulled back from the head-strokes of the network in accordance with their demographic statistics around those like Bimboos, the high school that Ian Marriott's favorite. You have to do. Marriott himself is a mysteriously bizarre trouser-big man struggling to meet simple sentences. But not for "Joe" with "lovely" lines like "How do you look stupid"? "I think this is lazy to change the channel just for people who've seen these reality / dating / dating shows, but after" Joe Millionaire "I think they should genuinely be mentally deficient. If you come to people, you will have a little more pride. <br /> <br /> This demand a little more from your entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
