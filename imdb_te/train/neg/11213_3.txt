OK ... I watch very bad movies. I'm proud of the truth. There are several gems of B-rated bombs several times. But this film is the worst thing I've ever seen. I like a good horror film ... but it's a storyline and motion feeling. Early sequences appeared beautifully. Good music and imagery. Then there comes down the hill. One of the main characters is the disability (ringing in the Eers called tintitus). Now it will threaten his secret disclosure. They paid a lot of attention to the film. So what he can not ring in his ears and leaving an ear plug in accidentally somewhere. It is not necessary to bring it up. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in her motel she falls in the back of her head and hit. So he decides to dump the body so that everyone can learn about his affair. Now her twin sister tries to find out where she is. She finally finds herself pointing directly to the position of the body after seeing her sister (like a zombie like the devil) and over her. Now the body is recovered and she has left to face the only and suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she does not plan too much. She is the only one to be seen as a pair and a guy who is eliminating the body. Idiot did not believe that she was murdered. So all has been revealed there and even if she is a gun ... something she will manage to get her throat. So the final scenes in the film come from her "souls" and water from her twins. So the bad guy wins in the film. <br /> <br /> The good things about the movie: <br /> <br /> The bad things about the movie: music sound effects are not the length and the plot is low-grade actors
