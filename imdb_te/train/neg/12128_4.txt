If you look at half of the film's footage, you'll find a way to get this gourmet Italian cult-crop! For you to see, the notorious Dutygood Louis Fucci did not produce the film and also took the liberty to re-use the most brutal murder scenes in his own (and more easily detective) "Cat in the Brain". At the start of the scene first, in which the prostitute severely punishes an ax, in Falcie's next film and features another killings and sleaze movements. Andrey Bianchi's "Massacre" falls badly as a Gilsa, searching for a horrific killer in a horror film shooting movie motion but is all but compelling and vibrant, but you're inexpensive 'n shocky. The involuntary script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who are all potential maniacs, but the red herrings comes with none with Biachi acceptable and you can immediately point out the killer. What's really fun to do is truly the rest of the make-up effects and the ensemble cast's ridiculous awful acting performances. As with the first and second murders, "Massacre" is slow and almost impatient, with its ineffective dialogues and absolutely no obscene photography when there is no blood on the screen. Thankfully in the second half, women have fences and men get impaled on stabbing repeatedly with rusty spikes. The use of music trash and filming sites is quite unpredictable. My advice is to skip this puppy and go straight to the "cat in the brain". That "great hell" had all the great moments, and then some.
