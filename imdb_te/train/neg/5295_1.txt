It is a young man committed suicide. It's his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking many questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> The good idea is, the bad thing is done. For starters this was done before 1988 - mostly after TV movies and school specials. It's not new from some swearing and conversations (hence the PG-13 rating). The result is predictable and Reeve's efforts in acting are really painful. He's fine now but is not in 1988. Besides his character is wearing like a slab and is always difficult to build up sympathy with dirt looked <br /> <br /> That film is dull. Every scene I got and every "surprise" telegraph. <br /> <br /> When I was in the theater in 1988 I felt unsatisfied and hated it (it was in a sharp bomb). It is lousy after almost 20 years. Subject value management but countless other films have been good (with good acting). "Normal people" comes into mind. You can skip this.
