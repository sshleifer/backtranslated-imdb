Simple thriller, happened several times. The general plot is involved with Cap Lisa Russell's wife and he tries to avoid a good ol 'kurt to have her. It's fantastic, you do not even try to imagine, the theme is not a theme and no idea outside of the box. The only reason I see it is to see how it develops, but actually neither does anything interesting. Not really saying anything about this film, it's not too bad, but any good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you do when you see him in a movie. Ditto Leota. Stowe is an annoying cher-esque voice. I read the plot boundary and I could see the movie in my head, which is very clear and fundamental. I saw it and it rolled before my eyes as I guessed. I do not drop emotions across. I do not have any idea on this image, it is as if I have never seen it. This is not a beautiful nonsense movie. Still, I give 3/10 for some reason.
