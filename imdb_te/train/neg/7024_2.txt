I got this picture because the idea of ​​playing a role in its gay background was really interesting to me. I was surprised that it was shot in San Francisco when I was living near SF. And of course it's nice to see the shots of the Castro District (and Castro really offers more for gay men than male). But other than that I can not really recommend this film. The characters did not really develop for me to care and I was already frustrated by my mind when they finally started "playing the role". And the scenes I've seen are a bit awkward to see the character. Acting is anticipated. Needless to say that the movie is not closed. I will skip this.
