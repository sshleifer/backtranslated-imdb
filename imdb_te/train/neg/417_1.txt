<br /> Every week or so I read a movie and regularly check this site, but never pressed to comment on the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> A terrific over-long run alphabet spaghetti by the cast and crew - from the awful openings titles - to the disgraceful end - the number of countless classrooms in the world And the most absurd conversations and ever-presenting in the movies - this film is tedious and impressive <br /> It's not my opinion - it's my friends and everyone around us. <br /> <br /> When a large number of viewers are laughing and confused and after a serious thriller, it's clear that the film is disappointing. <br /> It is also sick. The director crossed the real fare limits for a violent film, and took the top of the B-movie to soap up the blood. The exploits of the lab and the invisible man in the outside world have been somewhat extended to two attempts to have some chest feelings because it is not difficult to imagine a sort of dirty old man. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting 'Empty man', and the rest of them - maybe For a disabled person, a bad job is to do a good job - for a disabled person who has been in a locker by a non-member of the band and "finally" he is a And the laboratory team wonders how to get the acting, shaking between full disturbance and pure difference at such speed.They are terrified of their way pad through the laboratory corridors, ensuring guns, but afterwards the crew's heart is a hart colleague's blood Off the happy off of the corridor to get off Hila is a little reaction to her breakouts with reports "he drowned in his pool last night", after he disappeared and even invisible man with good manners and good humor, and after he drowned the Pentagon chief, this kind of script Pedestrian pedestrian conversation, the rest is just AZ, thicker in the cinematic style and <br /> <br /> The 'Eureka' moment at the computer, in the window Tri clothing, looped security video - is indeed listed. Undeterred - unpredictable denial for numbers of strength, the decision not to kill two mainstream stars but just put them in place of potential upcoming death and leave them on their own devices, the lady, bomb and ubiquitous countdown tdown timer just nothing to save the good man, just fire before reaching heroes This fireball explosion, stops them before hitting them, and gets more than anything , Falling elevator, which is the immortality of the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The invisible man is scrambled with a knife with a temporary flame-thrower, with an electric-filled head, one of the lower castes directly sliced, and then the total destruction of the explosion, fireball and labs survives. Leave to climb up by fireball for the last pop - believing audience audience cringing and th Re looking watches. <br /> <br /> This spectacularly bad movie is indeed fantastic in the movie. The name of the film is also helpless, and it does not even remove the amazing effects of it, it should not be away from everything.
