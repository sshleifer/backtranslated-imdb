I first saw the film's glimpse of this film and quickly saw the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Lucy's Rachel York's character is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball is an incredible comedian with a brilliant talent. She is horrified as she plays in the film to think about the legend like Lucille Ball. I can not believe all the actresses in the world that play a very good lossy, and the producers decided to get Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles but it is very difficult to portray Lucille Ball. It's pretty hard to find someone who resembles Lucille Ball, but they could find a bit of someone at least looks and talents. If you observe Lucy's Yard character in the parts of Love Lucy, such as a chocolate factory or vitaeveminemine, it is similar to her expression, voice, or movement. <br /> <br /> It is terrible that Pony is playing Danny Dayne Arnag for all this. Pino is not eligible to play Ricky. He is small and thinner, his voice is true, and once again, his performance is unbelievable. Although Fred and Athe are not the same, they are not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, the most horrific cast and story is said to be bad. To understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, Lucy and Decie's A & E biographies saw his book from Lucille Ball, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a document, "Before Laughter" is a good choice. The cast of "Lost Before" by Lasille Ball and Desi Arnaz is much better compared to this. At least, such a thing has been shown to be nothing.
