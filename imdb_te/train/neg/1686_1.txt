Imagine asking for a date you'd like to see and you should remember watching a hidden trailer rather than "the grudge". So, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. It's Halloween season, after all. It did box office box office last weekend, so it should be very good ... so you go. <br /> <br /> When the movie is over, you are really in a state of shock, and listen to your voice as you hear it, "This is not the end of the movie .... but, alas, it is. <br /> <br /> From the movie theater Do not worry and be shy for recommending such a dog of a movie.Your date is that you feel like a bone and you advise you to indicate such grief Actually, it is very bad for the two killing the laughter we've been laughing, and I have not seen any future for Miss Geller in the movies and suggested her to stick to the television in the future, the original, she did not have a long time before the Buffy Memories sold in Flea-Market Conventions If you ask me, it will not be enough . Terrible, terrible, terrible. The plot did not make sense, continuity is terrible. The conclusion of a "Grudge II - The Return of the 'Cat-Boy" is clear that. "
