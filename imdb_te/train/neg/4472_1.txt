'A smile like yours' is a curiosity comedy. I do not know the story is complicated, but the entire plot relies on one thing: the couple's desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to abort children. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays the role of Jennifer Robertson, which is a complete contrast to anything offered by women's liberation movement. , Displaying almost any sense of independence. She is a very boring character who dreams of having a child in her mind without having anything in her mind. <br /> <br /> Like a romantic comedy of a male 50, Greg Kinner did not show any kind of personality, independence and interest to us as his submission husband. <br /> <br /> They rarely do the ridiculous things that they want to have both the most boring and often annoying characters and the many risks that can arise from the couple they can get to abortion. Other than that, they do not do anything except to get out of the money to do what they can to go to the breeding clinic and do their own privacy (except for in vitro fertilization). The plot rarely provides an opportunity for any danger, because the couple does not do anything to create any kind of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. <br /> <br /> The subplots are intended to test the confidence together with the couple, because the pair of necessary moral element of the story together will plan the pregnancy of the children. Jennifer works in a new era shop with her new friend (played by Joan Cusack), and they are in the business of development of affordock. Christopher MacDonald plays the role of an acquired buyer and Jennifer is the negotiator of a good price for her and her friend's production. <br /> <br /> Danny (kinar) is an architect who has the opportunity to make some extra money to cover. Clinical bills take a job in Seinea, where her employer cross seductus (another helpless, helpless female character), tries to influence Danny to have an affair with him and with his wife (I do not give away because of the reasons). Jill Hannes is very good in character, but her role is very imaginative, and is quite a formula as the most essential element for creating conflicts for Danny. It is stupid and rarely interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely boring, and seldom fun (save the scene and flight airplane again). The plot is really nothing to attract attention. Though the story is trying to conceive both, they have found many happy things to get out of the writers. Second, the main characters are totally boring. They are full cinematics of the 1950s comedy dumb with a happy wife and a clueless husband. <br /> <br /> Jon Cusack is in the lead role and should take a piece of kinier. Cusack also made a lousy story even worse funny (she is sometimes her co-starring role). This is definitely a pass.
