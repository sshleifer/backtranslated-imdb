<br /> <br /> The film is totally terrifying, though sometimes it's ridiculous, but this humor is not entirely unexpected. <br /> The plot is ridiculous. I do not even feel convinced by the ludicrous idiocy I tried to slap in a story by filmmakers at age 2. However, on the positive side, the horrendous plot twists offer some great humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hacktot has a huge missile hidden in his yard!" It gets worse (and even ridiculous), but I will not leave you. <br /> <br /> This acting is usually ridiculous. Children's characters are quite beautiful, but not quite believable. On the other hand, everything is pretty awful. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but this is a good thing. If they try to be believable, the picture is even worse. It's hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> When you have finished the entire film, some frustrating moments are almost annoying. Lady Hoogbottom's son's home scene was astonishingly fun, but it was a lot worse when they were caught by police. <br /> <br /> Butler's role is very small, the rays of sunlight are almost, but very dark. <br /> <br /> When I see the film, I have caused physical pain. Nevertheless, there are some ransom components that are almost as easy to see as the bleeding begins. The film, which has decided on its good parts alone, is about a 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the picture is rarely a 1. meaning. So I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> It is very beautiful, I said it.
