This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm looking forward to a cheesy picture but at least some cool car scenes / races. I got nothing. The racing scene boosted cars to make them "fast running" in the budget. In a scene, Mercedes SLR circuits revolve around just 4 seconds to reach 200 to 0. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real picture about cars, look fast and furious series. They may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this film. Let's look at the Michef 3000 better, I think the best car movie ever.
