The plot is masonry. Acting is a junior high school drama somewhere south. Cinematography is not bad but it seems to be cut with machet. I could not decide whether this was a deliberately hockey film or that the people behind it actually thought they would make a good movie. Death Valley days meets the mafire RFD. 6 gun rigs for people running in a quick-lined 'unbearable' modern town. This is more than a fair share of 'cuts' stuff. Good Guys pulling an old farm home, and Ford Mustang right in front of a highway train. Capture a clamor in a hotel looking at a clear Western (hollow) film with a Japanese sound track with a Japanese subtitles. It's really odd, but it looks better when you take a little peet. This is a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western film cliche you can think of. There is also a modern version of good heart meditation hall girl in aesthetic and a version of the Jewish harp. Really! If someone takes your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell your DVD player dead.
