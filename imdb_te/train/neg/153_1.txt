"Spielberg loves the morning smell of sentiment but the narrative is the sentiment of honesty? No one should love that." - The Lucifer Shepard <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" takes place in Deep Soul in the early 1900s, and tells the story of two African American sisters, Sally and Netty. The film starts with girls playing in purple flowers, which is immediately damaged by the shape of their stepfather. This motif ?? Innocence men interrupted <br /> <br /> The film entered the small sequences. Sally revealed that her stepfather was twice as likely to be born in a dirty warehouse, taking her newborn baby and getting married to the local widow Albert Johnson, a violent blind. <br /> These horrific scenes were given a short screen time, and instead Peeka-Duty Cinematography moments, medalgent symphonic score, smoker comedy There are too much exaggeration in camera work. The cumulative effect is a Disney cartoon and rape film, a jerking combination of aesthetics, commenting that Stanley Kubrick "The Color Purple" was concerned that he would stop it after ten minutes. Ten minutes? <br /> <br /> It is often said that the film deals with "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but this is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel based on the film, is a bisexual argument but is actually a living room in Lesbian. Her book is a Lesbian Fantasy, Women's Freedom and Self-Discovery Story, which portray women as violent breeds of women. The only way to get out of this satire is to combine with gay people, blacksmith and female independence, only for a walker. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's image, Walker's story, American legend's comfort lens. This film in which Salvival power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. Albert is a film that has found himself in a lot of ridiculous situations, with the moves of false comedy to make him look like a mask. All the characters are portrayed from racist minster programs, with men (cast with devil smile and toothpick grins), stereotypical fat mummies, jazz bands and gospel teams. <br /> <br /> These black people are a naturally acceptable child and naturally acceptable social condition. The black-eyed movie, the carnal senses are dominated by violent desires. Poverty and class issues are not entirely unseen (Albert lives in a huge house) and the blacks are totally useless. It's not Old South, "Gone With the Wind", MGM Muscalls, "Song of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Hallelu!" And Disney films were banned. In other words, it is the South who is seen on the 50th televised baby. <br /> <br /> Ishmael Reed in a black chair is compared to a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ This synthesis is in Walker's novel, but each character in Spielberg's story goes further by reconciling with their relative. <br /> <br /> We do not show anything with Walker's hate letter to blacks and Spielberg's bizarre compassion of black life Black community. We have only vague thoughts about how these characters live and how they have any understanding of how they deal with others in their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera is desperately struggling for our perspective (one of Selil's kitchen contracts appears to be in the movie "Home Alone"), when each emotion plays, the director simply passes the life to somehow observe or slightly allow. Quincy Jones's hilarious "white" music and one of the most important films in cinematic history: the feminist vessel William, who filmed a white film in the style of Disney and Griffiths. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the lack of white characters. Consider this: The men in the film are not being tied to each other, they are dominating women because they are brutal by a racist community that reduces their racism. No, they are cruel in nature. And women, quietly sorrow like Seale or her sister, are rebellious and harsh, only perseverance and survival because men are stupid to destroy them. A better picture of women's oppression in the worst is not only focused on social abuse, which has led to slavery abuse, slavery blacks doing the same tasks (compared to their male counterparts (still more traditional female characters) and African American domestic violence For financial reasons, women are themselves They and their children are in a position to samardhincaleni alone. Work here. Because Late does not respect his wife in the film, she is badly hurt and tells a character that she was imprisoned by whites. Blacks need to come back to their African origin to restore their respect, and crush them unfairly that it is their fault. That is to respect someone else in your poor minority community and you can not walk to the white culture of dominance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Sex and lebble, unsuitable music numbers, numerous Sequence Visual Piezage, Dotcompical Comic Business, Serious Music Shields and Failure to Face Hardly Emotion, Color Purple "Worthless.
