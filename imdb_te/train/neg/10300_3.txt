I'm a fan of Arti movies, but I have to report this movie to be a pride of pride. Experience with a slowdown in developing an unsupported plot based on a hopeful premise, we must say we are trying. I think I can learn something after bad movies, or enjoyed some of the factors, but there is nothing there. The premise is not unhealthy, but the movie starts and ends. Acting is OK, though the characters are boring properly. She is strongly empty for the heroine to reach such an adventurous goal. Pity. I usually enjoy unparalleled movies, but the lack of formula is not confusing with zero content.
