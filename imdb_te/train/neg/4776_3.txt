I had to write a review after reading another comment that I was the best film of Sydney Poiters. Poetier returned from a break in the film acting for just a decade and he is clearly creaky here. 11 of his films are referred to in Wikipedia and they do not include them. In his movies, there are 5 AFI Top 100 Inspirational Movies. Berenger and Poetier, Raub and City Slicker set out to hunt deadly mental illness before crossing the Canadian border. Some of the attempts at comedy in the film have been clearly failed and Berenger and Potter's bonding are very different and difficult (not fully supported by the wrist script). Kirstie Alley (captive) was almost completely ignored and completely ignored when she was on screen. Some effort is made at suspense, for example, you attempted to kill five people on a fishing trip and killer (all type-cast villains). I understand this whole appeal to most fans there. <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, sniper (1993), you can see Billy Jane Stuffing. It's great. In all I like to shoot 3/10 Kill Shoot. It's not so bad, and it's very straightforward to me.
