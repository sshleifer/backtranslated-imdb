This film still moves me to bone idea. This film is not just bad, but a bad budget and bad deal. But that's definitely all of those things. The problem with the film is that it deliberately tried to hurt the viewer and found it to be a great success. I want to know, is it a horror film? I mean, it's absolutely horrific, but horror movies should be. I was able to see the first section trying to get rid of horror and failure, but what is hell in the second section? It's just annoying. The third section is like looking at a artsy pupil image, which is amazing enough, making it the least painful discipline. This film is not low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) among the people! I know some people gave me these good reviews, but they are falling into a vanity attempt to deceive you. Trust me, it's impossible to like this movie. The only purpose of this film is the wonderful lifetime effect: After the first half of the year you seem to be watching this movie for years.
