It's not horrible for the first part: it's ("campie") light and funny entertainment. Like most sequels, the action starts immediately without any explanations. But there are breasts, so I do not complain. And there is a real boobs. I understand that this is rare in teens girls in the United States. The fact that the main actress Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen brings to my mind. <br /> <br /> The idea without first film, I compare it to this. Again there is very little wear (mainly trousers) and funny hair, which is not difficult to tell any decade of making this film. Again there is really strange characters, this time more visible "diagnosis" ones. Especially the camp's staff. It's like some mental rehab summer camp. People are old: most actors must have at least 25, but I think they are 16 or something. Some "techniques" used by Evil Dyke are very unpleasant. In fact, the film is not much closer to the first episode, and it is much worse than in every way.
