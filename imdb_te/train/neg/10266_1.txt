The first is 11/07/2004 - 10 to 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over the top rehash of the 70's expected horror flicks as Friday 13th (Reforms 1 Thru ??). I am not able to redeem many people (or can I think anything?) This story revolves around a group of stupid people listening to a radio program. Some children kill some forests, supposedly, supposedly. But one of the stupid people has connections to the original event because one of her sister's killers (again, she is still stupid in this episode). What to guess? The murderer has it again and we have missed the first (so no mystery is there). Moreover, 'cops' are not where and why they do not. I can not believe that this movie has earned money for anyone. You now feel that the American people are going to be a little bit, at least in their film experience, but not the filmmaker.
