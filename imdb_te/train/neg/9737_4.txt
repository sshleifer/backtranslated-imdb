Bjorr√© Toby Hooper exercises his ability to keep people in the fire about an unfortunate young man (Brad Durrif). This capability comes from parents who participated in nuclear experiments in the 50s. They died of spontaneous human combustion and these kittens know that his girlfriend, Lisa (Cynthia Bain), is suffering from harsh migraines. In fact, Lisa was told to deceive Sam to take the children by Liu Orlander (William Prince), the father of a very young man who raised him from the child. Sam's first "atomic man", he sees in human form as a pure killing machine. Sam never wanted this wish and silence those who are responsible for his condition. As the film moves, Sam's blood grows slowly and is red in green. Water and other substances are often opposed to the fire as it burns fire and cams of fire corms. Come find out, Lisa has Sam's condition whose parents also die from the SHC. Dr. Marsh (Jon Cipher), Sam, who has known for some time as his doctor, inserting the poisonous green fluid in their bodies, and guessing that I can raise their flares. Sam's parents' friend and colleague Nina (Melinda Dillon, her fault and light) in 50-year experiments. <br /> <br /> Former wife of Rachel (de Young) Sam, who is working with her ex-husband Lev and Marsh and is susceptible to Lisa. <br /> <br /> Very strange flame-effects. Dourif his body slowly becomes poisonous waste with his often burning fire from his orifices. We seek to take a tragic element and intensity of his character when we see its plight. This big hole in his hand spits out of the flame as a volcano and there is a huge burn spot in his hand that grows over time. Director John John Landis, who is a rare electrical engineer trying to inform Sam, is the best scenario when he radiates the radio program he is calling the radio on the night of the night. Sam does not work much because Sam is very rare with a sudden, ridiculous finale that she takes from her and free her to Lisa.
