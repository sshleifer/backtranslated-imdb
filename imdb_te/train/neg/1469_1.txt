Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, "Indian Summer" is a sleep-inspired bore. Eight pre-students are just introduced to campers, when the characters begin to begin with the beliefs of the past, believing boring past. Fine actors Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton have been thoroughly wasted. A camper's observation is "much smaller than I remember it" will be repeated at least ten times, and it is enough to appease you. Expected pranks are not funny or original, unless you think that small sheeting is real "alert". The film has a great deal of talent. "Indian Summer" I am sick and not sick. - MERK
