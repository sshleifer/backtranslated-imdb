If you ever watch the movie by Brian Evvet-Bradley and compare it to the feedback that it finds in the IMDb, you know that many of the comments and votes are fake. Trust me: you are bored! Production team write their opinion on their opinion (sometimes they also accept it). But that's not right: they constantly click on "continually" when commenting negative on the image. That's why negative critics are always behind the hippades. <br /> <br /> Film is also bad, bad, evil: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad finish. Trust me now Otherwise, you can believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Evenet-Bradley may be a very good businessman. Otherwise, he can not explain what he finds in his films. (Okay, they're cheap, though.) But as a creative figure, he's a complete failure.
