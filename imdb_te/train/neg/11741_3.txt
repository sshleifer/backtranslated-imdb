<br /> <br /> George Saunders is an amazing character actor. But he's here, basically, his philosophy and looks great as a Eighteenth Century Rogue known for great looks. His prisoner Akhim Tommyroff is for everyone. Some are French! Virginal's daughter of a wealthy family, the dark wig was Saigin Hasso. Carroll Landis fares are good. The film opens with her with silhouette. She is a soubrette, and a naughty girl at that. She disappears for a while, but becomes in an unlikely situation. But she's fine. She is always an attractive actress. Here she is close to her normal role. <br /> <br /> It is kind of a bit naughty, oh-la-la. It should have a light touch but it is a major affair from start to finish.
