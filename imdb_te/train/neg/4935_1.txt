"Caveman" has surpassed my expectations, not the best way. It's worse than I think. Mainly, the demonstration here is: an alternative race for cavemen, they face jealousy, etc. Most probably never ever created the stupidest idea; Most of the writers were jailed. The caves went into the club and tried to pick up girls to take part in a performance, and nothing else happened. It remembered a 22-minute Andy Rooney dialogue, after which steak knives were killed by midgate cannons. For those who have not seen this presentation, here is the example of the dialog: "You know very well that you are going out with a caveman." "Yes, it's fine, I have 10 thousand people!" The happiest ... perhaps the best work I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> With terrible decoration for 22 minutes, cavemen solves tough social issues ... is like an entertaining night. I also like how bad the recent thoughts are being resorted to a sitcom out of car insurance trade. I'm wondering whether Gekko will do the next, and I have a new title for the worst performance I have ever seen. I also say that I am worse than "Viva Laughlin". <br /> <br /> "Viva Laughlin" is drifting somewhat stimulated. <br /> <br /> I feel like there is a comet where demonstrations like this have been targeted to Earth. Honestly unratable ...)
