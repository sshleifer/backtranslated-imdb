A Vietnam vet decides to take with a backyard run-run Amok, and anyone who comes into his path (including women) will be eliminated. This action drama starring Chris Christopheron is Merymash wildly off-quadrilateral, thoughtless and average-enthusiastic, releasing theaters in front of "A Star Is Born" which turned his career around. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, results are made largely by director George Armitage's script with red neck clots and mindless violence. Armitage played a 70s character in the film, including Michael Vincent, the Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and Anderson in Little, Nevertheless, the center of the whole thing is Christophson, all of which is embarrassing and rude. It's a totally unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but bad vibes (and funniest climax) coat deserves to suppose for the whole project quote like an ugly stain. **** from * 1/2
