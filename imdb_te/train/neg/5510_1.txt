The film's main character, Rodney Danger, is not. He just has it. The screen time is dominated by very unlikely jokes. A running gag was named Jack Off for a role. There are lots of structural jokes that have a structure on the punch line. <br /> <br /> The film began to look like a weaker action movie: five minutes after the story Bam! Bleak jokes. But, from the terrible work, the film is also poorly directed and acting is terrible. Well, this movie makes an old bad comedy clich√© containing B-movie actors well known. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfrid, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. Although these characters were billed in the title role, people who spent more time than Rodney. Do not be surprised to find this film at a drug store selling for five bucks. There is also a lot.
