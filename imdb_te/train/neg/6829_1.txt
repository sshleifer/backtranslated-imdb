I undoubtedly wrote at least a dozen deacon reviews of this small film and no one has been published, so I think anyone in imdb.com is interested in this awful movie. It is ridiculous to produce a fighting machine again that some people can revive some oil tankers that have been built in the desert for more than a decade. So acting and directing. Pass on it.
