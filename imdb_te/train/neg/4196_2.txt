This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Not just the story, but acting is frightening. <br /> This comedy / drama / romance is rated, it's not those things! It's a small act, that's it. <br /> <br /> If you go to watch this movie, I'm sorry for you. I did not recommend this. Pretty much you look good for anything else to look at. This is a very action / action movie. The scenes of action are sucked, and the crime story is very predictable. <br /> If you're really interested in good story or good acting. And if you want to see the 'overseas' image just for appeal to be overseas. Then this may be for you.
