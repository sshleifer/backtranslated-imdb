Zodiac killer. 1 out of 10. Never worst performance. Never really worst acting. David Hess (it's not too late from the seventies .. It's pretty cool) It's a bunch of rubbish (pretty tight competition but he's awesome god awful.) To take part in a home film that has such an awkward camera presence. <br /> <br /> There is no reputable quality to destroy Shri Hass in the film. It is filmed with a home film camera and appears to be completely outdated with the attached boom mike. Any post generated. Some shovellers use a five-star computer that cleans the image. Autopsy and aircraft carrier Takeoff's bizarre stock footage images and it is a visually screwed image. The autopsy images of Italian cannons have prevented the god from interfering with the terrible real-life murders. And Navy footage some anti-war statement (we all know that we want to join the Vampire Maniacs Navy). What is the world of Lion's Gate releasing this garbage? It will have trouble with Troma. This plot is a zodiac killer (last seen in Dirty Harry, no one from the seventies is it really cool) to whom was cast in LA in the stomach and will the Cops Jody Killer come back? Uh-huh. DSM IV is not a psychiatric disorder and you do not know where a youth killer is associated with a Congress page and a member of the Congress party in the room. Yeah Eighties face haircuts and production values ​​meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up.
