Rock actor John Norman Howard (Chris Christopherson) lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) turns into an overnight singing actor. Esther's star increases, but thanks to John's degeneration, drugs and alcohol. Two o'clock, John brings in the self-destructive-high-conversion-160-mm m-desert-desert-highway. The best thing about this film is the music, especially the song, "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand plays well, but you can not take her as an up-and-coming star when you're already * a * star. Her first reappearance, singing in the back bar, is as she looks like a bad actor in the slum at night, not as a struggling guy who attempts to start a career. She is very professional, very professional. She appears to be out of her apartment "apartment living", not a hole-in-wall apartment where a real struggling singer lives. <br /> <br /> Chris Christopher himself is self-centered, like the role of the Contra Rock Star ... Well, as a singer trying to be an actor but not much acting talent. Moves in this direction, the story is slow and dull. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is not acting or laughing or slow story. It's hair! Christophson and Streisand's awful 70's of hairdos 2+ hours, have suffered your eyes.
