<br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do, and he does his best with an unbelievable character. I can see how this film looks like a script, but it's improved, and ultimately a smart one. I saw a fake death one mile away. Rene Z. tries hard with an underscore, so Patricia arquette. If I can not remember the name of Detective (which is not Chris Penn), the actor is a big sweat. You can not see it if you're not perfectly distracted between the most intuitive movies, so you can not understand it. If you like the cheesy camera work you will see it seashek. See Tim Roth's work with a gigantic script. See if it's late in the night. Otherwise, rent the usual suspicions.
