What type of sh * t? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was initially initially seen, but the prophets had super powers on their dreams, and it became a child. It should be rated PG or PG-13 rather than RP over this sh * t. I wanted to see some very mature things, but this is only 1/3 of the film. The rest of the small children. Plus much focus on Christianity. I know Freddie a monster but there are many ways to fight the demons. Why Should Christianity Be Always? It is full of Orientalism and white men / Western dominance. Do not watch this, show young children who love the Power Rangers.
