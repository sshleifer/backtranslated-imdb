I really do not want to write this review. I'm a Christian, so I'm eagerly waiting to see this film. It looks great - with a few well-known actors and a plot of Christmas film that is witty (I have not even purchased the Bible code - you can say anything you want, but I believe everything in the Bible). So I sit on my seat edge, enjoy the previews, and when the movie arrives and in minutes I will manage to ruin my mood. When I was in theater I had to cut my lips to stop commenting on the terrible writing (I'm sure, rather than clumsy but basically clumsy but basically superior scenes, tension scenes). After rolling the final credits, I was able to reflect. There are many parts of the film I liked - some uniquely unexpected plot turns, some special effects (I do not count the visions), and some interesting technical work - fades, sets, type of thing. Unfortunately, if I had read a book of a monkey and set a monkey before a typewriter to the hour, I earned a good script. And the music is beyond the cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes cheesy music in scenes in action and intrigue). I thought I would be like everyone in the theater - it's like the people who are crying and breathtaking - but I'm not a writer, throws words into the Bible shell and it slaps a Christian stamp. I need a good plot and a credible dialogue before I enjoy the movies too, and it just does not. Sorry, but I do not recommend this picture to anyone. And that tragedy. When do we see some clever Christian imagination? It should be somewhere ...
