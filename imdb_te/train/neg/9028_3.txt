I have seen this movie and I'm saying that this turkey will be there with such great campus and great talent !!! One friend gave me this film and I have seen it with an open mind, especially for giving great appreciation to the story. <br /> <br /> The film fights with Kevin Costner. Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He is thought to be the captain of the Antoine Quinn as his new pilot ... Well, never go to the coaster on an airplane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costier is a Mexican businessman and Costner goes into a Texan (James Gamon) who sells a horse to sell a horse for tags. If you do not know what happened, Gomone has been hit by death and Coaster takes him to a meeting, which is Quinn's companion! But it does not come ... Nada, Jilko! Why are they in the role of Gamon? Why do they have horse sale with Qin Associate if nothing is coming? <br /> When they leave Costner for their death, Madelin Stow's character becomes a prostitute, then she hides one of Qin's men who pay for a turn ... She cut him with her own knife, and the next thing she moved to the convent ! <br /> <br /> Many wasted talents on such a weak script and poor modification! One friend owns it and let me see it because I have seen it ... I will throw him at it for 2 hours seeing that I have ruined my life!
