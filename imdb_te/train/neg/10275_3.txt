The mantle looks fantastic and some of the acting, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rap, looks beautiful ... but this film is near unwatchable. It comes from Royalty free online site and sounds like a raging dictionary that opens the music in the lap. The vocals are far off key. I may have shot with the singing accapella and may put in the music under it ... the conversation is really stupid and unassuming. Actually, while talking about real estate, the film works best, but unfortunately it turns into stupid ferkelic sub-plot. I checked my watch for the first time after twenty minutes and thought I'd end up after 40 years.
