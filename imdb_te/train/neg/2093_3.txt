If you want to be a syfoy soap opera, I'm worried about it, it does not work for me and I can not see it after watching 3 episodes. It's a boring and slow and timeless around for a demonstration 100.000+ years ago if you depend on the timeline of Battlestar Galactica when they come to Earth they certainly have all the same things around 100.000 year old Chevy Vans driving down the streets and people looking for 100.000 years leading name brand LCD TV sets. It's also just a lot of today's stuff involved in the show, as well as the rest of the sets as well, just do not have the hobby, I think they could have done a job much better to get around these problems and yes Battlestar Galactica has some problems, but not so bad. The BSG is not as good as it is paid for the rest of the program, and it is a poor precedent.
