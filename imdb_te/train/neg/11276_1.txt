I do not waste my time writing time so long as it's hardly worse every aspect of the film. Many details have already been made, many times. The most affordable cockney battered 'platform' like wide-boy / gangster-by-numbers and was very quickly complicated. Those who pretend that they are playing some hidden masterpieces in this horror mess are just the ones themselves. It was 7 or 8 years now when I saw it in its 1 week at the cinema before I dragged it, yet it stuck in my mind for the horrible film I had ever seen. The only reason I went to see this movie was actually the fun fact that my brother Eddie Pub Schen was the second 'heavy' performance. It was his hands on a zippa light (actually originally shot at the former Bullins vacation camp in Barry Island) to the face of Ris Efen in the bar in 'Russia'. My brother definitely did not have any acting experience - he recently joined an additional 'agency and this was his first part. <br /> <br /> The whole film had about 8 people, only a few days after it was released. . So unparalleled and never heard of one other film that disappeared very fast - and rightly so. If you're thinking of renting the movie on DVD, your two-pound coins will be red-hot, and your jam in your eye sockets will eat them. This film is much less painful than watching.
