After reading many reviews, I do not know what some people are seeing, but obviously I did not see it. <br /> <br /> This film is terrible. Moore's performance is mainly terrible. The woman does not work. Nice tits, but she just can not work. At any time she did not come across in her original role. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood actress goes to the body but goes to the beach to prepare the boys. <br /> The end of the film - Hollywood-belief. The training sequences are topped. Politics - the top. Political correctness - above. Combat sequences - assuming it is, above you. Your mission is to be found and untapped. So what do you do Why shoot so many rounds and noise as much as possible, of course. Oh GI <br /> <br /> In addition to catching someone in Hollywood, the storm ends with the top gun. <br /> <br /> Nowhere else to be expected from commercial US films? I guess too much.
