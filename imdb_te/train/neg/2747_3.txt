I know it, but I have some laughs and maybe some mindless fun gave it a rental. Anyone who reads some of my reviews can see that I like it very much. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> Most of the events are completely random and suddenly <br /> <br /> I thought the studio was interfering or something The problem with the biggest problem is that it is trying to get it Grandma and mythology, everything goes so fast and quickly passes through.I feel like I've hit a million plot and action sequences in a bigger ball, like a punch in the face of the movie, which does not take much time to establish the characters or the play. Of the Rings "trilogy ?? You are the legendary warrior There are a lot of reports but there is absolutely no increase and you rarely ignore the outcome of the wars that are in the case of Dragon Wars. <br /> <br /> What are the amazing CGI, but terrible acting, fast pacing and mute stories in some okay direction Have worked hard to enjoy. . I enjoyed it at the age of 6.
