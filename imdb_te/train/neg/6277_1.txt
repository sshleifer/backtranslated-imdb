This movie tries hard. If your horror film is going to give you a reason to believe in attracting at least the viewer. <br /> You can wait and wait for the image you are looking for for some grand explanation. Instead it tries not to reveal the most intelligent ending and anything. <br /> What is this movie? Is it actually going? And more importantly what hell is going on. . . <br /> Why are they there and how is it related? Another weak science fiction horror. I like IMDb duplicate reviews, how good it is through relevant press releases (cinemas or people have less horizons). <br /> I'm not saying this film is much better than gentle, but at least giving reason and why and what's the final result. This is missing and it is waffle with tons of padding to just feel the reactions. This image is less than stranger calls. Very dull god. <br /> If you make your adult horror, it is reliable in logic and explain what is happening to the viewer, so they have a hook in your story. No organization can hold and nothing can be scary if there is no logic or credibility. Being disrespectful to actors or staff, they do a good job. It's just poor writing.
