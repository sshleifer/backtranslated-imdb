No terrible, terrible, cinematic! One of the worst films I have seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, the whole "A man meets an extraordinary woman he likes, but he is already in contact with anyone who is right for him ....". I guess I was imaginable and I did not care. Movies are always fun mixing romance with the right amount of comedy, but this is not it! Every joke comes flat and "romance" makes me want to vomit. The title role I've ever seen on my television is one of the "kill me" characters, "unusual lady" is not so strange, more like agility and annoying. The "other person" is the most reasonable and mature person in the film, but it is also uncomfortable. These movies are flat, do not waste your time, there's no way around it.
