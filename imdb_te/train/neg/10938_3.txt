I did not expect this going too much, but still got disappointed. This is my least favorite hostest product I've ever seen. I thought it was comedy, but I was only 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see fat man eating donuts and falling over and down? What's with a guard in Heaven Scene? Fred Willard was happy with his Christopher guest cohorts, but it did not work. Since they have no lighting budget, the "knowable" actors have spent all the budget appearing in this regard. It was filmed with a video camera, and it seemed that most of the scenes were very dark. Would it take too much to show a basket when someone really shoots it against hitting and editing the ball in a basket? I try not to be too complicated for low budget comics, but if you want to see something funny this film instead go to a true church basketball game.
