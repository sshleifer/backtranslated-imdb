This is bad. It's a bad and boring criminal film that is not normal. A whole series of criminals you have not seen throughout classic investigations. And there's a classic story about a policeman who's going to be and what's going on, so he has to fight himself to reveal the truth. Not much in this case. Vote: 10 to 4.
