OK We all love Daisy Dukes, but this is what happens with the cast. Start Jessica Simpson as Daisy, this girl is not a daisy, not Daisy! Uncle Jesse was probably similar to the original. Burt does not have a crime, but I never notice Bass Hogg such a tall. It is part of Boss Hoag's comedy his size. Did they even try as Danny DeVito ?? OK, now will they see Jessica Simpson at her husband? He will be joined by Luke Deux with Luke Deux !!!!!! These producers do not have the clearest view of the old cast members. There is never a screen of the screen t! The film was initially a turning point. I give this huge thumbs down.
