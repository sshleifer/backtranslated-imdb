Savage Island (2003) is a sinking film. This is a video shot with very low lighting and horrid acting home. The storyline and the script are not damaged. I do not know why this film was made. I have seen many movies in my times and I am really angry with what I hate. This made my blood. The conditions are not good. If I did such a film it would have been smaller. That's actually because the backwood "idjits" is not in the picture. <br /> Do not be fooled by covering. I would be keen on the bad movie. But this film is not actually visible. Movies D.V. <br /> <br /> "I do not need to recommend this disk waste. <br /> <br /> You really get angry movies with automatic 1.
