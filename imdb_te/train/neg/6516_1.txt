.... a dozen well-rendered images. <br /> <br /> "Dates" is a mockumentary, but I'm not sure Miles Berkowitz's intention was when he started. My opinion is that he has started the semi-intensive project, then quickly realized that it was not curiosity and funny unless the circumstances were made more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing has an uncomfortable, cheap and impatient feel about it. <br /> As someone has said intelligently, the film has two "dates" and has issued compulsory orders on the Miles, and they appear in the film, which makes it impossible to have a consent form. It also appears to me that the majority of women who look like "Dates" are professional actresses (except alba not famous, except Tina Carrar) - they are very clear before the beautiful, polished, thin and comfortable camera <br /> <br /> Mr. Berkowitz makes this classic lesson that is not only a very thin actress, but more ridiculous and ridiculous (perhaps in a mockumentary), without using loyal women. He is probably skeptical of his real world problem, and both the film character and Miles Berkowitz are also active enthusiasts (his real life IMDb credits are not actually present, except for the film). Even in the film world, his ex-wife has divorced him without ever having a job. I think the viewer is eating a fancy car driving and pricey, he deserves a description of a luxury apartment in the US, in a luxury apartment, one of the most expensive urban environments in the US. He did not see the restaurants when he had no source of income. (Do he want a drug dealer? Should his great parents live? There is no basis!) <br /> If you are jokingly fun, you can stay away from the movie. "20 Dates" is aching, pesky UN-funny. <b> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <a href="http://directory.blogspot.com/ It is not very surprising to discover that there is no credit product. My inspiration tells me that the film is not funded by "Ely" (a gangster money man who looks on the camera), but that Mr Burkovitz's wealthy parents may be more likely or indicate the surprising abuse of credit cards. Whatever it is, we can easily relax as no one can see any of our Miles Berkowitz or his creative efforts. Hellelia !!!
