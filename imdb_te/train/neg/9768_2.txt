When I first popped up in Happy Birthday, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was amazed at length. Both animated and horror films share a common field: the selected audience should be within 90 minutes of attention. <br /> This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes maximum time, is a big problem for me. I'd like to be half editing in this movie, but I'll say it's so generous. <br /> <br /> The film was very low regardless of the continuous tour. It spent the time trying to be the biggest mystery in "Elite 10" that killed eight other friends. For the most part, they will not only do it, but they say zoom on a face and say pretty much "This guy is it! No! These galons!" In fact, the camera spends most of the time to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> "Well, I started it. Melissa Sue Anderson was laughing at the beginning to remember that Praise (later, my suspicion of research) played the role that Little House Blind went through because the film was all blind, she was genuinely blind. Strange, a settled actress, was the best in her group, but it turned out to be worse. <br /> <br /> The film begins with ten friends, and one is killed immediately. App. Only nobody feels twice in disappearing this "beloved" friend, so they continue on their merry way. Slowly, more rapidly, Virginia's (Anderson), the main character, has revealed about her psychologist, more and more of her tack bit more personal (and call 24/7, obviously) more sagging. <br /> <br /> "The first disappearance", the funniest "best buddies" waned, and the rest of the remaining care. Sure, they say, "Wow, (that guy) just give a few seconds air time to say" not run off ", but then they're back in their sexual routes.And this is probably because of the terrible script, or maybe it's losing interest for a minute I did, but they seemed to be the sexual partners of all the group they did not know with the likes <br /> <br /> If you have a mouse / rat creepy person in his pocket, literally ?? and the most obvious suspect. I know the credit (and time), but the part of "Elite 10." Why are these children targeted? Why the trailer and poster claim these killings "You'll ever see the most bizarre killings six?" Hell also appeared in the first two Friday 13th films in 1981 ? Incidentally, Friday 13th Part 2 was released for 2 days until Happy Birthday. <br /> When "Secrets" is revealed, trust me and you will need to rewind. -4x to actually get rid of ridiculous and incoherent motives, and since then, keep subtitle to get all mumbling victim / killer words. Even if you get it for the first time, it's an unreliable and outrageous ending. <br /> <br /> Watching the whole movie is almost as valuable as a drinking alcohol game. <br /> Do not use this birthday collection. Is it a horrible and supernatural first draft script ?? Please, please be aware that before rendering the cameras, you can take several retransactions, seriously acting or acting seriously, and how people respond in unusual situations is 100% irrelevant. <br /> Side note: A kid, or 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (Still, exceptional flawed pleasures, but it's harder and harder to see when years have passed). We got our first VCR and I have recorded many horror films from the network (or, revised versions) from TV. Remembering my Happy Birthday to Me The last 10 minutes on the tape is getting worse with me for death? And the big secret of who the killer is. Although I saw other clips of this film, this was the first full-length view I had. Fortunately, this awful movie was not hurt me as a child. I'm older now, and I can take this garbage. <br /> <br /> "I guess, this film (or last one) Minutes) In my childhood, Melissa Sue Anderson!
