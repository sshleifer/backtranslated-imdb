Townsy is a sensitive film I have ever seen, and I've seen Blair Witch movies (one and two episodes). It's confusing what it will be. It's not funny enough for humor, it's not sad enough for drama, it's not enough bloody for horror, and it's not good enough for watching it. I think it's doing a "slapstick / bloody" karate of a man's scenes, oh this film is in the vein of toxic avenger and street trash. A missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman and a reliable mother jumped without warning into a play about it. It was then that only a good role was played in this film, which appears to be set up as sitcom without laughter. The part I spoke was lonely single, he was alone, he was comforted in a rotten corpse. This is only part of the picture that made me feel. The rest of my life is a waist. Then, to show how to show how the documentary at the end of Cruel Wayne Wave (the director) film of the film Toby (star). This made me sick. The killer nird and the bride of the killer goddess (two other movies by Wayne) are not the best, but they will make you entertained until the end credits are completed. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like underground movies, if you want to see your feet, just go to <br /> *************** ************************************************** **************************
