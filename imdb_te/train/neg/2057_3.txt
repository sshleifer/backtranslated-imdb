Sorry to go against the flow but I was unrealistic with this film, the boring and the longest way. I was tired of looking at the long-standing struggling Jenna Rowlands with the turmoil she and her facing. Perhaps the film is represented as an important step in the cinematic value of the film or the director, but I would like to stay away from the pure entertainment value.
