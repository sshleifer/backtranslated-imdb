The Spice Girls remembered the film and made the same mistake by the S club (one of my favorite bands) in their own film, rather than the songs (besides their songs) their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band). S club: Tin Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Minkintosh, Joe Omera, Hannah Sparritt and Rachel Stevens (What happened to Seventh member Paul Katermolm?) Primarily asked for their owner's break, see themselves on TV! Three of them are swapped, and vice versa, half of them are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just get in trouble themselves. Gareth Gates is a clone himself. The film may have more plots than the Spice Girls movie, but the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True". Not long after the band split up for good. Not enough!
