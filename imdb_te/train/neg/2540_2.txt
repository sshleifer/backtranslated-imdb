I thought I saw this film twice. I read all the other reviews, and they do not match too much. One man and three teenagers, two girls and boys are going to go to town and face charges. Although I still have differences in reviews, I feel pretty good in the movie I've seen. I'm looking back at my review: If you ever want to make a 'B' film, go back to the bogey crek, just as I do! It's a sleep timer, hanging on your favorite movie-bomb or hanging with friends. Bogey creek, mute button, and you've got a pleasant night of improv. Look! Legend is real? I think we'll find ourselves in an unstoppable star cast. Which instrumentalities do not exist in the particular movements of the film? Our blonde, manly, young hero has any chest hair? Do you want to finish the entire film with the exception of high-tech technicolor? You have to watch for yourself.
