I can not remember why in my life - I should have a free ticket or something - but when I was released I saw this movie in the theater. I did not recognize the people I went to, even the theater or the city I had. I was worried to see someone in this movie shoot in the movie, and half of the people in the theater came out before the movie was taken. Unfortunately I have finished it so far, so far I have considered one of the most deadly mistakes in my life. Smith's ghost child backs out of his signature before unfolding credits and "Look for the Child 2 Problem Soon!" My crime has become a pure scary. <br /> When I remembered correctly, the plot, John Ritter and perhaps his wife (Lord, from my mind to the movie) follows the "problem child". Perhaps they think he can reform him. I'm not really sure. If they intend, they will fail because they come to the big screen, the bigger, the most horrible ghost-span of this child from the first frame. Forget Damian, forget Rosemary's Baby. This kid takes the cake. The only difference is, he's a problem because we feel sorry for him "child." However, this is impossible since this child has played a very unlikely role. You'd want to kill him through the whole movie, and (like Spiller, someone asked) John Ritter "You're the second film I gave" I "to IMDb. John Ritter had a quote in the TV Guide, the Child 3 that he was about to die at that time. "My body is back <br /> <br /> I see a 24-hour marathon of the Police Academy sequel rather than watching a twenty minute problem as a child. 1/10 I can not give a negative score, This is what really deserves. Anyone eaten the original disadvantages of this film, please!
