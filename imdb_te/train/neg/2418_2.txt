The first mistake you actually made in naming a film is to use the "Living Dead" without a budget for the real-life FX. Sure, this low budget zombie movie - really low budget. I thought it was a movie project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It did not take into account the above, it provided an interesting twist for a zombie generation. If you are going to have "R" for violence, you can give us some good shots that are attacking children. <br /> <br /> In this movie, women are used very little and can be classified as homophobic. <br /> I'm from Oakland. There's so much heck on the shooting going and there's no cops in sight!
