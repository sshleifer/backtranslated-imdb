Lulu (Louis Brooks) is a typist while she does not have anything in her life. Miss France enters the competition against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlie) and her success. She sets off for Miss Europe title leaving behind her boyfriend. She succeeded again but he returned to Andrei's home and asked her. Once again together, one night she leaves her to feel reputation looking for Miss Europe to write her a note so that her life will again be laughed again. <br /> <br /> This film is silent with the piano music track. It also looks faster so everything is speed-up. The Limited Dialog is added later and it is very fraudulent. Remember that the cast is a silent film. The best part of the film comes to the end but the story is very small. After watching this, I'm not sure what the big deal is over the looks of Louis Brooks - it's a terrible haircut that makes her face fat look. I do not need to look again.
