The film has a very small class compared to strangers or offensive meeting on the train, and I can not really compare the plot similarities with both of them. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy many lifetime movies, but I'm stressed to see each and every now and then. Interested in promoting harmony at home. I am often out of silence but this film has loudly protested, leaving the room and running around the house, before I go back to the chair where I love my, and I was more tormented. <br />> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
