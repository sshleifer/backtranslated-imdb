Although "Exorcist II: The Harriet" of 1977 does not help him, it is difficult to imagine that Richard Burton was seen in the combination of non-exercise thrillers. As you have already seen: Burton plays the role of a writer who has the power to move dead objects through the power of his mind at a young age (and you do not have the effect of "Carrie" Hollywood!). Although the novel has been taken by Peter van Greenaway, "Medusa" is similar to recycled materials, with special effects at the catechild end are exceptional (typical). Lee Remix is ​​somewhat a physician, although the supporting cast is very weak. Burton is tired of hammy ... telacisis can not save him at this time. **** from * 1/2
