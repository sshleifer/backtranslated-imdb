Most people who are afraid of the dentist, letts, little monsters or scary looking toys. <br /> <br /> For horror film it makes a perfect point. <br /> Fineston (Corbin Burnsen) is a successful dentist for many years now, but he cheated his wife on him, he suffers, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work. <br /> As I said, you should not think of intelligent thinking but deliver it. The ending is especially big. Finally note: you can see for mark Ruffalo (you can count on yourself, Eternal Sunshine ...) <br /> <br /> 5/10.
