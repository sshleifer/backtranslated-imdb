When I was young, I was frightened of hell. Now I'm more fun than scary, but with a very nice moody moves and a kind of good quality that I like. And, come to think, the plot is actually frustrating ... but it's kind of flavored. If there is a problem in the film, it has magnificent spaces or huge spaces that are interesting. Furthermore, the perpetuity will only be permanent, and the climax appears to be tightened after a long time with Barbara Bach thrown and thrown. "Monster", which, after revealing, is unfortunately not very scary. The theater's some brown look also work on it, making it a TV-movie rather than the theater. But it's rarely an example of the images taken these days. Hence the horror fans look and feel a bit nostalgic ...
