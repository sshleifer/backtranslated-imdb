Well, the F * ck rules in this movie. It is one of the most technically vulnerable films ever made. Definitely terrible, but you see it as GOTTA. Rent this with your buddies and come up with a drink game or enjoy, it is hilarious. And proof it proves behind the scenes, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint. Awesome. Okay, rent this scene: two characters actually move in PLACE for about 3 minutes in a shot. Director (on the commentary) "Yes, they think the tracking is very soft ...". Yes, the right man, they walk in full place. It's funny.
