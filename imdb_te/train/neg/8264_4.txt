Brigitte Baco and Eric Palladino, all in all three of the actors, meet in a film that fights the situation in the movement to move the story. In other words, they seem to have shot the movie scenes rather than realistic life. Even though women working in peep parlors have never gone to one of their customers, it does not look as realistic as it is written in the film. Moreover, when one of the characters encounters an overweight woman in the film, it is artificial and seems to be seen in every other second after they argue. Again, the actors are good, and the movements of the film are fine, but reuse the product before producing another indie product.
