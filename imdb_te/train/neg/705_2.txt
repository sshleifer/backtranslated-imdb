Anne Rice's book there is no point here. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - do not come to the screen, and those who do so have the water to point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> The relationship between Christoph and Marcel? Where is the persistent affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why her story is never explained, because why does Dolly Rose seem to be everything? Where is Mary's rape and emancipation, its great feature (and fall) can go for white - she's married to Richard? Why does the film end when Marcel hits his father? She did not learn anything more than a misfortune that she hates her husband; Why does the protagonist describe this hatred? <br /> For performances, it is not better than mediocre, but it may be due to lousy script. Richard is very good for an actor playing - but Richard does not fit in to protect this image. <br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy, like Dal√≠ Rose, is worse though, the actress does not relate to her what works for her. <br /> This is terrible. I thought it would be impossible to get worse than the rice book turned movie, but all sorts of things would make it harder to hit the mess. How does Rice have such a slut? Will she allow her best deeds to become such a junk on the screen?
