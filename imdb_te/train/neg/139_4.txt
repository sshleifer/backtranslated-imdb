This movie is being rented by a friend. Her choice is generally good. I read the first cover and was expecting a good picture. <br /> <br /> The horror movie. I do not like it. But when watching the film, there is no horror idea. <br /> <br /> It's not a lovely movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> But it is. We (four of us) <br /> <br /> We're disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> Just judge yourself.
