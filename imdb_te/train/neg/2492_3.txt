I think I've seen the worst pictures, so I'm giving this 3, but a fight to remember what they are! Maybe Xtro (nasty & cynical) or perhaps creep (just plain dull), but it's a fight to think something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's cast Jean Claude Van Damme of the poor man, saying it's a poor man's under-siege. Casper Van Dean is the only unique feature I have ever seen - I always wondered what happened to him after the Starship Troopers. <br /> <br /> The TV movie hello is stuck to judge from this site .... Casper is more unique .... Please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhh, I have just turned and turned out to be a good movie that is a criminal law ...... Now I'm starting to get really angry about the last 1.5hrs !!!
