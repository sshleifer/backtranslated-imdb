Tyr. Just terrible. The script is acting, painful acting, and the story just drags. It is, without a doubt, celebrated Sally Potter and a little celebration. It is not so bad, but she is the star, director and star of the film, and just self-fame. I could not find myself talking about the growing romance between the two main characters, the momentum did not get a moment soon. It has two ransom features. The first shots are very lovely in Paris, especially in Paris, and look rather good in black and white. Secondly, if you're a fan of Tango, the music and the bigger, the wonderful (except for Sally singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you have to unwittingly laugh. I know this is a request. Statistically, it is.
