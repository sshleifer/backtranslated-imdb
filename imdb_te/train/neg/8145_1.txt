This image is very bad, and I can not believe that it's really shot. People who voted for 10 or 9, 8 and 7 are you mad? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (there is a story there?) Somewhere, totally irrelevant, acting (some conversations are just ridiculous), music score (what's it ****?), Editing and especially artistic direction, a pure disaster. Recalling old Maskist movies ... give you an example of the enthusiasm of the product, the mermaid's costume is a sleek bag with stigles on it. <br /> <br /> Here is another example of the enormous mistakes we found: a 200-pound fat woman, a cell phone, looking at a scene. The next shot in a completely different position, you can see the same woman, she still speaks on her cell phone (!) Yes, it goes a long way. <br /> <br /> The money is big, heavy, waste. Overturned.
