I actually had so much hopes going into this film, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hope for the best. About 1/3 through the film I just had to give up, quite simply the image is a mish-mash of stuff going on for obvious reason and it is all disconnected. <br /> <br /> This is the way I love movies as you think, but this film is just a group of ideas thrown together and really not connected. <br /> <br /> Do you think David is Lynch-Esquire? Unlike some tropical visuals, there is nowhere close to that field. Saying this is a kalyan to hide the truth, there is no hero or story. Acting is good, but it's not a story. I agree with a comment that I posted earlier ... "It's some other person's head ... when they are on drugs," other words do not mean anything.
