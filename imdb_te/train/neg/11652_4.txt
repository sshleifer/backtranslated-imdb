The script is not just ready for "Scary Movie 2". This is a problem with the film that looks obscure to the actors and audiences. Director Keenan Ivory Weines, and many actors are funny people; And the film is not entirely ridiculous. For their credit, the film has many funny moments. But altogether, "Scary Movie 2" is not as intuitive as it is intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> The first "scary movie" is a laugh image. It turned small smoother in the slasher image style into comedy gold. Humor in "Scary Movie 2" is a huge hand because it is original. They also lose clear possibilities for parody. Two of the movie stars are the former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210" and it is a show full of pyodox! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" is a very open wine bottle. Script age requires too much time. 5 out of 5 stars.
