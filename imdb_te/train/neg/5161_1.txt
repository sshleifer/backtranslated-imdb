My life is about saving animals. I volunteer to work with a cat rescue company. I am vegetarian because I can not even kill the animal to save my life. I can not even kill a spider, so I put it outside. When the child died, I was sick and chased me away from participating in trying to accept other children. I believe that it is the curiosity of those who need human beings. The end - adoptive parents early - does not redefine the depiction of animal cruelty. Who would you like to see their child?
