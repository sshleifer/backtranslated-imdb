I'm sick and tired of these little weenies going on about how this film rocked "rocked". It's a CAP featuring pure CG! Do not send Assassin, it's very clever to steal hundreds of dark colors, aggressive, and poisonous snakes on a plane! Because people like this film feel like they only have. It's "Very Good" It's not too bad, then I'll move again and then move the eye with a sharp stick. Honestly thought is going to be COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A spoof! I'm wrong. It's the whole "It's sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A Jackson, "sorry about the snakes!" Sorry, I can not get it. It looks like you have given more money to the movie industry to make more movies like Wymel X and Die Hard .. You see a film in the company of the same people that bought William Hing's CD If the money is spent, still live in their mommies basement, and online Ask the rhythm of thriller and ask for a ticket for snakes in a stupid-butt plate (I think you're a girlfriend), full metal jacket, pulp fiction, True romance, 12 Monkeys, Clarks, etc. The true degeneration of Western civilization to hell. This is Sanskrit The film is insulting true cult classics like the Repo Man or Argazmo. Here I say enough.
