Chaos, opacity, bad screenplay, poor photography, and direction ... The first attempt to commercially visualize the good people at TBN is all the more obvious. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures "China Cry" has succeeded in helping to bring the story to the big screen. But the "Omega Code" is an unfortunate mixture. As a Christian who loves TBN and its programs a lot and "China Cry", I have found it impossible to recommend this film to anybody yet. They do their best in their ministry, but this is not an example. Do not waste your money ... go to "China Cry" instead.
