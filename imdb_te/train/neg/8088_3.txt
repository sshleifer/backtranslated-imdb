In order to make a good image you will need an amazing actors or a wonderful director. You need at least one of two. <br /> I also remember the name of the director. He should not have done much in his career. I'm very much like Donald Sutherland, but he certainly should not be the main actor in the film. He falls short. Sutherland is magnificent when he appears more than 15 minutes. Sutherland had an excellent ability at Oliver Stone in JFK when he spoke to Kevin Costner on a bench of a park. Wonderful. But Sutherland is not a good actor. <br /> <br /> Kate Nellgaon? She's probably fine for the TV series. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follet story is good but it has become an unpleasant movie.
