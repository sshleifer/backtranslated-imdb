Do you think someone has betrayed me like I did? The first hour or the last one is pretty solid. Oh god. It's supposed to be an imaginary and cheesy. The massive and epic performance is not the whole display. Many reviews have been read but I can not really understand why. But I thought it was because the general end was WAY before I seriously thought it was withdrawn because "no, they would never do that, it's pretty dull." I rarely can not stand. I am dissatisfied. I feel like going out of the door to sell every season I own. Someone please. I change my mind. I like this. Bad. Some people tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible end.
