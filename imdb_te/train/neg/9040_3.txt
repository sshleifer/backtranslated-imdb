Although I'm not exactly right with Melville, this is not even reliable. The story moves the intent and nature of the original story to move to the 20th century; Maybe you can move it to England, but it should be of late. Our storyteller - the owner - which in retrospect, goes somewhere around 1800. At the end of the 19th century, a strangely unrepentant worker is ignored without thinking. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a perfectly deleted break !!! By the 1800s, such behavior was not well-worked, and such behavior was not working well. And the end of the film? I do not know what happened because I did not see the total mockery - I had to stop. This is like Elizabeth creating "Streetcar Named Desire" in England.
