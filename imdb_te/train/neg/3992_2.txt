Directors Spike Lee is known for highlighting the racism of the films. In most films, such as "Do the Right Thing", there are more ruthless racists among white people. In this film, the issue of interracial marriage, racism is once again the whole issue. <br /> <br /> Lee demonstrates his disagreement with Christianity. This is excellent for double standards in the film world. If Lee or others had previously created this bias against another group, he would be slander, but Christians? <br /> <br /> Ozzy Davis, an honorable man in the film, shoots his son and then puts a smoldering gun on his Bible. If you miss it for another closeup then it will zoom. Hi, folks, another Bible reader and see how he is! <br /> When dealing with ethnic relations he shows the same hate. Who would argue about racism as a bad thing? However, Lee will remain permanently in his other films. Does not help the bitter condition of the white people. It just increases the fuel to the fire. <br /> Hey, Spike: Start the "right thing" and leave your abusive chamber in the room. <br /> <br /> If it is aimed at intent and intelligence, it is very bad that you can make the subject a thought-provoking movie.
