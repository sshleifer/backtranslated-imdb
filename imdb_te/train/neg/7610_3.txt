Normally I do not like the films directed by Sydney Pollock ("Firm" somewhat of an exception) and I have never been a Robert Redford fan forever. <br /> <br /> Widescreen Cinematography is very pleasing to the eye and although Max Van Sido is a good, "Kondar's Three Days" job as a bad professional killer, I found the whole affair amazingly frustrating. The film emits the irrevocable paranoid atmosphere, but does not seem to be anything. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most unsatisfying conclusions I have ever seen. Viewer hanging in the air. What about the absurd romance between Redford and Dunway? I have seen many times in Hitchcock's pictures five times.
