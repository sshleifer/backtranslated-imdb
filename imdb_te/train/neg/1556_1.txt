I'm China in this movie. Since I have modeled in Italy, I have selected Screen Shiba Alahani and they have not been able to correctly pronounce my real name, so I added Alani to the liking of Sheba. <br /> I did not act before (and it shows), but the movie is very fun. They gave me "acting lessons" each day (which was clearly not helpful). <br /> <br /> David and Peter are an explosion of good humor and jokes. The film did not intend to take seriously, it was written on the basis of the information. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
