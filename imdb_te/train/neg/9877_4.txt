Fantastic Mister Fox Classic based on the book Roald Dahl. Directed by Wes Anderson, he takes a small book with the same name as the full screen name of the full name. Anderson, I respect what a very talented person has done, and the film seems to have lost its own brilliant spirit. Anderson seems to have learned that this story is a talented man, and if it is a bad movie, this is his first bad movie. When you go to school and on your first bad day, Anderson's first bad day movie is in the making, so I'll leave him easily. I agree that it's smarter and nice, and the animation is good, but the movie goes into the story and becomes more difficult to have random shots of random things. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman is the smart donkey son of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash and drowned exclusively. The film reaches a very horrible level, but it definitely goes closer and closer. I'm sure Wes Anderson will re-track another wonderful movie, when and where to decide another movie, but now, sorry, Wess Anderson, your film is a big disappointment.
