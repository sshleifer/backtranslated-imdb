I went to see this a few days ago, and I forgot the film ... for the wrong reasons. Not a smile in the theater (perhaps Jossey Garcia and Gerard D'Pardyu) is not, it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what they say. They speak fast and they are not enough to understand us. I was a friend and was 4 or 5 times more funny than what I said, "no, what did he say", and I was a French saying after a line. <br /> <br /> I think that good films are being made here, but I apologize for all foreigners who see the film (if they are shown outside the foreigners). Sorry for the CR @ p. 2/10
