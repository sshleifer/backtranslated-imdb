I actually sat and saw. I love the independent movies, horror films and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add Ninggas, you crossed one line that you never let go. I hope people in this movie have earned a great deal of time, then at least not a whole waste. But you never know this by looking at it. Script? You're funny. Acting? I also feel faking the trees. Cinematography? Well, there should be a camera. Period. I do not think there is any original plan involved in the film production. The amount of time I have not extended by more commenting is such waste.
