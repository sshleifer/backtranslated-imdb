Never before had a movie run to write a review for me but this was just as horrible as the snoop chose his first serious role but frankly trying to find out what's about this film it chooses a poor choice. He did a good book but it certainly did not work for me for the movie. I could not believe it, it was not atmospheric, and I found that the scenes were a lot worse. A musician is a actor but he is an actor. Dylan mcdermott and pink byrne passable but weak dialogue is not enough to carry a weak plot. Maybe I missed the point completely but it did not fit in any genre, it did not get any empathy or created any suspense, in fact I found myself praying for the end and wanted to kill three of the main characters in deep quelling!
