I recently purchased the DVD, and I hated the version of "A Chorus Line". <br /> <br /> The director-cassie relationship is very prominent, and the whole concert of the entire concert to the window. </ P> <p> Some musical numbers were moved and moved. <br /> <br /> The whole staging is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> Because I am a 2, some of the greatest numbers still enjoy the film despite the effort of the film that made everything come out of happiness and stamina.
