<br /> <br /> "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" appeared a bold, radically new direction in Disney animation a few years ago. However, it comes one year after the innovative and almost intelligent intellectual of "Emperors New Groove", which represents Disney a step towards separating Disney from the Disney Formula. I'm a big fan of feature length Disney animated films. You should see them all love or hate them. "Atlantis" is an animated throwback to "20,000 leagues under the sea" and live-action sci-fi adventure in the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version has hardly an original idea. It seems to be a remake than the original Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). Characters are usually more of these types of paintings (Odduble Mechanic, Gong Ho General, Sassy tough women) than a general trend of densely populated dinosaurs. The casting of Milo Thach (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) Beyond is a vulnerable cast. The film is suffering from a brief pace. Instead of fleshing into a legendary story, Disney jams are normally brushing over most development chances while running briefly ... suspense, letters, really anything. They thow us into this new and fantastic world and let just get in our ring. The pesky pace sometimes confuses the most common story. The animation is dark and daunting and cheap. This thing looks like a Saturday morning cartoon together with a clap. Let's hope they will not forget that 2D traditional animation can still look great. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The lack of visuals, pace and originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: Perhaps the greatest death scene for Disney is the villain for a long time. It highlights the creative of the movie.
