You're disappointed after the original story of the early Baroque Artemisia Gentiley - but if you're after a body theme that has been designed with an art theme, you feel the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is not an inaccurate description of the life of Artemisia Zetilis, which almost casts me. (The type of artemic errors in Google and actually some of the fictional stories.) However, the film was perfectly in line with technical knowledge: sets, textiles and especially Chiarascuro lighting was an early 17th century experience; <br /> <br /> How did director / co-author Anne Merlet defended his paintings? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemissia as a victim, which was unfortunate because it would have to face.
