On her death bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about the past (woman) story. Last weekend, a young Yan was staying at his girlfriend Leila's wedding weekend. She joins Harris at the wedding, and she will influence her throughout her life. She remembers her as her true love through all the fluctuations and decline of her professional and family life. Her daughter Constance is old, and "responsible", with both mother and things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nana is a boyfriend from a boyfriend and works for a job and does not know her direction in life. The details of the period in the movie are good. Clothing, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and space. The film has a very good acting. Vanessa Redgrave is the main character and her brilliant mood is very good, her life is just fine. Claire Danes is beautiful and she did a great job in the main role when she was younger (and she was a wonderful singer). <br /> Now, unfortunately, everything else is there. Things are constantly interrupting the story because it's great for us. The chemistry between young un and buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then ... you do not really love him than a friend and you believe that his paining anger her. <br /> I thought the whole idea, "he might be gay" thing is out of the blue and there is a benefit. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. This character works with wood and creepy. Whether it's another kind, you would have known Harris as a serial killer. <br /> <br /> "Why do not you like me?" They come for each other. <br /> <br /> They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener 's bag, come home to find out about the tragic end of Buddy and then ... <br /> A few years later and see all overly eyes and learn about one and why I could not help <br /> <br /> Why is this film not compelled to marry other people and I am very sorry for them? <br /> <br /> Now the story is very boring. Daughter and clich√© bad daughter.Nina I am not sure how to change the order of the film but she is convinced that she should change her life Unnadi I'm not sure. A "touching" is the scene where the daughters of the old Anthony ventadukuntunna butterfly she is equally mixed. It is really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> msgid "" "Yan advised us," there are no mistakes. " This story is not true with the story. And after watching the film they did not wishing good actors could wast the talent.
