I saw this film last night and I warned you to take into consideration anyone's interest to see this film. In a word - do not. I felt like a screenwriter student wrote in Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy stage, that is, every other word is a curse. As I did in "Good Will Hunting", there is no problem with infamous accusations that can help further exploit the roles. In this case it was just a blanket disappointment with an attempt to get a * gap * or a smile from the audience. The three main characters are their own unique stereotype, Wall Street Jerk, Coffee House Jerk and "I'm Not That Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side". You do not say anything of them! They are all unhealthy, losing unredemable who want to see you lose. For those who dare, this movie has a couple funny moments, at the very beginning, and very end. The toilet / vibratory scenery is fun on the way to "Uh, yes" in a sick hazard. Actually, I will only recommend this film to my enemies.
