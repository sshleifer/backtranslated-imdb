So let me tell you that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really a fine bored 1997 day and i biking to the movie rental store. I asked him to clarify what's the worst picture in stock. Without hesitation he walked over me "lucky tight." He told me he would give me a $ 1 rental fee (he said he was wrong). <br /> <br /> This film is awful. God's horror too. I do not need to go into the plot details, read other reviews. Jokes do not understand. Acting is terrible. I thought it was comedy, but the main character's tiredness was tired. You can try to see and laugh at it, but it's so bad that it's not even funny. Avoid!
