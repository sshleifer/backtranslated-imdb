The film was not programmed in Italian cinema, and I saw it as a manifestation called "Fanafusty" .I find it terrible, because some scenes seem haphazard and dark, and the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there. Music is not entirely in the story and I do not have the words to describe visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is interesting but requires a complete review of development.
