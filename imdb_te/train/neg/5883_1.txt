The film does not have any fun with family members who have a mental illness. Several scenarios remind me of my life experiences very clearly. The film's version of the movie "Mummy Dearest". It is graphically and accurately described by many children in the mentally paternal life. It is a psychiatrist who shows how easy it is to be corrupt and behave like God. <br /> <br /> "This is very serious and discouraging." My son left me room. The best use of this movie is for people who do not understand illness or we do not believe in what families actually do live.
