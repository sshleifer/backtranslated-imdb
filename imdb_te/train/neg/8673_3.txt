Before I start, you need to know that you are a fan of many of Sony's Chiba movies. His biography is one of the most outstanding martial arts films of the massive and best street fighter films of his life biography of Mass Ooyama. This action was practically a great martial arts learner in the 1970s, with no exception to the non-stop and Bruce Lee (depending on what you ask). They are very good because I have seen at least 15 of his films and a little more recently (I'm in the process of watching). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, despite my love of these films, I'm not an unmanaged drama zombie who worships the man for a degree that rates a rate in each picture. Here are some reviews in the IMDb and I do not really close to such a bad image and Chiba's best work from a technical perspective because someone who gave this film should be neglected by 10. 10 score is not a real rating - it's not some zombie fan this movie, tries to advertise Chiba! As I said, this film is technically awful. Some of these I saw American dubbed version, its inappropriate affiliation and bad dubbing. But a lot of trouble still exists with the original Japanese print. Camera work is just worse - it happens through chimps (smart chips, but still chips). Marshall arts action often fails, because the camera is too slow or will be canceled due to the shaddiness of the producers of the heads of the actors. <br /> <br /> "The musical score is not original - but it's also very bad. The "spaghetti western" music of Enoio Morricone is the kind of assistant rock of the 1970s - it's annoying, distracting, and just plain silly. <br /> <br /> For martial arts action, choreography improved slightly better things. Instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to a Chiba movie, the fights are very brief and often missed the camera !! So is the story you are left with ... and this movie is just the worst part! It needs a anti-drug film featuring Sony Chiba .... Sony Chiba! And the film begins, he pledges to destroy drug trade in Japan. But, Mafia (with any single member of Italy, but also Japanese) pledges to stop Chiba. And, when a woman comes to Chiba with promises to give her information about how she can ruin her drug trade, he accepts her and no conditions accepts her life - even though she never cared about telling him what she knew! In fact, she then tries to use Chiba to save her when she sells a big cake cake filled with coconut - and tries to save her! It makes no sense at all and they seem to have been filmed in the movie all over the film-such as walking into bars and brothels, and walking like Chibano when he drank. <Br /> <br /> If it's bad, why is it merited to a 3? Well, first of all, the most horrific wedding art films (dating from Hong Kong in the 1970s) - 3 feet tall fighting, including those dressed in Kung Fu and their operators in gorilla suits (now it's not bad). Second, it's very bad compared to its lazy Chiba movies, and it's not bad compared to its contemporaries. <br /> <br /> If you wondered if this deadly Sony Chiba film is not it sure! In his first films, Neptune Men's INVASION, a leotard-wearing superhero who fights straight-line invaders from Chiba Graham Neptune. <br /> <br /> The final note to the parents - like the images of Sony Chiba, it is very violent and has its share. of boobies. Let's see how they hated some kids! Wait for the old ones before you see them wretched R-R Martial Arts Films!
