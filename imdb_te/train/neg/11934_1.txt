I sat through the episode in this series and can no longer take it longer. It has already seen dozens of episodes, it hit me ... nothing new here! I heard that joke on Seinfeld, I'm falling in love with friends, the episode of Happy Days has almost the same storyline. None of the actors are interesting here either! Some are good on other programs (not here), and others are new to a never-ending career. Avoid this stinker!
