Only one liner had to write, but it really was. I love gangster art and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I have the praise for everybody involved in the most important, script. This is a weak story about a small criminal. The fine acting or black and white film styling can be made for the total lack of overall material. I love Kevin Spacey and I heard he's going to do another film about the ordinary. My advice is not to waste your time.
