The disappointing cloud is the frustrating image to see. Troubled with passion, it treats the work of art as a shot. You get the impression of each shot's composition design and the cheery boundaries with a degree of sensitive protection; The first movies of the nineteenth century came to light and the film depicts how their film progresses, where the camera is always moving. Apart from camp and colorful music numbers. The ambient noise is kept low and only one word is spoken. This interesting but efficient device stimulates the viewers to focus on visual impulse, so that the story seems to be drowning at the speed of a snail. Unfortunately, at least for me, this immersion begins to unfold somewhere around the hour mark. <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie, the film is very difficult to watch, and watching the film is just a challenge. It is more obscure to Western audiences. Because of the nakedness of female nudity and sexual abuse, it may be possible to talk about abusive (or perhaps dead) female pornography, but it is more enthusiastic as it chooses to show the effectiveness of males and women (consumers and consumers) for pornography. In reality, the poor and most enthusiastic participants find the film for all the wrong reasons and see their sticky finger in the remote's fast-forward button. For all the problems, the film is definitely a stay, and you can feel more about it and make some stuff. Ironically, for a movie that is too low, the viewer will probably have a suitable prize for the second or third time. For me, though, is it enough ??
