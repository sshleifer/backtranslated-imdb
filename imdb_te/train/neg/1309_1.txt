This film is very boring. Not at least 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments but I have a lot bad and very good comments. <br /> We are close to one step to honestly assess this. <br /> What can I say? I'm sleeping 3 times in this film. I spent about 4 hours from the sleeping time of 8 hours. <br /> <br /> There are no dialogues between characters except for most of the 2 sentences. <br /> When you sleep once, rewind and catch you because you fall asleep again.
