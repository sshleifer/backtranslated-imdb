I do comedy, drama, fantasy, science fiction, from generation to generation is not complete as it could not find, but, given the actors I wanted to give it a spin. The film's tone awkward sense of the genre patches went through, but a lot of balancing to consider, eventually I tried, and sinimatotagraphi and individual performances focus has been, I was on the whole a good thought, every character in the story of the nature of the (here, give it away), low depth is. I thought it was longer than its 96 minute runtime and was not in a good way. In the end I'm looking for closure, some measure of satisfaction but it does not turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece I thought. I gave him that Tony was wrongly thinking what he did at the end ... but it was a tragic mistake to try and verify the previous 95 minutes. In the end I feel cheated. IMO would have been able to stand a piece of art without "ending". Or ... I might have missed the point completely :)
