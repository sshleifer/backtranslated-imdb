Like many people, the pictures of Michael Boel Yeng in the painted film are drilled across the box and the imagination (from the picture and the title of the film) from the movie All about the beast <br /> <br /> For my disappointment, Hercules Boso Yeng Jin Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger have no retrieve number ... Erm, Bolo Yeng - Video Akslo maximum response, at least in real-time on the screen! Oh! Sounds good! <br /> <br /> The storyline is pretty important, but it is well-done - a peaceful Kung Fu Fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and does not want to fight again. He flees to work as a worker in a peer, where his colleagues are impressed by his heavy story training lifting, and they suspect him as a formidable war (not knowing how those things work). Meanwhile, the corrupt owner of the peer makes them a deal with guarantees, which are specifically used for peer's use. As a result, workers must be thrown in their ear, staying on the beach where they unite with their boss, gangster boss and his Hulking Hennmark Boow Young. <br /> <br /> I'm facing some problems - first, bad dubbing but given in old Kung Fu films. But, the movie switched between different combat-scenes. And for the action sequences, I have been overly long, and Jackie Chan has been a serious dancer, unfortunately shot and people who do not have martial arts capabilities. In fact, many fights in this film are not 'fights', people just beat people without giving resistance! <br /> Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other pictures with this guy, but at any time I was fired for him. He did not appear on the edge of wimpy and tears at all times, but I found his pressure to be angry! I understood his argument, but he knew he had done it earlier and knew that he was going to do that, and many people could save the pain! Why is it a big mystery for all the people to fill their hopes on the one who has never seen the fight? <br /> <br /> In fact, the existence of Bolo Ying is a big saving grace in the film. He is not so big and cruel, he has some great and fun lines, and the rest of the cast gives the master class on how to fight in the film. The person oozes the presence of the screen and you can easily see how he has become a star. The guy is scared of my life, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who saw this film to hunt all in the final fight for Bol! <br /> <br /> For all, the average Kung Fu film below you know-you know a lot of heavy dramas. I did not think Boel Yeng was great. Man is a myth !!
