Do not make me wrong, I want to see GaryJo as the next person. I'm confused now. However, the writing is unrealistic. Dealing with a PTA mom drugs but her medications are adamant about getting into the hands of an aged person. Will you be. The smugness of the character of Mary Lewis Parker's character is an insult to my intelligence. The characters are not all likable. In general, the plot lines did not go anywhere. I mean its only TV land. Fear was very scary. Mary Luis Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am confident this .... why? I got the feeling that the reeking of the seed was preached by a performance. There's a way to cheat on your wife but someone with the legal age. Not exactly the same, but I think you get my point. Children's stuff is amazing for promotional trails, I guess, but the local pot dealer does not have water on a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mother.
