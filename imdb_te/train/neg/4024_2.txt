This film is just plain terrible. Poor John Savage had to reduce this low to be in another film. He has acted as a rare vampire, helping it as a washed and thrown woman in a street hooker, a dancer in a local strip club. She tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who is one of the rare vampires, who are falling in the dressing room. Savage is entrusted to a small protagonist of this rare vampire race, a cross between the 80s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. The film is dancing with Savage rapping and a tader spider on his head with a midget, which is rare. He was Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante Quotes and I had to laugh. It just gets ridiculed. And then they have the most gross special effects to come, Corri throwing her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can tell that all is fake. Her son does not know what to do with the new identity of her mothers and the pest is higher than the object of calm. I enjoy a good Vampire film, believe me but I just hate this one. Photography is also obscure with a changing camera, and it turns out that the camera is faster for camera to keep up with the camera and then the cameras look bright in the scenes. He was around Corri until he had himself. Avoid it !!
