If you ask me, the first one is really good. Look at Sarah M. G., her real, average, brutal girl, Amy Adams is around her little fool hanging around. She is nothing! People do not worship her! Secondly, Sebastian is beautiful and beautiful in the very first film, now he is the "baby face". The story is not good, I do not understand. Why they did not make this one first, it's the beginning. Lucy's actors, nothing with the story. It's not rude, it's playing. The first is good actors, good story, and its average. I feel that the music is brutal motives 1 and the music is brutal motives 3. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the first one in its big, big, big nothing in the composer.
