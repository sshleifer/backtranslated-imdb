It's hard to say that Neonan and Marshall are angry with Abbot & Costello, Martin & Louise, Curly & Lorry, or some other comedy team, but whoever tried to imitate them failed miserably. This whole stupid movie is just a weak laugh. Noonan (helped to write the alleged "script") and Marshall did not have any chemistry; Marshall Dean martin seems to be trying to cool the devil-may-care coolness, but he does not come close to the remote. Noon knew what he was doing, but it was not funny. He flapping a lot of his arms and legs and staring at dumbly at everyone and everything seems to be the height of the screen comedy; Probably not for him, but for the audience. I remember seeing it in the theaters when it came out. Three years Jeff Chandler Western ("Stills of the Sky," it's great) and three Stooges short (not "Saffi Bullfitters"), and about 20 minutes of the audience threw stuff on the screen; It is also inconsistent with the three stupas shorts scarcity. I'm in the end (I wished, but my folks did not take up the cinema until the end of the film), and by the end of this mess I was the only one in the theater. I looked back at 15 or so years ago in one night's cab and I watched to see if I was as bad as I remembered. It's worse. The only thing that's going to be Julie Newman, it's always hot and hot; Other than her, this thing is absolutely nothing to recommend it. Two of them are playing Japanese soldiers, and as they do, Jerry Lewis discourages Japanese characters by comparing thick-lensed, book-tooth and gibbering mental diffusives. Marshall hosted "Hollywood Squares", and Noonan was trying to keep his hand in making films, but most of them were so bad. Most, though, I do not think it's too bad like this. The true curiosity of the film is waste. Do not waste your time.
