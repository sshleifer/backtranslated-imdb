<br /> <br /> These permanent ratings are still in the air, and there is a mystery. This week was a worse for Veronica Mars: it ranks 146th out of 146 in the big 6 (soon it will be Big 5). Yes, you read it correctly. Veronica Mars is currently running on every program of WB and every show has been defeated on UPN. It was beaten by Fox and all programs by all shows in ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> Now, hip masters are going to say: but it's in return. But everything on TV is pretty much running back for the week! <br /> <br /> CW Select Ratings disappoints as one of the few programs saved from the UNP. <br /> <br /> Apparently something is going on behind the scenes. <br /> Sorry sorry, but what is the other explanation? <br /> <br /> "The probability of Veronica Mars" is now apparently dead, its foundation has a two-year term and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> It is the influence and influence of Joel Silver, but apparently, I'm losing it <br /> <br /> I do not want anybody to view the audience but choose someone to choose anyone in a bad show. <br /> <br /> CW is a great secret and a very unpleasant debut.
