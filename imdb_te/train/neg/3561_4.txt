The Stephen King adaptation (written by King himself) was found in the pet Cemetery close to the home of a young man in rural Maine. <br /> The Father (Dale Midkiff) then learns about the burial of Mumac, which has the powers of the resurrection beyond the pet burial place - where only the burial does not come back. <br /> <br /> The average "horror" film is clumsy, insulting, and useless, and for some time continues, Midkiff's helpless performance continues with the whole worst element. With a finer partially disruptive part, it is a little better at the end. In fact, the whole picture is really upsetting, so I can not remove it completely - at least it's memorable. <br /> <br /> Fred Guinness is a good old neighbor, and as Brad Grewquist, Victor Paskov is not really worth it to redeem the movie. <br /> <br /> King is his typical Kamonu minister. <br /> <br /> After the sequel, directed by Mary Lambert, did she not work any major film from her?
