This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but Hostel is definitely the worst. This film is more ridiculous than scary. I laughed a lot of time while looking at it. Camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show than a movie), with low quality effects (as you're going to be able to understand what I mean and how low it is), bad actors (I heard them for the first time) and it's shot by an amateur . But at least I have patience to see it until the end. Like comedies? Look. Hannar? <br /> When I talk about the Diablo Legend, I do not even know that I have classed horror style. Some cheap budget worst. <br /> <br /> I would rate it from 10 to 3
