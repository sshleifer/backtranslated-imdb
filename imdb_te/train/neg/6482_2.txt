Disney has not yet seen a movie that does not make at least two sequels. And this is not exempt from people at Disney to give a weaker story to a quick gift. <br /> <br /> Ariel, though not paid to see it, I'm cheap by looking at it. <br /> <br /> Ariel has grown up and has a daughter. The daughter of the dead sea witch did not allow this daughter to go into the sea due to some disappointing threat. <br /> <br /> Here the daughter turns around again. After a not so wonderful battle, she lost and lives in harmony with mermaids and humans. <br /> There is nothing to see here. Go back to your lives. "D-"
