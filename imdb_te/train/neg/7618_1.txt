This is not a movie. It's not a talent. This is not information. It's not horrible. It's not fun. <br /> My cousin says, "Diablo! Coil!" Yes it is true. <br /> <br /> I did not buy the only thing that was cool about this experience but instead took a rent. <br /> <br /> This is a bad soap opera. Do not wait. Soap opera at least LOOK professional ... sorta. This? It's portrayed by someone's camcorder. It's awesome! Wretched! It sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is hateful! Who is this director? I do not even get enough attention to see him. He is forbidden! <br /> <br /> "B" level is 2.6 / 10. <br /> <br /> "A" is about 0.3 / 10 on the scale.
