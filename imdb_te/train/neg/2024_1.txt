Trying to Deal No No Deal and 1 Versus 100 This is not a sluggish need for fun - show the money, in which 12 sexy dancers will decorate Shimmy blinking red hooker. A contestant "lost what team?" With three options, A, B or C, each completes this phrase. The contestant has three options to answer one of these 3 options. The host - William Shutner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - was "locked into the answer" and when the contestant said yes, he "show me money!" If Yells chooses to choose a 'dancer', the competitor asks to open a scroll containing her amount, and if his answer is correct, that sum adds to his achievements; If he was wrong, the whole subtraction. (So, ideologically, the contestant is likely to be in a disappointing defeat to shut down Sharon's money). There is also a "killer card" and the candidate chooses the girl with the scroll of the wile, nothing happened. If he is the wrong answer, the game is going to be sudden death and answer another question. <br /> <br /> Before commercial advertising was done, Shutner yells, "let's dance" and Shatner, contender and 12 dancers Shake Shake Shake. At the end of the show, Shatner asks ladies for "the last dance" and they all spill more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ (They are worse - they somehow bribed to be a Cuban Gudding Junior Host, and I bet him a better dancer than the 'Shot', as I call him these days <br /> 7/08: Just imagine what's wrong! 5 episodes only, the world has hope.
