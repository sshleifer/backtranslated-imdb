I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely loved Kenny Hotz, and Spencer rice was a lovely side to him. I do not like spin. The film made the spine ruins. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert is pretty boring except for a scene. There are not many celebrities in this movie, and most do not tell more than one line. Overall, the film was disappointing. If you get it with Season 1 DVD of Kenny vs Spency (which comes for free on 3rd disc), I'll see it. Regardless of this product, I am very happy to check The Papel Chase.
