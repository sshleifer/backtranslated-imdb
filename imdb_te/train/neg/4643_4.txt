I rented this movie on DVD. I know that the film did not survive as it was promised behind the film case, but I saw Leather Face (Gunnar Hansen) in it. It enables a pretty good start, with the premise being cast on the cast of the cast. However, the main character her nothing you feel sorry for her and nothing about her, and the end of the film really leaves you hanging. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that took me totally by surprise, but overall this is a very sub-part film, but I guess the value of $ 3.99 rental fee.
