What do the director think? Everyone who read the biography of the Artemia has to face an open rape trial during the Renaissance, and Tassey suffers torture to show offense. The truth shows true independence and redemption - in her terrible hour she is with her MAN. Why are the films that have been recreated by the Renaissance show that they are medically beautiful and romantic, are we worried to see an awkward piece of life or win the Hollywood Happy-Happy-Mood? I always preserve the freedom of the director to create his own reality in the film, but I can not understand how to change the artemia's life on its head. This film was very frustrating by producers.
