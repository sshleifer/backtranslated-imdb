I can not really say anything bad about this thing * or better. Its roles fit, which is the product of production and design and professionally visible (except cheesy monster suit). However, this is no realism, ideas, and nothing you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or Outland. This is different from another formula, cookie-cutter, "deep space versus unstoppable monster". Pretty much time waste.
