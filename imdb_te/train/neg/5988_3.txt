The original Thunderbird has gained a place in TV history. In fact, the first 10 minutes of Wallace and Gromit film (The Verabit) get a direct copy of Thunderbird, the original replay of the original Thunderbird 2 launch series (you get a copy of the original episode that started Thunderbird 2). <Br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a cross - In reality, Thunderbirds have spent their time and are often trapped by Mother Nature or Technology's terrible error (yes, even occasional criminal law) .Thunderbirds have not made any of their own lives and resources - the essence of heroism and selflessness. There is physical violence. Thunderbirds challenge the imagination of a degree Do not underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - a lot of Japanese old Astroboy cartoon attracts their attractiveness with humanoid robots. <br /> <br /> But the film is a poor picture of the original. This film came as a compound between Thunderbirds and Looney Tunes - I mean, we have Anthony Edwards as Bronze Pig's stuttering brain ??? Most action involves the Kung Fu / Power Rangers type fighting. In fact, there are funny sound effects when someone hangs on the pan to hang. The technique that eliminated our fabrication does not attend - instead we have been using this plot in an original series (the whole team is taking the time, leaving the kids and the brain occupying the base). Then there was a dose of "use of force leuk" when tin tin threw something or another with the hood using "losing aerodynamics" from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". "The Tin Tin, I'm Your Uncle" with the voice of the breath of the hood. <br /> <br /> Thunderbird's specially made heart is unique. <br /> <br /> The role of Ron Cooke's Parker is only a matter of light. But playing lady penelope actress came across as a child - HUH ?? <br /> <br /> We hate this movie. Anyone who is famous for a place of fanfare, and expects the fans to shell money, and then sends something if the fans are not so close - sorry, sorry, it's just plain wrong! Well, if they make a child - fine - the next time it is directly distributed to the video, most of them belong. But do not change package and innards up something in a familiar wrapper.
