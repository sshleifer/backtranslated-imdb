I tried to complete the film three times, but it was a terrifying god. Case in point: Mother and daughter drive up to bed and breakfast, breaks for mom gas, crazy gas station Weirdos driven her B and B mad at her hubby to try her rape. She escapes, heads up to B & B and instead hubby going to ballistic and wants to call her cops, the story continues to be moderate behavior on both their parts. <br /> <br /> Other action logic errors are high. <br /> Acting is moderate and subsequent to the neighbors' warning that is really fun and bad. <br /> <br /> The movements of serious gore / death are unevenly interrupted by intermittent time intervals with interactive sequences. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore has been hailed for more attention, mood and stories.
