I hate horror movies, it's not a secret. These flaws of plot, bad acting and bloody gallon cinema are important, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. As I mentioned in any other movie, I am saying: All of the fantasy movies, Jason Movies, Freddy films, Chowki movies and Michael Mayer's films can be used in the same words: TERRIBLE !! ! <br /> Rating (Fantasium III): 0.5 / 10
