This film will cause more unexpected laughter than anything I've ever seen. Actually, if you're a Tolkien fan, rent it to laugh with your friends. I will not be a million people to break its deficiencies ... I will say that the movie has played a major role in my favorite character, Sam, to become a male idiot. Humiliation, shame ... 3/10
