<br /> <br /> The length of the film is 4 times its biggest mistake. J.P. As Datta fell in love with his project, there is no editing. Lagaan also spent 4 hours - but it was entertaining and gave a message. <br /> It is based on real events and real people. It's kudos, but recurring battle scenes really need? On top of it was moved from a battalion / squadron to another and not all of them could be tracked. <br /> There are songs about loneliness, loneliness, fascinating and relevant stuff. There are chamber conversations. Initially some relief from violence, but later becoming unchanged, can predict the nature of the upcoming discussion. <br /> <br /> Soldiers do not know that the enemy is lurking somewhere nearby because they are like lions in the forest? When they were shot, it seemed to be very serious to their safety, even though it showed sympathy. <br /> <br /> Music is melodic and literature is confident but does not fit with the movie. <br /> <br /> It is best to listen to them in the soundtrack rather than the film. <br /> Acting is saved saving: Like everyone who has worked for everyone, such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Khanna, an experienced veteran like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are clever ("Love With Madry!") from the strange / monotonous ("Pakistan Saw Jada) musalman Hindustan Main Hain"). And all MCs, BCs, Cs and F-words have absolutely no need for accurate sprays. <br /> <br /> The LOC Cargill seeks to pay tribute to brave Indian soldiers, but it tries very hard and will eventually fail. Indian soldiers are absolutely good tribute.
