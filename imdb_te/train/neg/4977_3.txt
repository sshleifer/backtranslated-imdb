It is a special TV series of Beowulf's story and a replacement of unnecessary science fiction channel, particularly the 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". The film does not really come to Beowulf's story, but when a kingdom of absolute fear and confusion left us through his war against the abyss of the so-called Grendel, the mighty Viking warrior, Beowulf is the monster's devastation. If it is successfully achieved, children should not sacrifice children to keep it in bags. After some trials failed, the creature was slaughtered, but this angry and venerable mother soon returned to Beowulf and reinforced her supremacy of strength and power. "Grendel" is portrayed in a small budget and CG effects are terrible. As I mentioned, this film is absolutely not necessary.
