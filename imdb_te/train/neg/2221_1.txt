I'm sorry, but it's scary when it came out in 1978, but it does not happen in modern times. The only scenario in the entire movie is Michael's opening scenes that kill his sister, Judith, and worn his Halloween mask. The most difficult moment in the whole movie is when his parents kill their murderers. The film did not pick up from there for the last fifteen minutes, but it was too late, we lost all interest in the story of the audience. Larry is always kindle about such an unusual heroine, just developing any character, and the people she really does not have much. I'm sorry that everyone is terrified by this movie, but see Shining or Rosemary's Baby if you want to see a great horror movie. Two best horror films ever made. Halloween is not exactly their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave four stars because the film could not get such a high rating.
