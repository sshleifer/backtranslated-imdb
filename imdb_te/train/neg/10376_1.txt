I saw the film premiere at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> Many scenes have prompted the laughs of laughter from the audience, if this is a comedy, but the audience is afraid, if there are filmmakers. They were delayed to release for a year. I curse it again with curiosity. As I said, they were not. <br /> It's almost "very bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
