This horrible little picture - and unfortunately, this little made company has made many other. The smallest is not funny to start with a joke idea and can even disturb you. In this case, dancinghall girl and bar room patrons - seem very uncomfortable by looking at the very small children (as early as 2 years old). It's a kind of humor that you need to laugh at your own children, but I do not want anyone to see it - especially when wearing a slimic little shirley and clothes like Worms! And then, some of the other kids work as adults in some adult situations. At that time, I was not trying to appeal to them pedophiles, but when looking up today, that's what comes soon to mind! For this reason, this boring image also creeped out of me and I hope I can not see it again !! Pretty strange and pretty awful.
