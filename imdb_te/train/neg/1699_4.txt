I'm a fan of Lynchie's work for a while, and I'm happy to see this DVD. Unfortunately, I missed too much. This is a series of small cartoons that try to show rare and ridiculous humor. The animation is very doubtful, using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat man who hits his family and usually treats everyone as he is a jerk. <br /> <br /> For those who are unwell for the animation, they are probably impressed by some. However, if you spend more time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons are different than what you have seen before. Many of the prominent amateur artists in the New Gords are doing better than what is shown on this DVD. If Linch submits this work to the website, he perfectly combines the good of the New York artists. But, when I see it on DVD, instead of in the Newgrounds, I give it 4/10 instead, instead of a 7/10. These cartoons suit the Internet, but I guess it was a good quality story and animation in the name of David Lynch.
