Warner home video is better than a double double noir on one disc and better than the two films RKO's fantastic 1950s thriller "Where Danger Loves". It is a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchell, Faith Domherge and Claude Rains. Black and White is produced by Nicolas Musurakka, directed by John Farrow. <br /> <br /> "The Whole Danger Lives" is a prime example of Nair's style of film making. Always remember the Hollywood style of stylish handicraft - See my full review <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the above picture of the acclaimed disc can be applied to the stable MGM 1949 stinker TENSION! The poorly written (Allen Rivkin) and directed by John Berry, the film is filled with humorous characters and unrestrained circumstances. And his overtly floozy wife (a dangerous Audrey totter) is totally unsustainable and astounding (how is they ever met together in the first place ever - the unexpected relationship between a lightweight mannered and wimpish panacea - played by blandly Richard Bayhester). Then she was "surprisingly" at one of his players (Lloyd Gufff) at the last chicken that finally died, as we tried to kill our cowardly pharmacist, his newly found luck, plot revenge and guf. The man is murdered anyway and our pharmacist immediately suspects Homicide Detective Barry Sullivan (another patchwork performance). So who killed him? Well, at this stage of the film you can not really take care of it, because it is very bad and it is ridiculed by director Berry. Mr. Berry has no idea about passing and can not even inject a style of style on this issue. There is nothing he can put in front of the camera to prevent you from shaking off! The only removal in the film is in the rubber band, which has expanded to its limit and snaps in the fingers of Barry Sullivan to introduce him at the beginning of the film. For that too! The most unfortunate attempt! <br /> <br /> The best things about this turkey were a soft monochrome cinematography called Harry Stringling, Young Andrey Praveen's effective score and lovely Cyd Charisse found her dancing boots. Hey! - She may have saved us a picture she has given us a couple of steps and a couple of pirouettes! <br /> <br /> "But the disc is only worth it for RKO Mitchell Classic !
