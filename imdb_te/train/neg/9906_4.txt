After reading the reviews, it was clear that everyone was intellectual. How totally boring Oh how good a good day is. <br /> <br /> I grew up after the age of Steam and the film gem was decorated on Saturday afternoon afternoon with Dan Boon. . It is an annual film that keeps rounds, bats, flashing, farking, turtle and leopard giants. At that time it was a theater filler. <br /> In every criticism IMDb stated that there is anything about the plot. The problem is that it is a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (Cowboy / Hero) collects friends and defeats the evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> "It's just about every film, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie plot line that made it so far. <br /> If you take the time to go back and review each movie - do not ask for a surprise. <br /> Remember the time period, no small TV is for children, the school is out of the great outdoors and toy guns. Cyber ​​time and <br /> <br /> The film is entertaining and it is as mental as it has been produced today It is the first to be promoted. <br /> <br / > Our fathers enjoyed the real thing, and the red splashing of the simulated blood in real and extracurricular size to Sam Peckfaf a decade later It's not going to be fun after his director until his death until somebody dies slowly, great pain and worse than the Pekinfa war and gun battles and bloodless affair. <br /> <br /> The movie is less or bloody, but adults do not care. They feel I can not tolerate. Brenting Plant life is not sprayed. So this film has all the fame and no one of the ghuri. <br /> <br /> I've allotted four minutes for this rating. Why do i do it Well. It's a terrible picture. No matter how I love it. I love this film because it is one of my childhood's happiest moments back. But it's not all that good of an image in terms of quality. Basically Gung Ho can become a romantic novel for kids. <br /> You have to watch this. Of course. I'm not saying that I should stay away. Of course not. Plot is easy. The letters are not right? They are shoe. You prefer a bad image.
