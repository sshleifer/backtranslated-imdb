The reviews I read for this movie are pretty good, so I decided to check it out. Bad idea! One group is a movie about a ghost for revenge against friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts rink with a piece Prom Night, I know what you did last summer, and a sprinkle of add a small dash of single white bride - the mixture until now completely paltry. This theme is not new, and since I am not entertaining at this time, I have reviewed my favorite clocks. This film will jump past and last, and it still does not understand what I perceive once. The characters move from the sane to the psychic killer in the eye blink. Greedy selfish attorney, ahakakari actress, baseball star, video yayoor, bitter girl, spooky quiet chick, nice-than-nice 'nice girl - talking about characters, they liked your past. , A freakin 'black cat ... and I do not care about any of them. Perhaps a good writer has done a good job with this film, but there are some good scenes, but overall the movie is a mess. I also need to mention a specific 'video tape' that has IMPOSSIBLE to shoot. <br /> <br /> This film is not the most dangerous Asian horror, but it is still very bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh at some of the above acting or "You're Stupid!" If you want to get your sleeve on a movie screen, or another Asian horror when you ask what you've seen - this picture is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a good plot will see elsewhere.
