I'm confused. I have been a huge seagull fan for over 25 years. I saw all of his films and dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre". Steven Siegel shares screenplays and credits in the film, but I have a very hard time, he chooses to dub on his own songs on the songs, a narrow, whiny viewer's voice is low. I can not even get it, and if some of their lines have to be dubbed, why do they have his own voice on the rest? I wanted Siegel just like our age. But Seagal in this film has shown us the same confidence in his previous films as a self-confidence, confidence, brave, charm, and sex-appeal. His confusing, self-assertive attitude and his bad-donkey sneeer can easily turn into that adorable smile while I'm not quite visible. Where is such a huge starred your-face attitude and charm ??? I hope that this film is not all that Seagal offers - if so, all of his lifelong fans will agree that Seagal knows and likes everyone.
