Capital "A" is impossible. It is currently one of the best performances on TV. I'm as anti-bush as it gets, but this show can not even get a stain from me. You're sure what you think of Bush as a president, whether you like this part of the worst display or not. "Jokes" is not funny at all. For example, when Lil Bush has his linger on his head: "Welcome to the camp al-Qa-eda!". Nothing about that is not funny. Is this a joke? Advertising shown in the weeks leading up to the show was more ridiculous than crossing the show and was just sad. Hopefully it will not be considered for this second season. It should not even have a first one.
