La Chette de la Maison Usher, or The Fall of the House of Usher, starts with the castle of Allen (Charles Lommy) for the castle of his best friend Sir Roderick Usher (Jean Debutcart), whose wife Madeleine is ill. Once there Alan finds Madeleine sick and her husband Roderick refuses to describe her portrait. <br /> <br /> If Roderick paints Madeleine's weak and weak image, Alan tries to help his friend, but the tragedy is soon hit ... <br /> <br /> This French production is co-authored, 1928 The second of both the films of The Fall of the House of Usher, produced and directed by Jean Epstein, was honestly published in the original novel in 1839 Dinadi I do not know, I've been waiting years for a shot in the follow-up to 89 for the same time as two years to come! Anyhow, I think there's a bit of a problem here that I have read plenty of positive comments about La Chute de la Maison Usher & maybe I just did not do anything for it I'm not the right sort of guy to write a comment on it. I do not like it, the first thing to do is it's a silent film and it depends on the images, but I think the story is weak, I'm worrying the whole movie, just over an hour & it really did nothing to me. La Crete de la Maison Usher was made almost 80 years ago & literally a lifetime, world, movie & flavors have been moved on a lot since then & I found happiness in this movie. I was seriously dating this movie and it was not good to start anyway. I never thought of anything of the characters, I have never cared about anything happening & I've all been rather tedious to sit by if I'm sorry if there's no silent movie fans out there but the way I felt it. <br /> <br /> Director Epstein is doing a job, and I agree that a lot of people will do something about the pictures in La Chip de la Maison Usher, but that they are definitely moments. It's not that I'm really bizarre to move people's mouths and say, I did not like music, and the version I saw was originally kept French French Insert cards, which also ceased with a very awful noisy French accent. <br /> <br /> Based on the story of Edgar Allen Poe, I suspect that it is a great deal of comparison with one or two primary elements of Auss's fantastic Roger Carman House starring Vincent Price. Technically considering when making this image correct. <La Chute de la Maison Usher will appeal to those who live in a cave or who have stuck in a cave in the past, will appeal to those who crave, I like having a story in my movies, not bored me & Have the sound & the last statement I am sorry if you sound like an illiterate idiot but how do I feel? The world has been good since 1928.
