My eyes! In the name of God and the Holy Spirit will unzie the picture for me! What drugs do you have? This could be a very bad movie! I thought as a whole time in a bad acid tour, I need to call a doctor if I help deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the completion of the glow rope, the satirical masterpiece of Satan's film can be said. When I wanted to see this movie for my Jewish best friend and his family we could say "Oh hay, this may be funny! Perhaps it's bad but it's still a little fun" My friends all sat for lobotomis, and after the movie, one of my friends attempted to hang out with his belt and the other tried to hit his wrist with a wooden spoon. Instead I saw the video from the ring, pain and suffering only in seven days. For all who want to watch this movie, you're not ready! You may think that this is a "tough guy" sort of a rental, but this picture breaks you down, pushes you to the ground and kills you.
