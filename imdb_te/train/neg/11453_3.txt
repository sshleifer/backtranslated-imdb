This film is one of the Ghost comedy films I have ever seen. I hate this Napoleon Dynamite Rip-off. Only mute humor is already experiencing people who have been mastered. Do something new for a while. These new hobbies are just terrible. And SNL coming from Andy Samberg is not yet ready for the main character. I hope he can bounce back from this awful movie. And Arnetts's character is just plain bad. Hey, you do not read the script. This story is really written. Now tell me whether this is unrealistic. Rodd Kimble's step father Frank dies and the family needs to pay $ 50,000 for cardiac surgery, so Rod plans to raise this huge jump for Frank. Only the rod frank can be defeated in a fight and prove to his people. Yes, that movie, you say, will cost $ 7.00 to see the worst piece? <br /> <br /> <br /> "
