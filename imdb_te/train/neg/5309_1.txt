I just watched the movie only night and I can not believe how bad it is. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this was rebellious not even entertaining. Some of the highlights of the film are constantly playing movie with extravagant special effects (neon green with a laser gun, soon breaks) and playing with boring acting. Acting, in fact, is what I steal the show. I do not recognize the actors in the film and I hope I did not see anyone else. Overall, I recommend that you rent the movie (if you find it, I can not imagine the video shop carrying this trash) so you can learn to appreciate the quality images after seeing this trash.
