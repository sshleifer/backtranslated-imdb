It is mine looking at this sight ... but the film seems to be the reason for running insanity in the family. It makes a lot of sense, as others have said, one of Karlhof's last films and it has only the presence of his screen, which gives no credibility. All the great legends of the horror films in the era of the ultimate eventually eventually reduced to low grade trash. In the end, Boris was slightly better than the poor old Bela Lugoshi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best job and give him credit for trying to combine this mess. Solid background music does not help from the moment at any great moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast has been translated into some strange, clippipe, English singles, reminiscent of the type used in the late seventies. <br /> <br /> Still, Boris Karlof is very good in his best There are movies, search for them and give a broader berth, unless you want a 'shrinking brain' curse!
