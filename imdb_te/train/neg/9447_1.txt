Most movies can be easily sat down, especially if I do not like the movie. I'm a kind of guy who finds great images even though I do not like the genre. This was the first film I could not stand to see. The cat in the hat is the worst movie I have ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. Acting (Myers is good as a cat, he is really annoying). Even in audiences' children, the cat is frustrating and unchanging. The plot pulls and pulls on it, and the audience suffers from poor speech. The "witty" parental comments are reminiscent (I kind of like a man called "ho", better than some gardening hi about a garden hoy). Although the film is really low, it's always the last one. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If the kids do not retain it, I do not know what the elders are. I want to smoke more about this film but I think it's a waste of time before writing this review. I hope! So, in essence, looking at this does not cost 90 minutes of your life! <br /> <br /> I have always given a picture.
