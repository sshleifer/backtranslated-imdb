I can not say much about this film. I will talk for it (current ratings here). I rented this two years ago and I totally worried. I've tried / tried it twice / twice, but I could not. I can safely say that I have never had any desire to see these waste anytime. I can not get the movie bad, but I really believe it's awful. It's also not too funny. Some of the only bits I have enjoyed are the scenes with Christopher Walken. I have destroyed this movie Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. One day when I was one of their movies, I saw this horrible film that reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think you get my point. The stars are for the walkway, by the way.
