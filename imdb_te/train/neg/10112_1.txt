Every year I watch hundreds of movies, in their lowest minds no one ever wants to see even the lowest budget-looking straight-to-DVD abominations. I've seen thousands of movies in my time, many wonderful, many forgettable. Will the Zombie Nation remember one of the most disappointingly ridiculous 'horror' films I've ever seen? <br /> Day, it looks like some kind of weird dreams. Did I really see the idea I saw? Why do the police work from the warehouse? Did the Wudu priests really recommend 'eat' zombies' cheeseburgers? Is this safe? Is this safe? Is this safe? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie, I can not recommend the Zombie Nation, and I say it's good. However, if you have the chance to see the most disappointing film ever? This is for you. <br /> <br /> When someone asks the worst movie I've seen before, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> I think it is more guilty to make a boring film than the bad one, and Onlum Lomel deserves to build a film that is inaccurate. He is really a digital wired Ed Wood Jr., and I can not wait to see if the film is constantly humorous.
