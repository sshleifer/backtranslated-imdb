Before starting the movie I started to say that I read a lot of reviews. Still, I was amazed at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> "Most of them have sub-effects, poor performance and weak storylines (earlier motion <br /> <br /> The first story is cited in reviews on this site several times, so I can not go into the specs.Although, the author (s) lichtropropic Slideshow It is very clear that a horror film is given to a writer, such fees are considered "top", and they tried to come up with a new spin on the wolf Mythos, that's fine, but the horror fan who is trying to do this is usually the horror audience's intelligence and sophistication Refuse and end up writing them ID. The plot parodies of the films take place in the plot, and my intelligence in the ring lying seriously avamanaparicindani I just shot the unexpected happens. For example, TV news footage, never shut down all the people who are behind those who are away from the reporter. Credit for characters and viewers to identify the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon army. <br /> For the effects, I have never seen a less reliable wolf. I'm happy with Lone Chaney Jr. in chili. They look great like the beast they use ... well, some hair glued and some really awful animatronics like a guy with a cheap rubber suit. And, most people already know I have criticized CG, but my God is awful at it. A scene changes a woman, and starts with the CG version of the actress, but can be a cause of no nudity. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to look for positives in any film, and there are some. Cinematography is acceptable (the film is portraying all the digital ones, which is interesting) and the performances are not terrible. Tippy Haydron is the world's most well-established destitute woman, and Kane Hodder's title is also a bad guy. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger got all grown up and ... well, damn. And if you're looking for the skin, there are some cute tasty examples. <br /> <br /> If you like a good wolf film, try "an American wormhole in London", the original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers", "Dog Soldiers" or "Wolfen" ). If you're done with lycanthropy, then take a gamer. Otherwise, give this a miss.
