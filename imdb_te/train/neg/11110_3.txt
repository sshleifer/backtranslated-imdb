I like to watch this movie, I can not rate movies below a 5. For several months its many trailer bulbs on TV really want me to see this movie. <br /> When I saw that I brought Fearnet on demand, I got some popcorn that night and sat down to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The storyline is very intriguing - the way of the land. There is a photographer involved with missing people. Where are they going? What is happening to them One day, the photographer sees a connection between some of the photos he has taken, and is obsessed with the butcher, around him, yada yada. Although the plot is highly imaginative, there is a way you can absorb it. <br /> <br /> The plot, though predictable, is intriguing ... it's up to the end. "It's fine until the end ... it's just crazy," Jack_Slellington_Freckey told the Board of Directors. And I totally agree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not. Some Secret Society organisms are alive. Woo. How original. How dirty. How dull it will be. <br /> <br /> Come on Lionsgate. You have amazing imagery, but it's a sink.
