Take the tale Cinderella story. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty good bad step mother display. <br /> Visually some areas are excellent, but it's about it. From the Elizabeth Age to the 1990s, there were long dresses. <br /> If you're in a mood for a Cinderella story - "Ever After a Cinderella Story" or "Ever After a Cinderella Story" The Glass Slipper ".
