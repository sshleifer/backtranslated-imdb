Spoilers are this. The movie may be good if there is a script, director, and CGI provider in this movie. It is not right that the film has a person who opened his own theme park ... Zoo on a wrong island ... people can see dinosaurs ... wrong ... Sabretooths and this is called Jura ... Wow ... Primal Park. There are no original ideas for this kind of movies, but you have read the interview with this one, RPED L. Here also "the shadow head of the creature on the design". According to Mr. Primal Park (Just the Ancient Killing Cats), Sabretooths without Sabretothos is just jerk, a coronation accomplishment called "slaggy". Because one large cat is disposing, only one hero left, because there is only one left. Enter the unpleasant feeding person, naughty, we've done three, the third pulls its monster in front of it. Great, groovy. A team of college students was also a scavenger hunt on the island, where their teams had been tested to get the FRAT or some sort (always considered a little nickname). Only one of those living has done their job, so I got a kick. Yes, compulsory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" is not one of the Clik is in force, but two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is one of these films, the tooth jars loose (courtesy of Slaggi), slows some dimensions and weakens the man through the throat. If I stayed away very easily. I'm better off than this spin-off "Sabretooth".
