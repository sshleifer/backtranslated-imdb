Ruth Meyer's Kitten Activid of the film reputation played a chastiest woman who found her breast cancer, so she goes to South America, which has the ability to adapt to a particular fruit (crocus?). After falling down to some of the fruit (found on the trunk of the plaque), Chantity will have some magical powers that will make his double hero specially The Double D'Avenger. Notice that she also wears a pair of drops as a mask. In writing, all sounds pretty good. In effect, well, it is slightly higher than that. It has a pub for the cast and the local business strike is unhappy with the fact that some strippers (including the fame of Rus Meyer's film) went to destroy her because she was removing her business. Of course, Chastity returns in the pursuit of Double D Avenger's pursuit. See her "Wonder Woman" type spin change her dress and lose her balance due to high centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double enterprises fly as there is no tomorrow. Although it is not separated, it probably will be away with the PG-13 in the trash, but it is played with the contrasting 70's "Live Action" kid with adult content. And it is a blessing that is well covered by the diminished stars. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movies look better. What is a special show by Forest J. Ackermann Very stupid, and I never bought another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 10 to 2.
