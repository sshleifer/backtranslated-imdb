I have to watch the movie I started, not how bad it is. This film is sitting and grieving. Reporter with "ninja" bullets, moves, hundreds of bad guys and hundreds of bullets will shoot and hit only innocent spectators, predictable result and all the bad acting is just terrible. She's finding a reporter in the apartment of her friends and saying, "Hey, you're curled," "What are you doing on the heck (holding the bat)" in 1.2 seconds .... Just be bad ... save yourself an hour and forty minutes Play with your kids (or dog)!
