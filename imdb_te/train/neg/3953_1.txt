I can not believe this film is made. These people should be beaten with medicines and blunt objects. They should be tortured. This film is unpleasant. It's nothing but footage from the first film. Whatever the original is unrealistic and there is no sense. It is similar to the kind of drugs. Likewise, what is a mirror naked treatment? Moreover, Moron is unlikely to see the first film of this thread, while Suzanne Love's character is naked, they baked. I'm on the screen, "IT 'Lucky, IT LOSE !!!!" I felt like crying. I give it to 10 to 50. My god!
