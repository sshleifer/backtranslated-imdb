This may be a terrible appearance I have seen. Unlike the unscrupulous Sitcom about Hitler, it is neither funny nor entertaining. It is quite similar to the 1950s sitcom in its cornball ball humor and contrived situations, but it can do just like in Love Lucy, which is not just funny here. I feel that presentation was astonishingly "look, which Hitler thought to be a male sitcom figure" but in every case it's flat. The guy who plays Hitler is hard enough to sit in it alone. I wonder what maybe this network may be a good idea to wind up. I thought that America has some flawless performance, but the Brit has defeated us this time. Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiff, however, does not broadcast the sitcom on Hitler, though it has this show. Chances are you can never see this show because it's just an episode broadcast and never released on DVD.
