This program is a good example of how CBC should adapt to news, sports, or satiric sketch comedy. The situation has shown that the developer of humor can combine pizzas of "Kings of Kensington" with the belly smile of CBC "The Beachcombers". <br /> <br /> It is difficult for great performances such as "Kids in the Hall" and "Second City" that share their funny origins with this litter product. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " To begin with, half a concept in English-Canadian history, is a direct attempt to eliminate one of the few sitcom successes in "Corner Gas". The rest of the concept - the cultural clash - from a very original and very often used a crutch for lazy writing. The choice of Muslim's choice of "water fish" roles is "desperate" and "timeless" but desperately trying to escape. Some jokes based on the local response to the newcomers are intellectual and utterly insulting to every participant, especially the audience. <br /> How does this program work with CBC? When Canada creates content, especially as a multicultural environment, Canada does not "get it". Cultural diversity in Canada does not lead such a huge force and force. The CBC will make a refreshing change to participate in a TV show about diversity in the program. I suspect the CBC has enough sitcom talent to pull out something sensitive enough. The variation in the corner gas can be compared with the way it is applied - i.e. The primitive characters are not separated by their race or their legacy used to generate storylines. More realistically, their lives and other characters survive in a way that makes the breed more important than their other personal characteristics. <br /> <br /> A formulaic fish-out-of-the-water comedy this show failed. The acting was weak, the comic passing across the map, and the storytelling I thought was very ridiculous, even for comedy. Only talented Derek McGrath, who is devious to be here to be saved. Guest actors (Colin Mochrie, for example, an Anglican Archbishop) doubt that this dog can be saved. After CBC's 'hype' died down, I decided to give the show a chance; But the two episodes can all stand out - I can not almost feel my experience of shutting myself off with a failed punchline everywhere. Time-slot will be served by more coronation Street Stream, Air Furry, or Doctor Who. An infomercial is also an improvement.
