The problem I found with this title is that I do not know if the director is trying to build a documentary or movie. The composition of the two genres simply does not work, and the whole thing is hanging somewhere in the middle. The director chooses the most seriousness of making a suspicious documentary that takes place in our everyday life. If it is a thriller / drama it is very dull and unchanged. In any case, what is the moral or message the director is trying to the audience? Do we keep others around us who misuse others who are ill? Are there many crazy lunatics around us? So .......... So what?
