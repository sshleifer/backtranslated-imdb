It is disappointing to see this DVD after many years. The main problem for me is the uneven script. <br /> Though some of it is witty and hip, it's a little dull, infamous and lifeless. <br /> <br /> The cast, May West and Rachel Wellch are coming up well. Rusty shines in the role of Roger Herren (many films did not). But for my money, John Huston is just too much, and poor Rex Reed rarely gives a fight chance. <br /> <br /> The public opinion of the film should give a lower user rating. Vidal's original pretty much wasted. Even the 'classic' film made a lot of clips. Not all are trying to get a rather sub par, and it is unlikely to get much better with time.
