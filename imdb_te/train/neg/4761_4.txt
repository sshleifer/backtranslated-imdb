Harold Pinter visits her boyfriend's husband and writes Anthony Schaefer's classic drama about the man who sits on the sidewalk. The original film was Laurence Oliver and Michael Caine. Cain has in this version the role of Oliver and he joined Jude. Here is directed by Kenneth Bran. <br /> This act is wonderful. Both Cain and La are Gangbusters in their roles. I really like the chemistry and the controversy of individuals. <br /> <br /> The horror pinter's dialogue is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why I have chosen to use the recording cameras to understand how the characters move around. Michael Caine goes for a walk with doors and panels through his odd modern house. Conversations take place repeatedly in different areas. I know that Pinter has done in his dramas, but in this case it is bad. Why do we add to the fact that La's sleeping with Ken's wife? If at some point this is exactly what we have done, it will not work for the first time. The script also did not correctly direct the cannon to its manipulation. He is blindly angry to start, so he does not have to turn around and scare us. (Do not be late for the revelation of the game to make you wonder why he is sad) Did we never really believe? Here we are and we give it an edge but it's somewhat wrong because we need to be surprised why it's not clear that we're not set in Los's. <br /> <br /> When I think about this film, I feel it's missing opportunities and mistakes. Chances of having good fireworks between Cain and La The choice of a gorgeous arrangement and odd shifts in an unhappy take away from the creation of a tension and reliable thriller. <br /> <br /> Despite some great performances and witty dialogs, it is only 10 to 4. Because the rest of the script just does not work
