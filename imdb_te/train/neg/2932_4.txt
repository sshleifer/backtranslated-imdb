He does not have to care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. I have a good chance that if we continue to make the implications like this, we will fall. In trouble, he found a successful formula for the male, the normal guy-next-door run, Fat Boy Run Run in Dump's Shawn, but it started to wear thin. Here his character has no intellectual qualities, he is barbaric and evil, and he feels funny when he is not clear. When transferred from London to New York (and I think this link should appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he is equal to his new colleagues. However, between his Jolly Jupiter he appoints a bright stripper to take revenge for his employer at an editorial meeting. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dante starts to warm him, even though he's done nothing nice. Oh, and he drops for Megan Fox at first glance because he is a superficial male, probably because his character is as absent as his. It makes for all the imaginative film resolution, but I can not say that it reflected any viewer in their life. A cast of precious value on the paper as insult. Peg, though, plays himself, seems to be even though Kirsten Dunst does not merely make movements on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox does not stretch at all. A large plus Miriam Margolis is Peg's New York Landroad - now if she's on screen for a long time ...
