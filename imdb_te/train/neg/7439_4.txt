A different look at the horror. Styling differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But this is not good from my American perspective. Mary did not play the role of Anastasia Hilly, and she found it difficult to find her. Her time is disagreeable too much time and there is no confusion for what most of the time left. Moreover, she spent a lot of time taking her to the mainstream of the film. It's been a long time before any real suspense. As it once happened, the volume was used as a major influence, which is more annoying than anything. This concept is much more direct than video-video images and they do not use sex to make a narrow plot. All in all, I would recommend renting, but not for the theater.
