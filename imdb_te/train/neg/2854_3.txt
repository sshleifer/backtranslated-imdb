Dreyfus plays the role of a mob owner who lost his mind, but now he is "stable". <br /> <br /> Lane is his young girl with her number one (Gold Blame), which she needs to do with Lane's sister (Barkin). Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle McLachlan and Richard Pierre), Dreyfus proves he is not "sustainable" and tries to kill everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> It's not like you do not know what's coming. <br /> <br /> If Gold Blum is trying to tell you about the first ten minutes when Dreyfus is out, I'll save you all the problems. This film is because I'm on a Diane Lane kick lately and she is trying to see all the movies. The real let-down is not the only horrible story for me, but the fact that she does not show up until the last fifteen minutes of the film (though we hear about her through the movie). Fan does not enjoy the film even for more than half of the cast. <br /> <br /> I am laughing at what really happens to the components of the suspense mount. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 stars
