Well, I first saw this movie at Cinemax at 9:00 a few weeks ago and thought I was awarded. This film is a bit big. I mean, the mother of the monsters will only show at the end of the film his last form. I'm going to say "That's it? Why does not this picture show briefly in advance?" This young woman is the mother of the mother and the son of the donkey. If you go and they are not good, you know, sheriff or a policeman and have a way to kill the demons to get into the old, kill every young couples killing a couple, killing spree, killing the girl / woman, and 1 or 2 killed in this process? I think that would be a hell of a lot better. It sucks because he is the main character of the son and he gets killed first. Why first remove a mother? And what kind of strength did she have when the men started killing her at the end of the film? She said she was weak. This time with Stephen what the heck effect? At any time, I can never do any acting with any actor, after all, they make their best effort. If this is not for good acting, I've given this film 1/10. 3/10.
