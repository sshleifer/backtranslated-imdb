For a loyal Duran Duran fans who want to see a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to make creativity and make this 80 video video of this site-fiction article, featuring the bandbarella villain who had the band's name. <br /> <br /> The idea fails to show confusing and annoying cut scenes from some great 80 Durran Duran songs, a fictional rivalry trying to stop the band in one of their concerts. Good music is not only repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer by some cheap spin-off story hosted by a bad doctor Mario. It's almost too much to endure. 2/10
