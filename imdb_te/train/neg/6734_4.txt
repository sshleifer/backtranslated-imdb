I think this movie is a great idea, it did not deliver. They seem to have found a way to build suspense, but can not make their payments better. In one case there were police, the clock to find the secret base of kidnappers. The dentist from the dentist suffers from a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all is built, the police come at the same time he gets free, which is a very negative atmosphere to say the least. There are also large commentary scenes that take us inside the "thought" of the horrific husband and wife, which adds to it rather than removes the suspense. We have learned all about their tension, and the voice-over is a disgrace and the hatchcock time and again it's back, and the experience of personal experience terrifies. Great frustration, the whole image is sitting by, and get fast, instead of bland ended. I mean ... "ends up" in a snoring.
