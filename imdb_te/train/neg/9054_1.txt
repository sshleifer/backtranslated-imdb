If you hate redneck notes, you hate this movie. And to make it worse, you'll see Patrick Swayze, trying to be a red neck. I can not really stand in redneck voices. I liked Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Sling Blade, but he was very annoyed in the film. And what kind of name is Earl? How much can hekki get this film? The storyline is stupid. I'm not generally judgmenting these movies, but I could not stand this film. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton film, see Sling Blade. <br /> <br /> My mother has found this movie for $ 5.95 at Vault Mart ... I will close it, to my Grand for Christmas. It's usually not that I can not stand redneck vocals or I can not stand the Patrick Swayze. Patrick Swayze is not it. I never laugh at once in the movie. I'm laughing at something stupid. If they hit someone's fingers, I might have laughed. Due to the dangers, people always smile at me and smile at me.
