I am a big horror / publisher fan, some people are stupid. I like gore. <br /> <br /> When I read other people's reviews on the site, I did not think the film would be a little gem. <br /> <br /> My disappointment has proven to be one of the most nonsensical films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is awful, dialogues are stupid, plotless, special effects are useless and may have been compiled by someone who has died for the last 2 years. Normally I find these features make a great b horror movie. But this is not the case. <br /> I have reached EUR 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /> If you do not really understand Gorel (for example "violent sh * t" movies) without any cost!
