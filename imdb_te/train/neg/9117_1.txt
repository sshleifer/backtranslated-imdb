... or it's just this bad. The cheapest of the plot is the cheapest rehearsal, which is unrealistic, because it's a prequel, not a sequel. Pretty much the whole movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, things that happened in the first, just with the most ridiculous and possibly mimicking scenes. Where there are first great actors, it has a B-list actors and refuses. Acting is terrible. Almost every major character, including those who are not in the first film, will take directly from the first half of the good lines of the film. I realized that this TV series was made by the pilot episode, but it did not need any. They do not need to change the footage (bad) footage into a film. One thing is only good, and it's sexy scenes. Nevertheless, they are not the first, but it is not even better than 1 rating. If you have the opportunity to see it for free, and if you're a straight person, want something romantic that is not romantic, worth checking out. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. 1/10
