This is one of the few episodes of a controversial error in its heroic nature (not the only one). Christopher claims when the ralphi situation is in place and he heard about the death of pie-o-ma in the fire. This is an important detail because it is clear that Christopher is known to be the man who killed Ralfi in this setting. But I heard Chris about this accident. When should I tell you By no means nobody knows that he is torn from his ambition by Tony's call. Tony knows - it makes it even worse! Christopher's discussion of pie-o-my death, so Chris could drive Toni to the end that she had fire. I think the authors of the DVD reminded me of what they said and did not really understand any of the issues that gave me an extensive writing process. The story does not work that way. I do not think that Sopranos is a huge fan. Otherwise, I certainly do not care.
