I am ready to enjoy a powerful image of the Farah Fouset's The Burning Bed, when she is interviewed by Julia Roberts and her abusive and sick husband who played the role of Patrick Berg. Well, in essence I was mistakenly-major. The film is not like a burning bed, it has the power and Farrah has played the role of a woman you really feel, and felt that she was in need of pain and her life. While Roberts was killing herself, leaving her husband and going to live in Iowa, the first act of sleeping after Elimi led to cheap thrills. Although her husband believes she is dead, she is still alive and is suspicious of her departure. The rest of the film is mainly a cat and mouse game in a small town in Julia Iova and has changed her identity ... There is no mention of how she earned this money but at this point the film did not care. She meets a man (Mr. Nice Wink) and drops for him and her husband finally encounters her but she makes the kitchen straight and before setting up soup bins. I thought it was a cheap thrill to the audience. As I said, she has cheated the audience because she is a disadvanting wife and I do not care much. If she is of course and she may have felt the condition and for her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all the little ol Ms Roberts is better. If the real world is close to it then you can see the burning bed and think of a film on the subject of domestic abuse.
