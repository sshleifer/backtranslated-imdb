Body plot (though a B-movie is good), good fast paced fight scenes, a lot at 5. But something has ever suffered me about this film: How Mariska Hargitay never speaks? In the TV version, she shares a very close moments with Jeff Spuckman, a kiss in a garden. In a more general (video) version, she sees a lot of scenes and she can never speak. It hurt me because it's a woman (even if cliche) will not only view the view of the film, but make the final shot cool. She has kept her scenes in the film because at least one of those scenes has her own personality, which Speakerman says.
