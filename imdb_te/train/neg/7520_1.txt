This film proves that you can not confirm a movie through the amazing artwork on the DVD movie. It shows that you must learn more about an image before you buy (or get it for someone at Christmas). The film is somewhat fine in the beginning. Well, until you meet the characters. The pumpkin jack (old man from Street Down) brings the co-eds to the book completing the witch's spells, leaving their annual haunted house (where it takes place). Then some people are drunk, fighting, and soft core romance. <br /> <br /> Overall, the halves end is imaginable, unforgettable, and a reflection of soft-major pornography. This film is not good, it's good with a group of friends, because this is a good movie to make fun. And for the first time, it is fun to make expectations in the order of the people who die.
