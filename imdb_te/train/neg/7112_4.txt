Well I have to admit one of my favorites like this kid, when used as a home projector to watch a Super 8 Reel. There is not much to recommend it other than the value of the inherent camp of the actors who are currently "terrified" by replicas for human skulls. <br /> <br /> But special sets are very stupid, most of which are wires on the wires and the "ghost" images are pinned. <br /> <br /> The big building this is going to be pretty cool, especially not the most unseen (probably for budget reasons). <br /> It certainly laughs more than shouts. Wife (she is more than throwing herself) go to the greenhouse and do not get giggled when she struggles with her husband's ghost.
