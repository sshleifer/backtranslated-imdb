Oh dear. I was disappointed that this film was just ripped off by Japan's Ringu. Well, I made the US its version, but at least it was a remake remake. So, so sad. I know I can enjoy watching so many Filipino movies and some great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe I got this happen. Claudine and Chris such big names were surprised that they were affiliated with Plagiarism. Interested filmmakers what they think in the Philippines: You do not have to cut this low level to earn money. There are many movie fans who have been watching the film and watching movies enjoying them!
