I really began to believe that Seagal was in a mission to see how his films were getting ready. This film is full time and full of waste to see. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD. And as he looks worse in the film, he looks younger and younger. His big pat belt and double chin appear to him and his face as the most tedious and frustrating. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is startling and ridiculous for removing too long. The entire film has led to Seagal and his band's top secret military chemical adrenaline increase, leading to the ending of some individuals. In the midst of a very useless conversation and a statement, Seagull's voice is not a joke and stable dubbing. Voice has sounded like a human being with a frog in his voice and is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes in this film are terrible. Half time ht during Seagal Foug could not see what was going on. The person who flapping his hands at the camera and then flies through the wall or something will have tight shots. It is reminiscent of old Kung Fu series on television. <br /> <br /> I am confident that this movie is a worst movie and I have not bought this movie or I am a big fan of it. Seagal the Akidodist. The action star is quickly deteriorating and deteriorating with each performance.
