I did not complete the film. I do not have the right to review it in this regard, especially adversely. But I will do it because I can not see now when I stop ... I've got more than half, and I said it's good for me to do something good. The film is very tiresome, so I'm really shy. I did not read a lot of other reviews, so if two gay people teens, I'm homosexual, I've gone through "the same", the day dreams, the problems etc. There may be two moments where I feel that I can go somewhere out there, where I thought I might have some meaning or relativity, but these hopes came to the next set of cliché-tasteless narrative. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you will not hear the fluctuation play, or echo-eyed fades if you read the quotes, they miss the most painful / ridiculous / stupid. I gave the film three stars and went to the filmmaker's films that made a stunning job of trying to change the "feelings" of Archer's tiredness to the three stars. You do not mind, he's not the one who decided to include all of the longest shots of TV clopes ... another unnecessary cliché in the films like Corens Gammo has already been completed ... I'm very good at displaying this film (by way of the volunteer performances he enjoyed by Archer). .) Because Sundance is such a festival , Where Clive's huge drewwill is still accepted as an "arthouse". No, it's not the arts house, I'm just plain s ** t-house. Do not look.
