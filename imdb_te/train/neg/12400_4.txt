Matte Cardill is back from dead for the third go round, although I'm not sure I'm sure this time except MANICA COP fans. The death of Cardiff, who died in the last movie, was resurrected by Voodoo, and now it is hotter that the attempt of many miscreants involved in the shooting of fellow officer Cordel is too hot. I missed part of this early '90s low-budget fast, but it was pleasing to see the Cordell wracking of body count in various, grisly ways. The problem is, the whole picture is very stable, and Cordell is not just Jason or Freddie. The interest is pretty, and the Big Movie Master ends with his brains with Robert Forster. At the same time funny and scary and exciting, it is the stick with the first image in the series.
