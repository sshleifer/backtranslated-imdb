I initially found it hard to build the Eden Curve very poorly. However, I must say how the director captured the atmosphere at the beginning of the 70s in the setting of the settings and clothing. The "liberated" ground-breaking philosophy and dramatic sexual exploitation and drugs interest, which is right as many of the later versions of the 70s are painted, are not "disliked" as genuine liberalism with fake-east-coastal intellectuals, rather than New England school than one in Virginia I thought here that "good ole boy" mentality still dominates Two, one. Another thing I appreciated and relate to is that this homosexuality is not quite a lot of leathermen or drag queens and I think it is a time to appreciate some gay characters related to these horrible overused images. I thought it was unfortunate that in the 80s of Castro and Christopher Streets they had taken "homosexuality" in some standard forms and that they defended this movement and left a large number of gay men who were more dominant in their lifestyle. I mainly appreciate the way to remember a more natural way about our sexuality and personal relationships that are not "the scene."
