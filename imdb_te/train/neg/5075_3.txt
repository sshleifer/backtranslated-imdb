The animation is great, however, not entirely original, however, the story is too long, very confusing and the top is dramatic. About an hour later I can not wait to come with it. The movie is not really a movie that does not come anywhere or go somewhere, and a mini-series or perhaps two films are better. If you like this kind of unique story you would like it, but apparently, I've had some message to tell the fact that I've been spoiled by more creative stories. Go to Miyazaki's movie and watch it twice and you will come out of it.
