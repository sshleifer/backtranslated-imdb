I like looking at the early colored pictures - that means the 40th garments are not gray. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford has overtaken the film. Her "phenomenal" cloth is actually attractive and yes, she is an amazing miniature figure. But I feel her head was given too much. She has probably developed this role in many shows, and no one ever says, "If it comes to a smile, leave it out." She is very worried about her when she is surprisingly surprised by the earth. Madame Arcade joke is a medium that media are usually portrayed as long daring women. The archery behaves like a retired headmistress (we really put it in our backs!). <br /> <br /> All actors English (except Cummings) think that Americans use "words" because "Brit", "hard", "lip" and "upper". Oh, give it a rest! The three main characters constantly lose their temper and make dangerous comments (he loved you? Yes, but very clever - he's in cavalry!).
