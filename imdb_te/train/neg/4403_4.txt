Despite the film's greatness, it is much less investigated. As others have suggested, the film will be used to speak in Arabic rather than in Persia. It's enough to lose credibility to anyone with little knowledge of the region or country. <br /> Other realistic disadvantages: A train in Afghanistan is shown, but Afghanistan has no railways. Although the Turkish ambassador wore a fez (red cap), fir was banned by Turkey before the film was set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually an Indian, and has played Indian classical music in the face of several scenes. I think the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and they decided that Sari would make her exotic.
