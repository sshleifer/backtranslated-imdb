<br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, I have a low budget, read the review reviewed by the film and now I will take care of my work. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters have been able to animate well, but it is implemented in a violent manner. Combat scenes are not a shot of the monster with a very close interaction then it's a shot of an actor. When the monster interacted it looked like it happened in Paintshop Pro. In my opinion you should use patterns and puppets if you have a low budget. They may not be fancy but at least they interact with each other, let's look at the early pictures of Peter Jackson's. <br /> <br /> Acting has done a job for Beowulf but did not forget the other cast or they did not forget. <br /> <br /> Here the script seemed confusing to me. They talk a minute that you have a modern day after the play club Shakespeare's speech. <br /> <br /> "Beowulf is not talking about the rest of the movies, the gods and the emblems, initially citing old testimony. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
