I personally found that the film was very bad, at first it was very rare and offered one side of the discussion. Some people from the Billy Grammar revival claim that he existed. The second is that Yeshua existed from its emotional point of view, talking about violent Christianity, and Mel Gibbs shows scenes from "The Passion". Eventually, the former Principal of the Conservative Private School interview is interviewed, and the children are trying to catch him there for the faith. Oh and even techno music made it difficult to just watch.
