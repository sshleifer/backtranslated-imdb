When some other comments are shown when you are a child, this film can threaten you. <br /> <br /> However, if you're older, this movie makes only one thing: basically suck - and so I'm not acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. Something. I'm talking about "plots" (you can call it). <br /> <br /> "If you want to see this movie after reading this one, but if you graduate from any school, this is a big insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> We believe that it is bad. Is it also bad? <br /> <br /> In this way, there is no need to impose on the people in this way. Why Hell (no pun intended) are they doing? <br /> <br /> There is no one to be considered a "true Christian" in the film, to say that stupid prayer. So ... just pray before the Rapture and you are saved - what's OK? <br /> In this way, rating is 1/10
