The film was written about mediocrity, laziness and thoughtful thinking. If you're going to have a movie about vampires who have already done different times, you're doing a good job. I said that this film was not cut off. Some horror / horror movies "all stories are just lying" fail to break the mold of something forbidden and left for fun. <br /> <br /> This is unfortunately, scary, not different, and like all the frightening films, the heroes know how to do the same job throughout the movie and over, but then secretly they can not be wrapped in the moment and at the end to get a job? The end is a very opposite atmosphere and spelling part 3 which I do not see. Terrible picture.
