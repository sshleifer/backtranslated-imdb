There are two reasons why I did not give this film 1. One reason was that actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwyneth Walsh) tried to play a good level of their acting. But in most scenes they are blocked by some bad scripting. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The other reason is <br /> <br /> It is very bad in the movie. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. It is the first film for many actors. This is a very interesting story, but they have completely failed.
