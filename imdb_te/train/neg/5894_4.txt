How many centuries do Japanese / Asian horror films revert to the long-furry ghost-feminine shtick? "Ringu" was stripped a million times, and it worked very well - this is not necessarily true in horror genre (or I am very confused and want to ease it?). However, this time I found a short break, somewhat bored. It's not a bad movie, but with its absurd 110-minute length, it's more than half an hour. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC is not atmosphere and excitement. Moreover, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense. For the ring-tone: Mickey can come with a melody better than a little bit of a forgettable. It's a dozen times, but I can not even remember it - how scary it is. Talking about Michael, it was a commercial effort. Therefore, if anyone believes that they can get "BitTa Q" or "audition", they waste their time.
