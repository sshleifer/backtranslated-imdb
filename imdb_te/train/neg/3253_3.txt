Before I saw the original O'Brien, I saw China O'Brien II. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = ridiculous! And funnier = is good. If I'm a bad movie fan like you, it's great. However, if you are looking for a meaningful plot, acting ability or movie making expertise, this is the best. The best part is how they rapidly filmed all the fighting sequences that are stuttering forward. Happy and bad. Look for a laugh out of it, look for vacuum entertainment, but whatever you're doing, watch it free on TV.
