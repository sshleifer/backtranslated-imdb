Plan B has a look-out, unedited, sloppy script appearance for an image with an outing attempt for actors - a holiday that should be nixed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloney (Paul Sorvino) is another mafia-based comedy by Joe Maal (Paul Sorvino), who is more concerned about clothing and exhibitions than his business. Control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony Dessdo) is regarded as Dumbler and his ignorance is more funny than dust. Maloney took one of her debtors (Bunshan Fran-Dai Keaton married) and her assistant in Ma'loye's 'Hitman' by taking him to his assistant Fran. Fran feared his own shade and could not manage Mancini's tasks until she did not hide herself from her brother James home in Florida. This alternative to kill these three candidates is Plan B, Plan A to kill them! <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has done a lot of good films and one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams and hurts to see quickly through the chaos and the crowded section. Paul Sorvino is kind of Paul Sorvino from other Mobster films. The supporting cast is also allowed to play the balcony in the broad slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. Any comedy is just silly and overly stupid. Director Greg Yeatons has to go back to TV sitcom: this similar story is shortened to a half hour performance, which may have a chance. Grady Harp
