The 1999 film critic has led the masses. For the first time they tears us. Then they advertised the Blair witch project and now MAGNOLIA is the worst movie. What about it? Heck knows who. Loaded with its full self-joy and bad acting. I always wanted to be in credit and see, but when this thing was over I could not get enough speed from the movie theater. When most of the viewers showed me that I was in the same way, it was felt the same way. Dates argue with each other and with strangers. An ugly and hateful image that you feel ugly and hateful.
