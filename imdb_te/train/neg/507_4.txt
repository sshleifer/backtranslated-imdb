In contrast to my fellow critics, I always try to get rid of any movie I see. Yes, the quality of dubbing and lighting is alien, acting is wood and all that lascivious woman with lesbian dampers dripping blood. In Italian, something must be lost in translating the term "bloodsucker"; Although the producers initially portrayed the Gothic Vampire story and did not change their minds, their dramatic opening sequence could not be lost, but it was cast into the film anyway. <br /> <br /> In recent years, the DVD was issued in 1975 and comes with its own theatrical trailer, in some respects more daring than in the movie! If you buy this movie now, it will probably know what its reading and what it reads. I was attracted to Christ Nelli ("Krista Nell"), because I bought it. I missed the cast of the most disappointing characters in these Eurosleaze movies from the 60s & 70s. It was thought that the cast of Impeb characters was shown in the film but without casting the cast, it would be difficult for the actor to pair with them. Although Christa Nell plays "Cora", under that heavy hair style, the dress and make-up are harder. <br /> <br /> They have two dimensional drawings by actors and no one really stands out. You will lose something in the dubbing process. What are the ordinary points? If you have its beautiful into beautiful gentle soft romance there's music and of course there. External locations are good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island. This is the "Ireland" ("Ireland" North RR Republic?) In 1902, everyone sports sports clothes. And some sex scenes I have especially noted in those sex scenes. Whatever enjoyment romp.I rated it 4/10.
