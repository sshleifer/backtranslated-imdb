I was a real horror film that I felt confusing by watching forty minutes or I was standing. Actors mistake, but the writer / director, producers, economists, etc., need to speak very strongly. Perhaps it is very deep. It's not. Clockwork or Orange is neither centered nor included in this rape and ultra-violence, human understanding. It's no straw dogs, which, which I've seen compared to. <br /> <br /> Pet Walker says he's a little unfair on Peter Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful human desire, but the bed window is much more to say about the male victim than this pitiful attempt. <br /> <br /> It is not exclusively detailed, and is not just as pleasing in some detail - GA leg post rape, for example. <br /> <br /> I feel that the filmmakers are very brave in this film. Why do the participants want to do movies?
