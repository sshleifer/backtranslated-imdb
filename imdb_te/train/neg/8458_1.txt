I bought this film last weekend in my local movie gallery. Buy It 2 ​​Get 2 free and I need one more if I chose this one. Terrible mistake. It reads the box that it is a good movie. Well, it starts to be this great movie. About 5 minutes, ie. The film is a life, a laila, a bull from his bun, tries to save Jack. Laila's father, the cordobes and the urban people were scared. He kills Jack Laila for fearing this bull, and goes on the hunt to find him. It's fine for the first 5 minutes. What happens next is 100 times more chin. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, has some kind of acid trip or something else, no one has ever made any sense. Jack is on the run and the travel radio DJ is named Mary, who gives a ride. Mary wants a virgin Mary type. You know Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I can not make heads or its tails. When they're running, we see bad guys, magical visions, soulful encounters, flashbacks, etc ... And these things happen when you're trying to figure out what happens to your brain. No need to say, I took the film back and changed it for something else. It's terrible, I was terrible. And, in this film there is absolutely no bull-fight. If you do not calculate the first minute of the film. I hope some other people have helped to waste their time in the film.
