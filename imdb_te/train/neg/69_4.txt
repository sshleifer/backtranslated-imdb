I thought it was a very clunky, unwinning version of this famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom are very good in their roles, and their characters have given some personality; But the whole thing is forced and mechanical. <br /> The beginning may be more involved; Perhaps a shootout starts, and then they get back there, or just repeat how it's going to be that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> I am really excited for this film, and I am hoping for something better. The only thing I can say about it is that the Mick Jagger hit the version, but not too much.
