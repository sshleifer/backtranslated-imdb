"Attack of the killer tomatoes!" No one can ever imagine this topic with a title), a bad science fiction film or b) comedy comedy for bad science fiction films. <br /> <br /> This is a very confusing one in the movie. 'I think it's funny, right? I found some of the jokes or situations funny (i.e., side-by-side phone conversations, Russian Olympic spy steroid cereals, Superman Lewis etc.). "Attack of the killer tomatoes" makes it a cult classic, but it is not made. A cult classic image is very different, which means only one selected group (or similar description). <br /> <br /> "Attack of the killer tomatoes" can be enjoyed by humor in the age of eight, so it does not qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is a good actress who is the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Luis Fair Child. She is a thin, junky reporter, but has a lovely personality, loves to overtake, and a natural comedian. <br /> <br /> "Attack of Killer Tomatoes" is not as funny as saying "Amazon Woman on the Moon" or "Kennedy Fried Movie", but it's a few happy moments, so I still recommend watching it once. Avoid producers' cut, which has disruptions by some "lost" footage called filmmaker and detective African dialect (which is found in print from English).
