I accidentally ended watching this movie. I do not know whether I'm worried or not. I felt like watching a movie made by a group of non-cut movie schoolmates. Every Hollywood Clich is imaginative, if we exploit us at all times 'Corporations ultimate evil' message. The image is not known. <br /> <br /> The story is a fantasy world where a computer hunt has come true. The main character is an attractive young boy for a girlfriend and a programming intellectual and clear hacker (I think) in the fantasy-cum-true aspects that many of you might want to see for yourself. <br /> Also, when I see Ned Bellamy it's a z-movie ... he's a good tip-off. <br /> One, I was scared.
