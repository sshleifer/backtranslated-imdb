Johnny and Jeremy types vampires. Of course minus fangs. They're dark and bitter creatures with nothing better than spreading their own misery. Their charm (ie sharp tongue and fat bag, respectively) were betrayed by dejected souls, who were tortured and victims. <br /> <br /> This is very small for this black comedy. <br /> <br /> It's not a mix of black humor, I can easily subscribe, some of the audience quietly, the main character. However, I enjoyed the sound and the melody of the fast-fire (and very witty) words. The casting's strong performance, especially impressed by David Thelis; Jeremy's role was only bi-dimensional. Both photography and music, both dramatic and depressing, work well together. <br /> <br /> "Naked" (and the main reason that I never recommend to anyone) is to think of something that is really unsuccessful for me. In other words, in a world that is absorbed badly in the world, if the girls have some pain, what makes it any difference? Suggesting (some are on this website) Johnny is not a very bad person, because he is not as hard as Jeremy as girls and is totally insulting to me. They are two terrible, nasty people. They are keen to get a chance every time they are damaging to women. If his bad karma suddenly came back and bit him in the donkey, he argued that Johnny finally deserved. But still, his and Jeremy's cruel behavior is treated with some degree as a smiling thing. And I may be wrong, but I have found that many people who love this film are dark and funny about the movie.
