This film has its negative comments and I have to agree to those who consider one of the worst movies I've ever made. Of course, images are very bad on the basis of King's works, but it's bad in this horrible terrain. If you do not consider stupid panic, it will not be afraid once. This is the general king's worst - it is surprising for the first time that Peev's playhouse (which is, at least, fun), which it is surprising and madly called "fears". It's filled with ridiculous moves, in which there is no role of Alice Krig. When she begins to crush a villain and a villain in the old Batman TV show, it is irrelevant to be unsatisfactory. In this role (including John Landis) all the people are lucky, they still have a career. But the most nonsensical part is the cat's clothes at the end of the look as cheap rubber clothing purchased at K-mart. The best part of the film is found in realistic cats, which actually affect the people of the film.
