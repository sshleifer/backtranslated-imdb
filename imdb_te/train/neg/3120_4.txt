I really did not expect much from "The Night Listener" and actually never listen to me until I saw the cover in the video store. However, it is effective when creating a suspension and tension structure. On occasion it drags a little bit, but it really helps you keep wondering what's really going on and what's more important: when. When the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams, "cat and mouse" spiel can be seen individually for a kind 14-year-old kid. The Night Listener is an interesting story, it's great to create a suspense throughout the movie and you are pretty much a liar and the truth is kept in the dark. However, ultimately it's kind of disappointing and does not meet the potential to have it. It does not really give a detailed or acceptable explanation about the other main character, which is useful and interesting.
