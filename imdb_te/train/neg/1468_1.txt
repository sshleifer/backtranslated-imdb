Wonderful cast acting fairy cast. Ten or older people returned to the summer camp when they were infants. Is it possible to happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy, and a boring one. Are they teenagers again? Will they resume their pranks, games, and good times? They may try but ultimately answer: Is there no conspiracy? What a suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. Nobody is entertained by this bed is beyond me. I like this film; I like this movie, but my brain has refused.
