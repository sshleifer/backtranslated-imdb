Many years ago I saw this movie and I was surprised by one thing, I could not see any ransom in movies: Dennis Quaid did not act as an actor, his smile and laughter two of his trademarks. Danny Glover is a bad guy, but - again - he can not trust him in the role as many viewers expect. In addition, Jared Leto is not a former pharmacist. Tension is not just because the killer knows so much earlier. The end, again, is not dramatic or confusing: no one around me cares about what's going on next. We can wait to see the end of the movie. All in all, disappointing evening at the cinema.
