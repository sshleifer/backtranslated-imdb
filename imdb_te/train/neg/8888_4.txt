I rated the Basic Instinct 2 top level, and the film was less than 4 ratings. The film was only 4 out of me, but it was over 7.3 out of 600. <br /> <br /> The film is bored and rarely leaves those chambers in a broken big house. There are only 5 people in the film. It is almost unnecessary for almost two hours. Many conversations are slow and meaningless. The film tone is also dark blue, which is discouraging to see. <br /> <br /> The film is reminiscent of "Three Times", directed by Howard Hosien, one that is equally boring, dialogues are evenly boring. It also has a high rating! <br /> <br /> When the first story ended, I had to stop watching. <br /> <br /> This film is not a passion or excitement.
