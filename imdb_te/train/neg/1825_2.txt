I'm not sure. I did not laugh at it. I have an open mind. I want to be strong-about-ss. But in this movie I can not smile too much. It's not funny for me. Some parts such as Ben Stiller and Jack Black have been very difficult. This does not mean that this is a wonderful comedy because you put two very funny men. Some movies should not be done. This is one of them. It's just a lot of old jokes and acting just stupid. I know, I know it's funny. At least sort. But I did not impress. I'm sorry, but I can not give it less than these two. And that's all I am giving. <br /> <br />
