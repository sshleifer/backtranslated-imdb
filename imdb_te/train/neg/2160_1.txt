The gods ... where to start. The first 10 minutes before I started to bite was in the stomach. Although the actor lost the role of Robin Hood, the rest were just terrible. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the first episode, I have not been able to figure out how many bugs, plot holes, and terrible clothes. Some poor farmers are trying to hunt for a deer to eat his family. All is well and good. <br /> <br /> Poor armor was more deaf because some soldiers were able to insert him within 10 feet on horseback. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Then, he runs a few kinds of shrubs and immediately dismisses the soldiers ... Just a few seconds ago, a dozen-foot-to-back horse was pulled off. <br /> <br /> The soldiers of "armor" are very painfully clothed, which look like maillays, and have failed miserably. In fact, the main soldier "armor" is too big in 5 sizes for poor peers. He looks like he's a little boy wearing his dad's high-sized armor, he looks! Finally, Robin will show a perfect goal from the sight of a handful of 5 soldiers and within a span of 5 seconds, as a recursive bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they can not escape the soldiers and stop helping them get dressed up wonderfully. And digging a digest and clean "farmer" ... all the superiors are ready to perform all the time, right? How to forgive this sorry for a series has always crossed me for the second season. Dozens of dollars (or euros) in production costs (at least for what I've seen) have gone up ... <br /> <br /> I feel that a high school drama class has a better composition. It's very bad, Robin Hood's terrible Kevin Costner version is also good. <br /> <br /> I would like to go beyond this stereotype and rent out and buy a "Robin of Sherwood" in the mid 80s. <br /> The shame, the BBC ... for disrespect ...
