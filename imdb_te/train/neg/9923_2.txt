When I wrote this review in 2008, we were caught in a remake culture. Film studios are determined to destroy many classic films, including King King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and Michael Cain. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon but proof of 'Doug for the Do-Do'. The surreal masterpiece of Bob Clumpet adds some new comics that are framed by Fridge Frelen, with a completely nonsensical version of 'Porky in the Wallwand', a splash color of Clumpett's original footage. The director does not fully comprehend the fringe material of the Frangel Clumpet, and in fact, the director is expected to come close to Clampt inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, 'Doug for the Do-Do' is no more than a classic raffle with a horror new title. For cartoon fans like me, equal to the colorfulness of Casablanca.
