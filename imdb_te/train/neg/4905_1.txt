I'm usually disappointed with network movies. Fix, which attracts big actors, is also ruined by TV people. However, it is even worse. The screenplay is weak and acting, especially the tracey polon's abomination. I looked at my children and looked very good at school dramas. Polon works as she reads when she speaks. When she tries to express her fear, anger or sorrow, it is very hollow. I'm hard to take seriously because of the overall quality of the product. If you decide to brave this one just prepare for a big disappointment. Horror things do not intimidate you, do not worry you, romance is not warm and cumbersome and you will be worried when it comes to the end. "The first to die" tells a lot about this film.
