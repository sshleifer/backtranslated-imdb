If you see this movie, why did you say "Jesus, Jesus, and Jesus"? Not true !!! Every time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, and Jesus ..." "Jesus, Jesus, and Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey have appeared here in the background, but Timbertake and LL Cool J have won the screen. WTF Timberlake? Acting dreamfully! I think someone like Joshua Jackson may have done a better job! This job is perfect for Joshua Jackson and I believe him is not a big fun ... but I really like an actor, this is called Timberlake that is not Android. And his girlfriend is unpleasant, empty and annoying like hell. <br /> <br /> The story is ok, I think Dylan McDermott did his bad guy role. The film is entertaining, but I think Timberbell has destroyed it. <br /> <br /> Music is okay, but suddenly the music appears to have been metro-flash clips, fewer movements and similar words. . I think this is something wrong for the cops image. Perhaps they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
