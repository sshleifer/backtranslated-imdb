Well, big money machine again! Disney is very pretentious to use coins, and we feel every video (good or bad) is owned. Why do I look forward to this "sequel" that makes Don Bluth in a bad day look like Leonardo da Vinci? Three storytellers in Cinderella 2 (already a poor choice!) Is not one of the most lovely Disney Creations, need at least a linear story? These three, only the final animation quality and the storyline that I expected comes anywhere near. The music is worse and modern (which means it's already in 2 years) and does not add anything to the story. Why do everything need to be updated? Did you know that the virtual cartoon is still popular due to its timelessness, so is the genuine honor and genuine with the songs that reflect the same style? Gay, I can not wait to continue with Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we get Britney Spears inspired music! So Disney, if you're listening, remember that we are not all discreet children here. What about the bone or two throwing fans around for a long time to learn the difference between craft and dirt?
