Ted Tezlaf's cinematographer turned out to be a terrific horror film. For a bomb image that does not have time to watch a good movie but does not have absolutely no tension. Ford put someone here, his character smirk sleepwalks this though. Some former details of the former commander-in-chief or RAF, who was detained in the war, and his wife left him - but there are no stories behind this. Bomber himself is a complete secret. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? In that case, what time are we talking here? WWII or after the war ?? I thought the bomber's intention was the second most important. Generally, however, is just a terrible film. There are plenty of time to bomb-flick out to cross this time. For a more exciting time, look at the same time as the episode of "Runway UXB".
