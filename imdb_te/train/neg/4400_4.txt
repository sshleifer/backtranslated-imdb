Francis is one of the first films of Farmer; At 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Rayay and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, which is probably great in its time, is really cool today. Roy Rogers also appears - in a singing role. From my perspective it is worth seeing if you're a Francis Farmer Fan, and perhaps a Bing Crosby fan.
