"Could it be a great documentary"? Yes, deaf, dumb, blind. Everything but meaning, wit, visual style, interesting stuff. From now on. . <br /> Strongly, Wolken. This is an image that is totally unfounded. Adventure Doc without adventure, without any feeling of war for the battle doc, sending campie without intrusive trace. It means nothing, nothing feels like, and absolutely nothing to contain the implicit message of things. No wonder it is very IMDb fans! Of course, you know a movie featuring great skip-lipman culture, no intelligence, no wit (other than a corrosive adolescent intervention), and a remarkable human emotion? Just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a film - it's a panic! Avoid. There are very real documentaries and wasting up to build a toilet such as "Darkon" very little time in life.
