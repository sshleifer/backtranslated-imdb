When you're serial killer's main character shipped to electric chair (when the bakery truck feels), you're locked in a jail vehicle (and I'm not making up) this up) a genetic engineering tanker truck. <br /> <br /> My favorite piece of the film, however, is the over-the-shoulder shot, which melt him, and his DNA meets with snow. Snowmen look at the skeptics of a couple like white stove-potholder gloves in which his hands hit a schmuck. <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
