It's a weaker sequel: almost every aspect of the "Mankind's Horse" is not of interest and light touch and they are the same with each other. <br /> <br /> The return of the first is almost paradigm and attempts to stimulate different Indian celebrations, but first tries to make a magic bottle. The film is lost and abandoned, lost their homeland, modern life is occupied over heaven, and they live in tedious and poverty. Perhaps this is the first film that took us to the place where we wanted it, the simplest time. It takes us to break Indians into a traumatic world, and Whiteman is the hero and savior, which removes the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The first person's beauty was discovered and realized that the white man is in the values ​​of real civilization rather than western materialism. <br /> <br /> In the second film, it is very small and ends with a weak image. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment.
