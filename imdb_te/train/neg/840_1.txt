I fully agree with the last commentator, which is the worst picture ever made. I had to come up with a lot in this film. Michael Madsen helped the film to anyone. The image quality is by all means through Grennini .And the smaller the plot is just plain stupid. The less score I will do .This picture will not waste your time or you 'll regret it.
