This film ends up getting difficulties because some of the girls in a Catholic school are fundamentally putting red in one of their school colleagues shampoo and then they decide to take off Florida for the holiday after reprimanded for this action. Where they meet together with some people in a local diner, and then decide that they will be together with one another. The girls end up in the roadside near the forest and look for a murder that takes part in the local sheriff to stop for a little while and decide to walk around the girls a bit. She feared and walked to tell others what had happened. Other girls decide to look after her, and two of them are killed by the killer. The other two girls were then caught by the killer and placed in a local jail cell. Deputy Sheriff, on the other hand, looked at the girls, saying that sheriff was a murderer, both of them neglected, two negligent, and two of them could not put each other in the film. At that. The best part is killer and she decides to rape her in the jail cell. The scene between the girls is the scene and it seems that the girl should really rape through this man and bear chest scene when I admit their lips meet other things he has in mind. The film reminds me of a budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avolon, the same motive as another character role. It's not a rented movie for the 80s low-budget film, I've always seen in the movie and it wants to recover my money.
