I've received a DVD of "Boogman" and this feature is an additional feature. I thought it was "Boogyman II" because it was added to the original. But they know what they say about "imagine": it is "u-" and "me" from "donkey". I have read that BII has a lot of footage from the realistic scene and it acted in actress Love. When looking at "River of the Boogeyman", I decided to move through the original scenes to see the brutal death-by-tooth brush scene. Before I knew it, the movie was out. Rip off. I think this is BII, because it's the same title for one of the alternate titles of BII. Oh well, at least it's just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the mistakes of the film. Many, too, are mistakes. Who is he He really thinks he will sell the same film in different forms. There is no real Holding Part III. This is basically the past of the original through a supernatural eye, giving us a Boas boring play-by-play like everything else. This is the movie. Oh, and a death by stereo scene, but you can read that of someone else's review. <br /> Final note: This is not the movies that are back in the back.
