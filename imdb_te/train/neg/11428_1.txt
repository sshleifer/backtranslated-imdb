Oh my God .. The World SH * T I have seen - this is the main idea that came into my mind after seeing this film. I do not understand with anti-mythology. However, perhaps the idea is good but the effect is getting worse. I understand the role of H. Graham in particular. What is it ??? In my opinion, it destroyed all positive motives of the producers. The character is affected and played annoyingly. Recalling that she looks at a movie every time she sees and remembers that I'm destroying the moment of the moment, then the whole picture, because you can see her any stupid faces with stupid attempts to create an emotion. Terrible, do not waste your time.
