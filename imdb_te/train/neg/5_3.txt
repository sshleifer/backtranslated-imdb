I've basically gone through the movie but just enough to catch to look about the plot. It's kind of boring to tell me the truth and some spots do not make sense of it. I see this movie in the first place because CHACE CRAWFORD! He is very hot, but his hair is strange in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, despite the hot chess, it really is not for the movie. I guess the plot is not that bad but the fact that really threw me is the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. <br /> <br /> Do you have any difficulty expressing your anger without referring to someone else? The building is painful and totally elegant, the camera shivering gave me a headache. <br /> All the plots, I found over the film bored and dramatic. That's why I cut only the scenes with the chassis. LOL Anyway, I'm not worth a rental like a certain cast member like your one die hard fan. Oh yes cast hot. The girls are hot! But chess is the best !!
