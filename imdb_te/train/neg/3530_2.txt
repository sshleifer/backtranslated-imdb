When Ritchie first inspired the film scene, his films were funny, witty, well directed and original. One must consider if one compare his hype to his first two attempts and the hype of his last two outings is almost universal one product - is Ritchie invented? Is he really that expert? Does he really have real real ideas? Or he is a famous and eccentric director who just like Fincher, Tarantino and Leone to be a huge and disorganized pile. Is it wrong to see it after seeing revolver? What happened to his great funny humor? Where did he get these mixed and twisted thoughts? Revolver attempts to be clever, philosophical and brief, which seeks to be a clever psychological analysis that seeks to be a complex and complex thriller. Ritchie is a great deal to accomplish these many goals and investes in the great rocks of the script and the convictions of many aspects of the story. In the end, however, it creates a serious, constructive and ultimately unanimous film to serve the services. Its libertarianism is very sinful and blatant, but Ritchie must be punished even if he tries to give his own spine a try even if he is trying to pass his own work. <br /> <br /> The revolver is an unreal and corny image that eventually stole countless themes from art clubs such as Fort Club, the usual suspects and the Pulp. Fiction. <br /> <br /> The revolver is deserving to be worse, a real poor movie from a poorly painted artist. However, it was flat on its outer face and simply failed to achieve it and achieve everything.
