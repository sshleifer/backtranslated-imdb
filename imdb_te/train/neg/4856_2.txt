In my life I can not understand this completely unbelievable movie blind hype and devotion ...... and I have the qualifications to say .... I am 14 years former Special Operations soldier "Lifestyle" ... in this film war or group or platoon At the level, a person who did very little research in life in the Army was completely untrue and clearly written. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys surround their own Baghdad ??? Get real ... is not the chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD Clearing Buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Eligibility Buck Sergeant ??? Get Real ... Wait ... Kill a bad guy that I shot and then let me both bite me or shoot a different shot? Real Gets .... I am an Iraqi citizen karazak, I am armed with 9 mills, falling into another civilian house, packed with his wife, and walked in the middle of Baghdad, much like Scratch or Confrontation ?? <br /> There is no commitment to the Military Protocol {Arkinit], and I do not even have any similarity to any military unit. The men and women of EOD who are in conflict with this poor movie are working very hard job of jungle adrenaline but a very hard work seeking yahoos unbelievably and disrespectfully.
