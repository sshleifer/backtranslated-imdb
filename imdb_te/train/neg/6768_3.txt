Volkswagen Herby, who feels like a man, is now driven by a young woman who feels like Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a nesker champion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, I do not like that much, I got some hope for the sequel, and the cast is pretty cool and the trailer looks pretty funny.Unfortunately, Herbie is no better than he was before. <br /> <br /> The film was entertaining for all children It's all about it. <br /> It's a child's cinema There are very few laughs and finally got boring and many actors died in their roles.Lindsay Lohan is like Maggie Petton, Freaky is usually a good show like Friday and Mean Girls, and Matt Dillon is the best performer for everyone. Even though the bad guy is very good Brian Mayer and Michael Keaton are really and they do nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson is directing her and she is okay job, but she is working on her weak script. Could Thomas Lennon and Ben Garyt write the screenplay and make any surprise to you that they are also responsible for Taxi and the Pacifier? These two make light films, but they have not been able to make stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully the next time they try harder. Finally, herb is a valuable safe and imaginative family image for you to be a kid. It's better to skip everyone. Rating 4/10
