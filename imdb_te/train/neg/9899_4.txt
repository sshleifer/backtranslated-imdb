The literal standard "Moby Dick" is a ridiculous movie version. John Barrymore falls in love with Captain Ahab, Pastor's daughter, Jon Bennett. His brother Derek is the opponent of Ms. Bennett's love. When Mr. Brymore is in a whale tragedy hanging, Bennett rejects him. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that he has surprised the 1930 theater audience; Particularly important scenes are Barrymore's foot. But this film is not very old. There are very good movies for the silence since 1920 and for discussions in 1930. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Jon Bennett are not their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
