The film is the biggest waste of nine dollars, I've spent a long time. If you know how often you went to movies that probably went, it's hard to guess, but never-less, that's true! After watching the trailer for this film, I know I'll see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why not? The trailer is no less than intriguing and exciting; <br /> <br /> From the cinematography, to the script, acting, the film is full flap. If you read, I'm afraid that I'm disappointed with some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or an hour and forty five minutes of waste. <br /> "Why is this bad," you might ask yourself. Let me tell you. The picture is not a mystery or a suspension. Nothing about the film, "on the edge", at least frightening or interesting. The script is the best ridiculous. There were many times throughout the movie that was just a laughable conversation, and only a few seconds later I started writing it as a comic relief. Acting is terrible. I liked Nicolas Cage but miss it. Without exception, each show in the movie is too small. Cinematography is not afraid of a moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. <br /> I'm not a very hard critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I wondered. The film is boring, poorly written, poorly written, and overwhelmed with disappointment. Make yourself a favor and see one another.
