Ulises is a literary teacher who comes to a coastal town. There, he falls in love with the most beautiful girl Martina in town. They end up with the tragic death of Ulises in the sea, which begins a dried-out romance. Years later, Martina married the wealthy city of Ciara, living quietly and living in peace. One day, Ulysses segregation, she will grow up and act without thinking of the consequences. The plot is quite irrelevant and nobody plays a good role. Additionally, three-quarters of the film's sex scenes are still well documented, and the story is so tired that they want to see much improvement. It's just a bad big lunus movie, sex abuse, argument and stupid characters everywhere.
