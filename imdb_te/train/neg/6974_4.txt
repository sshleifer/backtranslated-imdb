Blue com is originally mentioned in the movie but it's not how it makes any possible sense. At one point, some kids are exploring and deep levels. <br /> They discuss what they find there. One of them (the girl) will see her blue monkey. <br /> Yeah,. <br /> <br /> Let's assume that you have found a blue monkey in a hospital basement, the story is completely unlikely, and the only tragic connection to the title. Someone must remember my purpose!
