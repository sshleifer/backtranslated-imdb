It's very bad acting. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this presentation. Turn it off. Or you're worrying for the next 30 minutes. This is not aired. It's not great. You can not see. Never ever. So now, if you ever watch this show, please. Turn to CW for Smallville. Disney Channel for the Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, or Nick Drake & Josh, that much better family shows. So believe me this, I've seen it before. And it's honest, and I'm honest, the worst performance I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a lot of TV. So make me a favor, and this show never.
