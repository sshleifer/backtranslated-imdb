I saw this film yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavonag basically feature these awkwardly unbelievable script for these five hours (or how long). From the beginning, each element of this image is unbelievable. The film gave me a lot of times, but they were mainly shocked, and the director / writer actually hoped to trust the most scarcely scattered items that tried to take these movies. <br /> <br /> The vision of the film is Gray (Graham) and her problems are intimacy. <br /> <br /> Things are interesting when she and her brother realize that there is a lot of unexpected happenings. <br /> <br /> Interesting and witty. However, instead of making this story believable and polite, the director grasps into these ridiculous turns in gray, and does not actually understand any feelings. Being a LGBT person, this film will be available in all manner of heterosexuals in the upcoming ways. (If the author's queer will insult me.) For gorgeous chemistry between Gwana and Graham (by the way, forced to be understood), I would give a negative 3 stars.
