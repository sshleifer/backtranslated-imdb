I understand that this film has been built in a very low budget, but it is not necessary for the maestrocity known as Grendel. Deathstocker, Fire's Throne, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarians have all done on boosting budgets and poor special effects, and they have still created cult classics by adding some of the lesserly wearing female warriors and good sense of humor. The oldest costume, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendell a chance to be a very good low-budget knife and witchcraft, but the makers completely destroyed this opportunity using poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this picture to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it's a good example of how to make entertaining low-budget science fiction / adventure films using reliable special effects and attractive characters.
