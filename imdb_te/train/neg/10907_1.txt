I look forward to a movie like Deus Baga, I enjoyed it. However, this sound has never stuck. It is one of the flix that enjoys the sad appointment of PG-13, the child is not appropriate. Jokes are not just low-brow or f ** t jokes, they are crude, vulgar, and many actions beyond the boundaries of the bad taste and beyond the legal and ethical generation. Many scenes seem to be shredded to get PG-13 ratings ... Very bad ... funny has gone that may have splashed up as a R-rated film (over statement? Maybe) Do not recommend this movie. It's time to waste the whole time ... and I'm ready to give you a movie lover and just about a shot. In 45 minutes, it was filmed to shut down ... and it was ready for the baby. The end is ragged but it does not protect this swamp / tourism trap of a rental. 1/2 star (happily I've seen it as a freebie ... it was ill to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this trip)
