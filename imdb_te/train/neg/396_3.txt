I saw this when it was in the theater, which started strong back in the 1980s, a bold film and special effects time. In the 1980s you had to understand this topic at least 30 or so in 1980. Historically, when reading the movies, the mind set misses in expectations, and other related psychological factors. As I mentioned, the film is breathtaking and very entertaining. It's constructed to an amazing climax ... When it's done I understand that someone who describes it as having a water bubble break near you, which is very poetic description. In my experience, it's not just strong enough. I'm fine with my wife ... how can I say this? We have been disappointed, we mean we pay money, an amazing movie to invest in time to see it. "We have confirmed that we both have been eliminated, but the fact that the production company did not have enough money to rush the money and did not get enough to finish it, actually said my wife was the best, it did not end, it stopped!
