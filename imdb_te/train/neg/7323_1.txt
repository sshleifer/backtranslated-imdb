Well ........ In contrast to the other comments written in the past, the only good thing about this film is that it reminded me of my youth that the fact that it looked a bit like a young man Jason Donavon. I have no idea what wins I have won, and if I do a lot of work, it's becoming more futile, even though the early 90s of the soap operas screams. Ploteless, cinematography is hopeless and acting is similar to a one-level performance. It's unfortunately long and sub-plot is very unreal .... For example, if your best friend has been sleeping with your ex-boyfriend for 6 years, you're not the best after 2 weeks break. It's all fantasy. That's it! Oh, and the weird house's house / softcore indie mind is touchless!
