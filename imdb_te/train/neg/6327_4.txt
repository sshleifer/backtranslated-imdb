I think this film is very good. It sounded a spoof of spy, and it reminded me of Pleasantville in the beginning, but this film got smaller. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. In Russia, KGB and the Soviet Union initiated a spy school to teach Americans how to deal with their spy, but the town they set up for a little while, so they have up to two anxles from the US up spies. I do not know, but it's there. The Russian town speaks of Russian pronunciation aside when no one is beside him. <br /> <br /> Also, for comedy it is painful to dry. One, two funny spots are benches, and they can not sing and dance. <br /> And, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro for the US that makes me ill. This film keeps repeating again, the US god and the devil in Russia. This was a smear promotional campaign against Japan in World War II. These pictures are as if everyone thinks the US is full. <br /> It reaches 10 to 4, and I'm kind. It really should get one, but the dance scene is funny, but then dragged it a long time to be quite fun again.
