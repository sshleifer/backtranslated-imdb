Jimca is one of the worst films ever. But bad movies are not kind of bad. This is a terrible look and it is fun to laugh. Kurt Thomas does not have a lucrative career. He should go back to gymnastics. But in the slow motion the crazies may forget the memorable scenes such as a high bar with chalk, stone pommel horse or a five-minute chase scene through the village. I think this is bad, but who can say. It's not art, but if you want something luminous and lighter, rent it. The fun makes for an evening.
