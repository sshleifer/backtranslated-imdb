A "social commentary" on racism and jail conditions in the rural south of the "nightmare" in the late 1970s was a bad south stereotypical, full of phony sounds. It is not dangerous for most of the American Southern sensitivity, especially in its uncut original version - the work of the work as a "baby in the prison" was just jail. Nonetheless, acting is usually above average, and in the end chick connoisseurs make a good job of hating viewers, especially - although he seems somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. Robert Reid at the end of the final warden, and Tina Lewis (previously the "Gilligan's Island" ginger), is a believable saint prison guard. My grade: D. <br /> <br />
