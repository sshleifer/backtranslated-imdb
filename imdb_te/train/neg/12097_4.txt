I really did not expect much when I went to see this stuff. <br /> <br /> When I was jammed with two friends, I had hoped for a similar experience. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has become very intense. Can I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry. There are no covering Ft13th films anyway. At the end of the day, he was a dead serial killer, I'm not going to get that sympathy. <br /> <br /> Freddie is a very interesting element of the film with a lot of hallucinations and, but unfortunately they are very low and at the end and at the end of the movie, the bad episode of the popular deathmatch was down ... just not funny.
