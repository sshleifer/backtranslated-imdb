I can not believe how anyone can create humor about the problem of homeownership. Of course, Brooks _real_ does not have a comedy about homeless people. There is no mention of drugs, adultery or violence in these streets. People we meet in the movie are homeless in fantasy, so they do not eat the difference between them and us. Brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years. Nail it in the coffin.
