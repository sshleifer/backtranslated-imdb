Gorgeous institutions, gorgeous colors and camera work, prestigious dialogue, simple plot. Prima Donna, Camilla, the name of the most frequently named flowers, Dumas' novel La Dame ax camelias, Cambell's film, Cambell and (I think) Robert Taylor and last but Verdi's opera la traita. Beautiful, very unlikely young girls, social outlets, loved ones, for one reason or another, when they die after the death of tuberculosis in moments ... In an opera you forgive the usual plot and stupid dubious dialogue Why Hayek, Don Sutherland, a beautiful composition of LA in the 30s, conveniently A Deus Ex Machina earthquake that killed another woman, and this beautiful tahra Is there any beautiful singing of the song in which there is no beautiful singing?
