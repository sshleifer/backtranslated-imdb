Amazing actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and is not quite in great direction. My main concern is that I do not care about these people. Not the killer not the victims. The settings are pretty drab. The role of Dennis Quaid was written very little, and I did not even care when the end came. He came back to his kid. Big deal! I wanted my money back.
