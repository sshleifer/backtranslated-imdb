There are some serious disadvantages in this film, and it is unbelievable that anybody walked through the open back door through the most safe medical facilities. Then this guy just walks around the facility and enters the doctor's office, just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> Very very imaginative image. <br /> <br /> Without being shot in Canada, I do not know how the film was taken, and possibly the government granted. <br /> <br /> You must say that Aron, Cory Montit, was doing a good job. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored, some time will be killed, but if not, it is a movie that any actor will want their resume.
