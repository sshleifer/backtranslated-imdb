Last night, this friend had this sensation to my friend when I wanted to complete the whole year without giving me a movie "Bam" rating. I was afraid of knowing the fame of its glory, and God was awful as I'd imagined. It is the Mexican-Made Mess, which was translated into English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects and has a rather intimidating Santa that does not work in the North Pole, but there are not only little clouds in outer space, but also small ghosts that help build his dolls, practically all children from every country. With this continuous sequence, St. Nick is dark, he sees all of these stories, playing terrible holiday songs in different languages, and never, and without any story. This Santa Claus does not notice child labor laws. <br /> <br /> In the end, we turn Santa's Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare of evil ghosts, who make hell out of hell and fly from hell to land. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it is bound to intimidate small children and turn them off of Santa Claus and forever holidays. Significantly, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which in some occasions makes it all Christ in the context of all the strange things happening. This makes my personal list easier "the worst movie I've seen", but I'm absolutely sure nothing.
