Thomas, the innocent, the bad idea, the career-killing (now the talent of Angela Jones?), The deeper illness of the worst. Quentin Tarantino thinks that a valuable story does not require a second break, saying to the world it is not wondering to direct anything from Repr Bratislik - someone who has the opportunity to make his own film his own film based on his own script, and something like this.
