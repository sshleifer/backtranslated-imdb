The film has several stories, which follow many characters. <br /> <br /> This comedy makes it very absurd and will sometimes look hurtful. It may be very weak and clich√© but this is true; It's good to watch the Crocodile Hunter range with Steve and Terry Irwin in the Discovery Channel. It's more fun and more fun than this film. I have lots of fun making this film with both cast and crew but the film does not give us a lot of pleasure to the audience. Not just funny enough for a comedy and Steve and Terry Irwin are not just good actors, they even play themselves! <br /> <br /> There are some criticisms in this film, when Steve Irwin is a character I am curious to see and a delightful one, when I first hear they are making a film about my first reaction 'crocodile hunter'; Clever! However, the film has a very weak story and lines of involuntary stories with absurd and innocent characters. <br /> <br /> The film has at least one entertainment value to let me at least once, but I do not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time. Still, when the movie is on TV, it can only be seen on a rainy afternoon. <br /> <br /> It has some good moments, but the storyline really ruins the image and its potential. <br /> <br />
