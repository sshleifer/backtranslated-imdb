The "Finding John Christmas" is a good idea from a poorly fictional plot line that does not make sense of bad dialogue and chaos of bad duner, bad acting (Peter Faulk did not find his way out). Bertinelli's performance with the love of the likes of William Rus and Noah as co-starring Shri Herr and David Kubit is too deep or emotional. Jennifer Pisna as Sincore, the solitary father could not afford to hear Noah's daughter singing. But who can blame them? Michael J. Murray's script is fine childhood. <br /> <br /> Every time I search for the TV Guide and wait for some of the classic Christmas and exciting holiday movies that appear on the small screen. "Miracle On 34 Street", 1951 version of Ernest Lubitchch's delightful "corner shop" and "screws". Frank Capra's classic is "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "home for alley" or "holidays for home" with the great performances of Holy Hunter and "Robert Downey Jr."? <br /> <br /> My suggestion is by advising you. It is better to search for these movies than finding your time "Finding the Christmas Christmas". Christmas wishes!
