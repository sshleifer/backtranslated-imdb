I want to say - it's a stinker! <br /> <br /> If you are suffering from insomnia, do so only. <br /> <br /> There are many people chewing there and damaging it, this film. There is no suspense, no deep, surprising secrets are revealed, there is no real threat to the heroine's abundance. Some differences, the slightest increase in the voices - that's pretty good. No secrets can happen to anyone - the last "mystery" in the movie is completely predictable at that time. <br /> The Faith (Meg is an artist designated to paint a series of a mural panels in a huge ballroom in a huge building by the kind of big, very wealthy, elderly woman, and the growing mother / daughter who revolves around a youth named plot Tillley), <br /> <br /> The old lady daughter Cassandra dies. <br /> <br /> The mysterious man who makes our heroine does not bring you to the point where the scene is really worrying for you or your safety beyond the other two or two. <br /> <br /> In this vast building there is only one servant, and there is a fact that everyone has a reliable butler - cooking, cleaning, eating, drinking, etc. Anything else except the door lock - the only explanation is how to move one of those characters into a trusted room. There is nothing "mounting" tension in this film because you do not have to hold your chair hands, and there will be nothing leaning on the edge of your seat - just bland and curiosity tossed from time to time. <br /> <br />
