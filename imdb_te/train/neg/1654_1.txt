<br /> *** The possible scene spoilers (but who cares for hell) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's correct: zero. And I should rarely give 1. I'm looking for the most beautiful movies of films for things like music, cinematography, fiction, humor, a good pace to score as much as possible score. Seeing it inside your own race or subgenera. But nothing here is not redemption. Once again I can not remember it, climbed up and down the room while in the movie. I do not seem to change the channel because I have only done it - I'm sitting with Ahlath, it will come after the insulting stupid bit. It's like watching a rat to digest a snake. <br /> <br /> But we should some fun and remove this baby, what should we do. First of all, nothing technically about the "whip" working. Visuals are all sitcom style. The cut scenes are all over the street through traffic and all over the night. Music and score, the film does not contribute anything - it is bad. Not to mention that it has nothing to contribute. Acting cardboard, all around and passes for Amanda Pete as it comes (apparently "train" got this train wreck green-lit). <br /> <br /> Director Peter M. These friends, supposed friends, unmatched chemistry or angle if they encircle them for a few minutes after the shooting at the Cohen bus station. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, it is the actual bone in the body. There is no imagination. This does not show anything we have not seen before a thousand times. The whole campus, or "twist" of the film, is based on the "idea of ​​men playing" just as they are playing "men of bosom" and "sympathetic women." To anyone, it is thought to be something like a twist, or by no means originally on TV. , Unbearable women are common, the male bashing criterion, which does not steal from anything special, it is worse I can not imagine a woman filmed by other women who are based on this concept of contempt: I want to "rent" in the Men company - better yet, "Mary about Mary about Mary." <br /> <br /> You may want to see Sweat. Cohen has only content to capture the myths that are just aside from other sexist films, on the other hand, the film does not work sarcastically because it can be considered "satirical" even when it's exaggerated, In reality it is needed. It does not even know what is sarcastic. Then there's the conversation, it sounds a little more then obscenities at each other screaming characters. Example: Alphabet 1: "F ** ku" Character 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> And the bottom line, at will: Morally repulsive characters and obscene conversations And there are so many movies without movies that are good, good and good acting. "Wrapped" is not funny. Secondly. It does not have comic skills or times. The conditions are all completely deceptive, the truth is not to be based on any shred, especially to laugh at us enough. All of the characters are extensively drawn so they will be less relatively usual deprecated SEEM relatable. Just look at the "Markie scene", "Cult classic" hair gel scene. One of our anti-male leaders opens the drug cabinet and sees the vibration of Meena (Pete). For some reason light shines on him as he found the Holy Grail. Cohen men I do not know why vibrators feel this way of reaction. When he rubbed over him, he drops it in the toilet and then runs out of the fish with his shit hands, oh, meena walks in herself. Oh, on my sides. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly enough people like this movie. Of course, I do not want to be surprised because people like "friends" and even reality dating. This is all though a simple thread. The "adult" is a big testimony to me, it's in a big pocket in America, it's about sex because of any joke. They love any show or movie (or think they like) about dating or relationships. There is no quality on these people. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because I saw this movie as cheap and free, alarmed, TV, movies and products, as the tooth and thin bodies are trying to distinguish people to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs. When it dies, I get credit for 80 minutes of my life back Ccindi. <br /> <br />
