Darar got a good start. The first scene really left me on my seat. Moreover, the first half of the film is bored. Rishi Kapoor lost the lead role in love with Juhi Chawla about the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> When Zhui tells us about his previous husband, Things will eventually begin to spice up the film; And what a lunatic he is! He is really the most protected and neat-bizarre with hot temper! He beat the poor Juhi for good reason! I can not stand watching Zhui (my favorite actress) because I really do not like this movie. Usually this film is WAY too abusive and bloody; <br /> <br /> Anyway, if I'm thinking about renting Dasarar, I'll try to say. Something else!
