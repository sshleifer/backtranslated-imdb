After Amenmarbar and Ballerorella's overtered success, Spanish Horror Movies spread with a disease in the increasingly bleak world of horror films. As a result, El Segundo's name, TV-like production is in bad writing, but it is even worse and directed. I did not read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I know that this doll writer does not have much of her mother with this horrible product. Avoid it at any price except for a quiet sleeping night in the latest movie theater. 2/10
