Robert De Niro Gill plays the role of Renard in Fan. Or is it not a Travis pick? Or Rupert Papkin? Or Max Caddy? You're looking at this kind of character, De Niro Taxi Driver, Kamili and Captain Fiera King and unfortunately characters are well developed and have good scripts. <br /> <br /> The character arc is not the only problem with this script - it's a little harder that Reynard has started as a discouraged obsessive sports fan. One character's vision (I'm a problem with De Niro's awesome but slightly flawed), I thought Bobby Rayburn was the main character, and thought that the story was back to Renard. The sports fans seem to be very disappointed that it feels that this is a little more concentrated on the baseball. I'm not sure if it's the first to appeal to the Basal fans, but once the producers make the minds of the producers, I accept that I am a fan (especially through soundtrack), but it's a very flawed film and it was not until the mid-1990s by the Nutter in Single White Heart actuated Remember, the unlawful entry and so long ago steam
