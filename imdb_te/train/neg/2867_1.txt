I slept on my bed, very bad cold or flu or whatever. I figure some time ago my mom might like to kill some time watching slight horror movies. I never selected this movie! After I saw it, I felt more sick and I dismissed it. Later (when I'm of course good) Dennis L. I did some research on the radar and I saw that Dennis in this film is not real. If I see this movie, but if they do not always eat or feel at first, I feel like you feel. I think Santa will have a better time watching Santa Claus 3. At least that movie has good reviews on this site.
