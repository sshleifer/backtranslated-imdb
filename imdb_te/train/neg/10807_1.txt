The film has successfully demonstrated that playing basketball and professional basket-ball players will succeed. Especially rapping and acting. I really explained how badly this film is. First of all, is it just me, or the brass kid you saw? I mean, his teeth can be used as an opener. Secondly, why would he want to continue his career in an illusionist music industry, even though he has magical powers, he is nervous about doing music? Third, I read the Bible. Jesus jeans that there is no shape or shape. Fourth, what's the crappy special effects deal? I assure you that there is no better than any acne-attached attractive youngster with a computer. Fifth, why ending so bad a bad boy? And what is hell a djin? Finally, creators of the so-called Kazam need to move from an airplane and a tower to Eiffel because the film takes the word "suck" to "new" altogether.
