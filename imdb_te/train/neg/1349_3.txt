I got this DVD well 2 years ago and yesterday decided to see it. I do not know why the Inspector Gadget display and the new gadget and gadget Inside took me a long time. It's a bright color palette and all the technology of a modern animated film can be flamboyant, however, this gadget has some old things to throw down that toilet right. <br /> All the classic inspector Gadget theme is not the first song and music completely. The composer tries to compromise by making this sounds sound, but still not good enough. Gadget-Mobile is now a talking car, not a car, not a car. Plus it looks very cool and rounder instead of being normal cold. Penny does not have his computer book anymore and she and the seldom rarely appear to everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. Some people have something about the transformation formula and the Doctor Claw used for non-exposure but bad but I've got. I'll never deal with what little deal / big Italian person. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the title. <br /> If the title is to go, his final case will not end in any way. <br /> <br /> The mystery is also called why "the last case" <br /> I'm impressed. It's disappointing to the great animated show on the DVD, but you can not inspire you when buying inspector gadget DVDs. Finally, I sold it in seconds. Any kid who loves or appreciates it and does not withstand the old show's fan.
