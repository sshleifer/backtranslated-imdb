This film is terrible. I also promise that they did not even produce the images I have taken from the whole movie. Ice-T hell is hurtful. * SPOILERS Phht more like * Reasons to not see it as they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. He's gone a long time. It was impossible to track him with soil dogs. And ICE-T thinks that the shotguns and handguns are inaccurate at 100yards when it is on the hill and its SPR-15 attack shots (and cuts a tree with eight shells?), Taking its sniper rifle, takes 1000 shells to cut off a tree. And they also looked at the reflection. Reflecting the light? I do not see a scope in that respect. Even as he was shot and gutted in the gut, he was retarded that he had been bleeding death there. Plus the end where he is a rock or a cigarette stuff in the barrel. It will not blow up and kill him. The bullet still kills snow t but the barrel is frustrated.
