"Unhinged" is a forgotten slazer from the golden age of the genre. It is difficult to write a satisfactory review in the movie because the film is very unique. It is quite overdone in the plot - get a car accident with three young girls on their way to a rock concert and end up alone at an unusual old woman and her spinster daughter's building. Very quickly, they find strange ladies when something strange breath and sounds from the attic are not correct. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very strange relationship, as strong quarrels before their houseguest at dinner. The old mother also called her daughter a prostitute and an infant and accused the boys of sneaking at night for the night to sleep with them. Halfway, through the film, decided that when a girl finally decided that she wanted to help her, the murder began. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the film is at the bottom of the barrel. Three lonely girls can work "main" girl, especially no one. It is almost unbelievable to listen to deliver their lines in the wooden tone, in the same way in the film. Mother and daughter are good, but not quite. The film itself is quite dull and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but we have not seen before. However, as noted here, the film is truly amazingly disturbing and Gary's finished points. It comes from the left field and has the same shock value as the Camp Classic ends "Sleepway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the film suffers a bored and horror acting and boring, boring motion. The discrete, creepy looking building and dark, moving forward lighting gives the film a realism, but it was quickly damaged when trying to act in one of the characters. If you could do it until the end of it, it might be worth it, but I said I'm going to be fast forwarding for the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
