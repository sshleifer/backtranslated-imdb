I regret this film for 90 minutes in my life, in which I will never get back. The campus is really quite interesting - especially from a perspective of the afterlife, unfortunately, they fail to fail a compelling story on the frame. The current reality can be added to the reality of the film without the nearly unsustainable change of lives, but it will correctly eliminate all the entertainment value The audience is engaged If they do more and more efforts to persuade, it is likely to lead to their social interpretation.
