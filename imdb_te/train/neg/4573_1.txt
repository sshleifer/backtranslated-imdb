I did not know much about this film before I saw it, but I had something with quantum physics that I was interested in. I do not know this fact is not a standard but a bunch of new-age bloodhards who like their own voice sound talking about how little they are about basic quantum mechanics. I said that I'm more than a comedy or drama rather than a documentary section. <br /> <br /> Marie Matlin is in the film to give some of this new era symposium * storyline. Parts of the film are intimidated and intended to show the speaker's ideas, so we do not get bored. Matlin has a real job as a photographer crashing on his couch, unlike a New York hippie. We get to hear unnamed people about "meaning" to all of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> The speaker in India (I imagine) is a bright spot in the film, but he is coming for a wrong image. <br /> <br /> Barbara Eden can really go, Quantum Science is about what can be done with her crazy new age beliefs. With Quark Cash cashing down from DS9, he had a brief appearance in the film. We're impressed with the whizbang CGI too; People in the movie say people in the movie can not see the Clipper ships ever before, because people in the movie are likely to be able to know the Aravag people in San Salvador. In fact they left all of that information, "the ships of Columbus disappeared to Indians in America." This movie is very proud. Thomas Young made a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that some time would be light particles and some time wave. Of course, you do not like it since seeing this stupid movie because only the reference molecules can be cells and waves. And people walk through the walls, walk down the water, and if they only want a star, no elderly people! Then I'm sure * Merley Matlin could stop being deaf if she * was hard enough * to believe. I am paradoxical, but this film is with false hope and beliefs, and people do not save them. <br /> <br /> These are the New Age Coxs that hold in Quantum Theory. It reiterates everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal medicine etc. If the snake-sellers really believe the worst they are selling, are they just a joke? We do not know, we do not know, talk about his bed before a fire (or TV screen) about how he created his own life. Every time I was on the screen I wanted to rush someone and throw him in his face. These people take themselves very tightly. The other bald person in a suit says that nobody really touched anyone, because there is a magnetic force that prevents quantum levels. If only one goes to the screen and dispatches him in the stomach, "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you!" The moral relativist in the film claims to be really "not good or bad". So, does it make sense that Hitler has killed millions of Jews? Another person says that he does not "love". It's just a chemical and we do not really love people, we're addicted to chemical rush when we are around them. <br /> <br /> The two young men walk around the wedding reception and see all the things we really are of witness to sympathetic scenes. Robocop. They analyze if women cows, dogs, or foxes, and pop in a sexual position scree. <br /> <br /> Marley Matlin is married to a marriage that she wants to marry, and she loves and loves her the next day because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. Their predecessors feelings. <br /> <br /> I see only what I want to see in this review, but I really wanted to bring these people to the face pies, and it never happened. The ideas presented in the front image, you can see them interesting, but there are good resources for all the ideas here. If you want to see a good movie about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, see the person there. If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read HyperCases by the Mishiko Cock. If you want to see a movie that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see Waking Life (which sometimes seems boring, self-important and acting at times). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in the film, go through Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Riding by Robert Anton Wilson. , But this is easy for me: 1/10 Stars. <br /> The title of the movie is true. People in this movie do not know # $ *! Hands down, the worst picture I've ever seen.
