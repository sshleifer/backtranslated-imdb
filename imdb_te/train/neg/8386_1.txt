The film is like shooting fish in the barrel. It's easy. I'm going to challenge myself to find the good things of Little Man. First, I was impressed with special effects. It is affiliated to a small man's body like the head of Marlon Weines. <br /> <br /> Second, I love some of the comics that I did not expect. David Alan Grair has acted as an annoying restaurant singer, and his characters of "Havin My My Baby" and "Movin 'On Up" are valuable. John Witherspoon, who played Grayer's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you remember, he played mushroom belt "mushroom jacket" with "mushroom jacket"), now plays Vanessa's father in Little Mann. <br /> <br /> The film is reliable as white chicks. How nice it is when the doctor is not even a 40 year old man and not a baby? He got a set full of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one can recognize that it is not a baby? Little Man is a Rob Schneider Kami is so bad. Please, if you have enough intelligence to make $ 8 in this image, please do me a favor and do not bring your children. The film was intended for sexual activity for younger children (sexual orientation, and sexual orientation, sex, eating, etc.), and I puzzled the parents who brought their children under pressure to be forced to bear. If you insist on seeing an idiot film, at least your children have left pain and suffering.
