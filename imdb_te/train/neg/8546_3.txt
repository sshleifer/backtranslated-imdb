I can not afford too much, unbelievable, and impossible Spanish production ... Well, let me see how close it is to me. A girl opens with a woman who kills her cat a little girl. She then loves her to take her anywhere in her wedding. He works and demands that loses his vacation time and says she will pay for this. Guy, a swarthy photographer, a beautiful Patty Shepherd Spice, is the queen of Spanish horror films that looks like he snaps a picture so that the pinch takes his bikini top, because at the end of the film to anyone's assessment lunch, and then to his appointment to Mrs. Mountains - Again we are never secretive for reasons. Before they go, Patty's house and loud, "strange" celebrate the echoes of our hero's ears. Again, it does not explain. These two go to the mountains continuously and the mountain witches know why the mountain is called. There is a lot of things to do with the film making it better than a bad movie. It has some atmosphere, especially some of the actors are really good (especially deafness and elderly), Leeds are at least adequate and climax - even though it makes no sense - literally) with white brassieres and witches in the long black hair. It just does not make any sense, and it's a big deduction for me. I can see the film ten more times and still do not know more now than I did after the first view. This is a big problem. The Witch's Mountain is an interesting picture from the long line of cheap European and European horror films that covered the decade. If you can get more than me, you have a lot of energy.
