This is absolutely unpleasant, if the film is made up of freak. Because I played Richard Dreyfuss and Jeff Gold Blum, two good actors, because the plot line - a mob company is going to be released from a mental institution - has promised. This movie is called comedy, shita. You must pardon the pen - you should pardon the pen - head, stomach, knee strap, foot, heart (no part - you should pardon the pen - you can dimly lit elegant people, somewhat surreal, inner, every other anatomical - in the head, stomach, kneecap, Escapes, looks like this) Speaking of vague and cryptic conversation, some of which are sort of ridiculous in modern-day fashion Clearly. The Gold Blume's dialogue for the whole movie fits on a 3x5 card, and he wore a single facial expression - a lamb smile - across. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are the best they can do. Burt Reynolds plays a guest role. The credits list is Rob Reiner and Joe Bishop, but I missed them for something (a good move on their part). The whole thing is cool, clean, mechanical and unsavory; The heir to the 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers' style. If you liked that, you probably prefer it.
