From watching only the trailer Theodore Rex, you'll think of this bad guy comedy comedy as a person with this hoop Goldberg and a dinosaur dress. This is true, but it is mostly a futuristic story, like Batman Forever, with its directional style and unnatural character designs. It must be mismarketed, and just a fabulously marketable future, instead of a dull cop comedy. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have brought back to life through excellent technology, and they are talking and walking like human beings. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who has never taken seriously, but after the assassination of the dinosaurs, he has given the case to work, but he must be allied with the toughest Capt. Coltrane (Vupi Goldberg). It is up to this unmatched duo to solve the murder, and it is the audience to stay awake long to make this piece crud. <br /> <br /> Teddy begins with a simple acting character, but ultimately he can not afford to hear. For some reason, he is a bad comedian and a bad impersonator, being a detective. He makes simulations of famous people and tunes, and some really awful lines. The heart blamed him heartily and he said, "It's not my butt trumpet!" Wow! What a brisk, immature line, even for the kid's image of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. <br /> <br /> Teddy snaps the entire length of the film on her head. <br /> You do not know what this movie will be. When futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as fun as they can, which will be in frustration directly from nonstop. Action scenes are very strange and they do not work because they are not sufficiently violent, and as previously mentioned, comedy mass murders are just a group. <br /> <br /> Here is a dinosaur / human detective duo that looks pretty original. No! This film is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace dinosaurs with cartoons, set it in the future and this is the perfect plot. One man was killed, a dinosaur was killed. To solve the murder of a dinosaur and detective, solve a toon and detective murder. The evil guys Christopher Lloyd and the waves in Roger Rabbit. Here is a guy like the bad guys Christopher Lloyd and just like the guys who work as visas. Jessica Rabbit walks on stage in the club scene in Roger Rabbit and mimics dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not as good as it's straight to VHS height. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** from 1/2. 90 minutes. PG for mild violence, language and raw humor.
