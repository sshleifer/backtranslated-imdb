It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store and saw the cover as a good horror movie. I know little about the best part of the film. Where to Start? The film was scattered and boring. At one point, no one is talking about a minute scene, driving a carriage on a regular sunny day. Nothing happened, they just walked silently. The whole picture is boring, annoying, unbelievable dialogue and basically the plot of the talking. If you hire this movie, see it with some friends and it makes good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run it.
