Now I need to get out of this curiosity and watch out - just like you are in car accident ... I congratulate the fact that this is a spoof, but I criticize the terrible direction, acting and dialogue of God. <br /> <br /> It was rated as one of the most poor films I've ever seen - it looks like the episode of Tales from the Crypt Keeper and is poor in it <br /> <br /> Okay - Some criticisms (1) Doctor When the monster was in front of the monster (we never see him attack the monster, we assume its heart attack), after the army the shells, rockets, Etlu launch - from the feet, it is the doctor - Despite the fact that he's still alive, and the doctor by any missile (2), 100 yards from the military, and we see a flame-thrower is used - Geez, the things that are more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tried to take professor, the soldiers run into the roof of the classroom and the fire; Monster boy falling, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster? Come! (4) Looks Something From The Monster Power Rangers! (5) Five "good people" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and kid) will be surprised at all, and we react to the reactions (other hand) - so natural! (6) General just goes away, time after time (7) refuses to try normal electricity and (8) acting is awful (9) I do not mention the rubber suit monster? (10) That god-awful music, non stop!
