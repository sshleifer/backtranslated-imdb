When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We have done this for a while or another time, but I do not need to look at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons": I'm a kid and a simple; <br /> <br /> Fortunately, good things I now appreciate. Stargate SG-1 is not good. Every 12 years old is a hacked bit for me, a curved dialog in each row, and every bit of an unwanted technobubble. The writing is beyond the spine; So it makes a miss star trek with corny and enthusiastic: Voyager. <br /> <br /> Star Stardust film is fantastic James Pleasure, James Spider and Kurt Russell, fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, an excellent musical score, and cold science fiction ideas. Except for the original music, nothing is funny in this movie. MacGyver is worth watching and Richard Dean Anderson, who made an interesting legend, was half asleep. <br /> Sometimes Sets sometimes look like a basement because the budget should be very low. Cinematography is not as good as a vanilla and dull like scripts. It's a surprise to me that it's too much style (like Farscape) and the substance (such as the reimagined bottle galaxy GCC) is smaller than the pop and less warm fans. It's not just deserved.
