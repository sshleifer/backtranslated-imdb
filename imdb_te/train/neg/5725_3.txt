2005 gave us a very good "nail romance" film hostel, and gave us Live Feed 2006; Hostel is not as good. The live feed follows a very similar principle as the previous film of Eli Roth, except for the rest of Europe except Asia. The plot focuses on these dumb kids and one of them is frustrated by locals, so they find themselves in trouble. The locals get all of them in the theater and decide to kill them. Director Ryan Nicholson I heard a little better than 45 minutes of the rapacious and revenge movie "Torched" in the past when I saw it. But this film is very rare or just boring. The film attempts to rekindle the good old days of the Grindhouse cinematic movie (which has been successful in the hostel), but it does not really come. Surprisingly, Nicholson's earlier work in Special Effects - Gore is not impressive ... it's far better than acting! I can not say much about this movie ... it's not good, it's not good. Avoid this!
