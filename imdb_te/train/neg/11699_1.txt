The Sun's plot is decisive. And gross. An obese advocate runs on the Gypsy woman, and Gypsy curse loses him and loses weight ... bone. Well, the gypsy votive should be fun, but is it bad to lose weight? Nope. Stephen King feels like that. And Michael MacDowell, the other horror writer and screenwriter of this static film. The lawyer is not criminally irresponsible, he is very fat, haha! The theater is like an immature piece of garbage for a man who moans how he / she did not see anything disgusting than his fat. Hey, I can only say: well, look at the mirror.
