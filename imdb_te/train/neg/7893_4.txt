Initially we need to see some kind of secret council. It all looks very good to go. The mystery is more interesting by the minute with some supernatural elements thrown. The main character that looks like a good racer is his argument for money because he (temptation) and other items. You really have an affair with the guy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Usually a person has many options in his situation. Somehow he did not have those options. While it is clear in the film, it's a solution, it's not his fault. From the blue he meets the roles of the church, prayer and god that speaks. And they provide answers to his problem. This solution should be clear at a time in the picture. Say now that there is nothing wrong with this message. This is always useful. But this message really needs to be hidden. This pastoral fact has actually destroyed the experience for me. Although the message is good, it is not simpler to avoid the fact that it is more realistic in solving the problems presented in the film. The mystery given to us can never be resolved. Of course, you will be forced to deal with something else that is not necessarily plotable. Do not be fooled by Malcolm Madwel. Once clever actor is enough, but if you look closely you will see he's not serious at all. He really needs to be upset for money. What else does his caliber film actor do in the film?
