I can not compare films like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or Malta Falcon when I mention Malice as Film Film, and I can not compare director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Louis Bunuel. I am just writing a protest against the darkness in this movie to finish just from the start, and how much you can not do what's going to happen. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes but the film is dark even in the daytime Brady, I'm damaged to understand. However, if the director Becker is shot in the entire darkness, it will not be much different.
