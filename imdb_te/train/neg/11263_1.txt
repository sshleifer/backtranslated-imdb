Often, a fine actor like Joseph Finnes is shocked to drive himself into a boring piece. This film is not just bad, but right terrible and down the quality of any voicing. The plot, (is there?) Seemed to be where it went. The Russians have been killed or killed and the rest of the cast should be declared vacant and vacant for their curiosity. I gave the way 3/4 and turned it off. Not only because there is a "1" low for terrible. Do not waste your time at this time, you will not lose anything.
