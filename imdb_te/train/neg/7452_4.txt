For me, this film seemed to fall on his face. The main problem for me is the glower casting as a serial killer. I do not know whether it is kind of casting or his attitude, but I suspect Glover can always play a role villain. He is a good person, and it is always clear in his performances. Unlike your running film for the mill serial killer story. Not too innovative.
