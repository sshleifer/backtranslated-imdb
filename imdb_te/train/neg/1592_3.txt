This sudsy maternity ward has been set up as "difficult cases" in a separate ward to enhance the play's story. The main story is Loretta Young's; She survived a long prison for her murder. Should doctors save her child at a cost of her life or against her husband's plea? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they are not the least honest sort to say. For example, in order to merely move things out, this hospital has a mental ward beside the maternity department and miscarriage revolves around the abortion of a woman with a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> Just laughs and sarcasm is the image of these worners, from her Glenda Farrell, she wears gin from a hot water bottle, waiting for her to have twins, and now it seems that there is a law on the sale. An example of her resume: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Alin McMahon is a great writer as the main nurse, but do not expect her to give a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme in this movie. Despite the clear limits, the film should be better than that.
