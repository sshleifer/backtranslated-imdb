Subject viewers will remember the bad headache that gave them over the film due to the overly charming, inconsistent, camera work and fast, confusing cutting. If they did most of their movies like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh's proof, I was not against those stylized devices, but in this case there was a lot of WAY. You can not realize that the story of the Mexican city and every important scene along with each fly, like jump-cuts and light flies, are narrow and totally imaginable. The biggest disappointment is the fact that in fact the whole thing is going to figure out how to end. The story is said to be a story of violent, brutal and morally corrupt film, and it is unlikely that too much depth and character development is not mentioned. This is another disappointing factor in the film. I do not need any justification, but the film attempts to justify the killing of Denzel Washington's murder and failed to deliver any unbelievable performances. The first half hour or so most dumb rakats and clocks are filmed and the action machine rolling starts to be cut so quickly that it does not really know what's going to happen. Hence the film does not act as a credible play / thriller level or a pure action film. The film of course is not quite as bad as the blackbusters in the last few years completely messed up, so many people do not understand why so many people are why this movie is fresh and very cool. For a video clip it is too long and there is very little material for an image.
