Nicolas Rogue? Has he not made a classic supernatural thriller Don`t Lek now? Surprisingly the above-mentioned film was broadcast on BBC Television on the weekend, which did not provide any proof of heavenly sound at night. <br /> They both have the same director and the same design and I have seen from the first third part of the first gold because they do not match Don`t with the golden paradise. Instead of the dead husband replaced the dead child instead of the dead child, in fact my mind was breathing in the film to the film. This happens as it occurs at the time of the occurrence, but a huge plot twist, although it is an important story twist and is not explained in any great depth. <br /> <br /> People say that Cold Heaven's poor product values ​​are worthless and should not be observed. If I did not do it differently, I thought it was TV. Because of the title sequence it is made up of white capital letters for television. Rogue also tries to find artistic performance by speaking thought processes, but does not help the film again. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values ​​are by negligible directing, making a strange heroine and screenplay bad image.
