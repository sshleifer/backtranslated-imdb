<br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the most cinematic days of movie theaters every year. Because of this, film studios are avoiding releasing weekend big budget images. In every few years a studio has released a program of every-programmed women's curve (2001's "The Wedding Planner") to compete with the big game. Similarly, "The Wedding Date" enters the success of the Super Bowl Weekend and attracts the audience without seeing the game. <br /> <br /> "Her sister is a lover of marriage in London, and her family is hard for her to marry her, who is seven years old Her ex-member, who left her without reason for her, was the best man, and Cat Nicki, who hates him, could not see him to meet her, but eventually Nick Kat learns that she can open her, and let anyone love her <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of money from the same wedding films, which contains almost carbon copy of 1999's "Picture Perfect" and mixed scenes in "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friend's Wedding" The film has a reverse "Pretty Woman" theme, and the director is introducing intelligent suggestions for that and other films to know her audience <br /> <br /> All the clich√© elements of "Wedding Date" are a stereotypical overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and practically by plagiarized wedding speeches of family and friends at a simple wedding image, marriage and rehearsal dinner is plagiarized. The twist at the finish was done before, but it is something that is not fully evaluated. The original reason for the cat dumped is surprisingly coming and changes the direction of the movie for the last half an hour. <br /> <br /> "The Wedding Date" is speculative, although it's own. Debra Messing, in her first major role, proves that she is beautiful and funny. Dermat Mulroney has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his conversation is crisp and unreal. He can do better in what he has given and can save the character. <br /> <br /> The film is actually funny by using the most intelligent pains (often sexually). Mainly a chic-flick movie can be enjoyed by everyone. Good feel, humor is the best film that has been released for a long time.
