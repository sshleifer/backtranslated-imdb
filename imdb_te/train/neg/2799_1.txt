Whoever wrote the script for the film does not need to work in Hollywood (there is no), and the actors need another job. It was a very awkward hour and a few minutes in my life ... and I saw only looking to see what was good, unfortunately it did not work for me. <br /> In the end, I worry. I guess there are not many people behind this movie because most people have to roll the credits slowly. <br /> <br /> The film is absolutely great "How Not to Make a Movie" guide. Very bad I can not give 0.
