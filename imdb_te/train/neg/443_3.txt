Overall the most frustrating image. To build up a very, very slow basic storyline. The role of Maria Scrader was secretive to her families. (Every take seems to be sustainable forever?) *** Spellers *** She protects herself from a Nazis by a German woman who plays Ruth Cajja Rieman. Ruth's overall character is a three-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** Spoilers End *** The film moves between New York and Berlin and Berlin between the 40s. When you do this, give a hint to indicate the story is going on at any time. Is there never a clear indication of time? Very annoying. The worst part, the end. *** Spoilers *** Full Performance about the Jews and Jabber was just as severely hurt, just in an official accident! Will you be. Do the Jews come out of Rosenstrasse? The question of liberating the Jews was never answered. Have you sleeped with Gobels Lion Fischer Goebbels? In Venice, the film won the acting award for K. Rayman, why? ?? I do not know. Should the Jewish theme be?
