I did not say that the movie was the worst film ever, but when it was first released in theaters, I personally thought about it (1) opening the door to my girlfriend, Basically laughed in the movie Rudu is the only "serious" image I remember. Once we reached the infamous (and endless) snake fighting scene, I thought I had left everyone. <br /> <br /> I would like to be a quiet film. Oh, and Bo's Chest, although her acting nudity is continuous and does not rate more than the Playboy films. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" of the film is terrible acting and the dire direction of her husband. The most ineffective "action" sequences that never snake the snake fight. However, it is very painful in those films, it is good to see the level of random humor. The worst picture that I am paying for.
