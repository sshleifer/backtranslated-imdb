Most of Stephen King's short stories did not take much time to develop small gems and original ideas; It's basically lean and mean - he sets them up a bit quickly with the pages, you read 'em, and you're done before you start. They are similar to Carton's MacDonald Fries - they really taste good and you know they have a lot of nutritional value (again: they do not say much about the universal human condition in the literary perspective), but you can still scarf em down, not just a pig Go for additional super-sized episode and fill in a lot of grease ("Grey "A metaphor for the prose in Kings' novel beside the sinister-cultural observations or the intelligent yanky side - let's see with the story already!) He composed four books of short stories. I've read all of them - from Night Shift to the latest, Everything Examiner, and they are capable of everything, which is sometimes very small in his tome-size novels. <br /> <br /> His short stories are not welcome ... It brings us to the TV simulations of nightmares and dreamscapes ... <br /> How they are in hell (series producers) 15 pages Did 50 minutes of episodes come to light on average average stories? How do I say - two words - "Stephen King." The stories with their name are probably not cheap, and an hour displays that provide more than half an hour ... mostly anthology of the 23 or 24 minute episodes that will become taller, and <br /> <br /> I'm wasting time syncing the plot of stories - This review you have already read the stories and /; My Gut reaction to what TNT has submitted is ... In my four installments so far, my ten percent estimate (from scratch to the worst): <br /> The battlefield - is not a classic, but argues that hey, putting William, without any dialogue with this episode Hurt from opening his trap by shooting episode? In the tongue of the killer juni doll from the trilogy of terror, the shoe mention and destruction I was aware of their mission to the producers (the author of the son of retard matherson son Richard Matheson), at the same time taking a surprise action. It took longer to get hurt's apartment than it should have, but I think the goal was fulfilled in it. <br /> <br /> The final case of Umno - William H. This is mainly due to Mackie's performance. I think the story is realistic and the story of the King short story (probably not half the audience, though not the audience) because the writer / Umney initially wanted to appear in the beginning of the private eye / Ummin because the controversy setup was a source of inspiration by the writer Reality, so it should already take place, Beautiful and brilliant hard-boiled repute Alum banned private dick. When the author / Umnie family began to reveal the tragedy, I thought that I developed an emotional connection to the presentation (at least, at least), and I thought he was sympathetic to the real life of MESSIEF to avoid his hardship with the enthusiasm of his fictional creation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Twenty minutes later, I was ready to scream at TV - okay, we already get it, my youngest Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! I'm talking to Ron Livingstone camera ("I'm getting it" - not just as I say) because it's already built because he had not built a plane because he could not stop it, but almost died; And, when he preached chemistry, he broke his chemistry experiment (to think that if the child had some parental supervision, the world was prevented at the end). We have been wasting time to establish Henry Thomas's uber-intellectual, and when we finally reached the conclusion of his discovery - the end of the world is an undesirable ambiguity - how much do we see the world? "The short video footage of a reporter is in the hands of brief radio broadcasts to forget what she is reporting, and the day of judgment.Oh, and brother's parents drooling and singing old songs If your story is really about" the whole mess (world) end " I'm going to see "mess" while going in flames and crashes and burns. <br /> <br /> Crouch End - This episode will completely eliminate me when a happy couple comes to their hotel, meals and intrigues, meals, and a taxi (half of it is there), they eventually end up at the end of the end The episode has delivered the cold, but it has been a fragile one, it's not horrific, it's practically ridiculous ... Oh, look - a kitty ... wait D, it turns out ... Oh my God! It's terrible to see eye! Uh-huh. They are so far during the day to night, Crouch End sequences were filmed. When you accidentally phannini you can see the shadow of the night. But I guess it's not high enough to shoot at night on fake London where they are slapped together for sets. On the page, it is a frightening story about the terrible things that surround tourists in a corner where they go to places. In this adaptation only insurance direction and acting - are really horrendous. <br /> The whole series is average (so far): 4/10
