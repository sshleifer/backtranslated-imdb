Where to get started. The film appears as a rip-off of "Darkness Falls". The older, bizarre woman living in the woods offers presents for giving teeth to children. Sound familiar? Then it will change. In the "Darkness Falls", if you see her, only the tooth fairy was killed. In this movie the tooth fairy is dead. Why do they do rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubba and their sister? I think this film is done without them. Producers seem to have been sitting around and decided that they wanted to keep extra people in the film, so people try to kill the teeth of the teeth. However, it is good to see a pretty blonde girl that has not been portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. Rent it, but I do not suggest buying it.
