Lorenzo Lomas has acted as a type CIA agent and seizes some exotic beauty under the name Alex, which forces her to kidnap her daughter and fight her former owners. O.J Simpson is on board to provide a dash of credibility of acting for an uncompromising compound. I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or I accept his movies. He stinks. Although Lemas, Jean-Claude Van Dummel, looks like compared to O.J Simpson and Kimmont's wife, Lyme. Oji I only saw the CIA because of the restored interest around the Simpson inquiry, because if your parents have cable and extra channels, you can not escape this film. In 1994 you could go to the Amish community and some Maran is playing on this portable TV. This film is a collection of slum action sequences and is a conspiracy, while OJG. The shock value and liners of jumping after Simpson fireballs offer some random comedy. Also Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant are these full camp classic? <br /> * Out of 4 (Bad)
