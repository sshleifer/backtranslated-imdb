I have seen this whole movie saying something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. In fact terrible. But it's terrible that I kept my attention in that tragedy, looking at a tragedy and not seeing it away. <p> <br /> <br /> "You have seen the frauds that you have killed, the poor victims nothis agape and waaaaaaayay they thrill a long time to think about the coming doom of their time, their deaths are outrageously contrived by the Deliverer When two women fight for a gun, when it goes back, your heart warms with old combat scenes, both of them see themselves, then some others <br /> <br /> "I think movies get worse, then this might be a good choice for you. <br /> <br /> It's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, "They Live" featuring Rudy Roddy Piper, but it is more fun to watch than luck-warm movies like Omen II or III. 10 to 4.
