It is an image that attempts to rebell the Thai history, set in ancient history Ayutthaya. I have decided to look at this theater because I have seen and enjoyed a lot of Thai movies, Thai actors Thai and one of the martial arts craziness. Well, it's no one. The film is completely depicted in English, featuring the full potential of the English actors and the production values ​​are very bad, it's ridiculous ... but not funny! Who can we stare for this trash? Acting, dialog and many sets are too bad. Some of the action scenes were choreographed by the local high school drama club. Special effects are also very bad, but there are fewer animations on the screen that have some special cheesy effect. It has a big, epic-style outdoor fighting scenario where thousands of extra clothing runs a field, but when we see two armies are struck in the fight - HA! What a joke! The film has a pair of beauties. They did not show any more skin. Guys had at least something to appreciate. No trouble.
