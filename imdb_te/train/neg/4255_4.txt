The film begins with a beautiful woman running in a white gown in the eastern European town. She knows something soon, because she is looking behind. And soon she's going to chase a mysterious man with a black trench. Then the man realizes that he is actually a bloodthirsty hunter and he is next. But what is her reflection in the look window ??? What a vampire just the same kind! <br /> <br /> In the 60's and 70's old hammer movies this twilight and amazingly fun throwback (the twins in credits are of course the twins of evil which are given to the twins of evil <br /> Every small plot of Dracula (every time he's reborn) He transforms his appearance, so the producer doesn`t come to the media students who are aware that he is dead and thought he is dead I do not care about all the movies that say that drinking blood transfusions of vampire blood turns into blood vampire and use vampire blood to find treatment for the trouble of our jerky allies. + It is obviously wrong and vampire for everyone. <br /> <br / > A new concept, but seriously retracted. <br /> <br /> For example, the media Students, tried to bring back the life of the drug, for example, in the bathtub filled with blood, the building. The house is very scary to be at the center, but have there? In the absence of any reason they decide to take the demons of an abandoned swimming pool. Sigh. The film had a real problem with the movie "The Movies", and the house scene was perfect for a hammer-like image, but the film quickly gears and changes to medical horrors. It's nearly impossible to introduce any of them, but it's almost impossible to forgive us. There are students among Med students and their wheelchair-bound professor type "friend": arrogant, boring, money hungry, and stupid. Until Med School meets a hunk / big breast quotient for its muscles, how are they surprised me at med school? And then there is a mysterious Vampire Hunter by the movie. Hey I can respect that but the picture will be about him and it would be nice if they did not set it up. You have random priests, cops, and sciences types. <br /> <br /> When many people introduce, the person will be forgotten enough to save the person or get upset soon enough to jump to the cheap threat. <br /> It is usually a lazy picture. What genuine fears scares just a few predictable jump. Set up for this is so extensive that it is hilarious. Blood bath filled with tests. It is clear that Drake murky blood is going to pop. And yet we must wait too long to get inevitable jump scare. After this he kills dubber and big breast med students. We all know that she is going to be one of her dead. But what do others do? Grave her in a shallow tomb near her house. Sighs, so you know who can jump at you when the cops appear at the house. <br /> Maybe someone will have a suggestion that it's impossible to make a horror movie vampire and go for the weather, and then we end up with the whole movie that's good for the opening scene.
