Thanks again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed my whole time favorite "Avalon" and "Diner". He has some good films ("Rainman"), but has always been anxious ... until now. I tell you about humor is a bad thing, it's boring. "Jealousy" is the definition of boring. I'm a big fan of the pure slapstick ("Dumb and Dumbler"), and I was surprised to see how bad the film was. Probably there are 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you pay attention to that long time. The best part of the film is the title of the title song by Red Bone sound-alike. If the film is written as well as the song, it would have been reasonable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and they all want to do comedy (Julianne Moore), but reveals a weakness in the real world. SNL cast member Amy Pohler played a major role in her role as she became the princess of the trailer park. The disaster of this film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work alternation brings together some promises, but then their chemistry disappears to the poor script. This script is like the ideas of Jack Black's character - not a bad idea, but there is no hope for success.
