I saw romantic comedies and it was one of the easiest / worst trials in one. The scenes work in a plugged-and-play manner, perfectly adapted to the romantic-comedy genre. This is usually true because we deal with a genre, but the challenge is usually original, new and innovative. <br /> <br /> There are no separate characters except Silvie Morse (not the original actor of the film, Isabelle Blais). They fit into the e-dimensional clich√© and nothing more than the simplest puppets that they used for a much lighter story. <br /> <br /> The film's motion, the lack of rhythm and the editing is full of fun. With unnecessary close-ups. I also need to mention the overly stylized decorors that make some scenes that are not very clear, trying to make something natural or natural. Moreover, you have reasonable music that is unfortunately, often unevenly heard. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the film which clearly articulates Woody Allen is not fraudulent. If you're looking for good lighting romantic comedy, this is not the case. Or rather, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> When the film is over for more than 100 years, the film is getting rid of astonishing theater, and the good quecois directors make better films. <br /> <br /> Les Friends is a good movie. If the film is considered an art and director cinematography it is bad.
