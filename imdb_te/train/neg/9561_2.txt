Many others commented here before me, I was bad, but it was not the worst I had ever seen. <br /> When I see a TV show or some episode, I do not have direct instructions for the film plot or sequences in this comment, making me feel that they are there. Some extra $$$ cost CGI (I've seen that's worse) ... In all, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology, there is an insult to the viewer. There were a lot of emotions for insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself begging for the fast - half way to begging through. Moreover, there are countless "easy ways" scenes as insulting to your intelligence as a thoughtful human being. <br /> <br /> The movie is two stars from me, because one thing and one thing: the performances of the actors are not half-bad, the script The rebellion is the worst. However, they should never sign the film. <br /> <br /> You must have a studio's name or something like this movie's top score, <br /> <br /> For all of you who have not seen this stuff, make your own mind. But the floor is low on your expectations (and some later).
