First, Hackman takes about half an hour to get out of jail and start working. Time erupted, we all know that Hackman is out to make some job for his masters, why these scenes wasted the movie three. Then Hackman is in a hotel and the story arc goes somewhere again, just seeing the closer to Hackman and proving to us that he is telling us or by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then wasting time with his wife to reunite. All of this is a real action, a set for conspiracy and plot turns should take a much easier 10-15 minutes. By the time I realized that the real action was going to happen, I wanted the film to end. Hackman is just as good as the other, and other actors as well, but this is the momentum of the first dimension.
