David Mammoth is a very interesting and very reasonable director. <br /> <br /> His first film, 'House of Games', was the best I liked, and when it came to critical conditions, its perspective set the line of images through life changes, and thus the viewer's perspective. <br /> <'Homeside' is trying to set the viewer's mind to the normal crime scene from the title. The main characters deal with two cops, a Jewish and an Irish racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner, an ancient veteran of the Independence struggle in Israel, stirs the Jewish identity of the Jewish detective's mind and heart. <br /> <br /> This is more evident in the flaws of the film. The awakening process is theatrical and believable difficulty, the Jewish terrorist group opera and the detective finally leads to the final violent confrontation. <br /> <br /> Joe Montgna and William Masy provide strong performances, but the story's defects are quite clear to easily replace them. .
