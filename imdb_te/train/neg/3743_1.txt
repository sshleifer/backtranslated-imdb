Although the first episode of the Jared Diamond episode, other people in the world do not have pets, it is said that Europeans made it, and why the reason for making steel and finding complex machines. But in the third part of Europe, when he was in the south of Europe, they planted cattle and crops in the Zulian people and other tribes. <br /> <br /> Diamond also germs (brought to North America) is the largest weapon in the form of smallpox. If 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 homeland fighters and 400 non-military non-South African 10,000 joules * can be defeated without any death, then I would like you to confirm that germs are irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that African influences, malaria stops malaria from killing Europeans "thousands of people" and migrating North Korea. (I'd like to know the real numbers but he does not.) Then eventually he killed millions of Africans and so they can not meet us. So is it Jared? Has Malaria helped Africans prevent or erase the Erpians? How was Europe still present despite the large number of pests across our history? <br /> <br /> He is very keen to say that the Europeans were mute fortunes for the success of the Europeans. In some cases, he threatens to kill his passionate ideals, but he does not want Europeans to succeed. It is sad to see his apparent neo-Marxist contort reality.
