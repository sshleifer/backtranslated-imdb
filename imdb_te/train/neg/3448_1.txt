This image is still checked when it's 6 votes and it's going to be 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a terrible movie. Let's break it down. The first thing you notice about the film is that it was shot at freshman's hand-held digital camera in a community college. The next thing you'll notice is that the actors, all the friends (that's probably all friends who met them at the pub before the night), you will notice that musical editing is terrible, and they will be 30 seconds in the movie ... all digital editing on the latest home PC Windows Movie Maker can be used ... This movie is terrible ... laughs, an unwarranted evil Crypt, and I do not recommend anyone to know this film, but I will make a sentence to the author and the director to watch this film in hell for eternity.
