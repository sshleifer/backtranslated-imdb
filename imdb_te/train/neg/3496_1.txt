I remember my parents understood Saturday Night Live. They do not even understand rock n roll and many other things. Now I am approaching their age, I still remember, I understand many things in my children's love. But it is painful. I can not say seeing anything by Sarah except there are some shows out there and there. They are reasonable. I did not see her exclusively. But this program is less than I expected from her. IMDb wrote and made it sound as potential. So, for that, I started looking at the first part. I turned it off by half way. Anything is fine. The jokes intended for a 5 year old are presented in the planned adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult has moved to turn you off. I really believe that some comedy has been funded by this insult. The best thing to say is that there are so many juices that many Jews have deposited there, saving other shows from such trouble.
