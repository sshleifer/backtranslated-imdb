I've seen Arthur (The TV series and Books) years ago and do not like this program (sorry if you're a fan of this cartoon, I'm scattering it for you) <br /> <br /> Children's characters all the time (especially Aarethr And DW), they are often better for each other, but gradually the attitude of Arthur's complaint to everyone and his sister DW ( ), And DW is similar to ADHD (or ADD) as Arthur's 4-year-old sister, such as Arthur's friends and her stuffed animal collection), the friends of Arthur are not only in Arthur's books, but also as young and Parents No attention was paid. <br /> <br /> The great cartoon Ragos Modern Life, Arthur is not (no offense).
