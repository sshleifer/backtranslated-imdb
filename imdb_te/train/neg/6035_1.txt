I've wasted 83 minutes of my life in a horror movie film, because I want to give this negative vote. Acting is just a terrifying god, I'm really bad, the dialogue is worse, the script has sounded like this ... I can not think of any terrible thing to say. And the day "outside" and night "inside" shots would make you think the events took several days. Terribly starred, directed, written, etc. Gofer all the way down to how everyone gets a meal. Stay away from all these fees. If my protective grace is a good deed only for leaving the hell, telling the world to see this dirt. This film is the perfect reason why horror films never get worse.
