Zheng's Kohn was a very (very) entertaining British film about the German police commissioner in the late 1950s, who was haunted by a Jewish comedian's ghost he killed 15 years ago while he was working under Hitler in SS. <br /> <br /> The ghost comes back and wants to kill his murderer as a Jew and kill him. <br /> <br /> Otto, the German police officer, because in reality this is the name of the ghost, in Yiddish, `kiss my ass. "The police did not speak Yiddish, so he asked around until he realized the meaning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> There are some men who have killed the police commissioner's jurisdiction, and there are no helpful sources. Men were murdered with a set of missing knives from the local butcher. Though Kasai did not see his swords, the Commissioner announced that he had a liver and onion sandwich in the shop, so the commissioner was suspected. The first person was murdered when he loved his wife, so he was suspicious. But if he is killing every man who sleeps with his wife, he is very busy. <br /> If I were murdered I would have been a bit more angry than Jenkis Khan's ghost. If he is only a light car accident he has a good nature. I guess it's a very polite people because it's a British film. <br /> <br /> "I gave the film 4, I think it should be a bit more intense than that, and the movie becomes a murder mystery ), And he seemed to be more useful than Jenkis in which I gave a short form of Jewish culture, but skin-deep only all the Jews love the liver and onion sandwiches? <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a Jewish community center in Berkeley, CA and I was not alone in the room, completely gray or white. Or white hair) .18 of us have lived in the film after 20 minutes, and there are 2 main concerns mentioned: I do not know what the future generations really are, and I think this second concern is fraudulent, I think there is no need to worry about the presence of tons of literature, and I always see people like me are. The murder of 6,000,000 people with many bad people has never forgotten. They gave me this statement after telling others about my experience that day.
