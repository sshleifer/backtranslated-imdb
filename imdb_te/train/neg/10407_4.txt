I'm Tremure 4: The Legend Begins, Being Dull and Bored. All the action scenes are stupid. These "groboids" are reduced to the modern day cat's size, not small. Acting was horrified, and the film was an unnecessary film in Tremor Saga, as it tells the story of how stories have been shaped, the story is quite mute and ineffective. If you want to tell a story back in time, you're using someone in the past in other Tremor movies to be someone in the past (Michael Gross). If you do not see this film, do not waste your time. 1, 2, and 3, for a good time. If this movie is you, make sure you're remote STOP button is sitting next to you and work away for a quick retreat from this slick.
