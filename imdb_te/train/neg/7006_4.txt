Mark Hamille should have felt great embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! At this time, he uses a new type of "power" to return his dream machine, a bright red 'Vette. It looks like the first half-hour of another sour teen-age and turns the U-turn in the wrong direction. Writing and directing job threats, you can rarely take some scenes. You look forward to doing anyway, even in the end you will see the smell of the 70th blend. All the new ones, like all the songs, steal the show and save this poor picture from Repo Creeps! She has an interest in your inaccessible but joyous personality, and she's the best opportunity to watch her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, mark! I guess the Force is not with you at this time.
