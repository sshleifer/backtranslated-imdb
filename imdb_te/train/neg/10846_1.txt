Caligula is the way I want to stop by half the film ... but in this case, I'm only 15 minutes when I think. Unfortunately, I did it all the way through. <br /> <br /> Fearing is not to be fearful or frightening or frightening or frightening or sexual appetite. It's not what those things are, yet it's desperately wanting to be all of them. Instead, the boring, simple, simple, imaginative and recklessly poor performance (video, high school special effects, the primary visual hero does not exist, the dialog is not just heard ... it's not worth hearing). /> <br /> The film also proves that direct-to-video video distributors are required to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
