The producers of this film offer the funeral to spend the funeral when looking at the film. They should have offered intensive mentally to anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. A young couple moves into a house, where the woman from the pair found the woman who found the woman. Very boring, and very predictable. <br /> <br /> I do not care about anyone in this movie.
