For the first time since I spent nearly a year working on Danish television, I saw a cold case. It was almost drowned in almost 4 or 5 other American crimes when it came to TV. At the same time, it was broadcasted almost simultaneously. <br /> I saw it and I was bored of death. A pain behind standard actors who have self-fair faces and morals. <br /> <br /> The total evidence given by a group of researchers to solve murders 10-20-30 days or 60 years old is not to say. <br /> They also take a break from 50-60 minutes to solve the case and just stay alive, and take a break from the time they have just been able to get justice for family members. <br /> <br /> "This is the only reason for really looking at you .... There's a reason to see this trash.
