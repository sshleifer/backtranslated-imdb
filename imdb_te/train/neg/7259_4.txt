This is definitely one of the 70 weirder movies out there, and it is so important for Bigfoot emotional kicking off a decade. It is recognizable for the small touches of insanity throughout the film (as the user suggests, as one suggested by the character Travis Crabtree, who briefly paddle around the canoe, and then ... the leaves should not be seen again), as the dark and moody first half is replaced by a music interdependence in all subjects . Although it's painful now, I still have a fun horror movie to show the kids, and anyone who has a BigBut Lower or 70's Hilberley culture is committed to getting this kick. My favorite piece is: A door door jumps over the head (so!) And the storyteller explains that he has lost consciousness from "shock". <br /> Cheerful, who breaks a door on his head, why did he go to the unconscious, but what? <br /> If you like bad American 4/10 stars or 7/10.
