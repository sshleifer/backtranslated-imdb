The folks in the Texas / Louisiana border should have a good laugh or both when I publicly publicize this war of Paramount's B Unit. The simplest film on the Sabine River coast is the cotton country, like the rest of the Deep South, or at least the Deep South. <br /> There are large livestock empires, they are far from Texas, and they can ride to establish their empire over Richard Dix and Preston Foster. And when they steal their services by caring their livestock in Leo Cariire, they will save their cattle. <br /> <br /> Foster's marriage is accompanied by his younger neighbors, played by Dix's sister Frances Gifford. <br /> <br /> However, as Westerners are often suffering from geographical trifles, it is still good from Harry Sherman's production mill. That Hopalong caustic Western for Paramount Climax is a blazing, and I mean literally, a gun battle may be used in a product. </ P> <br /> But the Western fans can not see it.
