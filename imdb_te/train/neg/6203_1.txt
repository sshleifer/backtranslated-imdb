I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It's awesome! Every cliched, violent, rich boy fantasy is in the show, you know how to end the chef's wife's shots and the first girl's rape. <br /> <br /> Q & A with the author / writer and writer / producer tried to come across intellectuals but you could tell they're those types of getting off the violence. <br /> They often carry brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I want to save my boyfriend to go out.
