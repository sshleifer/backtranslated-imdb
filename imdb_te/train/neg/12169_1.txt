This is the 13th (1980) clone of Friday, which is the worst of the garbage and slander. The poster of the film appears to have a cross type between Jason and Freddy, which is likely to appeal to film-goers. Nothing about this film is good or entertaining about this film. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a camp consultant at Camp Rolling Hills, where he is known for her other camps Good and feel they are having trouble. Meanwhile, other campers find that people are wasting each other, and she does not need to send her to Angela. Once Angela Killer, who was involved in the Sex Effect operation of the previous years? Who knows? <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, many films that crossed between Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager styles were housed in which a mad killer was subtle. Some have a plot, some, but they're all about evil like this. Sleepweep Camp II: Unhealthy camps introduce 80 minutes of young people, then cut off, throat, looting, cutting, burning, and mutilated. This film is all over. It is vacuum and bloody violence. <br /> <br /> Looking at this film, the message of its viewers in which I was reminded of Friday is that the basic duty of teenagers is hacked to death 13 films. Sleepaway Camp II filmmakers have the right to be ashamed of themselves. Imagine the movie's teenage audience: "The world is a bad place," the movie tells you, "It kills it.It does not matter what your dreams or your hopes do not matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend. No, what do you do or what you plan for your plans for the future <br /> <br /> And the unhealthy thing - and does not give too much away - the picture just sets the room for the sequel. Well, why not? They probably took the dirty bucket by making three or three of these films. I missed the original Sleepaway Camp (1983), and, after seeing its first sequel, I hopefully will be away from the other sequels, as well as the original. And for parents, if you actually know the kids who love this movie, do not let them date your kids.
