They made this film as a fantasy man from Snowy River to Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, and they came to Joe to play high-tech talents for the romance and dance of the jo and play with the frustrated young wives of rich men. Well, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are a lot of papers, even though they have left space for artistic creativity in building historic dramas. I mean, not Robin Hood's story, not Beowulf's not the Arthurian legend, 99% of their life and times of entertainment is undoubtedly in the past several centuries. This is only a couple of weeks ago. My own grandparents were already at school when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> I'm crazy for the film to be a serious attempt to tell Kelly story. I have recently eagerly waited to be in a similar vein after reading Peter Karey's amazing novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang". But, in fact, closer to Mick Jagger's much ridiculous 1970 Kelly reality, most do not say the whole, this is a better image overall. </ P> <p> Take two bucks DVD! I'll give 3/10, and only because the Australian Bush's nice shots feel me generous.
