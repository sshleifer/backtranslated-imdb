Curiosity !! <br /> <br /> I love Brahang, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I love them in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but I can understand the actor's desire to avoid romance. . Well, they've done, but really - Banyan-Carter's outfits are memorable and occasionally the "mad" sequence film or old Rowan and Martin Laugh. <br /> <br /> I never got to point out - other commentators that Branagh's character is a dreamer . I never thought. He is a loser, and not too bright, and certainly not fascinating. The bank robber is just painful to see the business in disguise. <br /> <br /> Bonham-Carter's original (anticipated) attempts are harder, as realistic speech than the first 15 minutes of Lancaster's voice in "Full Mont". <br /> <br /> His poison on his hill with poetry is buried under the monster of his plane. <br /> Do you have an angelic band or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Get back to a class with a spine and a class of it. <br /> <br /> It is donated to PBS. <br /> <br />
