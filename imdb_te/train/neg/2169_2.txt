I usually enjoy the opening images of Loretta Young: her acting is light and windy, and she knows how to wear clothes. But this is just losing from the word unless Glenda Farrale turns funny support through. Young is a hip Czech girl who becomes her role-husband (Paul Lucas) championship bridge player. <br /> <br /> It's not a lot of movie games, and for long time, the mid-part of the talkie kills their marriage motion picture. <br /> There is an interesting bit. Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschalk started their climactic game, with quick shots a series of airplanes, trains, football games, a diver in the air, anticipation of the incident. This was the first use of a freeze frame that I saw in an American movie. Its rest are inventive and funny.
