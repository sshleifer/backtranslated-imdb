Wow, I can not believe that people thought this was a good film. Now I see it very bad, but there are so many romantic / funny jokes with kashak. <br /> This is the best film ever. Acting is not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there is little love and little love. There are many loose that are not displayed or unprofessional. Unfortunately, the main characters come complete shy. They know that they love people who are engaged. How do we know that they are not in love? Because the two characters left their financial resources because there was no repentance. <br /> <br /> The film does not end up with a wedding scene, both of which are cold feet and fall apart. Like a hot potato after a commitment is getting closer. This film, in fact, does not adhere to any of Kusak's previous characters, but deep commitment (Lloyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Point Funk, etc.). <br /> The biggest failure of the film is the lack of turns or any interest. Boring - When the movie was over, I thought they failed to include a climax to the story. <br /> <br /> If there is no joy, they do not have any suspicions about their work. <br /> <br /> In the dark of the film, people are very much shattered by the eyes, 'everyone is very much cynical!' With criticism. Criticism of the film is not hate, just an impartial test. <br /> <br /> If you think the film is good, try these movies, you will explode the hearts: Princess Bride, say any, Fair fitness, Charded, Rear Window, North West by North, or Something About Mary (today's society Which is a good test of ideal romance versus).
