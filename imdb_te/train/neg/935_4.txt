Users who rated this movie can not quite see the images that match it quite simply. Have they all thought ?? I was rarely disappointed by the film and attributed to the ridiculous hype around the film. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BU is a chase film. We pick it up at the end of a chase and go directly to another. And another. And another. And another. Are you looking at the evolution model? <br /> <br /> If you do not see the other two Bourne movies, you will lose pretty. <br /> <br /> If you had just lost one - it's a long way from a movie. <br /> <br /> Paul Green Grass's interactive critique style has worked best on United 93, a sentiment overload, but Bourne and his post-traumatic events have had an impact on the audience's removal from the role. He runs. He jumps. He's punching. He'll be blown away. He clears tall buildings. That's it. For all - he gets out. He is survived by a plastic action man, who has only managed to get rid of ridiculous stunts and no tension. So he digs a building? What is that? He is alive. <br /> <br /> Bourne's love interest was a girl who was mixed in the previous incarnation, but she was just a design. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literary self-innovation is dull and baseless and tells us that we do not know from the first film. He became a killing machine. Big deal. He found his true identity. What is that? <br /> <br /> The end of 'twist' is tailgapped and weak. Oh, dear, more I hate more about this film! I reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! <br /> <br /> I love good things and I love a good thriller. Bourne is not ultimatum. It's a loud, tedious sequence, confusing sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> Bond franchise is the 'worst thing' which is absolutely the worst. Casino Royale breaks water on it.
