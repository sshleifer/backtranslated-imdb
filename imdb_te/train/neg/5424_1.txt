Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat-out sluggish movie. Why did I see such films when I was young? Who knows? Perhaps another one then to punish me by watching a horrible film. I do not know, I think I need a hobby in my teen years. Youngsters emerge (Rainbow Harvest) comfort in the old mirror. She soon learns about the terrible power of this ancient mirror and helps her fight against those responsible. Movies like this, the power giver has a nasty side effect. <br /> If she does not like it, she turns inward. <br /> For some reason the mess of the restored image on d.v.d. A few years ago. I do not know why. They should be left in the shelf and collect dust. Some fans love this movie fans. I want to know why you should do it. Until then I did not like this movie and there was no reason to see me anymore. <br /> Not recommended.
