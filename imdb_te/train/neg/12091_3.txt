Well, Cannes's artifactist might be interested in this movie but I'm not afraid. If you want the movie type to be astonishing whether the actor fell asleep or for the cameraman dinner, it could be for you. The big part of it belongs to the discomforting sector with small pellets. I'm not surprised or upset by some other critics - just a little bit annoying and understandable. The only reason I did not give this actor is to say that acting is good. The plot, however, is much less of a recommendation. Most of the movie shows just a horror woman listening to the teaching or piano, which will appeal to some people. But you do not think it's harmful to make a bad taste in your mouth for illness and sexual abuse. Not recommended.
