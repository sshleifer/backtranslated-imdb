The film was slow but tedious and acting often drifted into the land of Ham. Redgrave's role as the 60 Wright lady who is trying to compete with Thurman's 20s for the love of Fox is missing. The title of the film is to be "horrific people on the lake". Actors played like they were in rehearsals. A terribly predictable end to boot. I can not believe that I am on this website as comedy!
