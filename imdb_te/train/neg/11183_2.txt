Despite the efforts of a talented actors game - there is no root for none of the "people who know me" and there is no clunker with no one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pacino Eli Wurman offers his usual tour de force, past his prime propaganda agent moral corruption away from the lifespan. <br /> <br /> Unlike Michael Carleone, in this role, it is impossible to embarrass investments in his confusion or his duty. <br /> <br /> The film displays Eli's preparations for a liberal political cause (Ryan O'Neill, better in an underwriter) The latest "Dirty laundry" - in this case, an earning TV teacher acting in the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her a traditional actor to this supporting role, however, the script does not give her much work. <br /> <br /> Eli's daughter, Kim Beasinger, has raised sympathy despite suspicious plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> Pacino is looking for his stuff, unfortunately, between the script and the directions, "People I know" are absolutely committed. Hence its limited theater release, and the fastest journey to DVD. Warn you.
