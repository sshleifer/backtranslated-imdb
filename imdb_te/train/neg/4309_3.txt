A high school leads a coach that turns out not only to know a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but also a catalyst for winning their new ways with the loser's basketball team (Keenan Wynn). Are you really surprised? As well as a romance between coach and team's star player Jack (Michael Bain). <br /> The police have no notification. <br/> <br/> Like other Great International films, the film is packed as a grindhouse film and there is no service to this movie. This week's televised film can be easily edited. Kathy Lee Crosby coach is very good as Randy Rawlings, but she is more than just typholishing from R-rated film. One side plot involving a dorky center that he hypnotized through his colleagues thinking he was the former NBA player Sidney Wicks is the original cause of the team's new success Cathy Lee training. Most teasing and enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment.
