Historian Ian Kershaw, a realistic Hitler biographer, Ian Kershaw, who was a scientific adviser to this TV movie, separated himself from it. This film is historically very wrong. When Hitler's father died in Aloe's home, the mistakes begin, in fact he died in the pub. In this film, Hitler traveled from Vienna to Munich in 1914, and in fact he reached Munich in 1913. I have gone forever. Hitler's childhood and youth path is depicted very little, which makes it difficult to understand the role of this depressive nervous man for historically unknown people. Important figures in the party's early days, such as Hitler's younger brother, Dietrich Eckert or party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, were missing. The role of Ernst Hanfstangl is very troublesome. In the film he almost hates Hitler. This script apparently follows Hanstansk's own glass, which he sees in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstangl is crazy about an anti-Semite and his "Fuehrer". But the film's biggest problem was the role of Hitler. He is constantly described as a negative person who does not have charisma or charm and constantly orders everyone. After seeing the film, a wonders, no bored man has ever been able to find any followers. As we all know, a nasty criminal Hitler tried to naturally describe Hitler as a totally frustrating and bizarre. But the facts, the private he might be the most beautiful and entertaining. His friends did not follow him because he would ever fall asleep, but they liked this strange man. Behind these historical flaws, the film is well done, actors first class, location images and product design give a reliable view of time.
