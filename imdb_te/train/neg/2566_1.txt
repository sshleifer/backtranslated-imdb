Recently Came in GEORGE 2, but I did not get to see it. Just awful! I can not even remember the plot. George and Ursula were not the first of George's and Yurse's, but I know that this is not enough. There is a lot of scrambling around, but direction and editing is very staggering and unstable, such as watching or deleted scenes. The AAP's back was not enough to heat me to have EP's uneven voice. George 2 is probably the only deadly sequel I've seen, and it tells something. Geez has to keep typing when the 10 lines rule because of IMDb, nothing more to say about the TV sequel for which I made this crapulastic. Disney, hang your head ashamed.
