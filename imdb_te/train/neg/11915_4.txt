This clear pilot teenager has a nickname of Canadian actress Shary Appleby for a constructive TV series. CGI is equivalent to a TV job, and Appleby is hard to swallow as a blend of superheroine. Enjoyed TV face Richard Burke is along with Ride as Appleby's mentor, but he can not do anything to raise this deck up the average level. From the beginning to the right, we see on the right side of the caterpillar flying ghost, the bad sign. Moreover, the scenes of Appleby training to the Burke War are actually ridiculous. These are a bad copy of such scenes in many other movies, notably Remo Williams.
