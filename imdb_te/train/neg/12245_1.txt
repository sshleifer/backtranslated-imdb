Why, O 'why! ... do I choose this? Well ... I needed no brainer in summer heat, and the cover was cool. <br /> <br /> I want to know you well. This really, really bad movie. And it becomes embarasing the manufacturers know badly and try to cover it by adding some sexy / beautiful women, and some sex scenes to it. <br /> <br /> If you'd like a cool image about a big reptile that is really, very good, very fond of and funny, the Lake Lake Silence! (It's an order)
