Having seen about half of this film, I have seen something weird ... I've been constantly changing through TV channels to see what I'm seeing from time to time - is not a good movie feature. <br /> <br /> I must say that the film is in many styles, and each of them has failed. By image 80% I switched over to see the old Reean look instead. Bottom Line - The whole picture is thought to have been made without any accuracy and ended in composing without noticeable taste.
