After crossing the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, there was much discussion about the restoration of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe it. Now people who make movies in HK give a new meaning to the crossword. Time 2 running is a perfect example. The name Ekkin Cheng is drawn, but he breaks the theme with idiot and waving a coin. He rolls the coin up and rolls again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a police role that follows the coin-flipping Pretty Boy. But once again: why do you know? She is a pretty actress in the female lead actress run by a kind of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she looks more like a spa or shopping center than a camera. Nothing understands. No action. No sex. There is no comedy. All name is a name: Ekin Cheng. And what do you know? Who cares?
