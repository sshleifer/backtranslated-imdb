3-D animation (highlight of the show) When it worked well, many other things were flat. Motion picture producers "Well, it's going to be 3-D, so we do not need to do that on the plot or character development." And the fact that it is a child's picture is certainly not necessary. The three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) are drawn to the public. <br /> <br /> However, the two dimensional scooters are the only ones to show the main characters. He removes the theme with his strength to eat everything that belongs to time. <br /> And perfect kicker? There is an inability to screen ahead of the screen and ruins of the screen and ruins announcing that the film's main characters call "contaminants" and put the condition of the Buzz Aldrin (after seeing the most robotic cartoon version of an hour and half) is too late. <br /> <br /> Do not you have Easter Bunny and Santa Claus kids when you are just now?
