Is this interesting? A Japanese-set haunted house story from a newly-established American family perspective ?? <br /> <br /> The film is plagued by the same problem faced by the modern modern renaissance of local problems. The souls show that they are bad for real reasons than they have imagined! Besides, does it deliver a lot of scares department? Only a crazy attack is just crazy? In general, the ghosts have a distinct role and diplomats like Susan George / Friend-of-the-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert are one kilo warehouse soup for his daughter! <br /> <br /> At one time, an old monk turns home to warn Albert if they are at home ?? In the end, he called for the fury of the campus. However, history has been committed to repeating and the only result of the unfortunate thing only created? Albert and McQueer, which has led to a violent yet unexpectedly funny climax, have their Japanese ancestral spirits, take part in an impromptu karate duel of death! At the end of the day, it's a dangerous time-only 88 minutes can be tolerated, but in no way, the necessary view.
