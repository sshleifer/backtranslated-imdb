They can not get slimmer than this film because many of the losers who tried to capture college spiritism in many of the high school's annual spring leisure celebrations. The problem is that after losing 15 years after college years, a woman's senator wants to be the next Vice President. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that the daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out. The girls are going through drunken passions, exotic dance and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It is not really worse than this awful movie.
