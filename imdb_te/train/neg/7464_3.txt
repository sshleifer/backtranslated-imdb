I did not see the whole movie. I could not see the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I love the mafia movies both tragic and comic, but the carcass romance can be very difficult. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Carcano Romano tries to laugh at the audience, a plot from Chris Kattan (Carki) to another. Carcaye is not entirely hypocritical and subtle or loyal - his strange habits are contrived for everything - than Chris Kutton clearly plays a role rather than 'acting' - it comes out of the story. Each scene is entirely imaginable, and the 'comedy event' will be visible on the set soon after the launch of each scene. The funny characters like the title of Mr. Bean are funny because the characters are funny and you end up with the motions of the characters and the situation that ends in the early incident and situation is not the telegraph. <br /> <br /> Chris gives the feeling that he is deliberately striking in a desperate attempt to run a smile from a viewer. <br /> <br /> Chris does not play such an alien character and its behavior is totally illogical (except trying to laugh) and comedy scenes are not so much imaginary and uniform - all jokes seem very familiar). But it is not. Do not see it.
