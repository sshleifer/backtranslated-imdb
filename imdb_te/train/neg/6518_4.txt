The film is pretty funny and involving about four dates, it will become a blatant trade to really stand for you (and his "friends"). This is a very interesting concept; The search for finding true love in modern LA includes movies. The problem is that it (and badly) seems to be the script and evidently self-promoting at times. It's difficult to draw and draw into any of the characters because the author and the actor are very ego, uncool, lying, and just unlikeable. You're sorry for his dates.
