<br /> <br /> It does not save the occasional creepy atmosphere and some good (though not used) decorative effects. While exploring some caves with his wife, the B-horror movie is man-from the sub-part of the creature. The Bat People Aka It Lives By Night has its untold narrative, which is awkwardly plot and poor. The storyline never goes anywhere and does not give an explanation to what the image is going on, or it's a satisfactory end to all. These actors are quite common in their performances. <br /> <br /> This film will give me some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. Last Stan Winston's makeup work is very beautiful, but it does not quite get a show here. Definitely a missing opportunity. <br /> <br /> There is definitely one out there of the little man-creature. <br /> * 1/2 **
