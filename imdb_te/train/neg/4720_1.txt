When I see this "documentary", I will see again the campaign of Serbia. Although Sergey and its nationalist politics are the main cause of Yugoslavian breakdown, it is not mentioned in the "documentary", which is his name designed by Bagdanovich and tells him that Serbia and his film are far from the goal. This is one of the lies lying by the Mississippi regime. Serbian Serbians are right and victims, although Serbian Serbisms have been massacred in Bosnia, attacked by all independent nations captured by Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. The USBruck is not far from Uralousia because Serbia did not want their nationalism to retain federal Yugoslav government, so that the SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia forced independent countries to defend their interests. A goal documentary about the breakdown of Yugoslavia is not interested in documentary, and indeed the documentary that has led it. You can see "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", made by Discovery Channel and BBC.
