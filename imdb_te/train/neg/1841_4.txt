It can be seen in many ways. This movie sucks, its good or its plain weird. Third, this film is probably best illustrated. It's strange themes and just a strange plot. <br /> <br /> To whom Christopher Walken was a bad guy, average or good in this regard. <br /> <br /> Acting is what you expect from Ben Stilller. Jack Black I've always loved you so you know that you will come out of him but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always on the wall. It is always happy to see how the movie is bad. Comedy is somewhat funny. Of course it will have its moments (even though it's too low) but it laughs here to laugh but of course it's not in a good way. <br /> Directing is also on average. Barry Levinson is a slightly over-ted director and did a really good job. The film seemed to be quite capable and he did not do much to reach it. <br /> <br /> It does not seem to make a lot of effort to make this film. <br /> <br /> The film is critical to good comedy. Obviously, the writing has failed here. Better than average. Looking at its time is not terrible. It's never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> Not for Christopher Walken, I gave a low rating to the stupid laughing end. He always has a lot of role in his films. Styles are strange characters that are just so whacked out strange characters that really do not go anywhere. I can not really recommend it because it is completely unforgettable but it is a very unforgettable movie.
