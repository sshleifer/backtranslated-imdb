... well, this pop into the DVD, you can not get back and find an hour and a half of your life. <br /> Acting? What acting? <br /> Product Values? ... product? ... values? <br /> The story? <br /> <br /> After many years of posting in the IMDb, I thought I was very bad at seeing a film. <br /> <br /> If the author or director, the cast or the producer's intention or effort, I have found at least one reason or two to see the merit. <br /> <br /> In this case, he is actually a single man who can obtain a handle (!), at least he performed through this undesirable waste of video tape, he has no talent. This meant that some of its first cinema class would be a "reasonable" junior high school's "product", but the masterpiece was called "artist" behind the twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /> How does this happen? Who has never written a check for this in their right mind? Moreover, do not let the cover of the box cover you: a far better sex scene or any good "exposure" of the hunk on the cover. <br /> <br /> The two elements: When the film redefines the "second" value, the above mentioned "talent" surrounds his girlfriend. I was happy! And, I learned from this "movie" one thing. That's true when something is so bad and really funny. But not in any comic manner; It's just joked sin. Very sad jokes.
