Since my review of 2006, after 30 years of production and the concept of the film, I agree that it might be a fantastic horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> Starting Halloween Night 1968, 6-year-old Michael is the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and escaped after 15 years and returns to murder again in his hometown. <br /> <br /> The film follows the radical and rudimentary path. Each scene is easily imaginative at the beginning of the music to be shot for each scene with Michael (murderer), thus alerting events that are likely to follow the viewer. <br /> <br /> For horror / thriller enthusiasm, blood / gore is not supplemented by modern images, but I am not affiliated with the amount I am presented at this day and age. <br /> <br /> From the half hour of the film, a scenario is not unexpected. The acting period of horror / thriller film is typical of the era and thus there is no punch on the modern day enthusiast. <br /> <br /> The film has a very positive camera shots and dark lighting for the film. <br /> <br /> Jamie Lee Lee Curtis plays the role of Michael's doctor. She failed to provide infant stages of acting life and thus threatening central victim. <br /> <br /> The movie is very low in the 80s and sometime, 90s, from the other horror / thriller movies, but it really gets a lot of great horror / thriller film in its day itself. Suggest to find a classic. Cheers!
