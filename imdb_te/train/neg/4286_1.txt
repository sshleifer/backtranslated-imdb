This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've ever seen. I also saw a soldier in which he played the role of villain ... but I heard, it is not considered Jason Scott Lee's film. It is, however,. And if it indicates the quality of such images, I can not see anything else. Lee Marshall is basically passable as an artist ... as main, he is awful. With every minimum period of the film he has to fight with random unnamed characters because the script writer did not recognize how to remove the film with the minimum required time for the film. The villain is the only character with only a hint of personality, and of course the fact that he is certifiably mad, he just seems like a villain. Most of the film follows Lee Villain primarily through time ... or the other way around it. I can not say it ... and I can not see again to be sure. The effects are not completely terrible ... but it's close. The title came from the famous idea of ​​using a time-machine to kill and kill Hitler. However, the film again makes that interesting idea. The plot is very critical for its own good. Pacing is poor. I can not think of a positive thing to say about this film ... I can not really do that. It is very straightforward and nonsense. If I had a time-machine, I would go back and prevent this film from making it so far ... No, never mind. I hope that some vulnerable minds will be exposed as far as possible. Listen to negative commentators. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee fans, and no one else. If you are looking for a quality image ... well, it's not. That's perfect. 1/10
