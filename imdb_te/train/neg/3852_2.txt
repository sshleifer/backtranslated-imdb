Is this one of the most boring movies I've ever seen ?? I do not really know why? Your run-of-the-mill stories about the guy who wants to get married, and instead starts to fancy someone else. The story is said a thousand times. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure what's wrong with this film. This type of actors / actresses have spent a lot of time preparing the film a million times earlier, which is quite entertaining. The ones that are not really any other really are usually a little thoughtful thing. For some reason, you do not have your attention. You can pick out some funny episodes, or intelligent thoughts, but for some reason they are not just funny, or how intelligent ?? I'd like something new to explain it, but I did not? Do not waste your time in this one time?
