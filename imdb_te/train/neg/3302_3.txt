Swedish Action Movies has evolved with something to imitate American hardened action movies like "Heat" over the past few years but with a low budget. The film follows the same prescription, such as "Knoll Tolerz" and "Livewriter". <br /> <br /> The story is seen before, the dialogue feels artificially and acting most importantly, especially from the mainstream actress. The film attempts to portray pictorial images, such as a tight broth, and a female researcher who has been completely lost by previous problems, but at the same time utterly rationally. <br /> <br /> The blue-cast photo style is no longer fresh and does not make it well. Very few scenes appear to be good. Also, the sound sounds so strange after a very strange and original dialogue. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sack, but a SWAT-team's persuasive film leader, there are some really funny lines. Also, the music is great.
