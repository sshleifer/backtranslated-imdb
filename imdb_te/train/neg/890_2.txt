I looked at this regulatory overnight at the screening of the preview and I was blown away how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film was practically flattened by its grid blind spots. Are there any black or gay homosexuals in love? Or who knows the white people who are self-involved in love, say,? I know this is not a love crash of Avul-Tastic Inklawins, but you should not have a cinematic New York with these dominant members of society. Plus, you know that the Ham hand deserves the Oscar that crashed the people who have produced this Ish, so where is everyone? <br /> <br /> The worst and tougher socio-economic ignorance is the worst chapters on the right (remember when you are in high school and among whom are openly disadvantaged). This film has led to a series of lines to be so bad. Bad acting, bad writing, bad direction - all potential genres, aggravated by rich white people. <br /> <br /> They came back to powerhouse with Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson returning for the Jumper reunion. And, on the side note, Uma bullet dodged; Ethan Hack destroyed. <br /> <br /> "At the end of the movie questionnaire is the least favorite scene, but saddens me because I really like those two actors It should be a bit of Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the lack of taste. I do not think I was easily ruined, but what I can do is deteriorate and see with someone like a 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> In this fierce competition Shea LaBeouf's tone in the second place is meant to act as a deaf person, against former Disney Channel star Julie Christie.I do not oppose it, I mean, only the explanation is that I have realized that the opening scene with Orlando Bloom is relatively highlighted. Immediately remember when you pull your ear out Cukondi, first in New York, which was passed to the real world. This film is particularly troubling, vicitramainadi, equitable, asamarthamainadi, naked and finally was completely divorced from the real idea of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
