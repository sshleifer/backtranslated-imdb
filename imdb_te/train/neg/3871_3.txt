When I see a low-budget movie, I'm trying very much. I also apply low weight for independent and low budget productions versus big budget productions. I want to be flawless from big budget productions and their studios. So I apply stronger standards for major studio releases. But this film is just a worse. Period. The premise is terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), is credited as a high school high school with an undesirable desire to solve the crimes. She did not walk deep in her role or in acting. <br /> <br /> The lighting in special scenes does not specifically set the mood in the warehouse to make this film more mysterious. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am only disappointed with the three points.
