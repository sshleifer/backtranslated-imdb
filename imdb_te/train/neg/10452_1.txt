I am 10p.m. I have shown that this film is nothing special. <br /> <br /> I left the theater to return to my films. (Actually not paid for movies) I have not really found any ransom attributes. <br /> <br /> Some lines are chucking me, but mostly cinematic young viewers (the film is older than the age rated), a male audience. Fan came out of service space and attracted attention as well. I know you want to hear all Samuel L's his infamous line, but let's be honest, there's a whole lot of hype for it to pay very little. <br /> <br /> The real horror episode of this film is CG, very digitized and does not mesh well with live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now that I am a rational person, I'm going to see the theater I'm "Casablanca" and I'm at least grateful that the film is originally (Albeet Inen), not some re-manufactured or franchise off spin. Be honest anyway, if you are not a part of the worship, it's probably better to spend your money somewhere else and in a few weeks or two in the theater or rent a few months.
