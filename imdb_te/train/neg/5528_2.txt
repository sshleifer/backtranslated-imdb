The film did not have 61 minutes and good on television, and I decided to pop the DVDs into the DVD to the DVD. I was disappointed when it was discovered in the coming era. It opened the opening scenes that began slowly with the outstanding high quality of opening score (any brooding music?). Gosh, I have a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - it has some chills (white zombie, with Bela Lugosi, made sure) but this is nothing. Zero. It's almost dramatic (except for a few moments with a flame-eyed picture shot in which somebody mesmerizes). Like the zombies equally dull king, this film might be an interesting curiosity, but nothing.
