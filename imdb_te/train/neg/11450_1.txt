I had to watch the preview of this film and hope that they will have time to edit it anytime before August 3. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He plays a young man in a small town, who wants to become a stuntman, like his late father. When we meet him, he is jumping a mail truck on his mode-pad, yes, mo-paddle, and almost all of it. If you try to do it honestly, it is appropriate for the film 'Jackass'. Isla Fisher is a slightly older and very mature girl-side door, Denis. She is a rod enough to join her 'staff. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother Kevin, who picks up stunts with a camcorder. The mother of Sissy Spacek Rod, plays Mary. She is married to Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a real tough guy, he's enjoying the rod. Frank is not going to earn honor until Rod hits him. We learn that frank is $ 50,000. Heart transplant and rod just determined to raise money to 'hit his ass' once he healed, and proved himself a man. Falling over a mountain convinces the rod to go big on a stand. If you see them in real life, the rod directs you to get the seed money by charging for strangers. Like a human flame - during the birthday of a child. They have a lot of stunts at the show. Even when all hope and money is gone, 15 school buses will be sponsored to save the day on which the rod wants to jump. He receives exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines for donations. The rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns and tunes the world. Does he jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise $ 50k? Has Frank defeated his ass rod? Wait for this 90 minute film to appear in the video.
