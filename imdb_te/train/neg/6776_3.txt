I love this film. How can I not love Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donnen; All the icons in their own way. However, Suzie Parker has ruined my entire experience. Her acting was with my jaw and I did not believe my eyes or ears, and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Cary is no stupid thing in this regard. Gorgeous and fine dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, lovely, and clearly having a ball. <br /> <br /> Then you see Susie Parker trying to speak her lines with a dead, a dead, a cluelessness. Only explains confidence. How does she say ACT to this creator? Oye VEY, people.
