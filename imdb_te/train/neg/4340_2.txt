Carlito Way, a fantastic story about the original former drug dealer, departed from his criminal past and hence he makes deals with the club and its problems. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and immediately learned that it was messy but they were great after removing the pictures (Lucky Number Slavin, Tokyo Drift). I gave this shot and failed in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is five minutes for a young man to prepare ... It's weak weaker speech. It seems there is an urgent need for romance in a gangster movie. So Brigitte decides to defeat a man for the girl .... and she says 'yes!' And if you need to play badly just racism must be ... just like we learned from 'the Italian mobster' <br /> <br /> Performance is terrible to say ... I'm Hollywood Nicky <br /> <br /> All of these musicians are going to the movies. Because he did the film because he could play gangsters ... Letticia plays a role that is weak but beautiful. <br /> <br /> But overall, I know how to end in love with Carito and his life. <br /> Carlito's Way: Power to Grow ..
