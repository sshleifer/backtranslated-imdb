Where to Start? This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Editing is always the worst, sound effects awkward and sound editing is whacked. All of the pictures in the film are dark colors, not talking in the background. I had to change my volume in the full explosion of what I was going to do ... and what exactly did I hear? Perhaps one of the worst scripts ever. I can not believe that some people are really green people for this movie. <br /> <br /> "I think I can trash a box, send it to the producers, and then they want to make a film. <br /> <br /> A simple, dolph, no need to say, villains are bad, the main characters are bad, and the film is a stinker. Sukovalante, look at this!
