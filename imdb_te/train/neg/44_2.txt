I'm not sure if I suggest this video as a dirty or director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a bizarre 'horror' film. <br /> <br /> The plot is a loose Goosefi combo, one of the high-profile films like "Kennyball Feroax" and "Cut and Run". The chick is kidnapped by 'the tribe' of 'savages' in 'jungle'. The jungle looks somewhat like a park in Mexico. The tribe is a group of hippies participating in party-style Halloween costumes of tribal cloth. And the savages range from white to ethnic to race from white to Asian. <br /> <br /> In this case, the minor-minor gore, the real fears, the unwanted penis. Not fun. I like the worst Italian or Euro Trash film; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
