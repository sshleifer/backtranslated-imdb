I chose this DVD at the Dollar Store. <br /> <br /> For $ 1 on DVD, 2 is for rake, but because of having Michael Madsen in it, I have ever purchased it since I ever watched the movie. Like the picture. The film has played more than any statement for documentary or religion. I have found that the use of the director has not added to the previous story. <br /> <br /> I can not deny one of the other commentators, but it may last long before you see this film again. <br /> Although it is the first film of Michael Madsen, some archive may be worth some future date.
