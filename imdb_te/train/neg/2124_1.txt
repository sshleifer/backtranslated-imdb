The film is related to Eddie's story and his old friends' home in a seaside community as mentioned in the title. This group has a group of friends in which Eddie remains to be a means of dealing with a friend's death, in which he considers some of the responsibilities. But this is incompatible because the selection made in the product is too poorly and completely absorbed. Screenplay is not always necessary to 'chatty', but they should at least help develop the story. One line attempts, such as "I know he's just in love" or "he just left", as the audience's time is valuable. The writer also said that when the writer was damaged after some of the indie mood was cut to the heroine's music, Talk about trying hard. If you're interested in a good image, just kind of give quality and ingredient on style then this is not the image for you.
