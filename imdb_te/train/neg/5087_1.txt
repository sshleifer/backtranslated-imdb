Yes wade! ... No, because Pintilie likes undress his actors and publicly show their privies. Pintilie naked "Emperor" - to talk ... <br /> It's a big time to tell someone's truth. This inspired person is a physician locked up in an old man's body. He has no artistic legitimacy in nude scenes. It is 100% visual pervasive: he kicks his kicks into the stars by getting their kicks and see their lettuce. And if he does this before audiences, he will work hard! In the "Nicky Ardillan" set, poor Coca Blues suffered, "Oh, Coca, I Wanna F *** You!" Did you know that he said She is a great woman, very good and gentle, and she has become unspeakably shame - her little satisfaction! And, as the alarm signal of worry about lack of obscenity and lack of education in the Romanian audience, many people are still silly to declare these visually obscene "works of art"! Is anybody nice to open someone to reveal the truth?
