This movie is bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film is that Angela wanted to count the higher body. Acting is terrible. The murders were very bad. Ally guess I was in abandoned cabin as I got stuffed down that toilet. But when the film was over and Molly and the other person in the cabin you went to see her. Angel came to me when block girl and Angela was in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar string and she chocked. A terrible acting and two why do not you turn and punch a rider?!?!? Why do not you turn around if you follow Molly Angela? So stupid. This picture is sucked ...
