This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. He remembered his concentration that he could not deliver his songs. The plot is certainly not deserving of John Grisham's name. It has not been published as a book or released in theaters. I did not see the whole thing. I did not care about the work I did, and then did not care about "whodunit"!
