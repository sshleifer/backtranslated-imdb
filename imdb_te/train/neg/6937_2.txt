This latest Aden-Maria-Movieman tries to overcome his first (advertising) venture, which is almost old to debate through almost any cultural authentic - timeless romance (pun intended). However, searching (and exploitation for domestic audias) is good, such as pepper, spice, and general desires for Sugar on a simple spice mix of bye / g score, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes, the kitchen scene is repeated at least 8-9 times. More repeats will follow through the movie (after all the main character's cook). But there is a lot of trouble - no story! Ha, no wonder. <br /> <br /> Amitabh is in charge of a cheetah (high) performance. When will this guy ever get up? Although 30-something is teased by a nubile how many around 60-somethings prance ??? The timeless mind is yes, but what about the undesirable age bod? And unique? Sorry, soul? Good acting by Paresh Rawal is a good part of the film. The director does not have the sense of a new ground-breaking realism in his new confusion. No one is presented with problems of real life or the problems that such a couple faces, in fact it is not just an early barrier to marriage. The sub-plot of the cancer (the first love of the bachelor boy) goes somewhere and any small bit of poignancy will be prompted by this otherwise exaggerated presentation, which is quickly killed along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Try it nice but still not much.
