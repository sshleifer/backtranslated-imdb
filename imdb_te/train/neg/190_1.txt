I thought a good film should have a plot. I do not have this special feature film, and I think it will be more effective with a plot. It became even worse when it felt that it would last forever; I was worried to end it in the end. However, I noticed that I was only 123 minutes; It looked for four hours. There is no plot, but this film is not even in a controversial conflict. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but I've seen "The Fast and the Furious". So, the review of mine does not think from anyone who needs nothing but action. I hate action films today too; This is the film all the way to the other side of the spectrum. The film did not happen much. However, the scenery and clothing are cool.
