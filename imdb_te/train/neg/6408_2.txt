Although the quality of the animation quality is behind Looney Toons, Disney and MGM, the UPA's pictures in IMDB are surprisingly well rated. The UPA style (which was launched in 1950) was dominated by the late 50s and 60s due to the increased costs to earn more cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds. After all, the dirt made of films are cheap and they'd have received numerous Oscars "to prove" that cartoons are now the main. As a result, lousy animation became the rule and this trend could not be overtaken until 1980. <br /> This UPA film is one of the earliest times. The simplest line drawings (characters are simple and they used stick figures) and backgrounds are in line with very few slap-dash techniques (often with a sponge and rarely fill out the elements). <br /> <br /> For the story, it's a jov story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some people like it, others find it very loud. Because it's the classic "Frankie and Johnny" story and shooting and all, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Heck, because of animation and jazz, it's not a good movie for me either! Some read my review and I think it is closely (I'm doing the degree). However, I loved animated films and this minimal UPA style goes too long and you can not consider them as great masterpieces - just cartoons made very quickly. Ignore the Oscars and try looking at some classic cartoons or something - anything!
