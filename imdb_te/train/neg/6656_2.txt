I liked this because I liked it as a child, but I hate it because it's very unnecessary ... It can not give a detailed review because another thing that will be resumed after another is not told everyone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is in this program is that it runs around a moving baby. And that's about it. I have a cousin who loves this program and is the greatest and most beautiful person I have ever met. This program must be removed from the air. It's always the same thing ... they have to put good shows in Nick. I really am really tired of doing something like this.
