The "Confidential" component is intended to be the piggy-back of the sensational magazine with the same name, while the Labor Revolt theme is associated with major congressional hearings of the day. However, despite the A-Grade B-movie cast and some good script ideas, the film plots for 73 minutes. It's cheap-jack production all the way. There is some speculation from the particularly uninspired director Sydney Salko that what is needed for poor production values. Some daytime shots, for example, are relieved of heritage of desperate studio sets. Stylish Helmsman like Anthony Mann was able to do something with thick-ear material, but Salco would treat it as another pace-day exercise. Brian Keeth's distinctive low-key style does not work here, it's just wooden and dehydrated, while the cult figure Elisha Cook Junior. Apparently, Salco is not an actor's director. But, you captured the small number of the character Beverly Gerald, considering her character's commitment and dedication. Very bad, she can not charge. My advice - Do not get rid of the ridiculous bar-girls you do not do anything else, whiskeys in the style of a typical straight-jacket 50.
