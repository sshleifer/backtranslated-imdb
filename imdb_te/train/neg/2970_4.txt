I'm a backstage movie and a TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as great as some people expect. In my opinion, it is not big. I feel that there is no play. Batman: Fasmas and Batman Beyond Mask: The Joker's Return Drama is very much. And Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero has a lot of drama. Also, I think the movie will come to light for Batman. The ultimate scene that finally appears to be dark is finally the big fight with Bonne. However, this is a backdrop. But I'll rent it.
