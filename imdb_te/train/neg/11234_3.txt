The film is good to Rip from 13th Friday. The film is about a killer named Bernie, who kills people around the camp councilor training camp. He murders the camp councilor's training camp on his father's ground, and when police force his father to take over, they accidentally kill his mother (another F13 will be removed). Intro Bernie is killing his first victims. Then we introduce a family that is camping in a single carpenter, and as soon as they come they get a strange elder who loves to talk about his son. Later he learns that his son is Bernie and gets him in his transaction before his residence after being broken from a mental institution. He will take their items so he will set Bernie after the family and then there is the chase. <br /> <br /> This recommendation is only recommended for those who enjoy Slashers of B grade 80.
