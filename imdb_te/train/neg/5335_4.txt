It's a looooonnnggg time since I watched this comedy, and I'd forgotten how much idiot it was. I can easily tell you in the lower two or three films of Elvis Presley. The half-race Indian Bull Rider plays the role of Priscally Joe Wicklowd, returning home to Arizona and broken down shock, his family lives, and his friends all overnight. His parents played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado and his old Indian grandfather Thomas Gomez. Three offer of substance can be comically or not, anything. The government invested in the family's cattle, but they did not have a bull. Elvis gets just a few totally worthless songs, and follows a young boy-silly gal and her gun-run mother. This is just a real slapdash for confusion, and the wrecked surroundings are practically the stench of manure and do not make it much easier. A puzzle for me, though, is that Elvis actually had a good time in the film. It is hard to believe, he was upset about the difficulty making the most ordinary movies.
