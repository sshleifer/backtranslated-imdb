This is terrible, really terrible rubbish. Yes, we have dancing and sex with nude nude women. When is it working in the mechanism of a porn film ?? Can also be hit as a romantic movie ?? It seeks to mask the "image" with realistic facts that tell realistic emotions and struggles. It's not. It is a need to get some girls naked and have a fun time. These women (and men) in this particular film have not been able to correctly correct all of the 1970s porn movie business. . . But the original cinema is not in business. <br /> Acting is very vulnerable, very bad, I mean real terrible. Writing is even worse. I can not reproduce all these actors. They did nothing. The film's wide structure or storyline is well done with good writers and potential actors. A wider structure or plot is a moody man who spends his time off from a distance as a sniper. The men opened fire on the men who did not respect their women. If more writing - improved writing, improved writing - and less grateful sexual imagery we may have some work to do. <br /> <br /> This film is a hardcore pornographic film; That would have made more money. It's practically already a hardcore romance movie, and I'm the only porn movie I've ever seen a male steep penis.
