Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are in the unwanted pair of unlikely couples. <br /> <br /> In this film, Uttanov promised to be released from prison. <br /> <br /> He attempts to hack Robert Marley to his identity and start hacking at computers in a very fancy company run by another unusual duo, Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, for computers. <br /> <br /> He did in "Mary Antoine" in 1938. <br /> <br /> The film is considered to be the best. The following year, it was hard to believe that Maggie Smith had completely changed his way and gave Breaking Oscar a performance at "The Mainstream of Miss Jean Brodie". <br /> Smith is clearly dumb-red head, but by the end of the film, her outfit is brain. Very bad writing did not go with her.
