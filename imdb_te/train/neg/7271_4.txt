It was the legendary giants of Gone with the Wind, but it was satisfied by being the largest chain of empty episodes ever. The characters are single-dimensional and there is no other development in the story (none but the original story) than for each other and kissing. This is a curious aesthetic proposal that almost dialogue is completely lost in the film, examines psychology's psychology with some respect, and achieving a true emotion echo. On top of that, it pretends to be an "art" film using the movie's snobbery's worst innocent clicks. But anyway, I guess it would be good if someone could recognize his huge suspension.
