I'm looking forward to this movie for a long time. Zhui Chawla is particularly involved in the film, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> There are six stories in this film. This is a new concept from Hollywood. So this is not a new topic. <br /> <br /> Khamini (Priyanka Chopra) is a dancer. She wants to be a celebrity and news reporters will make her boyfriend want to make her curious. But Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and argues that she is her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is not a good actress. When she shouted, I was angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. <br /> <br /> "Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla) who gets in a midlife crisis and he is really attracted to a very young woman <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is the natural actors / actresses who are great. <br /> <br /> The story is shining for them. Akshay Khanna) is married to Jia (Ayesha Takia) <br /> <br /> Ashutosh (Joah Abraham) is married to Tehseb (Vidya Balan), who suffered an accident and lost memory. Now she does not know that she loves her husband (Govinda) is a cab driver who is a white woman in love with an Indian male (Stephanie <br /> <br /> He is very annoyed and not funny. <br /> <br /> In this film I was very much excited about the past years. That's yes! Sohail Khan is! He acted in the role of Ram Dial, who was married to Phoolwali (Isha Coppicker). <br /> <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actor but he is funny! <br /> Now there is a problem here. These stories are not interesting. The whole film is not interesting to make a story from six heroes! Here and there the stories touch each other, but not for the characters. <br /> My end; Priyanka did not act! Leave the woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan had to do more movies, and this role was very small. Salman Khan can not make comic roles, but real serious movies. It was written in his life as an actor. The film was a hit with good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> You have the ability to capture the movie with Amitabh. Bachchan, and you let him sing a mall.
