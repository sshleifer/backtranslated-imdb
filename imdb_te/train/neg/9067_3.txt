I have some hopes for the film, especially because Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Unducklard) is so happy that one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory is (Lear and Dr. Ti <br /> <br /> Although the film is much better, sometimes laughs, in the premise of evil-scandal artists facing their competition by cheating their way Blackmaker (who portrayed the talented Jason Schwartzman) is not funny to see him - he is not particularly disturbed in the funny or lovely manner, he's just silly loser In fact, the accident The film was very difficult - it was a fabrication between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear .That only three of the three gang scandals were actually shown to be believed to be scam artists - their schemes were made for a better film . The so-called love story is absurd and unbelievable, in fact it is crazy and poorly written and directed. I can say about the shortcomings of the film, but you got the idea. $ 4 gas worth to drive from rent or gas rental movie store!
