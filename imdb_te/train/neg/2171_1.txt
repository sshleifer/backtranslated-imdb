This film is essentially one of the strongest themes in history - with a weak defense of cross dressing of cross dressing in "Glen or Glenda" on the right <br <br /> <br /> Subject: playing bridge. Park Avenue sets to play; Bohemians are playing. <br /> <br /> The Russians - Most questionable "Russian" speak and have unreliable tones when speaking English - play at a restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in the bridge - despite the great cast - this strange picture is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lucas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - Lucas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk into the fetishistic script.
