I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I look forward to seeing this episode. I will be the first film, then comment on the MST3K episode. Recipe for this film: talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material, and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, plain stone solution. In the movie, I give 10 to 3 because the actors need at least some credit. OK, now MST3K episode. I accepted it, the first time I saw it, I was half asleep. I mean the response of many other wineries as well. However, I have seen for the second time, for the first time I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent suggestions and good lines I missed. Trick with this episode: listen carefully! It takes some scenes to capture each line. Give a second chance and you'll see my point. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 to 10.
