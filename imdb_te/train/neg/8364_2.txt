I will see the people making budgets for this film. "Let's look at the 50% Dirk Benedict, now that Star Star Galactic and A-Team are good, we're spending 40% Demon Costume, the Demon script is in touch and the rest of the movie is made of the movie." It's very bad and Witch Clutch. ... Have a loved one (or a good book Ukuravadam)
