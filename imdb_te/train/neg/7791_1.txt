I saw the original non-Dubbing German version and I was surprised at how bad this film was actually. Thinking I've seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could prepare me this! There is no pain, no good acting and special effects, especially called zombies, white make-up and wearing more than their old clothes, which is not really a pain to sit through this film, their good set is not destroyed by ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste 90 minutes of your life, do not see it and do it for others, because worry!
