Well, what is it ?! I found Nicholson's character inaccessible and unfortunately very uninteresting. The role of Angelica Huston has drained my energy. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty good slut. I'm not "can not get it". I'm not thinking that some of the ideas have led to something. It's a film that we do not expect to approve these ideas, and that's what the movie is going to be. Nicholson's fall for Turner was inaccurate, but again it was intended. This is not a strike for me though.) Funny, or b) ... even remotely interesting !!! It's not waste my time, so do not let the hype get your best ... It's a junk of your time! With that being said, the earliest church scene is beautiful ...
