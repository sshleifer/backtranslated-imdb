Hamilton tells the story of the four Hamilton siblings, the young man Frances (Kory Kannoff), twins Wendell (Joseph McChelier) and Darlene (Meekkegee Fergence) and the surrogate parent charge the big David (Samuel). Hamilton's movements house is not very clear, why is Frances, why it is unhappy. The fact that his brother's sister and sister are kidnapped, captured & killed by people in the dungeon is either Francis' nerves not resting or calm. Frances learns is not just right & he finally finds out the truth and never again ... <br /> Co-wrote, co-authored by Michelle Altry & Phil Flores. So far the other film director's credit April Fool's Day (2008) remake after the Dark Horror Furst (or it's called) and 'In Films to Die For' 2006 was pretty much the one I saw all of Seeing & felt unsaturable. I found the character was really poor, very incomplete & slow movable tale to capture my imagination or did not retain my interest in 85 & 86 minutes duration of a half minute. There was a terrifying twist at the end of laughing me loud, this really build what's inside a cupboard stuff in the really big continuous Hamiltons basement & which eventually revealed a teddy boy a little boy. Did you really want to scare us? Did we really want to shock us? Is it true that we want to talk about the final credits roll? Is a harmless looking young boy coming with the best 'twist' producers? It is unclear whether Hamilton would get their money from where to buy new houses because of none of them, except David (excluding David in the slaughterhouse). The script tries to combine the drama every day with powerful horror & it's an awesome work with two elements, but no matter what is not memorable or efficient. <br /> <br /> Though there is a seriously injured Butcher Brothers but no gore there, there is a bit of blood publishing and a few scenes from the girls. There are some scenes in a dungeon but nothing can be done with a camcorder with a bottle of tomato ketchup. The image is not scary & very middle class suburban setting because there is zero weather or mood. A homosexual and an innocent kiss, but Hamilton is less on the predatory scale & not much for the horror crowd. <br /> <br /> This modern modern budget version of the film, which is filmed in Petalama in California, is bad but not unforgettable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to think of anyone else, but dull from Hamilton, it does not come.It's an ultra thin story, no gore, a garbage end & character give you a toss Do not have & have an image that you all do not impress me.
