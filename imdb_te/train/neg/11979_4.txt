Here are the matches. . . Perfect team (Mr. Perfect, Ax, Smash and Crush of Demolition): Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, Texas Tornado and Doom Legion) breaks him for Warrior Pin (4-3 Advertising Warriors) in seconds. I know that Ax is not a healthy person but why is he suffering a card if he is ill? This was his last PPV. In the end, two Legion of Doom and Demolition Job is cheap double disqualification (2-1 Advertising Warriors). Perfect Perfect Perfect on Texas Tornado Perfect for Perfect. He then tries to get on the warrior, but the warrior is not sold and goes out. They come back with a splash to make perfect pin and sole survivors. Dream Team (Dusty Rhoads, Coco B Ware and the Heart Foundation v Million Dollar Team (Ted Dibia, Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues): Mystery Partner The Undertaker and On The Ear In The Earl, The Tombstone (Monsoon still has the right height, weight and He manages to talk slowly while pretending he does not know who) (3-3) and his career ended with WWF Shortly afterwards, with the help of Virgil (3-2 Advertising DBS), Nimbadr, who was the victim of Dibys, retained the top cord but did not keep quietly attacking Brother Love.Anteker goes before the slum and The legal person is not counted (2-1 advertising dobis band).   ెగ్ ఒక ఊయలకి హార్ట్ అతనిని నాలుగు లెగ్-లాక్గా ఉంచటానికి ప్రయత్నించాడు మరియు పిన్ చేయబడ్డాడు.ఇది హార్ట్ V దిబియా సే మరియు కొన్ని నిమిషాలపాటు nice రెజ్లింగ్ తరువాత, బ్రెట్ తన శరీరం-క్రాస్ పిబి కోసం డిబియాస్చే తిరగబడుతాడు. దిబియాస్ ఏకైక ప్రాణాలతో ఉంది. At least Hart has good use. After a short time, Wipers (Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, 'Superfly' Jimmy Snooka and the Rockers) in the ring, Marty Jannetti The power is slammed by Worlard because he comes to the pin (4-3 Advance winners) on a rope. Snake pin is pinched by Martel opposing his body cross (4-2 advance winners). Michaels are called by the patient holding the power plex (4-1 consultant). This is similar to the two years before the Roberts' Survivor Series attempt against two men. Roberts is counted to chase after Martel, even though he has hit Wartour with the DD. The first team of Survivor series was the first to be victorious in history. To be honest in psychology is not very valuable. Natural resources (earthquake, Dino Bravo, Barbarian and Haku): Husk Hogan (Hulk Hogan, 'Hexa' Jim Duggan, Big Bosmann and Tugbot): One Bosman Slam 4-3 Advertising Hulkamomics). Dougon received 3-3 after killing the earthquakes after being disqualified from 2 to 4. Bravo soon commits suicide, and then brings him to Hogan Pin (3-2 advisor Hulkamanicax). The earthquake will soon be able to overcome Bosman with two elbow dots for the pin (2-2) pin. Hogan defeated and eventually gets the Tugbot Tag (which he knew was there at this time?), Where he fights for 30 seconds before the earthquake. Only leave Hogan and Barbarian. The barbarian keeps in some nice offense but will inevitably be caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin. Hogan is the only survivor. Alliance (Nikolay Volkop, Tito Santana and Bushwalkers) Mercedes (Sargent Slater, Boris Zukov and Orient Express): All the worn-out face paintings of the merchants. In the last 4-6 Advertising Alliance in his last PPV in seconds, the lightning pins, known as Zyku with Saina. Not even Bolshevik Showdown. Although Tanaka's lawyer (4-2 Advisor Alliance), Budwarkers hit Sato with The Battering Ram and his last performance at The Orient Express Recovery WWF PPV. Tataka follows Sato when he stunts Santa (4-1 Advance Alliance) with the flying manga. Although Slaughter is getting in the ring against four men, he will remove that order in Volkov (after the end of the career), Butch and Luke. Finally, when General Adnan touches him with the Iraqi flag, he stripes Santana slaughter. Although the last few interesting booking matches are awful. Santana was the only survivor of her and her last outstanding hour. <br /> <br /> "He dances with Jean O'Rourland and the People and Monsoon <br /> <br /> Survival match: Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana v Warlord, Power and Glory, Rick 'Model' Martell and 'Million Dollar Man Ted Dibia: Santana Pins Warlord for his previous SummerSlam defeat (4-3 advertisement (4-2 Advertising DBS team), Dionys Stan Guns Santana after Hogan leaves out of power Pleks, and then hurls Rome, then pushes Power and Glory (3-2 Advertising DBS) Killing with a leg drop for the Hogan pin (2-1 Advertising Hogan Team) Hogan ultimately allows Warrior to enter the match, which makes it quick after splashing the former memory Hercules, a very predictable ending to nude. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "
