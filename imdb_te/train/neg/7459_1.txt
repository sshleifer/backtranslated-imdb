Please save your money and look for another. This film is such a rubbish piece. I just wanted to go, but I had no idea that I'd like to laugh at NOPE, at least once. Not a laugh, it's terrible! Chris Kutton never plays a good comedy and "one night in Rocksbury." The film is completely clear, does not have smart humor, and repeats over and over again. Listen to me, you will be able to get away from this film!
