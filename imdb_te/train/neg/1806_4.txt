Antonioni does not look good. Always wondering about them, there is a dull and predictable "psychology" of characters and situations, along with a decent plastic beauty. For example, "bad capitalism" or "fraudulent capitalist" or fergie at the end of the same movie would be Monica at the "fraudulent capitalist" or "La Aventura" who likes to sing him in "La Note". <br /> I reviewed yesterday "Jubrisky Point". The film features a number of nice and extensive shots of Rod Road's office, highways and LA's roads, advertising announcements, deserts etc., which demonstrates the author's appeal to his American journey, as well as years later than Wim Wenders. Unfortunately, the hippie-leftist clich√©s spoil the film: - The boy goes out of the meeting, steals a plane, flies in the desert and makes him find himself "somewhere else" independently. - In gray suites, the authorities speak of the speculation all the time. - The girl looks at the swimming pool and "objective women" because she should not like them. - The middle class pair of fat in the motor vehicle speak before the beauty of nature, making a hotel structure and money. - Last but not least, there are a lot of couples who love the desert. After half a century after the "Revolution" of "La Aventura", the king is naked, his films ("le amiche" and perhaps "Ill grido") are just a few cosmetic and common places.
