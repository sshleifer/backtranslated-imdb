Bandville Police is the first ever known Keystone Cops named after the studio they worked. But they do not wear silly cop dress or drive their trademark fastest car. Anyway, Mabel Normand is an agricultural girl who asked her father for a lambs. She later finds some strange men and cattle and immediately calls the police. One answers and chase is on. Later, Mabel turned her door as if she was coming. Her parents are going to jump to the ultimate thieves! Mabel furniture is blocking her door while the mother and father try to fight them! It's the smallest of the most explosive part of the police car with some explosions. It was 7 minutes short before it started. The only realism that develops is that Mabel only displays the charm with her face and big eyes and is surprisingly hilarious, except when she is scared. It's easy to see why she is a star. It's because I have at least this and I'd recommend seeing myself giving this a 4 why is she most likely.
