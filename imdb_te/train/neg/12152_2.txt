Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about the epidemic of zombies, despite the government 'control of the media. The film did not understand that George Romero worked only on zombie films, because he defended his character in the background of many of his politics (including "Land of the Dead"). This sarcasm is more like a bullet on the face of a brick or head on the face. What is sighing or uncertain about looking at a military person who is intoxicated to death and destruction? What about the various commercials that are inter-cropped with any movie? Nope. Also acting is uniformly terrible, the characters are remarkable, plot eline. Add all of it and you can get rid of the bizarre head "C.H.U.D. 2" from the most deadly, very inappropriate zombie movie. <br /> My grade: D
