This film is terrible. I have seen three times, not the whole thing. It's just impossible to see, the story line is suck, it's discouraging, and completely frustrating. Do not write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why you are bored, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this film is John Savage, his conversation in the beginning, and some funny episodes in the film. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is the bullshit. I saw this movie in American film stores, so it was a good movie. Jesus Christ, I'm wrong! Acting is all terrible, and nudity is also lame and nasty. Another thing, Starr Andrew, the other main character, has not been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she has some pretty good ones. Even with John Savage. This movie is SUCKS!
