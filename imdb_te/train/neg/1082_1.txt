I've seen all of Grisham movies now and they are all but poor except Rainmaker, but this is very bad, this is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> It is one of the stupid irrational tasks that no one has ever done. He is a lawyer for Christ. When his children are missing he can not call it police. <br /> When the murderer is arrested they do not let him go free, he is locked in a cell. A bail hearing is pending. <br /> <br /> Why do you take your children around the country to make them easy to protect at home? <br /> <br /> Do not bother to try and find a mental patient, <br /> <br /> In order to end up funnier <br /> <br /> Exquisite, very spurious and complete waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst films ever made.
