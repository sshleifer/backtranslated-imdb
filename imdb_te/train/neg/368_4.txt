This movie is really Goofy! I looked at an age of 11, and then thought I was pretty ridiculous! I recommend this movie only for children under the age of 12. I really do not care, but I think the kids should be the answer to the most good questions: 1) money happiness? 2) Can I think I'm lied to (my parents)? 3) Buy money friendships? 4) Have money for everything? 5) Should not I tell my parents when they tried to hurt me? True, these are very unrealistic situations, but if parents discuss these issues with their children, you can watch this video, they can watch this video to be intimidating / intimidating / intimidating their hearts.
