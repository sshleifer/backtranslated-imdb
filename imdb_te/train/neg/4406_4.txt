This budget's worst Italian action / sci-fi hybrid David Warbek is a Miami reporter using an asteroid spider to govern the world to stop a nasty businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) using a telepathic embroidery chosen by the demons of Atlantis (!). You got it? Despite such a loopy plot, it actually sneers it too bored and contempt of ATLANTIS's RAIDERS. Honestly, the most reminiscent of the COP theme of Herbie Hancock's Beverly Hills for the opening headlines (the intentionally) creative thing about this film. Most unintentionally has a scene in the creative bit lap, which can be shown twice again in the back-back. Perhaps director Alberto de Martino wanted to get all of us in the twilight of his career at Avant Garde? I'm going to declare this Ireland's worst image on his resume but then I saw that it's listed there's Cheerleaders of Saturn. I would like to announce that I am the only person in the world who would double the feature and make Hirchak's VERTIGO the world.
