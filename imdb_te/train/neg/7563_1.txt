Unfortunately, the film does not have any credit for the original. Nicholas Cage will be fitted to the screen with skill from wood and plussed to the top, until the actors go. <br /> <br /> The plot is similar to the progress of the scene, but it is much worse. Not enough details to allow audiences to be sold. It turns into poorly priced bills. The distrust is not suspended, or a doubt is given a befit. <br /> <br /> The only savings item of the film is that it is very visual, since the medium is needed, and who should give the appreciation to that location. <br /> <br /> In the audience and in many boots, <br /> <br /> It's frustrating! Come on the original television and pour a whiskey and wait for it to have fun.
