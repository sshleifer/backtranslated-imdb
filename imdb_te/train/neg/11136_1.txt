It was the second time that I had enough pressure to comment on this film at Imbabi. The best film I have seen for the first time and this is only for Memento. <br /> <br /> Like the worst movie I've ever seen, compared to Merveno, it's bad to see. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to leave the trash in the movie along with two scenes of naked women. <br /> Prevent effects, script, bad acting and 90 minutes long. My wife and I laughed through it a lot with disbelief at very bad. I finally saw it and how did I know I did not know it! Avoid !!!
