Yep .. These MSTify movies are definatly out there for some of the worst, but I have definately looked awkward. Nevertheless, I met Ric Sloane at some science fiction convention, and that remarkably he addressed! <br /> <br /> This is really one of the lowest budget conventions, where everything goes, and everyone (if you want to see the worst, some friends, you should see what I have taken). <br /> <br /> He is very good about my questions and comments in the hugobbliss, telling me he should not take seriously and he says he loves MST3K version. <br /> <br /> More than anything, Rick Sloan knows what he is doing. And I think Mars is intended as bad as attacks. So I'm standing up for this movie and I've given it a 5 and cheating my fellow MST. Ksamincandarra.
