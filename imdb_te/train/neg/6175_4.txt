Is not it a thrill as I think when I see the cover in the video library? Is it 'food fr idea' as the author is probably trying to make it? Not really. So what is this? It was a very mediocre film with great potential and was well directed, but slowly and ultimately started with a tumultuous story without strong points, delivering the best performance of the entire cast, even though he excelled at some point as he expected poor performance from a serial killer. It has good images, good colors, cool high-tef stuff, beautiful scenes, but wherever you go, it loses somewhere. And let's just wrap it in the end quickly with a feeling of let's. OK to see if there is nothing else on TV.
