Gillian Anderson is a proud, driven, career lady who picks up the working class oak Danny Dyer for a night. After a major disaster in the countryside, they were attacked worse. After returning, and after a meeting with one of the attacks, their thoughts become a revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Straightheads" were terrible. Violent, cruel, deceptive and unpleasant. If I do not like this phrase, I call it a video evil called "Straightheads". This is a non-budgetary release of the video in the dark days of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to get a film release for "Strawe Heads". <br /> I'm not a proud. I do not see sex and violence in cinemas, but they should marry with a picture) a good plot or b) good character or c) preferably two. No "Straight Heads" There is no progress in the plot or the characters and is very clear and unsuspecting. Fortunately, "Straight Heads" went somewhere faster. It's just over 80 minutes. <br /> The insect of an interesting picture that has been especially interesting in the last third story, because it is an insult. How often can I say it, but it may be better if done correctly. No shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they do not hide anything with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows's "Dead Man's Shoes". It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I had to see his "England is England". Sea Sera Sera ...
