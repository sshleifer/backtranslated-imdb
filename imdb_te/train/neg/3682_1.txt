I've seen thousands of movies and never reviewed, but I've been redirected to both the two I've been forced to protest my two cents, and bring the average close to reality to achieve the lowest score. <br /> <br /> It is a dull, boring stinger of a memorable movie that only targets terrorists' targets (John Bolton-Esquire Bully Diplomat is really great guy, you do not know) and Oh-so-beautiful and famous Dr. Phil ( Its selling book, one finds, is read by frequent fliers across the globe). <br /> <br /> Before you mock $ 10 or more dollars for this B movie, read the 'choose' from the 'quotes' (from the trailer) and ask if there are cleverest lines you can see if you'll really enjoy a movie. Unfortunately, there is nothing else in the film. The basic premise is the goofy like hell; Acting is murky and uninterested, lacking in pro / antivirus chemistry; The probability of suspension in every turn except for the last five minutes is disabled - through poor directing and prestigious editing; Struggle with the mismatch such as the script: She was later fought with a controversial field hockey stick for the opening of the heroine, known as a university lacrosse star; <br /> <br /> If the fraudulent moves, then the daughter of a high-profile public servant do not directly go, her first opportunity for airport security, to warn the murder of both Homeland Security Chief and her father. Lynnium is wearing 4-inch stiletto heels, pistoning weapons and bulging veins in her neck, when the same woman runs leather for lily-bent for crushing. Or when she pursuer with a sucking injury in her wallet. Or when the terrorists use a fishing pole to bring their weapons from an untimely harbor. <br /> <br /> I can not go from 30,000 feet without a parachute. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it is capable of performing the most serious emergency (even in bimbo form) - gender imaging in American films is not intense. In addition, the film never really gets out and is not thrilling than the red eye flight from Boston to NY. Cheat Trailers and Blazing Prayers Remember you last time - this forum or elsewhere? It was one of those times. Wait for the red eye video and then watch it.
