This is a really damaged picture. Third, with the unparalleled sub-plot failing in the film "The Final Conflict", the original (un) Holy Trinity is governed by the law of the Act restricted. Now the whole "Rimon" for the "Omen" series has become a dichrine. But this jumping-up TV movie (beware of the buyers of the Omen box set on the DVD - do not be fooled by the transfer widescreen ratio, it is perfect for the small screen) and generally do not forgive fine demon retailers, especially in the three films, Nephudud and producer and producer of Harvey Bernhard. I had a plot of normal death scenes (undoubtedly reduced to TV viewing) and anything else that I had seen with the worst performance I had ever seen. All the mockers involved in this project to the catering people are always shy on the screen, compare it to the Oman name. If a person convinces me through my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better for it.
