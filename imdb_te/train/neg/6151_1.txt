<br /> <br /> I'm not as lazy and understandable as I'm in the movie with a zealous amount of exhausted Hollywood geniuses. <br /> I am 27 years old, and I have spent 16 years of life struggling through hallucinating fear and horror hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I played a major role of logic: because I kept trying to keep away from reality and keep thinking over and what's really going on and what's going on. <br /> In the end, I was really successful through drugs, but I took the difference between the reality and nothing. I feel like telling you that this movie is totally fraudulent. It's a story of the main character (not trusting his wife, bisexual - it's really important here), but more often, it shows a camouflaged, stupid scenario to Schizophrenia - a complete point missing. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a disease, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not a "common man with an illness", which experiences opinions and feelings from a variety of people: many of his time, place and personalities are not as great. He feels he can bent it, it can change, it can be mutated, and may even disappear. To cope with this, there is a great, very imaginative inner world unexpected for a schizophrenic "normal" people - but he is trapped in it because he is not involved with so many people, and his world is poor and the poor until he is full <br /> <br /> This is ridiculous The contrast between what was filmed in "prevention" is the tear-jerking image. It should be violently frightening. Unlike the main character, people seem strange, strange and absurd, like Linch's "Erosar Head". Schizophrenia all is really, really * weird, weird, and gross hallucinations. <br /> "Naked Lunch", "Last Highway", P.K. See "Martin Time-Split" or "Ubic", "Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or "American McGee's Alice" on PC, and what's this vague idea for you. The "good feeling" of the month can not be seen, with simple conditions, cleaned characters and visuals and stupid plots tricks. <br /> Once again, not about schizophrenia, Schizophrenic's mind, "Kell" is the most accurate picture of his vision and his inner stability. Details, it did not do well for you, you played it. It jumps in your face and you will not let go: walls fall apart, people turn into strange conflicting creatures, if you feel like you go back in time, you're not sure who feels, everything feels. Strange, unnatural. Believe me, this soap is more than just a drama
