I know that sitting on the 14th season of the Bachelor ("On the Wings of Love"), I'm in "interesting" time. I saw some of Bachelor's previous seasons when I was traveling; There is an episode or two watching and the next three or more. <br /> <br /> I find that Bachelor is often attractive and delicate with details of the tour taken by Dallas 31-year-old Commercial Pilot Jake from "Loves Wings of Love". , True love for Texas, finding true love, season-long reality-drama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from across the country. He begins to know them a bit, but it is mostly surface; Whom do you know in some 5-minute conversations? Jake tries to present his audience at the very beginning, at least to the audience. He wanted to be with his future husband or wife, that he was not only a love or a good time. We can only imagine that he clearly told women in the competition. If it were, it would explain to a degree, some women's actions. Women are super competitive. <br /> If they do not yet know Jake, it can not succeed at all costs. <br /> <br /> In addition to women's competition, they are also confident, Katie. Threats, Backstabbing, and Warnings "See!" All of these have shown that these women are not good at all. Jake said he was looking for sex appeal but was looking for "a connection." However, the girls withdrew all the stops to try to impress Jake with sex appeal. They arrived at the building in skimpy dresses ?? <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain their impressive feelings, others missed the memo. A girl, Channel, Jake is a "good guy" she is a "naughty girl." She says that Jake is her "runway anytime". <br /> She was flacked by other girls for her provocative statement, which she had shown in these circumstances. <br /> <br /> So, the reality dating show is not that bad, can it? Along with the obvious problem of sexually provocative attraction, there are other problems that change this unwanted performance. The right way to find this future member; Are you competing against someone who is away from extreme ratios? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, today America has reduced the duration of dating: happiness and no sexual relationship and little pleasure in the side. <br /> <br /> Another issue is that Jake is the premature emotional attachment adhered to by many girls. Some girls are particularly addicted. One girl said, "If I can not get that first impression, it kills me!" As mentioned earlier, they still do not yet know and she is not one of the 15 roses to avoid a particular rose. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, has some problems with the attachment to Jake. Other girls also observed it. After a particular Michelle reveals, Vienna Michelle emphasized a "mental breakdown and we're only one hour here". Did Michelle get the last rose in the evening at the first show? Missing Takedown And it's very emotional about it. Other girls thought it was just ridiculous. <br /> When did it start with Survivor, and where did it go from? Reality TV. This shows our entertainment interests as a nation; If we do not see the shows and do not give good ratings, the networks do not continue to run them. The only logical conclusion drawn by America is adequately hooked. <br /> This thing is clear to me: America (commonly) loves the TV and its next traps. Does it attract us to it? We looked at similarities to our own lives, or because we were more stable and less enthusiastic than others. Whatever it is to attract us, we must carefully look at the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I can not say all the reality TV programs are bad. <br /> <br /> Components used for criticism: season premiere and episode 2.
