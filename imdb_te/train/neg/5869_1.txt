It's been around 30 years old, and I'm still hating everyone involved. <br /> When I saw this, I never thought of rivers, one way or another. <br /> <br /> After seeing this film, I have allergic reactions when I watch television unexpectedly. <br /> I've pulled this - against my good judgment - peer pressure. However, after coming out of the theater, the friends swore that the film should not be chosen again. About thirty years later, we are still taking mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> After my death, I will come to my expectations that one of my worries will improve. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a choice, you would like to sit in the film and put your own eyes. <br /> I have registered for IMDb comments I hope I can warn others for watching this movie. If I could save only one person without seeing this man, then my existence on this earth was justified.
