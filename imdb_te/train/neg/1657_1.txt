This film is worth five punches on my "hart card". I saw this when I settled in Virginia in mid-70s. I looked alone, and I was not distracted when I saw it. It sucks. <br /> <br /> I know others who have reviewed this film are awesome. I'll give you: if it's awesome, what's the box office? End of discussion.
