Most castes seem to have never done this film. It's just plain ridiculous and intolerable to see. The bad actors read cheesy lines while continuously making a diner that looks like a Disneyland attraction in shining classic showroom cars. Students fist fist with the frustrated Principal when trying to prevent him from shooting a bronze civil war statue. What's a riot with a cast ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney should not be gambled when he appears with a Mary Hartman, 'this is a very annoying smile from Mr. Form ". Nova Wyle reads the bad teacher Bob Dylan's lyrics with a swinging pointer and a very bad face lift. Drunken virgin Rick Shroder sat on a kiddie rocket last night before coming to the service. Silly, giggling school girls dress up in leopard rope pants and walk on the 'shinig' set, play the terrible key and actually make it big in the music business. And who wrote this compelling conversation? "I go to Burkley and put flowers in my hair" .... "I found someone else want to buy a stick of stick!" "These people are 'animals'!" "These people are my family" singing shirlels "Mama Said" is singing Oh brother, what a mess it's been in 60 years' Reaper Madness, which is not even funny.
