<br /> How did I think of James Woods, Kathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gosset, Jr., and Henry Thomas? Miss it. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Sam Shepard plays any drugs per week. <br /> <br /> I suspect Sam is the longest nut, which ensures the film based on this play. <br /> This is the type of RTC BS. Those actors love to drown their teeth because they give them the chance to divorce them indefinitely. However, the viewer who is sitting by the trash is not absolutely nothing to love this film. <br /> <br /> You do not see families who do not work until you see this bunch. Pay crazy, our crazy is, son crazy and daughter, oh yeah, crazy. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, if it is not enough, the plot - and that's it. You can read it thinner - locally there is a hole in it. <br /> <br /> Our intention is to sell their farming farm. Pay now can not say that I am a real estate expert, but the last time I checked the property must be sold jointly with the signatures owned by the company. If one of them has property, then others can not be legally sold, so that person does not understand. <br /> Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, so his plot does not work. <br /> You do not have any work. If they were totally disappointed to see James Woods in full frontal nudent to see the film, and I can not imagine why anyone would want it.
