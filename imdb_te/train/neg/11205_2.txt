Yes, well, I have absolutely no regrets about giving up on my Saturday night watching this weird little, yet so long, film. Clearly there is no major role to steal two hours in my life. Here is the essence of Antihero in 'No Regrets'. Physical Character: We are so confused with this jerk that it is difficult to find the future son of the most entrepreneurial entrepreneur's sophisticated businessman, Zameen. He would love it, if not otherwise. But after looking at this, you have to be chirping because it's like loving Charles Manson. (Alright, he's not that bad, but still does not have true radiomable properties.) I can not get past the endless stalks of the Jamn Sumin. Nothing has ever been said to love Zameen Sumin. Maybe it's a culture thing that goes over my head: crazy / hunter = insane love in Seoul. It has to be a little more than half the film, and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this would be a screwball comedy. I'm looking forward to a tiger "baby". Well, when going to school, Suman makes two jobs, so it's very good for those who are trying to make themselves better. But after the first taste of his ignorant attraction, he leaves his day job for the prostitute ring. What? OK, well, as mentioned earlier, the invasion does not stop due to job / career change and if you throw in the other very angry characters group you get messed up the picture where a tumultuous situation just seems to happen without build. The basic image, not 100% horrible, but you can do better with foreign gay background movies.
