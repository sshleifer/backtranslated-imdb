Drones, race drumming, bad synthesizer piping, singing kids. The most effective "world music" is imaginative. It is a tourist film, and a lousy one. What really kills the repressive lines. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. Whether the transitions, suddenly ten thousand miles away, are not visualized in visual imagery or imagery. Just another group of footage from the third world with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said. If you have some deep meaning that runs along the endlessly. If these guys want to make a 3rd World Music Video, all they have to do is take a few hundred miles south to Coyas's best parts and filmed in Mexico. <br /> <br /> This was a very good arrangement for "life in transformation". There is a scrambled tourist journey covering overcranked half globe and mind-deadeningly filter shots they have decided to. <br /> <br /> The only thing to recommend this film is that it is not as good as Naqiqqatsi. <br /> RstJ
