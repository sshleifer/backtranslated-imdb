Though I have a bad review in the paper, I have great hopes for the film. I was able to survive and I sat through the whole movie. I am suffering very late. <br /> <br /> Although I am not at least proud or particularly sensitive in a flawless film - everyone of Woody Allen wants to know you about sex. 'And' funny games 'of Michael Hannige - I've found the directors' siege with the full request of drinking milk for women at the age of ten. And when the film Climax in a "orgy" where his mother's milk, as well as the next lusting woman drinking for the whole film, I almost disgust the whole perversion and sentimental pops. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Feeling, as well as independently produced movies, so this film has enjoyed me a lot. Avoid all the costs of the film, which must be expelled from history as history as a lesson in bad history.
