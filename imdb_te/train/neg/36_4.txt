The film was only about 75 minutes long. The problem with Jungle horror films is that there is a lot more footage for people running the pad (the river, the forest near the lake, through the jungle, in the forest) to get out of time. The movie is valued for the funniest and nude local zombie, big breath, bloody eyes, always with a breathtaking soundtrack and a lot of reverb. Urethrash fans will be entertained by dubious English dubbing, inappropriate female meat and very crazy decorating jobs on the monster and local extras. This gore for a zombie / cannibalist is pretty light on but then I probably did not see a uncensored version.
