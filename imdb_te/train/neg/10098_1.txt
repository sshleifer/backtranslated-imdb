Video rental or time or occasional attempts are not worth it. <br /> Make a child makeup. * Acting has been done ... poor directing. * Editing is very unstable ... many things seem to be meaningless or just inappropriate. * The sound is dubbed badly. * The music is highly untoward. * The cast is rarely ... to be extensive. * Talk alone alone ... drive, dance, work ... pisses me off. * And a bad man ... holy garbage! He went terribly upset ... he was well-visible to everyone. <br /> <br /> The cover art is very good but it is very deceptive ... the main menu of the DVD ... great art and music. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dawn "T.
