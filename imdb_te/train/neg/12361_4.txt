Though the reviews in the film led me to make a disappointing effort, I would love to do my work because I saw this recent Woody Allen film and I try to see everything I did. They were right. It's a tumultuous movie that can not decide whether a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a play about the medieval life crisis. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a break-free middle-aged woman who is married to her great wealth and leads to her unmatched luxury life with her boring husband and their two young children. This magical plot makes the concept of Chinese folk medicine unlike some magical herbs, and the former lover's devil (she flies on Manhattan along with her). <br /> If these albums are so awesome for you, like a deal with a saxophone player, something more strange about something? <br /> <br /> Do I try to tell this confusion? <br /> <br /> There are only really funny moments in this movie and there is a really naive touch of pollya. <br /> Instead of 'Crimes and Missing', renting moral values ​​and moral values. Or "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
