I guess it's very interesting (so far) that there is no expectation that this movie would like to be loved. In contrast to them, I have positive expectations, and it is wrong. The camera has always seen how face-to-face, we know that we are in the hands of an ambitious director - this is always a clear signal, I think it's artist or effective or serious to capture the camera, two inches away from the actors. The actors have only one facial expression in the film. <br /> <br /> If the closest camera does not fit, the film lacks the light in the movie. The film was completely shot in the dark. So now the cinematographer is also a rank enthusiast. "Oh Oh, we're going to light it set with a flashlight! That makes it all seem intimate!" <br /> <br /> In the top of acute technical disadvantages, there is no story beyond the tremendous hint of an idea that has never been developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship is shining. <br /> <br /> The film does not indicate the quality of the fact that the Film Festival has won awards, but it is a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it. Picture, but next to the quality of these special festivals. I can assure you that this film has not won anything I saw in the festival. In fact, it appears to have appeared twice in the film and started to leave people (it was one of the side effects of cinematographer's "total darkness" technology). But when the film was read, instead of the mons from the audience. Finally the film ended in the end, it was clear that it was not as important as the two previous points ended. Before the end, the audience will save more independent scenes from indigenous (cutting folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we get it, the life of the single old man is bored - but we have found something very early. <br /> <br /> I would miss this audience,
