I remember that presentation. I still have the kick ass fun song "America's Funniest People." Apparently it should be named American's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people. Dave was unable to save the show and was unable to replace the hosts for Bob Sagat or AFV. The Jacallop divisions are fun and yes Dave made some good voice overs, better than Bob's. But this program went to hell because the slum videos were presented. It was developed as diverse shows with dual guest stars, including the Olson Twins. Plus it is the lead before the AFV champion begins to pick up drooling ugly kids like the sin children. Did I hate videos and dull? But still the theme song rocks!
