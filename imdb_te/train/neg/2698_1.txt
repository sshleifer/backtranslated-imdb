This film shows how racist John Singleton is. He painted on whites and other species that are not blacks in our educational system. He recalled how quickly he did and that it was the same educational system that failed. The role of the ice cube stimulates the black man who causes the violence in the film. Singleton is not just touching the relationships between white and black characters trying to reach each other. When Omar Eps says, "I should be with my people", that racist commentary volume spoke. And John does not think of a minute that Thomas Jefferson's picture on the steps of the dome does not get my attention. Looks good!
