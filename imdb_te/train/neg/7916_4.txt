Where to Start? <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine Wolverine's epicly violent and romantic past, tells his story of his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the ominous Weapon X program. /> <br /> His epically violent past is spectacularly nonviolent <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand how his relationship with Creed is related to them. The murderers show that they are part of a hardcore government team that they are throwing from one point to the war, to fight the war scenes in their long lifetime, and eventually they are part of a hardcore government team. <br /> <br /> We do not believe there is nothing complicated to believe Love is also. <br /> <br /> Silver Fox and Wolverine's Math After the introduction of the character, Silverfox was killed after about fifteen minutes and we should ask why why should we ignore this? <br /> <br /> For a crucial element of the story of this weaker revenge, romance is not surprising. <br /> <br /> When Wolverine realizes that his love is dead, he must turn her into the woods when she finds herself white. <br /> <br /> For that weapon X program, just after the painfully misleading approach Wolverine is up and running. Eventually he comes home with a comfortable old yet overwhelming loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are not alert to discover a naked sweaty man in their barn. <br /> <br /> In the previous movies and comic books, Wolverine played a major role in the memory, and he was seriously ill and was aware of this ... to remember or hide such grievances and his teammates Want to continue his current positive lifestyle struggling with the villains of the world together? <br /> <br /> As X-Men united in the United States, the striker says that when Wolverine disintegrates if the striker leaves some of his secrets, he is aware of the evil things he worked together. The film produces a team very well, they really do not do anything too much. No disturbing violence, no cruel acts, they just harass some locals in foreign lands for ten or fifteen minutes on screen. <br /> <br /> Wolverine seems to be not a bad guy under the striker at all. Instead he is constantly trying to hunt over his brother Sabaratot, and we are a violent agent who thinks Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Previously, there is no difficulty for everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> In contrast to the X-Men trilogy, there are tons of other errors, one of which is the experiment of lamst deus ex machinas <br /> <br /> Magic memory-erasing bullets. <br /> <br /> In fact, they are able to reduce the wolverine. <br /> <br /> It has been forgotten when an agent sent him to bring him with bullets and bombs that did not work on him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the film is that this was wolverine throwing in a ton of other mutants, which were nothing. Interesting characters just did not do anything for window dressing and story. Most people have a maximum of 5-10 minutes in the film and you see that you have more of you and fewer than Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (not the comic version of the comic version) <br /> <br /> Cyclops Optic beams (which are more similar now as the weakening force is lasers) can burn through buildings but at Sabertooth Straight straight away smashes him to the ground without hurting his clothes. <br /> <br /> Without using his signature cards (rejecting gravity), the mutant gambit is made in a kind of silly acrobat. In a poorly revised scene he lost consciousness by Wolverine ... awesome enough just a few minutes later he was on the roof of the Wolverine run by Wolverine. <br /> <br /> When he recovered consciousness, ran a few blocks, ran over a building, then ran to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match and there was still a secret to explain. This has resulted in weakness from the comic strip and therefore should be weaker and flash in the role. <br /> <br /> Comic book source material, the real origin of Wolverine ... the story coming to the screen. . It is not his past of sugar coat or treated reader as mindless CGI junkies. It began with Weapon X by Barry Windsor-Smith, though it was well-formed story and rewritten and readable over time. Very intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX image must be remade seriously. <br /> Who is that magic gun? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
