I think I am a skeptical and agnostic and I want to enjoy this movie. After watching this, I am honestly convinced that I have done a good documentary. Its arguments only contain four duplicate resources (although I can not see Richard Dawkins anywhere in the credits of the IMDb), which is disturbed with laughter amazing computer influences, and it is also impartial. Against the teachings of the protagonist (ie me), the film has spread throughout the centenary, almost anti-adolescent Christian feelings, destroying any possibilities that one can truly change the mind. Despite some interesting debate about the history of Jesus, when the film began to live on a Christian school that read as a child, the sniping snag was an institution that was emotionally disturbed by the company. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT is clearly a low budget, there is a chance here to make a clever commentary on the most questionable sources of Christianity. The famine of the religious documentaries that are skeptical in the market is perfect, helping to fill the vacuum. Instead, the director chose to insult his intelligence, eventually doing the worst exercise, which eventually appears to be a therapeutic workout for him. His Christian upbringing is bad because he suffers, but the audience does not need his coating mechanism.
