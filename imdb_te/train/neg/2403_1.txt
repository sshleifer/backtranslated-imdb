Walk !!! I'm in Elizabeth Hartmann because this movie comes. I did not know that it was like two small scenes in the end. I necessarily stress the fast forward to the whole time. Some young people go to Romania with his father, a wolf tear and turn into a wolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and friends. Over the last 30 years, he is not a bit old and reads in high school. He ends up biting and meets a coward who has children with her. This film sucks and I do not recommend it to anybody. Read war and peace instead. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out this one too young bob Saget !!
