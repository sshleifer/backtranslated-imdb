Try this modern masterpiece if you feel that you are really bad from 83. How are you still worse? Well ... at least for the first you have Alley Shetty jogging in a sports bra. Unlike the updated graphics, modern days (like terrorists), a modern new weapon for modern weapons and replication is unfortunately the same tragic story. The next scene in the heroine / line is seen by anyone who first saw the first one. And to anyone who did not see the first one ... well you consider that lucky that you only saw it once. Hollywood will try again in another 23 years.
