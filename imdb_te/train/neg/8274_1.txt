Ahh this film is very powerful! <br /> <br /> I believe that some people in some unnamed marketing segments have an idea. Generally, make a kind of legally cosmetic film, but do it in New York. Chances are a big, bright city with money and money and everyone is a hearty, energy / money-hungry person. This is Jessica Simpson, a small town, Bimbo, the brother of Owen Wilson and Andy Dick (he's the only image that you are in this for him) to ask for the obvious reason. The basic story <br /> <br />: <br /> <br /> The girl leaves for NY boy, the girl, boy cheats, with a relative of the girl are in NY, under false pretenses to get a job, up mucks, the other boy ( Brother Wilson) and with respect to save the day and a few words <br /> <br /> this image pratibimbincetappudu come to mind, that is terrible, terrible, agonizing, agonizing and xenophobic. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, be happy. One critic was referring to Guantanamo and I agree with him. This film inspired shock. And I know what you're thinking ... At least at some point I'll see Simpson naked or very close. This is not the case, keep her and your time away from YouTube. <br /> <br /> Film editing is weak, acting can not afford, and why do not they use blue screens? <br /> At the end; <br /> <br /> Willie Nelson always plays the role of every father in the film Jessica Simpson, and why are the black, Latin, Asian or European people in the film?
