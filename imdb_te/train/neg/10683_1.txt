Some guy hangs. Well, this other person shoots him. He has earned some security guards and they dismiss the killer, but a reporter gets interested. She goes to the hospital, where they have taken the person who hangs. She walks, and the edges are a lifeguard, but he does not feel like talking. I do not recognize why. It's not like no one is interested. She is the only reporter there. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working in this dirty story. But hey, she does anyway. She goes to see the killer's sister & mom. After a few minutes they have been hanging a long time - someone hit their trailer - hit a huge ball. She then searches the bodyguard from the hospital. She plays with him on a boat, but after a minute they are going to have two navy sinks in a scuba tank. Three boys are trying to strike them (and the boat was blasted big time - a huge ball of fire). The reporter and the bodyguard promise to walk both, who beat them. <br /> <br /> In the next hour another person crosses the street, in a warehouse with a sturdy leg in a shootout, some car wreck & death, fake suicide etc. Strongly, the carnage of all the eyes. <br /> <br /> The great thing is, but the reporter and bodyguard can not be identified: why hang on in the original hell. What is inspiration? Granted, it can help us to find out why the reporter is interested. This is the only reporter of her story by almost all. Nobody cares about the media. Not all of the big fireballs and dead bodies. True, the actual guy who got whacked was not exactly a celebrity. His job is a little lame. He is just president. Yes, he lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> Is it spoiler? <br /> It should be. <br /> <br /> There are no TV cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers ... one of the police blater offenses ... <br /> So what is spoiler? <br /> Think lime ... <br /> <br /> Wait! Spoiler made his wife! Yes ... first lady. She p --ed because the president is deceiving her around. And she will get away from it. She's really sharp, huh? But hell can anyone ever find it? Why is someone bothering you? After all, only a reporter is also interested. <br /> <br /> I would give this move to "1". It was too dumb and I had to look. And it only got dumbbell! That's a real spoiler! But even if I told you, you looked to believe it!
