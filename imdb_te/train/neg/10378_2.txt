When the house is on the back of the house to be secretive to the house of Evil, the hanging is very clear. I did not even know where to start with so many problems with this movie. <br /> I would do some of them. Acting ?? When you see Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) your movie stars, do you know that you're in trouble? This does not give me much importance, but they are not as-list names. Susan George may be in two films that I enjoy, but I never thought I was the greatest actress ever seen. And in this film, her performance is awkward. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> For other two, ghosts ?? Ghosts or souls or my wanty to call them a hosted mansion right. It's a little bit of demon in Disney World. And, they're scary. And why should they be clear? <br /> <br /> This house is not the essence of the inhabitants of the wicked. Plot How is an imaginary picture The result of this film is painful when you meet the three main characters. <br /> If you can not see where the movie goes 15 minutes later, you have to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> Is the favorable Priest ?? What are the prospects of the Haunted House you are buying from the Japanese sisters? One of them does not tell you about the history of your home and knocks on the door, and asks if you need help to remove evil spirits. <br /> <br /> The word 'absurd' is in mind. Everyone ?? It's hard to think about writing something about me. I give one point to the opening scene and I think it would give a point for home construction. Sure sign of a winner? <br /> <br /> The highlight of any image can not be said about the original film about architecture. <br /> I'll stop. I have to get an idea from what I already mentioned. And, I do not even mention a group of annoying little girl or crabs invasion or other problems. Warn, it's terrible.
