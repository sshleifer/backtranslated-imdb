What is their hang-up with American and religious Goblet-Goku? It is considered to be the best selling novel, but it's really good acting and removes as a film that needs a script. In this case, all the good actors go to heaven and we are left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type reporter (!) Trying to find out why a lot of people just disappeared. Oh, there is a bad world conspiracy and famine, or something about subplot. The good news is that it's very cheap, and with such dysfunctional dialogues, it has the entertainment value of all incomprehensible laughs. Not recommended for 3-digit IQ people.
