Anyone who knows my reviews at the Internet Movie Database will tell me that I will be periodically a furor bastard. I have a lot of movies that do not like, and I wanted to review it for some vague reason. However, if anyone is curious to know the worst picture I've ever seen, more than 6-5,000 more than Transylvania. Without question, it takes the title at all times. 1 awful picture. <br /> <br /> It is clear to catch Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein's taste, but the film is a fun, horror movie tradition, which leads to losing out of the pesky weak stuff. Jeff Gold Blum and Ed Begley Jour initially be ashamed of a group of journalists in modern Transylvania (now they are doomed to the dead). <br /> <br /> During their research, they come to all major monsters from past horror favorites, such as Vampires, Werewolves and Mummies. Their hearts are driven to separate from boredom. It represents a career nadir for everyone, and when comedy fails, it can lead to more dangerous entertainment.
