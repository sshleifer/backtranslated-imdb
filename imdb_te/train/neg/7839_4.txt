Serge Fornel made the film's most accurate critics on "The Ravandes Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). <br /> <br /> UN soldiers are in danger, while French soldiers are welcomed by massive troops. <br /> <br /> The day before, the United Nations has killed ten soldiers. <br /> <br /> So UN soldiers decided to run behind French trucks to save their own lives. <br /> <br /> Do not condemn the tussle <br /> <br /> Remember that French soldiers managed this situation.
