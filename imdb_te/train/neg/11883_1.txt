After 3:30 am I could not sleep, I decided to entertain myself when I got out of sleep. This movie is in HBO and I decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> Here is a nerve man with an addiction to candy (Josh Cornbull) temporary work for a subtle company: plot (potential spoilers, if you also care). Suddenly, the "perm", which appears to be the favorite catch-phase of the film, is given. But with a safe job and secure income, Josh decides for the stupid reasons he does not want to do. He undoubtedly bundles me with many small tasks and contempt for his laziness and ambition. His inability to send the most "very important" letters in the given amount was hilarious, but just stupid. Josh meets a lawyer and cheats and falls in bed (Josh's fantasy in real life will never happen). <br /> <br /> While this film is called comedy, I have just laughed twice. Josh Cornblath's opening shot for the first time (my first reaction was one of the frustrating fears) and the second when he was in the bed with an attractive lady (yes, right). Josh Cornblath is perhaps the most awful looking person in my life. He exposes an unattractive, overweight, Jewish man who I am confident of having sex with beautiful women. I do not have sympathy with Josh's character. He is lazy and unmotivated and I do not appreciate humorous attempts. If your life depends on it, skip.
