I think everyone is very disappointed with this sci-fi movie. For one thing, Tim Burton directed. Another thing, it's a classic remake of the classic. I found boring, gross, and ridiculous. If you see it, you know my purpose. Everyone at Imdb called it the worst and the boy, they were right! If you do not, avoid it. This is a snooker. 10 to 1.
