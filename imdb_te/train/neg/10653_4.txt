One two three four five six six and eight returns, haha. This must first look at the work to see. There are a lot of work out there, to see those close ups, the man you will enjoy. A video clip a few years ago is based on this image. It's a slasher but without suspense. The ending is very funny, and the clothes that she worn in the woods to face her copper, Jesus looks like a clown. Murders often come to the fore, blood flows but not quite Gary. There are a lot of fight scene, and hey, no one got hurt. And about the weapon to kill, did not see a big one like that, it did not spoil, you should see. And there's a lot of T & A being a slasher. Assassin who guess who you are trapped in a few times and that is the best part, but about the story of copper in the woods, huh! But still due to his cheesiness this is one that many still would like. I have my copy, one of those slashes. But the man did not say that clothes and hairstyles! If you are in your 40 years, it will return to memory lane.
