Following the success of "Paris, J Tommy", a team of directors decided to build a similar anthology style film in New York. Unlike the original film, the stories in this movie sometimes come and go pretty quickly - by the time you think you are going into the story, it is over in most cases. And, often start and stop and then start again - with stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and this is less formal in construction. <br /> <br /> Sadly, "Paris, GT Amy" hit or miss (mostly hit), "New York, I Love You" missed. Stories were much more sexually but less sweet - and often very terrible. It is a wonderfully dull and uninteresting movie with some fairy tales - and often often depressing music can seem too much. Now that means, it's good quality music but its daunting tone really has really, like cutting my wrist! The story is about the young man who has taken a girl in a wheelchair for good, which talks about cheating outside a restaurant (although it is in the first film) and the old couple. I liked the very first movie because it's very sad - I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, There are also two sections that are not included in the cinema: One Kevin Bacon (the cooler Fedora) eating hot dog ... There is absolutely nothing for about ten minutes, including a very happy couple - a teen who spends the world videotaping film.
