I saw the film after the timer-tapping on the Flex. I grew up watching F trope and I had a major hard for Wrangler Jane that poorly looks and looks completely different and suddenly finds after seeing this film called Melody Patterson, namely unfortunately declining homicide. I did not expect her in a million years. What is she doing in this film? I agree here that the film does not like the audience. No sex, no gore, no tease. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain Aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). The action is very tedious; The main character is the house and basement of the crazed doctor's house, and usually running around the neighborhood spends enormous, or being roughed by the police, it's boring and all of the time filling. Now that the Italians do, half the film Slingblade / Uncle Ernst / Jack Elm Hennmann has had girls with unconscious nude. But you get that for only 20 seconds.
