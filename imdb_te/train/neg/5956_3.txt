Another spooky film struggling with a spy-boy young man who is a madman and his supernatural partisan who wants to take over ?! Yes, but this fact from Canada gives a slightly different feel. The "brain" has a troublesome young man Jim MÃ¡lveski, whose leader is a leader with a big mystery "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess from our North neighbors accomplished all that they achieved, they are entitled to at least a humorous horror film. <br /> Furthermore, they are probably known for national health care and everything. <br /> The bad guy is the brain. Why did not people make this movie?
