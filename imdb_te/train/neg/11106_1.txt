I heard a lot about this film, with people who tell me that I am a fan of bloody and ghar films. I'm almost always with my hands, but I have always kept myself from looking at something or something-so far. <br /> <br /> This film is very bad. The worst thing is that it was much better than that. I know Clive Barker and the story of all the stories, and I'm not reading that story - but if you do not see it, you feel totally clueless and totally disappointed. <Br /> <br /> The film adequately starts - the interesting story of the actors. First scene bleeding - a great way to catch your attention. I thought the blood was a bit bad, but I saw the first scene that I hoped to improve later. I made a mistake. <br /> Blood and effects are very terrible, for example, an insult to my intelligence, for example, someone can use a meat hammer to beat the head of a person from their shoulders. WTF? CGI blood (Did they use any "real" blood? The things that made my home look better than what was used in this picture!), Triangular irreversible actions (very thick scenes from the back of the head (odd yellow color, or shadows hidden in each scene). I'm mistakenly mistaken. It's a great serial-killer movie and maybe it will turn into some ghost / psychic / monster film at the end It's a good crazy guy! Butchercher people in the subway should be thrown up with a conspiracy theory OK- and overzealous photographer Maybe they can kill people through predators and sell meat? Acceptable, doable ... and very good  ను "నిజమైన" కథ కంటే అనుకుంటున్నాను. అది కలిగి ఉండవచ్చు మరియు పని వుండాలి. బదులుగా అది ఒక పాత సొరంగ చివరిలో జీవిస్తున్న జీవులు మరియు దాని గురించి అందరికీ తెలుసు కానీ మీరు, మరియు పుస్తకాన్ని చదివేంతే తప్ప ... మీరు ఎప్పుడైనా అర్థం చేసుకోలేరు "అపజయం. What a terrible thing to do for a movie that is tragic and such a probability. If you like deliberate fake blood and gore, you will like it. But if you have half the brain on your head you completely hate it. Stay away - very far.
