I thought I would give this film ten to zero. Before it came to this film, I checked IMDb comments. One comment is called a cheesy with a predictable and horrible dialogue. I never went through the opinions of others, so I wasted seven dollars for this worst movie. <br /> <br /> The person I wrote the script comes to a hill. When do horror movies feature Saffi scenes? <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that I do not have any GROUP HUG ^ - ^ moments. Once. Thinking about my research paper for English, I went out. <br /> The birds / kittens that pulled out of one of those characters. My friend and laugh and the main character when I laughed almost dude said, "I have to get my mom's shawl!" You. Idiot. Nail shawl Safety is just a few steps away, but my, my mom's shawl (the way the clothing does not match) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they will take her back to her home, knowing that the killer knows where she lived. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also guess the whole movie. And just, he wager hiding under the bed, moments. It was, "he stole Belle's clothes and came out of the hotel" and "This is the killer of the detective who is the murderer!" Moments. These films can not be imagined. <br /> By the way, I will complete my songs, which is a horrible film. I'm happy to see it in theaters, so I do not buy for $ 15.00, and then hate it. It's just bad. It's good if only one thing happened. After filming by the detective, the killer fell into the same place when he was shot and killed. A knife with a knife, cut a girl falling on him. Oh, how nice it was. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. See good image.
