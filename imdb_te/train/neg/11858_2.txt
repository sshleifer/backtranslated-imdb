I'm a fan of Mathieu Modine, but this film - which I stumbled upon on the cable - is definitely wit. I was one of the screenwriter and director and that was the same, so there was no one around to check her trash instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. Goldfish is mainly the most sympathetic character. This act does not waste any talent. How expensive to shoot in New York these days, I have to wonder how this made it in the first place. And you wonder why I look at everything, I left it when I was working on the computer after the film I liked in the cab. This is not a very demanding film!
