It is not clear from the movie (so the audience will examine the people who submit their case) but the fact that humanity is incomplete without the aim of violence and intolerance aimed at violence and intolerance against non-Muslim Muslims. The Qur'an has many things to say about how Muslims deal with Muslims, but any psychologist must accept and follow all the doctrines of that faith and system as a follower of Islam as his or herself as a human being. There is reason to call a lot about questioning about the audience, such viewers should be able to see performance with healthy skepticism; <br /> <br /> For example, a unique one to investigate a person named Valid Schubat; Who is the former Muslim who committed terrorism in Bethlehem? There are many intelligent people in the world who believe in any of these advertisements. I'm never Muslim. I never read the Qur'an. I am not a Christian, nor is a member of the unbeliever. But I was a wise and discerning human. Although the film is very disturbing, it shows how some Muslims demonstrate their responsibilities to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than the views of fundamentalists. There are variations in the severity of faith and responsibility among Jews and Muslims. <br /> When you see this picture, you have to be a salt shaker hand. If a grain is not enough, you need more. Please use your own mind, think for yourself, consider what to submit, and assess the state of the world and how is it better than what Islam said in a 98-minute video. The political affiliation of those who put together this film is common, indicating that it is a definite partisan. Be your own brain.
