<br /> <br /> Uwe Bol is a skill as a frog. Also a toad; Just a frog. He has remembered a hundred other talent hacks who churn out a useless garbage-fest after another. <br /> <br /> The picture? The worst-fest is there. I believe that Slater's talent has earned him other things (such as his failed relationship) in his mind. If Reed has forgotten her acting lessons, she has been severely hit by her head and has had one of the worst directors in film history to forget her lessons. I'm voting on the third option, for me, but the other two times is always possible. <br /> <br /> I've never been so happy. Frankly, I am satisfied that he made this stinker. Bladrene will compete with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. <br /> <br /> I am confident that Len has nothing to say, I'm worried about it. <br /> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> > <br /> <br />
