<br /> <br /> Josh Kornblut's 'Act' in this film reminds me of my latest TV product class, where they can not prove that they are not entertaining. <br /> I think when I try to synchronize this narrow comedy. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painful. Precious stones !!!!!!! The writing is just a doric. This is similar to Bob Saget's performance. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as sad as watching a Saturday Night Live Skeet (Post Balushi) for one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and want my money back !!!
