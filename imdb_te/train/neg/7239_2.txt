The film was promoted as a brilliant romantic joke. It's not wise or romantic and it's definitely not an effective comedy. Good luck of the patriotic character "Tom", swing from one of the most embarrassing disasters. The efficient performance of Toni Collate was the only efficient one, and the frequency of Paltrow's beautiful face summit. Overall, should not be used!
