I thought that the leaked aluminum was a full waste of two hours, the players had a few terrible dialogs up the prestigious line up and the most questionable accents, thin and confusing. Camera work is somewhat experimental in working places and although it seems what the director was trying to convey, it just made it look more complicated. It is almost as if the entire plot of paintings used to describe the film as the most disruptive angle of leaven aluminum. Best performances are not anything acting. In fact, perhaps the most acceptable performance, however, is the staging office of the approval, which comes from all the people Danny Behr. Going into any situation, you'll see this movie, there are definitely better ways to spend your hard earned cash unless you have a reason to catch up with some lost sleep.
