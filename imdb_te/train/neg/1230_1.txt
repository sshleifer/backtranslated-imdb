How the story is fraudulent (and the movie is bad) how much words are not described! Basinger, del Toro ... what are you thinking? So there is a mall and its parking space is completely complete. <br /> When she comes out, the whole space is empty, and no one can hear two pistols that are not nearby? Wherever she lives, when she goes away from the bad guys, she goes to a very remote and godforsaken place instead of a nearby police station or at least a crowded place? Come on !!! I can not even go into the infamous red toolbar, because other people did before. <br /> It's so stupid, without at least bit of reasoning, I can only warn it, honestly it's time waste of time!
