This film is a bit behind (when working on a trailer for the film production company) and it's terrific. Hewitt is better mediocre, Hopkins phones for his performance (but still hewed away by their scenes Hewitt) and Alec looks bored. Do not believe me in this case: If you've ever been released, you should avoid this film like a plague. This tired plot will go on a snail pace so it will last forever. It is very unlikely, cinematography is so beautiful and paced in the direction. If he decides to direct again, Alec Baldwin must go to the movie school. In his acting career, his character is totally impossible, making it impossible for him to be impossible. Dawn Ackroyd is pretty funny and the jury's surprising decoration is beautiful at the end of the film, but the film is just plain terrible.
