Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea leoni? Ryan O'Neill? Richard Schiff? My mouth was drinking water. I dropped everything to see this movie in the cables. I am 30 minutes awake. In 60 minutes I hit the record button and fell asleep. I ended up watching the next morning. Not bothered. One great idea of ​​a great cast and "Love in the Day" is that it contains your insomnia and see this movie. I will give you half an hour and a half of continuous sleep. The conversation is terrible. Not in existence. The camera did super 8 and looked good. <br /> <br /> This film is a total disaster.
