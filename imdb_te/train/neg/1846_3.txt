Well, I want to be honest with all the audience who bought Kierra's sex scenes, but unfortunately I did not see most of them. All sex scenes are small and full in chaotic manner along with all the weird and cool background music like all other B movies - it does not look like two people who have sex too. At the end there are small plot - a killer of Kira's new lover. Oops !!! How awesome !!! Why did not we nominate this film to the Oscar? Rated (the image is imported from the UK, if not 18 rated) can not imagine how the film will be. The end? It would not put it down and walk away, so there was no ending being a morse like me. <br /> Score: 2/10
