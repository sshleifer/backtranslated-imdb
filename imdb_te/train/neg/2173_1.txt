If you rent a movie under the name "3000 Cleaners", you are well aware of what you're doing inequality. According to "Motor-Psychos", and "The Behind the Cinematic Case", "Destroyers" are the turbulence of all kinds of turbulence around the post-apocalyptic barren. <br /> <br /> Now, like the occasional terrible cinema, and when you read the annotations of Year 3000, you probably do too. I said the film was a great "1 (awful)" - I was totally hated by the movie because I made quite legitimate efforts in making filmmaking. Conversations, acting, cinematography, sound-editing, general editing, plot, etc. etc. - must be an excellent title for all the lowest audience audience expectations. <BRr> <br /> What's really good about this bad movie? This is my circle affectionately "losing quality." This feature is not a killer, a difficult and fast word, but usually a person who is murdered in a fierce, creative or ridiculous fashion. Even if you're hoping for big things from nuke mutants, they think that they play a particularly zero part in the movie - even if the year 3000 is a great deal of crazy bull, the legendaryly known leader of Heathless motor-psycho gang. crazy bull, though, is all you'll ask in a b-film motor-psycho. <br /> <br /> Its quality murders and While you're really looking for fun and worse, Shakespeare's paraphrase and unusual PG-movie, 3000 years of dull, crazy and old special effects, quality killing and bad dialogue are somewhat frustrating, mainly forty minutes Not enough to justify the length Or a long and boring car for the audiences to follow the characters in the "chase" and long desert hiking scenes ... All in all, pretty awful movie, but hey, it's not Death Race 2000.
