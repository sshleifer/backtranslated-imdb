I voted for the film 3, because Greenwood output is pretty good at all. But it is a simple blend of "art" sex and gravity. I know a lot in this movie but I was very upset. It's not exactly for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor apparently took a part of the credibility for guessing, but he really should not waste time. I hate to bring anyone in the fake corner but please ..... Plus it is visually appealing, and I enjoyed music but finally did not see it and I could not tell many movies. I usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable !!
