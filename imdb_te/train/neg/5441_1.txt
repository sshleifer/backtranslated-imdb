In all the movies I've seen, this is the rage, the worst of all. Direction, LOGIC, continuity, plot-script and dialog changes to me. "Can anyone be annoyed by anyone?" Gary Bassie knows his "B" films, but this is definitely a "W" movie. <br /> Take the example: About two dozen FBI & local judges surround a trip house with a jeep vegan. Why the "jumble" about the MA and all the cops inside the jeep is in. In just a few seconds, a huge gun battle was good, killing MA directly. The police are fleeing at GPG and exploding explosions. Cari will come with cops like domains and jeeps, Gary circles around and through a single bullet / capsule. MA seems to be assassinated and Gary has noticed - that guy is tight. There is no such miracle from the 300 bullets on Wednesday, which is really awesome.
