Will her first boyfriend complain that she was treated like a robot, and then complained that her new lover (murderer) had become a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes to make you happily scratch: the mantage gaolor, the tear cut in a kamono (what are they called when they are seductive, instead take them?) And a fantastic battle on skis! Tune perfectly for the start and finish, but when all the plots are going you can grab a sandwich during the second act. Is better than a CO-ED call girl? Nah. Will Tori never leave it out of heaven or ice? Nope.
