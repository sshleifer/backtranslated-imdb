Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980 in Hungary, a legendary story in the Hungarian Jewish Sunless family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then wealthy, moves upwards, changing its name, and hoping to stay in the Hungarian society, so that it can move professionally for generations. The story is told by the eyes of three generations each eldest son; Ralph Fiennes plays these three characters. Those who miss WW-II and Holocaust in Europe do not work well for Sonenenschein's life <br /> <br /> Sunshine is appreciated as an artistic success, but it missed a chance. The dominant plot in world history is predictable and transparent; It was strengthened with this voice cover story and news reel footage. The family 'plot' churches from a predictable event [ie. Happurgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism etc., with less continuity, depth or details. Jewish syncretal background is incorrect, and important sub themes [the secret 'diary and family philosophy] are the family's character and loyalty to the very end. Alternatively, filmmakers have provided continuity of waves using common themes of promise / dislocation. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fennes displays the innovations of brilliance but his performance is far from the award-winning thing. The "1 for 3" casting format feels like a viewer is distracting and less moviemaker than a better theater. Sunshine is primarily a Hungarian "History Channel" material. The look and feel of sexual abuse with the Forst Gump.
