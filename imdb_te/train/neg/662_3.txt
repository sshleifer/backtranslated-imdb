And rent a good horror movie. The writer never first seen a horror film, and everything he wrote was mapped to perfection in clips such as Clichéd and Hockney and "Scream" and "Scary Movie". Never got into the <br /> scary bit. Stupid "We're going to the prom" is not in vain. I wanted to close my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a good dialogue. <br /> You do not really need to do this film. The main woman was curious and I kept thinking "she? Really? Guy was engaged with her? Really?" <br /> All characters act in stupid ways, including police. (Covers the front and back of 2 teams! Sleeping in his car and sleeping Cop does not expect his throat to be cut) <br /> <br /> A serial killer is about to kill just about everyone and he is at least a bit uncomfortable. Do not resist the victims (or doors). No one has the least idea of ​​defense or at least fighting (or room security in the room room door lock). <br /> <br /> If you're a gore fan, you will be disappointed too. All the killing was put on the offscreen and is - stripe - tastefully done. <br /> There are no murders. <br /> We had a lot of time before we found out. <br /> <br /> In this type of movies, a cat without a pop is missing. "Oh kitty! You're afraid of me! I thought you're a killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be free, <br /> <br /> The audience is talking back and talking back to the audience. It's not really too scary and it's not dumb. <p> <br /> <br /> If you have a baby, you can not have a crown. "Or" Friday 13th "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(which of them) get a good intimidation with some original twists.
