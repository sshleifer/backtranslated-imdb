Sometimes you want to see bad images. Well, anyway this is my opinion. <br /> <br /> Marshall tells about Angel Cat (Shu Qui), a professional thief with his lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years before. Chim Lom was kidnapped for the release of security software for Chim Law Operating Company, and she was hit by her past. <br /> <br /> When I save her, she calls her old friends to save days from her orphanages and six other agnostic women ... <br /> <br /> I told chestnut to cheesy, but it's a cheesy story . In fact, the whole script and direction does not have any quality. Most conversations have been incorporated into a plot that is meaningless and thinner-like in rice-paper in water. <br /> <br /> You need to mind, I need to credit the credit and Shu Qui may have done a terrible act Only the only person to escape. Well, you can not say she's amazing - after all she's absolutely nothing to do - but she has pulled some characters from her character. <br /> <br /> The rest, Sandra Ng and Kelly Lynn created the same impression - they are mostly glimmers and very brief. <br /> <br /> The film is broken in other places. The scenes and dialogues are not entirely unnatural and reliable, the mask of individuals and the blue screen, poor scenes, fight scenes, basic and vague. <br /> <br /> I guess this film is a cooks affair. Many people, with the same silver screen, have seven children with a lot of enthusiasm for the budget. <br /> <br /> Franklin, the way the film was made was a sexually inexpensive pornographic film. Charlie Angels, it's not. <br /> <br /> While sisters can do themselves, no one is really clear here. <br /> <br /> Do not forget.
