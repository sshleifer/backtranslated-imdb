It's very painful and dazzling for a Canadian. We grow better wine. Our writers and poets are the best in the world. National Ballet is one of the top five companies in the world. But we do bloody rocky movies! This is not particularly bad. It's a narrow direction, high school level acting and "gee whiz ... especially in two bit hotels and public parks, and what's wrong with this camera?" Photography. If Michael Nicholson was so intriguing for Jack Nicholson's deception, did he at least do Jack Nicholson's hypocrisy? If the film is shot in Vancouver, one of the picturesque cities on earth and the center of the Yacht building (part of the "plot") why in the name of God we cantialize the lowest complexity of the Canadian Seattle ??? I'm not mad about this film, I'm ashamed and a bit shy. Australians do some amazing things. We generate a second rate pipple with enthusiasm. Gawd !!!!!
