If you want to laugh like crazy, rent the cage. Cage is the two war heroes, Billy and Scott's best friends. When Billy filmed in Vietnam, he could not escape himself, so Scott takes him away. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a film with more gay contacts for two main characters. Billy and Scott love "wrestling" and tell Scott Billy that he is still serious from last night. <br /> "Shut the shut up" and "Ping Pong Pong, sh! t Cut" will make you laugh at hours. Native American guys to play Mexican gangs are also top notch. As they say, it is "party time right now bah baba bah bah ba." I have gone forever, but please watch this movie and laugh at your $$ off. It was so funny that I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
