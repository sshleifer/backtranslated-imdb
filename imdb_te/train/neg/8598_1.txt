Something fun! This is one of the worst films I've ever seen! But it's bad, it's so happy. It was very bad and my friend and I intentionally rented it. Cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. The plot, dubbed some voices, is quality horror. But I have definitely been watching a blast!
