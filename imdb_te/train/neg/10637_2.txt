I'm sorry for buying this series. I have evaluated more actions, more targeted image and more compatibility. It's just pure advertising, very dark, no charm or romanticism, it's just boring. I'm acting very weakly with actors. O'Donnell Robin (with Batman) may seem beautiful, but he does not have any charm in the film. Perhaps when he is older, he loses his child's charm but does not attract anyone who has grown up. It is not shown in many countries and sold in the UK is a recommended price of up to 40% and is not released in the Netherlands.
