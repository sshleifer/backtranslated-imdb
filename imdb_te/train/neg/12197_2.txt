Beast Wars over hyped, overpraid and overrated program. <br /> <br /> Cheeker - The characters of this acid show are actually the sensor bars on this person. How could he not stop the audience who had the same voice as baby Taz? (From Rayman 3: Razzaf: Hoodlum Havoc Slip & Slideshow) Action Blast - If you'd like a line of sucking, G4 Transformers Cybertron-a show that goes down in a toilet. Show good job creators (surrogacy) self-retarded & boring (at least Super Mario games are good). I believe that this program is in harmony with many people, but it is canceled for its own good.
