There is another nail that duff this video directly into Rick Moran's Caf√©. Like the Disney tradition, a quick cash name is sacrificed to quality; Morris is accidentally confused by himself and some relatives, lazy, and repeats all the best scenes from the original. There are instantly dated visual effects and creme lamer in this cheesy lamer, if this kind of thing happens, 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' pin me on a day. Surprisingly, it is directed by the top cinematographer Dean Kunt, who must either adhere to the job or choose the next thing better.
