Something to see I was watching last night on our DVD tower. We were between Netflix mailings and it was a peaceful Saturday night. I realized that I never heard before and received from a friend. From the jacket, the "Big Chill" is not alarmed, but with all the actors, it is worth seeing. Boy I'm wrong! It is not just like "The Big Chill", which almost lost the role by character. Bill Paxton's character is a copy of William Hurt ("You Have Played This Role") - A Driver Warning - And, As And As And Seeing, He Is Bored To Take Care Of The Old Space (Cabin / Camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum, etc. I also found myself wondering why these people are watching. I have not developed enough character to show me any interest. How did Yuka Lau find these characters after 20 years? Plus it's not even funny, except that the perkins dropped, 'flop' out of bed in the first morning, it's a sign and I missed it. After this ended, I asked my wife, "What are the lovely characters in the film? ... are you sleeping there?" She replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, I can not think."
