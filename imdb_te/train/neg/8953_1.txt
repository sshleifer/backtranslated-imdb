After reading the book, the film is literally straightforward, and it is neutral or very intelligent. I think it's the next one. First of all, in the smallest and most important details is incorrect. One of the first things I discovered at Winsstan's day was his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. He feels unhealthy and thinks he is more sensitive to the people without fear. One of the most important parts of the book, it says, is impossible in any small part to perform a safe hint of his true emotions on his face. This is seen in the streets of the working class. Winston's book revolves around this and is suspicious and feared on every tour. <br /> <br /> While in the picture, he is often and not afraid, you lose the most important feeling of danger and danger from the bats. <br /> <br /> Other small flaws include hiding his diary on Winston wall, yes it is a very small change, but it prays the question, what's the point? The director has a very unpleasant thing to do with a book and it's morphing characters. <br /> <br /> Large bugs are very glitches. First, one of the most important parts of the book, Big Brother is a government based on a clever and more raw philosophy. In the picture, go straight to think that they are skipping and directing technology directly by Hitler. This is true, in an angle, when it looks its shape, but if you come out of the Big Brother, you really have lost the point in the book. The horror thing about Big Brother is, in a way, a few points behind its philosophy. When O'Brien flips in love with the Ministry of Love, he will hear about everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he hears, and his philosophy advanced forward, what is actually very creepy and mystery. Finally, when Winston says that he loves Big Brother, it is terrible that you are not sure whether you killed it and the fact that it is the real power behind philosophy. <br /> <br /> The Big Brother's philosophy has appealed to me, but its intelligence and depth does not say that this book makes it so disturbing. <br /> Winston in Julia's film as well? <br /> Where is O'Brien before the address given to Winfone? Winston's thoughts on the subject of the book are related to him. In this movie, they just go to the gun. <br /> <br /> The film is a terrible parody: it is impossible because the gun and morph characters can not be removed in less than two hours. How can this picture be seen within two hours? Too little, the movie demands 3 hours to capture some of the most important moods and connections. <br /> <br /> If you like the book well, I will really worship it, you can not accept this film and you have the chance, you do not already know. Because the book is unreasonable, and this picture just proves how impossible something cram something good in the tiny reel of the film. <br /> The two stars out of ten
