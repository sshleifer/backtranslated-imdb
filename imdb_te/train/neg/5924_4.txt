Diana Muldar appeared on the Star Trek for the second time, but this time was a different role. Nobody on the board will not notice - maybe it's hair. Regardless, at this time she is a very famous woman with magical powers that she can not communicate and watch with a Majusan without a god (not the previous episode) but without crazy (standard human response). Unfortunately, the man in love with him tries to kill a full deck's small cards and Muduson ambassador (phenomenally, lives in a small pump - this is very difficult to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr does not hurt her all well. What happens next is dumb and type over the first time I've seen it, I was pretty relieved. GA-GA over Muldaur is pretty crazy looking all the men and Spock acting is pretty campy when he briefly went crazy. If you do not see the presentation in advance, select another episode.
