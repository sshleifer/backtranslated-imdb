My roommates & I've shorted our TV out of many spit-takes when I see this hilarious piece of 1970's self-important fake Jen Deck. I have read about this camp for ages and scans my local Late Night TV for YEARS in search of this obscure thread. Several years ago our local ABC affiliate was known for its cold night flick for its late night weekend movie (ie "Frogs", "Lepus Night", etc). Then it happened one day: Saturday 1:40 pm (5 years ago) right there! We have over 15 folks and do not disappoint the film! <br /> See! <br /> <br /> Andy Griffith is the silly & most frightened guy from Joy Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> See! <br /> <br /> William Shutner resembles a variety of sports on his head in the sport of human hair (or any organic matter of the subject). <br /> Feel! Better than a decade better than 70 years. <br /> <br /> For those who have read ... Plots encircle a middle class level. Head owner (Griffith) for crossing the dessert crossing of California & Mexico. They wear all the leather jackets and look at Christopher Street. The way they stop at a cantina is a film that does not have a picture of drunk, smoke, smoke joints (the sight of Robert "Mike Brady" read smoke joint you do not forget immediately), start fighting, rape attempt, and just a group suburban middle class jack offs. If I have a wonderful copy of the tape on the TV, I will release this video so that the whole world can enjoy its half-baked gown.
