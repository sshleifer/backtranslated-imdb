I did not expect much from the film directed by Sidney J. Fury and played by Dalf Lundgren, but I surely wanted more than a GET. A liner user comment - 2nd Action Action Cinema - Lundgren does not seem to be too deputy for me. On the other hand, if this rating is less than 5.0, I can not see this picture, but hey, the film is 5.9 out of 10, which seemed pretty acceptable for this type of product. <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> His performance is just plain terrible, emotional and contrived. Lundgren's inability to work is more visible in scenes with juvenile offenders. They are as great actors as compared to the great actors or lundrene - they are natural and reliable. <br /> <br /> The lesson of the low budget is some of the things that are interesting - weekend high-security high school, with four teenagers and brutal criminals trying to persuade the battle-veterinary teacher - but the story (anytime BREAKFAST CLUB like DIE HARD Does it meet or is it a panic room?) Complete unbelievable situations, cliche and Lots of stereotypical letters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alex Curz and Kato Dobo play a bony and crazy couple in love and he sends the film's most acceptable performances, Sam Rockwell's budget version and she, a Milla Jovovich wanna-be. In the film that fails in everything, their aesthetic and style has provided enough tornado, which reduces my interest.
