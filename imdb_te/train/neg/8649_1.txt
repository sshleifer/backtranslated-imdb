This film fails at every level. I have a thought, take everyone involved and take them into the hot zone in the Middle East. If we are lucky, they are all shot dead and can not waste our time again and again. Did I say that I'm never bad about my worst painting of my whole life? My God, I never saw this bad. I will see Ishtar 25 times in a row and sit for 10 minutes to apologize for this film. When I meet anyone involved in the film, I spit on their face and then do not beat them unnecessarily. That's my two cents.
