It is hard to believe that the "action" packed jet-lee film is very boring, but this is a transparent trash. The plot is a mixture of other Hong Kong Chapsoki Flix. Marshall Arts Action does not have all the unique effects and human talents. <br /> <br /> It is a comic book story about a group of superheroes who are mentally unstable because one of those who have the ineffective army to protect their lives (Lee) will rebuild a life as a peaceful librarian. Austin Powers reshuffled killers with quality plots to recapture the world, and Li left his new life to save his world. <br /> The version I have seen has been dubbed, layer-thin plot and 25 per cent of the comic book special effects. But I also suspect 8-year-olds looking at the ninja-turtle found this childhood and space.
