The film was based on the 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McNuas has three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr. Love and Justice". I read three. The first two are excellent. Last, probably not an experiment. But McInness's work has been praised; And that's right. The musician was the ultimate nightmare of the novelist - it became the charismatic, ill-fired, one-dimensional apology of a film that claimed to have captured the spirit of the 1950s London, and to see the fruits of one's mind that it did not do anything. <br /> The goodness of Colin McNannes is not alive to witness this.
