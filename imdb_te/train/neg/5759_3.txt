These scary movies are third parodies and hopefully final. Spoof was mainly due to some strange reasons in The Ring, Science, and 8 Mile. In my opinion this picture is very meaningless and unnecessary and even funny. I laughed three times and did not fit into comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this is just plain dumb. If your jokes hit the dead bodies and the people are constantly throwing each other then this picture is for you. In my opinion, if your smart enough to stay at home and save your money and stop doing this kind of movies, they just keep getting 3/10 worse.
