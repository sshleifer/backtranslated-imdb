Definitely a funniest movie. I lived in London and researched the plot is enormous, which is ridiculous. No one could be terrorizing on London underground. In the shortest time every day, workers' groups in the service check and repair the tracks. The homeless people living there are not equal. Or locked up at this day and age and may not be accessible to the mobile phone. <br /> <br /> If anyone finds their own after the last train, they graze graffiti on them. Despite the control of a large number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the story. <br /> <br /> Remember, in London, we have more memory than other cities in the world with more secure cameras in the world. <br /> If it's in a town, I may not have known it. Perhaps I had it through ignorance. <br /> <br /> "If you have such a rating! Disappointing picture.
