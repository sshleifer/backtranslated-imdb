Wow. I went to the video store tonight and I found this gem because I was in the mood for a bad B horror movie. I looked at the cover and thought it was just like the picture to my mood. <br /> <br /> This film is not a horror film. It's very bad. I wanted a bad image but I did not know what I got, I was among the worst man like this. <br /> <br /> I wrote this film at the age of 5 and directed it and was nice about it. <br /> <br /> I am an amateur director and this film is very insane to me. Live movies. <br /> He needs to work in the trash bar. <br /> If you're thinking of renting or buying. I will give this to people who are willing to commit suicide. "Do not do this, it's not worth it!" I can not really tell you about this movie. Do not do it!
