I remember 80 slasher flicks and I remember pulling it from our theater with "Silent Night / Deadly Night", I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of this on Fear.net. That's what you got to watch out and I have come to expect these kinds of movies. The quality of the special effects is very ridiculous by today's standards, the character development is very long, but it's funny loudly funny! <br /> <br /> In the 80s you are not unpleasant flashlights but true turches - <br /> <br /> When Santa and his father feel his mother, then the mob lit up lights literally. - Really tied my funny bone. However, the scenes examined by children in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feel of a different nature. I also enjoyed the role of some of the actors. It took some time to recognize that the teddy bear, who loves the brothers, is the main character.
