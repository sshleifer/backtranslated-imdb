What is the deal with clothes? They wore like one of the 80s in the late 70s. Cars are too old. The school has expired. The nuns were decorated, and 40th-turn the hospital, with its wards and wooden stairs and objects. Nothing in the whole movie suggests it was done in 1991. My mom laughs, "Gee-od! When this picture is MADE?" When we pressed the "Info Button" in our Remote, we had to have a typo in 1991! Has anyone seen it? She's a favorite part, though, the woman tells her delicate worst husband, in her telephone, about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he says, "Well, see, I'll talk to Congress when I talk to you." That line is just classic. Only one person! My parent's favorite part is when she gave them a "sponsor of the devil's child" she is a very own rodewer. My mother said "what a devil's span needs ... a rodilare" she enjoyed all the people who were crumbling churches, holding their chest. Her other favorite part of the school at the parking lot was driving a garage truck / dump truck / front end loader theory to the right, driving five miles an hour. He had only 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he looked real mute vacant on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to school?!?! Whatever!
