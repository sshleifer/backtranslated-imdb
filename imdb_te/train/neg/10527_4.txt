I found this movie with a seller of OOP's seller. And this one is definitely OOP. After a year after The Exorcist she was back in business with the film, but Blair's career never happened, and she has never been a mega actor. For this reason she is OOP in many films. She gives a good performance in the film. It does not have friends and friends about the rejection that has not been identified by his parents. It was funny when he was 14. At the age of 14 at age 14, it was funny. There is also a name for the rape scene in the film. In most editions it was cut off, I do not know, no blood was involved, okay, Blair but naked but nothing was shown, T & A so people are not guilty. But the film is very slow. It's not usually happy for me but I felt almost asleep. It has become a rebellious group of about 14 years old, but there are no blood streams. Why is it surprising to me still classified in horror? If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can see it.
