I must be a person in America who does not like this movie. I'm not this my style or something, I guess it's so lovely about it, it's just entertaining, one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /> This is about the person who came from nothing, and to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe the whole picture, and it is my feeling about the whole picture correctly. A film about mafias / drug trade / criminal groups is not a great movie, just a good storytelling is not because of what many people think.
