I remember this presentation when I was a kid. I could not remember much about myself, just a few little things about the characters. For some reason I remembered that I was really serious. Even in the morning it was really really early in the PA. Finally, after looking for the web for a long time, one episode was discovered. The first episode number is low. Criminey! This show is terrible. It has been clearly shown that children play the laser tag and have a great time. The program begins with bodi li telling his mommy "My names are not Christopher, I bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" We then force the children to play the laser tag to the song "loose loose". And just a quick little, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhhh My mind hurts thinking about it. Oh yes, and if I can not get worse, you can not even see laser beams from their guns. It's just going around the whole "foot loose" song. Later, Biddy's space or wherever he goes, Phil Collins's song "Su-Su-Sideo" has a laser gun fight. Oops, trust me and do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... Light Shins !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
