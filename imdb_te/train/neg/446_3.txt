It's frustrating. It started well, but it went down and lost every opportunity, it fell flat. Maria Schroeder's performance is terrible, she does not even know what she says or does not tell her what she says. She did not have any real emotion, not for her beloved Goy, or her mother's story. With Lena she looked less like academic interest in Lennon's story. The real relationship between Lena and her mother seems to have a good time in the wedding, which is not too much. The clichés of Hannah's "mixed" romance and parallel between her mother's relationship with her father were a cliché and failed miserably. The marriage is totally unbelievable and mute end. The climax of the protest is poor, and if she or she can not influence the result, she can certainly show the complexity of the concept, the haunted look, the unsustainable ambiguity at that point. In fact, there is no depth or spark in any single character in the film. It is very difficult for anyone to ignore them. Everything with Louis is a distraction. (Why did she leave the hotel when she was on the phone? There is no context or explanation for it.) It will not be noticeable if every mention is removed. <br /> <br /> A simple story is disappointing by the poor character development (whose mother, again ??) weak acting, and directed by everyone who looked like they were acting. You can hear "silent on the set" ... "I think it's worth a 7, but it's a 4 in the movie and then 3 after getting the wedding scene turned out I was cool and clean about the film. Terrible waste of good story.
