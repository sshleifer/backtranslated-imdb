Well, I had to sit down at the computer and oozze this ink and write down the review right away. Why? Because you do not know how good the film is. This is unbelievable bad. Just how bad it is, I will give you these little details about the film. During turbulent scenes, usually people have shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me correctly. This movie really sucks. In fact, I feel the fact that these days will cost only ten dollars to come to theaters. And to see the garbage covered with corn like this? There is no story to talk about and the film is basically nothing more than occasionally breastfeeding and is really cheaply killed. I was really disappointed, I saw it. Well, I'm dumbstruck. It's very bad, I can not find the words. Rating: Out of ZERO *****.
