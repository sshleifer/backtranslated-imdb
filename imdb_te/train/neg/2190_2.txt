** Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Ever's wife Virginia Leith, a brilliant brain surgeon involved in a very poor screen car accident. Leith is guilty and the doctor takes his severed nagni back to his home and revives the head in his laboratory. The outline of the building was filmed at Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate; Laboratory scenes are clearly shot in the basement of anyone. The tumultuous head was kept alive in "Lab Equipment", which looked poor enough for Ed Wood. Some libraries were filmed on Andy Milligan's The Biddy Benit. Leith has another heavy metaphysical lectures of the head of Ever's Mowers, a chained chain in the room. Meanwhile, the good doc makes strip joints to see his body's knob noodle. At the end, some pruning time and pieces are cut when the pruning prints come out of the room to bring the pumpkin head monster to a welcome. The matter took three years to release, and then it gave the audience the greatest eligibility. Between this, plant 9 OUTER SPACE and some others should have declared the 1959 Turkey Year.
