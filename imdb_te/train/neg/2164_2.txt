I felt like a cast of a cast including Peter Voule, Susanna York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews. Hmm, I'm wrong. It was widespread in both Otto and York until beginning from the beginning. I saw it twice and did not know anything about it. I play Laird of the Scottish fortress who has a drink problem with Vole and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also a mad sack. But rather, your opinion is as good as possible. <br /> <br /> There is no ransom feature for this movie. I only imagine casting and the director blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. The talented cast and director's time is clearly ruined. Risible.
