The film wants to explain that criminals are the product of modern society. Therefore, thieves, rapists and murderers (the film's killer, Carl Panzraum (James Woods), are three and worse) are fully responsible for their work? An interesting concept, but it is very difficult to bring the screen to a brilliant and emotionally satisfying way. Killer: A Journal of Murder comes too short. The film tries to focus on the behavior of Pangram, with his violent youth and glasses with exceptional breeding, that Pangram never watched the idea of ​​being a victim rather than a culprit. Certainly, the system is corrupt, with a large man suffering a whole illness in Leavenworth prison (a lot of film is being done), many jail guards like traumatic harassment, and a prison director, such as a megomonican depot. But why would Henry Lester (Robert Sean Leonard) take a new jail on earth and why would such pity take place in Panzram? Even after reading his mysterious diaries? The film is given a few explanations: Smaller witnesses that have been beaten by Pulp through the most sanitarian (and stereotypical) guard are impressed by Pangram's intelligence (although it is unclear why this man feels very good). Although the film shows its crimes low and highlights his personality, is not it sympathetic to an angry person like Pangram? To the smallest, the pandor is very trustworthy, and exceeds all the aggression that reads the viewer in the pangraum diaries. Does this man have very few friends, who has everyone who can see the face value of everyone else alone? <br /> <br /> I am a small person who is a product of modern society. <br /> <br /> BTW: Shot for Killer TV (though not as good as it is)
