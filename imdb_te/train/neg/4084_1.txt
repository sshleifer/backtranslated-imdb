Every now and again hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate the listeners to watch the listeners or never through. <br /> <br /> It's nothing to do with Shakespeare's play. Not sure, but I thought I did some 20 minutes in the film ... I realized that I did not clear my toenails, and they threatened me to cut it. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me boring and behaving. <br /> <br /> I'd like to put you off with other pictures by English director Peter Greenway, which I did not score (I've actually tried to see it), which I can not. His content is "The Cock, Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" is really a great British film, although its content is stomaching - a fantastic movie, but why do I understand why it looks? <br /> <br /> Another good film by Greenway is "A Zed and Two Noughts". <br /> <br /> The other film that I considered too late to such radio programs is "Brazil". <br /> <br /> If you do not have a taste for self-worthy movies, they are very stylized, tedious and difficult, and Prosro Books is obvious.
