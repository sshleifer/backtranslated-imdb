I saw this film 5 years ago, and its memoir still haunts me to this day. I know how terrible it is, and that's why I'm only guilty. But for most people I do not believe all the negative. Being a sandler fan, it seemed unpredictable in his movies. I'm sandalwood enemies. <br /> <br /> The comedy that we do not have 1 second in comedy is here. In fact, it is very successful. Suppose you feel in a 90-minute comedy, they may even be upset about something fun. But it's just terrible. It's "nice looking good", it's not just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can cry. <br /> <br /> Do you wait patiently for the film, people will die 7 days after watching video tape? If the film is on the video tape, the people will die in their hands immediately and die on their face as they end their agony and the first smile from when they play. <br /> <br /> Do not stop your curiosity, you might want to see how bad it is. Not. Please do not. Trust me, I'm helping you. There are 2 types of people in the world, the worst picture ever made overboard going overboard, and it has not yet been seen.
