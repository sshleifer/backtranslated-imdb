In the late 1970s, I was looking forward to the film based on Grendel, written by John Gardner. It is based on Beowulf epic, from the perspective of the monster. <br /> If you are thinking of Gardner's book, the film based on Beowulf epic should not be named Grendel, but has shown nothing more than a revised Predator when it does not say anything more about the monster beyond CG Monster's some curiosity scenes. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is distinctive Hollywood to be very bad. <br /> <br /> Very desperate and waste of time.
