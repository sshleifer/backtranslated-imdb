This is a movie about the grief, live, live. As such, it moves the audience and sympathizes with the plight of the main characters. However, its annoying post-modern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera is constantly changing from one scene to another, from a personal crisis to the next, choppy, confusing effect. Many of the characters appear to have a goalless and constructive life with their professional commitments. (It's just a chance given a sum of death penalty, a woman he just met and extended the credibility that a woman would sink romp to sex). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. Overall, the overall effect is frustrating. For all, acting is generally good and some scenes are very powerful.
