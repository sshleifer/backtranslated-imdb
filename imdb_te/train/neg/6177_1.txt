The real irony is this: Joe Besser Stooges is a top-lyric comedian, in other situations. He has a perfect track record of being very funny and intelligent. Mo and Larry and Shemp have been known for him for a number of years or at least for him and his work. So what's going on when he joined forces as "third stooge" on earth? Obviously, nothing is there. Most of these "late Stozo" eras stories, not too often, are jogged against each other or another and this is not a perfect stooge courtesy. To refer to Curley from "Restless Knights", "Everyone for Everyone, Everyone for Everybody". When a good comedy band, Laurel & Hardy, Abbot & Costello, The Max Brothers, chips are either in benefit or in the other side, when the chips are down, one will come for help. Nothing of this particular has happened. Trying to deceive others or not for the unfortunate and humorous effect, it's almost like watching a dog's fight. It may be thought that there is something behind the scenes here, which imitates the art of life. Perhaps not for a long time with Besser Mo and Larry. Just look at the history of other teams and tell me that I am wrong.
