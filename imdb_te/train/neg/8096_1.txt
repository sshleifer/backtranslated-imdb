Many book simulations are bad but the film leaves off the main parts of the storyline and has changed the description and some characters. They got back the storyline and mixed scenes and changed the order. <br /> <br /> If you read this book, it was a very stupid film, and it was not a matter of attention to you. Characters like them, or do not like them. "<br /> <br />" Wast for two hours of my life.
