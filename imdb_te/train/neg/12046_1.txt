I had great hopes for Troy and I was disappointed. This film made my stomach a very difficult time. <br /> <br /> There was a good fight between Achilles (Pit) and Hector (Bana). Hollywood has always insisted to rewrite the stories that fit 'customers' approval. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted for 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris from the Troy walls with an arrow to the ankle! <br /> <br /> Do not start me on the lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She fought in the war, and it did not appear as if she had a great deal about one another. <br /> <br /> In the films I Carey Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole acted very well with a bad script but this awful movie is not enough to save. <br /> Can someone tell me who went to a budget of Â£ 200 million? <br /> Where did they come from all the trees in the funeral trees? <br /> When I get frustrated it hurts.
