<br /> <br /> I completely worship the 'Toxic Avenger' Serias, but this weak offering of Tirama people was not meaningless and it was a surprise to me all the time. <br /> <br /> A clutter atomic factory connects it aside) Throwwail High Goats make youngsters, which makes them join the gang, sexually explosive and sophisticated. There is also monster breeding in high school ... My God, this film is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors have pretty much stopped their efforts after this attempt and they should. This (intended) overacting started to get my nerves within 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointment. 2/10.
