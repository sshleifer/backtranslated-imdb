This film is not the least bad! The Lemm movie is supposed to be a superb car dominance. It is 1HR is completed in 45min from Las Vegas, which takes place in a Ferrari F430. I did in the small 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord in 1HR 50min. Seriously ... this film does not do justice to these cars. Obviously, these authors run with a speed limit of just 10 and 2 hours with their hands. I am Eddie Griffin 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo 30-40 mm. >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> And ... the director Andy Cheng is the biggest selling !!! He is ashamed of his own race. I wonder how many people are just happy to break into Hollywood. He participated in a film that he portrayed on Asian countercodes and FALSE. Asian Women >> Cheap money grubbing whores. Asian men >> lose all compulsive gamblers & thugs that beat all the time. What is the fear of what heck asians ?? Why always show them in such negative connotation? I am SO sick of the way Hollywood is always portraying asians with negative and false pretexts.
