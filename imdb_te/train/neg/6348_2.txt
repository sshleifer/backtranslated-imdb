Absolutely naked nonsense. This item is dull, dull, and dull, and most of the cast does not understand Allen's previous films. And Will Ferrell Will Will Will Will Listen to His Woody Allen Simulation The second rate (mysteriously popular) makes Ferrell more loathe. <br /> <br /> The 70-year-old Allen seems to have broken the job when the clock in the movie works in a new century. <br /> <br /> I've really tried to take part in the movie, but it's just impossible. My snaps can not slowly fire. So when I was sleeping in the afternoon, I slept myself and left my wife and daughter in the theater. Good book for re-reading (George Bailey's great sensation) 30 years ago, "the Germans.") Thanks to Woody, the day has turned out pretty well after all.
