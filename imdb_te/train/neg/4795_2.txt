It looks like the only movie that was directed by John Saxon and seems to have a good idea to stop it and stay in front of the camera. This film is a dog, from start to finish, and it's nothing too dull and wood going for it. A Vietnam War hero takes up a job working for a mob boss, friendly with his wife, and then wife mob owner and warrior killed and sentenced to prison and death sentence. Now, this special prison is experimenting with inmates and is finally testing some formula that turns men into a killing machine (a zombie). Of course, if everything goes wrong and then trapped in jail is all of these infected people, some of whom are suddenly and suddenly do not want to be just there and the rest are changing. It's nothing special to show or say to it, and it goes over and over and I've stopped before the end, it seems to come some times, but this is clearly only a different and equally dull way. In the end they can change a zombie, so it can not stop. 10 to 2.
