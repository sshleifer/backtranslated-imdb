Lynch. The man has some really great stuff! He knows how to disturb us, then we are rewarded by thinking in different ways. But it is completely different. Dumbland's prize is 1% absurd humor, which is 99% stunted with stupidity. I might have laughed at once, but I began looking forward to Episode 4 around episode. Do not miss a single thing. When this ended, I relieved, and part of that segment in this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying animations, voices and annoying situations with noise. But this and its other absurdist characteristics have been recognized and still failed to make Dumbland worthwhile.
