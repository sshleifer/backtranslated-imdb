Ah, byte. How do I hate you? Calculate me ways. 1. You try to be fun, but not wheat and unhappy; Each joke is predictable and predictable, and when it comes to it, laughter does not inspire. Instead, I want to flip. 2. You are dramatic, but unbelievable; The lady overacts a terrible degree, and looks like "bad guy" Bill Gates, and about scary ... well, Bill Gates. (Lawyer, perhaps, but not a gun.) I try to imagine trying to threaten anyone with Gillet when he tries to look at him just fine for Jamie Fox, humorous to say a dramatic and heartfelt conversation. 3. You try to get action-packed, but rather slowly and slowly over time. And when the action warmed up, the tripod for the camera must be lost, the scenes are more than the Blair Witch Project, and I find myself bored, and once again I want to hurry up. 4. You are a good movie, but you have failed, failed! With a pack of Meryl Streep only for beef jerky full water and no water, no sunscreen, and the company I walked footwear across the Sahara. This hell is far more favored than the watch that everybody looks at byte, with a gripping story with Bill Gates not even talking about their massive storyline and a huge bomb that goes into the car of Jamie Fox's character. Just run a CLIFF OFF, but it manages to escape something ... just kill me now, or the right thing and something I promise that this evil will never ever see a movie again.
