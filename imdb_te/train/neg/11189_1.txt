Always enjoy great images dealing with super-intuitive and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, the film turned away until its production and direction. There is nothing to go into deep debate about what this story says; All I can say is that it is a big waste of time and effort to keep it on the big screen. Actors, namely: Audi played, Thomas Garrett, gave his native land an excellent performance in England, and we saw him in a TV series "Still Standing". Heath Ledger, played a real badger and we recently watched him on "Brokeback Mountain", 05, giving him a great supporting role. Shannin Sosaman, (Mara Sinclair), has done a good job of abusing a priest from a church that has not been identified by any religious faith. Do not waste your time, you're sorry!
