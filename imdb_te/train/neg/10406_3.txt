Warning: This review includes small spoilers. <br /> <br /> The first intense writers have officially come from ideas. I am a big fan of the first film and the first two sequels are pretty straightforward for video fare. Tremor 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very frustrating picture. Where the heck grabbeds? <br /> <br /> In the absence of Grabo's relativity by the first 90 minutes, I believe that this entry would be considered a "role study". Unfortunately there is not an interesting character in the film Billy has given very few lines with the exception of the character of Drago, do not go too low and at the end of a very small screen. Michael Gross, as Burt Gammer, existed in the 2nd and 3rd films. When you do not take any action on the screen you can rest assured that Burt Gammer is very interested and / or watchful. Gross Heurm Gummer, however, played a very poor and boring alternative in the film. <br /> <br /> "I saw Tremors 4 101 minutes listed, which is good for the video, but after watching it, I see that the film is 15 minutes long <br /> <br /> When I sold Tremers 4, I saw a gold mine hit Good luck I thought I would pay # 1 for # 4 Well after watching Tremors 4 I'd pay for the original and like to think this mess got free for free, I can not imagine paying a dime for the Tremor 4. It is best to forget the Tremors 4 for fans of the series: Legend <br /> <br /> The intensity 4: Legend starts with 10 to 3 rates.
