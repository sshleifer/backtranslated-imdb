Really Shame - Very rarely I am watching a movie and leaving feeling frustrated at the end. <br /> <br /> I used some of the introductions of Ira Levine - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stephanie Wives' - and I liked them both, but it did not appeal to me. The story-winning playwright (Michael Caine) won a prize decides to kill one of his previous pupils (Christopher Reeve) and screws his script for his own success - I'm excited. I'd like to be thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lewett's good director and Ira Levine's work is generally good. <br /> I do not spare people who have not yet seen, 'LOADS of twists and turns. Describing the plot of the image in detail and giving it away from it is very hard. I first enjoyed it ... 45 minutes, turns and turns started to begin and my interest and experience at that time fade out. <br /> The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon and Irene Worth - all of their roles are fantastic. Worth's clear duplicate Russian voice slightly gets my nerves (personal Irene nothing, I think any actor's fake voice irritates me). Although Canon's character did not mean it was frustrating, Diane was upset and happy - at the same time. <br /> Anyone reading this - you are not looking at my opinions - give me a chance, you may like it, you can not. It's all about opinion.
