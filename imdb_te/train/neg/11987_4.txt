In my lite. In class we ended up with the book, Hatchet, and nothing like this movie book. (1) Brian does not eat mites in the book. (2) He does not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother cheated his father at station wagon in forests where no one could see. (4) The mother does not cheat black hair with cheating, he is blonde. <br /> <br /> For the dubious parts of the film: (1) A thirteen-year-old pitch does not hold his fist through a window. <br /> <br /> For acting, the child who played Brian is a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I believe the director is impressive, but the director also reads this book. <br /> <br /> If you read this book it is good, by Gary Palsen, but if you have, then start the letter complaining letter.
