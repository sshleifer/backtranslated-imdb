I usually have no problem walking away from a bad movie, but it's a special case. This movie is very bad, I really sit around the whole thing and justify the hour and hour of time that the time spent up to an hour and a half. I'm sadly disappointed. A group of college friends set at a beach house that is celebrating a holiday, this film is not worth looking at and suffers many problems. At first, there were no more hollow plot holes. Secondly, very few people in the C-list (I can not call them B) actors are valued, so any scenes can fail terribly. Third, it is very daunting and awkward to see the time when building a suspense is very difficult, causing quite a few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, there is a moderately semi-opposite climate because how it ends (the murderer) and partly because the dialogue is just worse. <br /> <br /> I have always seen the movie, I have seen a lot of movies for credit, the only film that I can say anytime. <br /> <br /> So, always glad never heard, if you want to know a secret next time someone will ask you, you really do not really run in the opposite direction.
