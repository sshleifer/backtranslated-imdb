Nice: I loved this movie because this was the first horror film I had seen for so long and really frightened me. This acting is not very bad, and the "Cupid" killer is believable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The movie is a storyline and the plot is very weak. It does not. The ways that the killer killed his victims is horrific and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Total: good fear, but bad story. <br /> <br />
