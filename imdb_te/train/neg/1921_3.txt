For some strange reasons, the film world is driven by fashion. Someone is making a movie about a killer shark, then the movie reflects the world ocean oceans giant squids, killer octopuses and ocean monsters. From the hell, there are men by a former lover, then the role of every movie is hell or hell from hell or hell from a hell or a hell. Then when a major Hollywood company turunados produces a big budget FX Laden blockbuster, other filmmakers jump on the bandwagon and do not have a budget that they have stopped. The rebels' night is a case. Whatever disrupts me for making a television movie, it tries to hide the absence of its budget by reducing ad breaks. Kamara seems to have been locked on an appalling expression of a tornado actors anytime, "Oh my got it is this is" and "run for your lives", then the need to drive producers to open the screen is a special effects budget. Unfortunately, the dinner budget was overwhelmed to include good actors. The cast is not bad but they do not master the catchy and take a picture of which the character is driven. <br /> <br /> This is the last word called Twitter Clone ..... Yeah NOTT TWISTER was released a few months before but TWISTER Hype for many months like 1996's summer block buster and NOTT led me to believe it and it's surrounded by TWISTER The tie in the hype leads to the belief in the release
