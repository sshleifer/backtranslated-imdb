This film is now the only thing that tortures the thrillers. After all, Feerstein's Flex Crush will tell you that you have not seen anything in real men through the tryout. <br /> If there is anything to the traffate - here-it might be interesting. The Wahair motif, like the camera, is nothing new. Did We Forget All D'Sika's "Bicycle Thief"? <br /> <br /> We can find all these things by hitchcock. Truffaut, Truffaut overshadowed his eyes in his films. (Many small thefts), and finally escapes social bonds to make 'his own film'. Sorry ... it's there, I've done it many times for this topic.
