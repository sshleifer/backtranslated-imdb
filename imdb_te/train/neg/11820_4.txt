I saw in this DVD (which is called this form of corruption) and the book on cassing really showed Harvey Keitel's character Frank how much he led him into the role of Bud Lecter "This is a gritty and powerful police thriller". Cassing does not say this is an old Italian cinema. How old is Theo? When a character is playing music he does not put in a CD player, he puts out a large plastic pancake item and puts it in a revolving hub when it touches the punk theory that can listen to some kind of mechanical arm. Do you see my opinion about this old movie? This DVD case did not give any evidence to the film 20 years ago. It also portrayed poor production values ​​as far as other Italian films play them. Although these actors are very painful, except Keitel, Johnny Rotten's performance is rather strange, horrific, cinematography and sound quality that I am looking for a fourth generation pirate copy. If it is a dodgy DVD down or it will print a very bad image) and the score of all the worst Enoio Morricone. It is not possible to clip the undesirable music that Clip Eastwood has suffered from music for Western music. <br /> <br /> All of the causes of corruption are moments. That's not a great psychological thrill ever created but it retains my interest and always keeps Keelel a good show like a violent nutcus cap. Just the rest of the film does not match its high standards
