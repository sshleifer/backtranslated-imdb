"Lies" narrates protocols about half screen time engaged in naked sex and hockey whipping and tells about an affair between the 18th year baculated male student and a scrawny 38 year marriage and a little more than pathely appealing to linear sexual scenes. A worst mix of comedy and drama It's a very poor product value, including a story clear clear sanitary accessories and phony soft sex, "Lies" quickly becomes unnecessary ad nauseam. With almost 2 hours running, subtitles and less stuff, "Lies" is not simply recommended. (C)
