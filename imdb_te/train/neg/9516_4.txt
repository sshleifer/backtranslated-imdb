Frank Sinatra is a no-Goodman former soldier and desperate writer, hard-life and hard-drinking, returning to his Middle East and working with his brother-in-law (Arthur Kennedy), the daughter of Headstrong. Frank Gambler Dean Martin, uneducated Floyez Shirley, is associated with McLain, and runs a few runs with law, but he really wants to write and settle with a good woman. The over-simplified drama in the soap opera with Mickey's 'Colorful' and Embarrassing Sentiment (though she was drunk at her "After You Gone Gone") and the well-maintained Maclean character. Director Vincent Minnelly oversees a straightforward fashion, but he is surprisingly gloomy souls and large sequences are too flat or dense. The film looks very beautiful on the Widescreen, a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from **
