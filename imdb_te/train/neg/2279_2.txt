Boy what is this mess? But it's only an hour and I've paid a buck for it, and I'm alive ... they're dusting this whole way of the entire 1933 clunker. <br /> <br /> In a small village, their blood begins to turn into irrigation. Local yokes are starting to talk about vampires, and each body is slightly loud after the discovery. The town is sheriff or constable or he plays whatever actor Melvin Douglas and tries to tell them otherwise. He claimed the fact that the two holes of the dead have a big hole on each side of the neck, instead, the locals are just a big vampire bot. Constable insists Vampires do not exist and it should be a human culprit for murders. <br /> <br /> But Melvin is not bothered to anyone. To enter into his sweetheart's pontoons played by Faye Wray. Also in the mix, Dougay Freya lines played the same role in each of his films. He freaked out the towns by catching bats and making his own blood. Lionel Atwill plays the town doctor who is trying to help resolve the seemingly constable crime. And the boy does that he always hangs up as an actor. He is close to Atty in this role. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this case .... The big names are the pinnacle of gino. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> The film is about Frey, he's nicknamed Freaky Town Weirdero, but it's not much more than him. When you find the cause of strange deaths and the special impact that the blood needs. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugoshi did a lot of horror films, but he At least entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> If you're not able to make a good 1930's horror movie, this is the logos.
