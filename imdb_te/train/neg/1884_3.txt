Fragmentary film about some people in Austria during a heatway. This type of image is more often done, and better than anything else. Stories can not really do anything with everyone, from the end of repentance: 'People are cruel'. Ugly meat, an image that goes unnoticed people and really long without making a point ... ultra-realistic? Original ... boring? Indeed. Even the beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save this one! 3/10
