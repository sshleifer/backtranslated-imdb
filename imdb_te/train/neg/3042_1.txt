I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this movie, but one word fits: bizarre. Habby and I do not quite laugh at this really horrible film. We look at each other better "what's up?" Expressions. There is no way to explain this film adequately. The killer tomatoes are funny, but it is just sick. What kind of mind does this produces and puts others in the movie to see others? What kind of mind has innocent children in this weird, whimsical movie and is it appropriate for children? Parents, if you're good, let's see him / her as your children still believe in Santa. Preteens can see it - perhaps "What ...?" Expressions on their faces. If you decide to make this movie on others, you may want to spike their owl. <br /> <br /> There was never a worst movie ever.
