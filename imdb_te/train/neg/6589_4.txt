I'm very afraid that I do not like this movie too. Along with some more savings piles, there is nothing to write about home. <br /> <br /> J-horror has grown well over the last five-and-a-half years, but the pictures with more than one previous record have been repetitive and contain carbon copies. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> It is usually a psychic slasher image. A dead girl has her eyes sewn together with graphical, but immediately promises to start with chilling scenes from a corpse as soon as they open them. <br /> After that, the film is deep down quickly for this film. <br /> I start with the things I like about "Gavi". On the plus side, the visuals are cool and the film is great for its kind. Some of the heart scenes are better executed for those who love their horror movies. <br /> <br /> Some small suspense scenes / set-pieces are also available. <br /> <br /> There are, however, many errors. <br /> First, my main complaint is that this movie, plot skips and a horrifying intensity of going forward and backwards. <br /> <br /> In addition to me, I'm not a problem here, at the same time I am confused by more than one occasion when students are exactly what age. <br /> The performances are okay I guess it's a little harder to tell when you do not know the language), but feel a little stiff. And for a horror film, I do not think it's scary enough. <br /> <br /> When I was a fan of Geo films, I had a lot of expectations from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was very disappointed.
