I have made positive comments about this film, looking forward to watching this film. Wrong wrong. I've seen 950+ images and this is really one of the worst of them - it's almost every way: compilation, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the only song in the film - a lion living tune - less than four times). The film looks cheaper and nasty and is very boring. I am very happy to see a movie end credits rarely. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the only one who has to give this 1-scoring - this is far from his best performance. Katie obsessives only.
