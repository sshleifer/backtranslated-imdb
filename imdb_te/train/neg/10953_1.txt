This scarcity for television is the most horrific piece of television technology to hit. Home mates are subtle, uninteresting, ridiculous, and likely to try to kill them if you have to live with them. As far as I am concerned with the Big Brother, the Western society has a decline, showing a society that causes brain and dead bodies. Is not it the target audience of the community that is the lowest common denominator for television? It's not classified as fun. I think the truth is that the Channel Ten can remove your soul. It was a horrible unfair when Row McManus, a respected comedian, once went to Channel 10. With the exception of The Simpsons, the most intelligently designed.
