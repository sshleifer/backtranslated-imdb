Ad Slaser movie from producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest success, the band said he did not make "real killer films" because he thought little tiles and big monsters had added a fantasy element that made films better - killing each other and making people real and less fun. The band, a good philosophy and genuine shame that could destroy the entire moon studio, damaged full-length movie studios for home film profits, blockbuster's likes to make him right and begin to sacrifice creativity and realities. The team behind it is 'Delta Delta Die!' And 'Nativity Right' - both are equal to the equivalent core values. Debbie Rochen is the usual top form here as a newbie with a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to create a story about a 'murder club'. She - one is obvious - it's not a true story and the silly Ms Rochen does not believe it and now everyone will have to run around to get the blood covered and maybe killing each other or perhaps she does not join and then makes all of the panic sets. There is a choice and this film is yours ... recommended but not completely.
