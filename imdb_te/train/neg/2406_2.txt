Another movie chubby comes from the mind of Harry Alan Towers. Based on H. Ryder Haggard's writing, this is done in Africa based on anything similar to Haggard's authorship (although an African with our dinosaurs - our intrepid adventurers are using their canons), and <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McKinney and John Calgary) are the only ones who have weapons, with only one medal to find treasure. On the way, they choose a French chef with a combination of the most dull monsters, and McCallum has an affair with the Phenicia Queen. <br /> This is an owl, which is very ridiculous. It's the only reason I do not give a 1.
