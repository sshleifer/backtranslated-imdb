Anytime a fan of the original series, or a clue about the storyline, the series must suffer. QB does not come around until Q brings enterprises to Q Gamma, and Kirk's never seen until they meet, NCC-1701 is the first ship to take the enterprise name. ... do I go? Berman and Pillar have joked about the creation of Jenny Roden Berry. When he died, they only saw $$$$ and went their own way. Majel Barrett Star Trek is in every episode until this series. I can not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor bakula. He is a great actor like the whole cast. I love them, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all the previous things created by the original series. Check ratings. Most people viewed Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
