This is a watershed event in my film career. When I came out I went to see it in the theater. I was totally amazed at how bad I was. Such films will make you money and who will be surprised to whom who likes it - too big. The special effects are that of the first grade level, what the first grader might have done. Look for dolls rubber bats, darts that are drawn in the picture without any effort to hide the strings and look like an arrowhead and a ridiculous story that appears on street street. Ed Wood performed artworks compared to "Conquest". Every film student should see this because they find the description of the bad movie.
