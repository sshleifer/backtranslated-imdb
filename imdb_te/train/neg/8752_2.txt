I have seen this film last night and in the end I'm late, I'm pretty happy with the movies. Even though I tried, I could not stand this film, because it continued to be a movie and it was worse and worse. I think it's comedy but I do not see much fun. This is a particularly unrealistic and immense character of rural life. In this case you can be like any country living, it's not sure. I agree that the Guy cast members are some of the most beautiful, but the French person is really a hoax. I agree that there is a good lesson in the story, but none of my recommendations are 8, and it is very painful.
