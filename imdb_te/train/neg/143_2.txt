If you know what was last Friday 13th, when Valery was failing, trying to bring back the teen slaser style through the scary movie and spoofs like sheik. Why are people like Halloween? Because it was original, something new and ever happened to have been beyond. Why did they like the scream? At least it makes sense.

And the moment when the killer is on the screen, it's just a sssssssssssooooooooooooo speculation. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 0
