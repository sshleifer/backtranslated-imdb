There is something frustrating about watching a film like 'Numers by murder' because it is a good movie trying to pop out somewhere inside the Hollywood principle. However, when the credits roll over, it is not saved. Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's Homicide Detective characters are pretty much flown through the crazy film's "Cope Sid" by an awkward sexual affair, the film is much longer. While Bullock is strong in her role, it is not enough to save the poor script and lazy pace. Ben Chaplin's talent was wasted in an unforgettable role (he did in the lowly esteemed 'Birthday Girl year') and Chris Penn, as well as a helpless role for exemplary talents. However, the plot is not really a factor in this film. The only real reasons for the film are the two teenage killers starring Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Their talent and chemistry work is very good and they play well off each other. It is very bad that they are not very good in all the movies. The Barbet Schroder is running a very safe soil route for such a floral filmmaker. Bottom line: If you're an artist's fan, it's worth renting, but it's all over the life that it's never seen, network network excludes favorable commercial breaks.
