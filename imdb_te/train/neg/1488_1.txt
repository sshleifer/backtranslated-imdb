I got a registration for IMDb to comment on how painful the film was ... the better story than my cats and the ball of the string. I'm not the worst act I've ever seen, but when you wipe almost the entire cast in 5 minutes, it leaves the desirable bit. There is a 'scary' moment in the film, except when they see the 'Halloween' movie on TV. For all this, it's a good story and I can not recognize her as she is in Chasey's lane, moving the credits and feeling that I'm lost before the scene ends. 'Oh, he is there,' she said. I'm very happy to see this hotel and I have paid one percent to see it, I'm a real tickey. I can find a ransom factor that I usually like or at least one image, but this is an exception. It's very promising-good - it's bad that it's not bad ... it's just bad.
