After listening to the film for years, I finally decided to rent it. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the rental is free from the local library. This action is slow, boring, dubious and the plot makes no sense. Two hours later, I was back in the Texas town and pulled out a group of those characters out of their troubles. I realized that the taste is a source of confidence, but believe me, I heard about this film. Dallas gave a good deal of life in Texas. Rent it only if you want to understand how much money can be paid to movie studios reviewers to convince the general public that the bad movie is good.
