"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. <br /> <br /> Many people viewed it as "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it absolutely clear; <br /> <br /> Even though the vendors lost it, he actually became a BAD director and created terrible, weak and surface stories and scenes. <br /> "When you lose it" comes to every director, but the vendors' case is intense. <br /> <br /> He has forgotten everything he knows about the film and has repeatedly started again. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the film does not have time for you.
