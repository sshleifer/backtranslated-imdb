The film is another Christian promotional film in the Omega Code. It's not necessarily bad but for the fact that most promotional images sacrifice honesty and realism for the message they want to offer. You can change the life of a stereo and life of the streets in the streets, perhaps you can enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and take a cross and switch blade or mission rent. When do Christian directors sometimes say bad words? This is not true (criminals say bad words?) And disappointed to see criminals that I did not really have to relate to flat roles. Similarly, if the movie shows some T & A, it's great. Now I want to pay to see. Who is Blackhead, a similar to that of the Communion layer-narrative story of The Bondock Saints and The Sting?
