When I saw the name of this film, it was always a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It's not. It was a pudding, the kitchen hit the roof, and cooked off and was transfixed together. <br /> <br /> It is the eldest of his three daughters, who tells a young child growing up Barbara Stanwick, which should save his family name. <br /> <br /> We thought this was a historic international story. And it's been a while. The story changes in Stanwick's struggle, then struggling with advocate George Brent. Why is she set dead against him? Well why When we learned in a strange flashback sequence that Stanwick commented, she once thought she could make some money (for her sisters and her) to marry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone who has their child and eight young people are considered to be during the main plot. , Well - you know, ... they got married very quickly and in a very short time they were together, he emerged. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters was in love with Gig, Young, who played Gig Young. Another sister tries to take him away. <br /> It's a saffron, tremendous mess - without a multiplication of logic or ability to work well.
