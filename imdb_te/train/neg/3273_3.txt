The Dukes of Hazzard A downmarket 25-year old TV program is a $ 53m picture worse than any episode. The plot may work adequately, but the vacuum is very rare and the cast is much worse: Johnny Knoxville's main character, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Rossko is a bland thug, Michael Weston's Enos Tiresome, a seemingly ideally-cast Willy Nelson is just waiting for a clear check and Burt Reynolds, bass hogg is harder at some purgatory where he is doomed to relive his old movies with a bit player, An interesting option but a heckler and a hundred dollar bill is a good moment Has Did you know that the movie was difficult for you when Sean William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the most captivating screen presentations? Jey Chandrashekhar's hopeless direction: The seemingly comic timing could not be done with less than two shots and seemingly more clueless than in the film. Stunt, in the film, decided to portray any signals in his life before filming them. Each episode has a few post-modern movements around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotypical role, but Hall Shading makes you pine on the day (and badly) directing, this is a good thing.
