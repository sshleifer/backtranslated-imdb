Yes, this movie is a real thief. Another battle hero image to boost the acceptance for wars from the USA (support?) Is because it stole some shiny Oscars from the Avatar. I do not really think I should go into politics, but it's coming, it's clear than the summer sky. Hurt Locker does not really have anything unusual, true plot at all. I really feel in Hungary's 50s when people really like what people like and do not like. The same promotional films were produced at that time, only black and white with exception. Even though we take this title into considerable part of the "US Wars Good" style, you must have better movies to choose from.
