I can not believe how illiterate this film is. It's like watching the police academy, it's a stupid robot that is considered a sidekick, except for people who have no clue what they are talking about, and ... wait. I understand the suspension of disbelief, but this is just full of stupidity. There is no plot for this movie. It is like looking at a doctor who is a doctor, discard non-medical terms as the chief of staff of a large medical facility. Plus people are wearing clothes that are un-fit for a space program. I feel like watching a valley-girls "B" movie in space.
