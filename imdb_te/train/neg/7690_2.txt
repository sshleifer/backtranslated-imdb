Anyone who gives a good review to this film must have something to do with it clearly. This film is a painful suckfest. The acting is tight, the stock generic soundtrack is ridiculous, curious to all in the direction and in all, the teacher is not really that attractive (making the student's blatant development more embarrassing). The creative minds behind this trash are to get out and spread to prevent more demonstrations such as centered crapptitude. I'm sure some of the hungry children in Africa can use the money lost in this project. Hell and funding also have a much better advantage of fuel for crack-slavery; At least someone gets some fun from it. Because it does not give me the ultimate illness, I will give both the film.
