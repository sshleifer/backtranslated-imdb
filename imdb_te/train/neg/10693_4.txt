Maybe it's dubbing, or it's the endless scenes of people like shouting, barking or walking, but Europa '51 was one of the many hobbies I've seen so far and I recognize it as one of the most annoying films. As Mom Ingrid Bergman's son is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat (Sandro Franchise), the film starts out promisingly. Mommy and Daddy (Blonde Alexander Knox) ​​will attend their party feast, the young man tries to kill himself, and changes throughout the lifespan of Bergman spending time on the poor and needy. Through Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Jiannini), she soon spent less time with her husband, who immediately hits her in a mad shelter for her troubles. Bergman portrays his role as a zone of arc, portraying the role of saint in silver, and Rosselli illuminated her awesome work and demonstrated her best effect. Unfortunately, Andrea and her mother were hiding the Marxist and Christian merits, the script ham-fisted its center of subtlety. By the last tear soaked scene, I made these tiresome characters more than my fill. After realizing that neo-realism was a real step for Rosselli and buried the flowers and mystical themes of the 1950s flowers.
