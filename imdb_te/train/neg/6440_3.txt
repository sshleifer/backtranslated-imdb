It's one of the worst WrestleMania I've ever seen. It really does stand out at all, really. I thought it was pretty good by card, but each match looked just short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP is one of the better matches. Benoit took over. I did not think MVP was so great, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys are not a mixture. Or it is not Khali and any other person alive. <br /> <br /> Melville vs. Ashley I am not a female wrestler fan. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs The New Breed I'm glad about this match. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr Kennedy vs Finlay vs. Randy Orton has so far played the worst MITB match. For a lot of people in the ring at the same time, just let down a big. It just did not live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker might be the best match this night. Good to see something good for change. <br /> <br /> I think John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels has qualified for this match. People make a case for Batista vs Undertaker, but this match is fine. I'm sick of seeing Cena win every match though. It's getting a little older. Now, I say, I think the match is best for the night, but I'm a huge Shawn Michaels fan, so I'm with a small bias. Batista vs. 'The talker may be good, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches at night and everything else really came out short.
