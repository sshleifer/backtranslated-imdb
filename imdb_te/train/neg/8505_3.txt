"Semana Santa" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak image. Mira Sorvino plays a detective character, who finds a killer that shoots the arrows at people. Meera has an Italian accent which reduces it from time to time. Did she speak in English? All other characters have a forced Mexican \ English pronunciation. The conversation is too bad and its distribution is wood. Cinematography looks nice, but this trip is not enough to save. This next part of this review includes spaniers !!!! <br /> <br /> The villain seems to be flying away during the climax, but he returns to the stairs and stunts on the stairs and makes a cool stunt. It just shows this script has no realism. Avoid!
