It is not even worth looking at the spoiler's rubble about 'all'. Letters are less visible by the poorly written storyline and are a low quality concept for the product. It's very clear for the TV and if it appears on my television, I'll straight it down. An alright job for kids in the movie, yet the role of adults is unbelievable and so the film really failed to draw you in. This film is the original brilliant and really made Annie's shine does not make music / dance numbers We all love it. Johnson, Anne is sometimes as troubled and starring. You can not convince her that she really is everything. The difference of the character has shaken me throughout the cinematic period. It's sad to say that this sequel is a whole flap.
