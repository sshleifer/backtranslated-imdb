This film is really terrifying, and Ben's play-candy-candy can be made for everything that is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The author / director / producer / principal actor is perhaps the best idea for dealing with important issues in gay marriage, family consent, religion, homosexuality, hate crimes and every other topic that affects a homosexual at this time <br> /> <br /> The script is very poor, very simple, but dialogue and acting are just painful. Homo-hatred's brother has been played as the most prolific actor and the chemistry is not perfect between the two main actors (I've seen more of a favorite in a corn flakes statement). The acting was tight, and the dialogue was forced (the sight of the brother detective to his detective was highlighted). <br /> <br /> If any creator of this train ruin is dispersed by any other garbage back and thinking about doing so, I would advise - do not do it.
