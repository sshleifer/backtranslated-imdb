Style but substance. It's never funny. <br /> <br /> It is one of the films in the style of filmmaking. Dragonfly, a convent 60 sci-fi film, is a young artist named Kodenem. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davis is an angry Riden filmmaker. He is not an artist hack. The film he wants to make is his life's diary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Davis All the characters outside the filmmaker are rice-paper. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters have been introduced as a comedian, such as his father, Doppelenger, or Jason Schwarzmann. This is comparable to other images about stardust memory or 8 1/2 filmmakers. Those films are good, provoking with well-developed characters. There are lessons that apply outside those movies <br /> <br /> This film is not a funny scene, it's a comic and campy, but its just a derivative. Movie producers describe it as sending it but what is a satirical target? Actors say it's a tribute but I'll do a full-length version of the codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is surprised to see what the visual imagination of science fiction looks like. Inside an image. <br /> <br /> Outside the science fiction film is just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker already chooses the science fiction weapon after the selection. <br /> He has a scene, because critics are critically acclaimed about the lack of a story, a lack of a point, he sees an empty scene blank, <br /> <br /> Your Roman coppola does not know what you say and nothing He thinks he will end up talking. <br /> <br /> If I had an option at Circuit City, I would see on the full wall of TVs.
