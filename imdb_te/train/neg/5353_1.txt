<br /> <br /> I have a special privilege to attend a special screening of 'The Assass of Light' at the horror meeting in Ohio. <br /> When the director introduces the film, "Let's keep in mind, we do not have much money ..." Budget movies are not bad, but when the filmmaker used it without a need, the results were always weak. And there is no better example than this vague sleep-fest. <br /> <br /> Actually, the 'Abomination of Light' is the world's first underground cinema: It's the only time I've ever dreamed of having a dream-art in artistic craftsmanship. Attractive actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Regby Banister randomly entered, exit and proved that every bit is an aspiring number of enthusiasts. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's too dull, you will not ignore anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and walked out of the theater. Surprisingly, there are a lot of attendees cast. <br /> <br /> Any enthusiastic genre fans are doing well to avoid this subject. With a little luck, the film does not always see "light".
