First, before reading, I have to understand that I am not a neo-Nazi, and I try to understand Hitler correctly. The series and found it awful. I mean, okay, look curious, but true? I searched for answers and found one: not sure. First, Hitler was not angry at all for his life, the series shows Hitler, who was angry, even when he was still young. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, Hitler actually became a gay man and struggled to infiltrate his life into this mystery. Third, people hate me, but this is true: Hitler is beautiful. How would he feel that if he was so hated and ugly, he could come to power? Because he is beautiful. <br /> If you think Hitler is just angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not pretty, you're wrong. If you think, people you love him do not allow countries to take power and you do not like it. If Hitler understands how he came to power, think he is just terrible, you have to be dangerous politicians like him (in fact, remember he is elected) and be able to stop the theme before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is crucial, this series is just as terrible to show us the truth, if we continue looking like that in Hitler, it happens as another way.
