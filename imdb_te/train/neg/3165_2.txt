This film is terrible. I think it's good with all the actors, that's fine. Do not waste your time. Eva Landoria Parker is awful. Her desperate housewives must obey. Paul Rude is becoming a B actor. I can never tell your girl the mess in the film is the essence of what I have said. And in the lake hour she needs beautiful but definitely requires some more acting lessons. Reese is like a heaven with Witherspoon ... it's good for a tad. Or any other ghost film. You are grateful that you can not waste your precious time. PS I love you a good beyond the grave romance too! Start looking at images from 10 to 7 and listen to the people already seen.
