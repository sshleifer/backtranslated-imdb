A trooper is on the road (everyone's doing his job) to adhere to the speed limit; He pulls a woman who looks like a mother (in the back seat has a baby); He was wrong and BAM was telling her ... they get killed. Okay, the good film I personally thought of was a good film. I'm with some friends when I see the movie in the theater. We started our first night after the summer, so we want to see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that the band looked good to everyone ... this is one of the biggest mistakes in my life. I did not waste $ 7.oo on the movie ticket, but I sat through the mental harassment for the brain. The film began with mystery and suspense and I felt very bad that "this bad thing is bad" ... I'm very wrong. The whole issue with this film is that it does not mean; If you can do bad acting, the "very horrific" storyline and the movie is in all terrible chaos, you are still unsure. This is not because you are not right to understand, no human being can understand this stupid image. Now you may be thinking of "Oh man", if you are as bad as you say this picture. "Get out of your head now! I'm trying to save you from trying to save this movie, but it does not even think of it ... People do not think that these errors will have the same mistakes ... That's not. I'll give it to 1), and I would recommend anyone to see this movie Yaledu, the film is about you w.t.f. many sleepless nights.
