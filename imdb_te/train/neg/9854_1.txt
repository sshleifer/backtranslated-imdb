The perfect example is that people who are so ridiculous about this documentary (or macimental) say they are full of enthusiasm. Honestly, I hate cryptosocial. It's a conscience, it just destroys. Nevertheless, the positive effects on this topic (the dragons are beautiful), but the information in this macrometer is completely counterfeit and it's really disappointing because it's really coming from scientists, so it's 10 and not 0. 1 is an example of misinformation: hydrogen idea: According to chemistry, hydrogen is produced by hydrogen but it is ratios Ilo is impossible, so in that case, you really have a good explanation about what happened to the stomach of a dragon. In nature there are a lot of hydrogen materials but the fly requires an animal that is firmly like that, and the hydrogen will not disappear from nothing, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is something worse, platinum idea: this element is more difficult than gold, and I can not explain how the dragons depend on that. It's ridiculous, they show dragons where the creatures are less likely to cross the monsters, but explain why they are extinct. Perhaps cryptographers are called scientists, but they are not. Some people like the mockumentary are lying, and some people who are worse buy them. But I believe when someone who asks about science thinks this idea in Dragons. Those fake scientists waste their time.
