The "incubus" is good (an interesting murder mystery), bad (a disconnected script, a sloping resolution, a severely aggressive scenario) and unnatural (strong incestuous references, a strange sleepy and hard work by John Casabettes) - that character is really "wacko" mean?). It is not very popular, but not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
