I have seen this piece of work at a Film Fest in CA. My God, what is the director thinking? The film professors use this movie as a case study on what can not do when doing a small movie. First off, this project certainly makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The film is partially "The Wastation", where there is some stupid vapid bar in the middle, nothing really happens. In fact, I felt very ridiculous. Main actress Julia Reading is one step under acting in most amateur porn films. Jacob and Fenner have one or two best performances, including those played by the characters, but the director does not have any clue how to work or use his performance. The only thing worse than acting is the conversation, which is irrelevant on the border. <br /> <br /> The author of the audition for the comic book villain (the director of whom I guess) writes every role. <br /> <br /> The whole product value is beautiful and it is easy to watch carefully. Product design is pretty good, while the Waystation looks no ordinary bar. The costumes and make-up are OK, and I mean the product is working with a low budget. <br /> As I said, the film is a terrifying god. It has seen a lot of director / writer sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked in a blender and accompanied it. My only hope is that he only used the money of others, because if he had his own use, he was totally succinct.
