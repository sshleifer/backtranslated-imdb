The book based on the film has changed my life seriously. But speaking of this film is a simple description of discouragement. Acting, directing, cinematography and storyline are all terrible. I will never recommend this movie to anyone. I have told countless people about the book but I tell them all about the movie now! I did not expect the book to be properly booked, but they left most of the key elements in the book. The film tried to provide a powerful and inspirational message, but failed, and suppressed the central theme of Prophecy. While driving me in a position that does not read the book, Selasstein practices hacks backs B.S. I was totally disappointed with Redfield for the film that made this film.
