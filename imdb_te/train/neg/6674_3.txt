The film is to be drafted as director Eduardo Sanchez, who has been credited with the well-known and successful Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Previously, this type of aliens, Stephen King's Dream Cockers, was one of the most critically acclaimed movies, but I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, the waste of time changed, so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always guaranteed, and mutated are not different. It tells the story of a bunch of men who experienced strange encounters when they are young, and as usual, others take you into stuff that imagines a Nutcis. <br /> <br /> "You gave a chance for vengeance?" That is, you can successfully manage and drive, and one alive What do you do? For this group, it's a happy restoration time, or they thought that the movie begins with a laughing, bad, unbearable conversation, and even worse acting.Even if it's a low budget, there are not many redesign factors It can not be a source of strength for the story or their characters from the cast can not help any of the tad interesting. <br /> <br /> This is a standard cardboard charge of the vanilla plain script, which contains some less intimidating strategies. I will spoil because many attempts to make some stuff I did not say Yabaddayi. <br /> <br /> I do not see never before, there was not anything, it is a simple square Special Special, blood, and there are moves to the crypt. The town compared to the other monster movie - dinner, a little fun, and it takes very seriously. An uninspiring direction edged by, you've warned.
