* Many spoilers in this review * This movie is terrible. I was a huge baseball fan and I wanted to see, I was disappointed. It started ok .. when I saw that DeNiro had his youngest son with bad effect, I was hoping he wanted to be a good father throughout the film or something. Nevertheless, initially it seemed like a Dinero role. He is the only person who believes in Bobby, and his adorable son is that he is losing control, which causes him to feel bad. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Pramom, and at any time he killed Pramoni as a innocent ... "I want you ****!" <br /> <br /> Then, when Dinoiro saved Bobby's son from sinking, he hoped that the film could take herself. If he saved Bobby's son he could forgive Primoni's killing. But he gets credit for killing and he will do so by stealing Bobby's son, car, and dog as captive, because Bobby just kills the home run <br /> <br /> Now we are totally involved in the realistic scene ... It is hell We believe that the game is not called. Then Dinero appeared in an umpire's suit and disappeared, calling Bobby at home, cutting out his sword and cutting everyone who runs into the field. There are no bosses on the ground (but the police are on their way), so Denizo steps on the mound and he gets ready to pitch Bobby a knife when Bobby comes to death. <br /> <br /> Because Bobby finds his son, this delightful and pleasant movie is very pleasant. <br /> This is not a sporting image. It's not about the fan. As far as I know, fans are not on the mental illnesses that threaten their swords, loot, and throw away the swords. This is a sick picture I see in my life. The plot is poor, the soundtrack sucks, the film has no purpose. I warn you not to waste your time to get this frustrating for the movie.
