As a fan of science fiction movies, I learned about The Matrix since its release in 1999. To some extent I let people tell me about it, I thought it was very original and sophisticated. I was a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. When I was released Matrix was never able to see what I missed. With the release of The Matrix Reloaded, it's time to buy and watch the DVD. <br /> The disappointment is great. The matrix of the matrix (the controlling device opposing the movie) is intelligent. The philosophical premise of the parallel worlds, the alternative factory shop. Nevertheless, I was able to buy it as science-fiction in this movie and if it stands firmly in that movie. Unfortunately, this has become a standard, "they or they can not escape, break down, save those who need rescue." To make things worse, it has become another martial arts exercise. The problem is science-fiction and martial arts movies really two different types. Pure, one or the other devotee, both do not work. This is like giving love to science. <br /> You can not have one or the other in the same image or in the same picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Matrix Reloaded really combines problems. At least thirty minutes of film martial arts scenes or long run car chases. (Every professional, neglected question of this observation film: Neo Superman can do the job, why is it bothering to fight? This answer is, in fact, a young and male population group theater.) Then there is a "freed by love". A hundred years ago, Richard Wagner wore the plot. <br /> <br /> In this way, the Matrix Reloaded has given up. Marshall Arts fans are commonly brutalized, but philosophizing arcane science. Fans of science fiction wondering why they were sitting by a kung-fun fest. <br /> <br /> If you see The Matrix Franchise Films: Science Fiction, Marshall, what would you like to get for your bucks? Arts, or soap opera? None of them is not for each, not for a satisfying image for everyone.
