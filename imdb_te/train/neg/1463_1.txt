<br /> You can not imagine a true Hitler campaign and speech as Carlyle played the role of the film, in which he played Carlle. <br /> <br /> No one is disappointed, unemployed <br /> <br /> It is just a campaign of Hollywood cardboard. Disguised as "true history". <br /> <br /> If we have a sausage, can Hitler win a lot of people? Why did people die in him? By portraying him as a loser, they do not want their own film to be completely reliable. The film is one of the most important figures of the last century in a mix of old WW2 campaigns and MTV urban myths. Think of the movie about Churchill, which shows only 90 minutes of drinking as a director. <br /> <br /> I am surprised how this film is insulting and they can talk to an actor like Carlisle as this actor.
