So 'fine' ... Yep .. This is Steven Bachman (who reads Steven King) about a man who has just got his desserts from a Gypsy Elder who killed him, no doubt about it, but I'm far more than I have santosincalenu. I guess I am really distracted by the actors. I mean, who is the leadership? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And cry out loud, please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for each Italian Mafioso role there? And when we are at it, does not every Mafioso have a pasta cooking Italian mother? Michael Constantine, Gypsy is in the top 10 pawns decoration. He is pretty good. But the rest, I'm all about "good actors ..."
