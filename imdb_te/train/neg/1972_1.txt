It really does not do the blues justice. It starts badly with pictures by telling the life stories of the various blues musicians (and) from the outside site of the Vioizer probe and the Blind Willie McTell (or Blind Lemann Jefferson someone) Blind Willie McTell (anyway Blind GameSern? Someone Blind Away). As a result, the most attractive part of this documentary can be found. The only thing to look after is the acting, mouthing of the classic tunes painted by the fake 20 black and white intercut, such as Rape Beck and Shemkiah Kopeland. This is a good tool to show us why these old blues metropolines are really great, but it does not make for a comprehensive view. The film is not a radio drama, but it is not just a film. No one should be forced to look at what this badly done. It is a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially Blues. Avoid all costs.
