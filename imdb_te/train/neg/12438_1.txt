Beating the bad guys ... Again the tag line for this image, which reveals the truth about it. <br /> Home one and two, the classic of the film. Three and four in the home, a good movie if you're three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, it's hard to try it funny, it's not. Culkin replaced Alex de 'Linz or something. He is a very polished actor with bland performances, but not entirely his fault, for writing Blonde vocabulary and Blonde feelings. Pranks copy from scratch with the first two distinct crooks, and you'd be crazy to think that chicken pokes are real. If you are a preschool teacher, this movie shows on a rainy day. And to make things worse, a completely different cast, if you do not believe me, but you regret it.
