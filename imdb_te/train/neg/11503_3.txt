Quentin Crisp once described things as beautiful, a romantic saying. When things are not intimidated, they are realistic. And when something gets treated, they're spot. Unfortunately, Leon d'Aronova, he falls into the second category. The director apparently tried hard to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" film, which grabbed comedy, and was unable to get the warmth between the loop films from the 'discouraging' ones. Los Lunes All Soul, just disheartening. Things are untrue terrible. The final movements of the characters reach all of the same climax, and if the Glam Story does not fit, Aaron will wash the story with a wheat and horror palette. These films are ridiculous at Goas. A film that shows the population of the weak in society, in this case unemployed harbor workers will not automatically make a good film, even though I am the first person to sympathize with these people's luck. The film will boast of their fate. In the 21st century in Spain, unemployed people are not beggars, and public transport boats have good rest rooms, so many punters and difficult to encounter it are difficult to have. Leon d'Aranoo is not clear about the Spanish workers. The only solution I can make is perfect. The scene where men watch a football match for free is directly copied directly from a more realistic picture of the "paternity" trap "completely belter", which is more aggressive, humorous, and sad.
