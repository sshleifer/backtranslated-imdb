'Anita and a' play about your 'multi-ethnic Britain', which is titled 'East is East', rather than 'Bend It Like Beckham'. The sound is a cherished chair (despite the Black Country tones), but the film is' east ozone, which appears to be slim and smooth. Furthermore, filming the film's relationship is not deep enough to justify the constructive approach around the film, between an Asian girl and her white friends. I'm also tired of being the author of films that have been a writer for over a years, and naturally the authors of the story are natural, but the latest in the fictional story. 'East East' is fun and sharp; 'Anita and your' is clear and dull in comparison.
