The film did not describe how disappointing it was. It's a series of random, unfunny clips for a person to get it with an old dead woman (really upset) from a stupid Batman spoof. The only thing remotely entertaining about the underground comedy movie is the best actor Joe Bettofo. Also, it will rate NC-17, eliminating only those who can cope with it.
