It's very sad. Though it is filmed with the film, it is a little bit more than flames like blood lakes. They are playing this music and I've always heard the ridiculous thing. I loved brother and sister in this film. They say, "My friends are so jealous!" And they are suffering from the sound of the eruption. Hey, who first wore his mask with a killer? Thats Retarded! I did not take that second half practically. The sound effect they use when the killer ax is used is my favorite part of the film. The same exact sound for each chop!
