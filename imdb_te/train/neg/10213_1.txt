Many people seemed to like this movie, so I feel bad to give a bad review. But after 96 minutes, I feel like doing that. Heck Where's the plot in this movie? I missed, I waited for the storyline and nothing happened. The end is definitely "somewhat shocking" but they do not build it. Who has forgotten who I was in the half time, so they really do not develop the characters. Acting a lot, so it's incredibly time-consuming, but I've been able to see it over time. So ... without giving away anything, if you do not like the actors in the film, there is no reason to see this movie. I made a mistake, but why did not you understand why or why it's so little. I can not decide what this is, so the judge will tell you. <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel really high, and I'm with my vote above.
