This kind of films are literally dozens of them every year. Fortunately for the use only one the theater release is given, the others go straight to video or TV, like this film. <br /> <br /> The first issue of this film is really realism. It is one of those movies that use a hard but troubled person "die hard" formula being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, the character played by Casper van Deen, is working for a security company that is fully testing security systems for companies and individuals. In this case he is sending a cruise ship, which should get hijacked. You can see a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One", and the film did not attempt to conceal that these two films were probably the biggest source of 'inspiration'. So really, you can not imagine all of this original original. It uses all the clocks in the book and the movie is something similar or something remotely resembles something original. <br /> <br /> If you want from a similar film, very weak script. Or say, it has a very thick work. As I mentioned earlier, the film is not originally original but the real story also has some elements, it is rare and silly fun is ridiculous. I mean, only 8 people have driven a big port, some of which only take small guns, and for 10 million dollars a ransom, a ship that is worth only 10 times, are too scandalous. How do you feel that they are split after that money? Earning just one million or more per person? It is very profitable for such big and dangerous responsibility. And then the passengers are in the possession of the hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the passengers to take control of the huge ship and he will not be able to hold on to the right, looking at them, manage his pistol, put them in a room with only one person. You will see only 30 prisoners, but they are at that time. Even though Van Dean's character is looking for his son and vice versa, they have a room to walk on a big cruise ship, they always penetrate each other instantly. <br /> <br /> There are only some examples of lazy writing in the film. <br /> This is an action movie. But again, if this film has no good action then it's not. Although the actors' Halve have never had weapons before, the film is filled with some subtle slow motion. <br /> <br /> I would say Casper van Dean is not really a bad action hero and actor, but this film also does not have the best actors. Very genre and the B-movie circuit concerns. However he suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; No matter how old, he always persuades to play the father of a young man. Although Van Duyen has started as a good new young actor, acting in these movies does not really help much in his career. He did not really give the right opportunity to display it, although he probably was good. Other actors are also a good job, but their characters are quite simple, they are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh well, it's not the worst genre I've ever seen, <br /> <br /> The original or memorable. <br /> <br />
