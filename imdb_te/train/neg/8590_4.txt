It's ridiculous. Angelic turns 9-year-old Annakin Amidala, whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who appears to be impressive with his senior for 5 years. Now 22-year-old Jade warrior hero Anakin has a bad dream, so he kills children, his friends and the whole frame of his existence, because a silly old man convinces him.) His valuable wife may really die, and b) he can prevent this. <br /> <br /> I feel that people who love this movie do not care. The story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Obi-van Kennobie" is a clever and kind anchor for the whole series, but Climax, he hacks Anakin's legs, burns him in a lava and hurts him. Do not think that someone is a bit of that character? <br /> <br /> "There is no one here. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, CGI beautifully good.
