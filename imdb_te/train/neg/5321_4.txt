Artificially artificially a singular intrusive humor trying to marry the then-cutting edge rock 'n' roll explosion with a suburban sitcom's mid-range sensitivities. As a result, none of the viewers who went for music were not satisfied, but at least their parents were placed. Video release should give some idea of ​​the back content. Tom Evelel is a drunken agent, overly capable of playing the game, and you "hi honey, I'm home!" The book called him "So funny in the 7 year it". It is almost like a pretext. Which other film was actually sold out as one of the leading players in one of the best? It reads "So funny in the 7 year experience ..." but he was worse in this regard. <br /> <br /> Monsfield is a beautiful girl with 50-inch assets, unfortunately, a bargain basement Marrow with all acting ability and a rotten Hodack's comic timing. Her wooden delivery, combined with Evel's OTT double-tap, makes comedy sharing from this hell. For her part, she gave us the sale: "[Jane Mansfield] is due to the film's biggest laugh for its obvious talent!" Selling next to a big breast that you can say is that you can see it. This "humor" is that many men are literally falling behind, their glasses cracked on Mansfield's site, etc. The Freudian nightmare of the milk bottle is only suspected of its "Uu" certificate. <br /> <br /> In musical terms, most of the players were selected by adenine. Do you really see Edy Fontaine offer? "Do you love your eyes, love your lips, they taste better than potato chips" in the song "Cool It, Baby"? Though he was forced to sing some of his favorite songs in a four-minute sequence, the incendiary Richard Morko left. And all the activities sing without a single microphone? Technically, this image has special effects (including a ghostly Julie London and Deluxe colors), originally with its reds, blood and duplicated-looking meat tones, which is a colorful image). However, directing is not the best, the sound quality is also very low. <br /> It is very old. Men were still wearing the screen, the cute child actors made adult comments and black people only cooked and danced. (All this happened). Some of the more it's hot, the African Queen, Ben Hur, and many still stand as examples of the happy future of the day, so the argument "good at the time" does not really stand out. The Girl Can not Help in Its Heart This is a cynical and promotional venture that does not have close inspection. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
