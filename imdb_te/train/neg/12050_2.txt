I have read some good reviews of this movie, and I was surprised at how terrible the whole thing was. It can never do what you think this film should be like some cross between an AIDS-related story and some "Ghost" / "Blit Spirit" story. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship. Mark HIV + and he and Simon do not seem to have sex life anymore. When Mark died, Simon - a habit of closing his emotions after his father refused years by - tries to wipe out his memory and get on with just a bachelor. His behavior before Mark's death was not very different. <br /> When Simon arrives to Simon to open his own selfish feelings, he returns in spiritually and Mark returns. Most image. By the time he becomes more and more sympathetic, it is too late to care. Marc, on the other hand, demi Moore's footsteps from "Ghost" is getting worse on the subject. <br /> <br /> Marc Returns has a hideous switch in the tone afterwards. Suddenly we found some lagging attempts ridiculous, a la the TV show "Bewitched." But it will not last long. While Simone's emotional health stakes, the whole thing is growing with your effort to remain vigilant. Finally, with a golden-coated muscle-boy angel guiding the tearful mark with heaven, the punctual and sorrowful Simon waves may be good, because it is not intentionally funny.
