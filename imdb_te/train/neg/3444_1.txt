It's the worst movie ever seen. From the plot, shots, "special effects", acting, and I mention the plot? <br /> <br /> I am trying to explain what the creator is; This is supposed to be one of those films that you can not really tell what is going to happen until the end of hell. The movie will end when you are dead and who you are alive and who you're reading and when you're reading, you're right when you're reading, and when you learn that the film ends - the next 5 minutes! <br /> <br /> But, Olga Lewens, this junk writer, yes, Olga ?? "Unbreakable" or "The Job" is some of the scenes for writer, director, producer, screenwriter, castor, production designer, art director, costume designer and one of the characters ... It is basically a female movie and when it comes to Olga Lewens " Levens Productions "You might not be wrong :-) <br /> <br /> This may come as shocker but" this time "this big time over Olga, the scene from the scene Sham jumping, from dreams to reality ... but wait! It all dreams after all ... or is it ??? The film fades and I realized that none of this happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... the fact is the ship ... do not wait! The ship is again, and the boys! They're alive! Thanks to God! No they're calling her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears so they're dead after all ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand that you like this movie - otherwise it's the boring piece of work and the only reason I have set through this whole trash is how hell they can look at this image ... <br /> <br / > Do not look at this if you are worth the time, ever 90 minutes there are a waste of this case ...
