For a few months I heard about this small movie and now I see it. I'm looking forward to making their own joke campus of an image, combining beautiful and creative ideas with all the wings of many wing directors. The forces, Swingblade, have come to mind a million Blair Witch paradigms. If the directors want to get inside the Hollywood door, they are doing the right thing, because they are plotting how the Hollywood films are created by plotting the plot. You've heard this phrase many times, "It's an animal house come to back to the future"; "It meets the Wall Street Dead Poits Society"; Or "Shakespeare in Love meets Stars Wars"? I remind you that the independent films are genuine and are not brave and unexpected.
