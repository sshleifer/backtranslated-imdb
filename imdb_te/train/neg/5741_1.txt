<br /> <br /> When I see a big-time horror / sci-fi fan, but countless horror movies on cable and videos regardless of budget, it is the worst of all the movies. People with bloody special effects (seen in baked blood or ketchup on ketchup) and people running around the thrown from the left, then right again and again. It was initially a view of the Convenience Store and stayed there for 15 minutes. Instead, it will be pulled from time to time. There is too much x5 low budget. Many scenes are way too long. The junior at the height of the story is very alert to the hero as a random person speaks. Although I have a budget over Manaus, Red Zone Cuba, Benji, and Godzilla vs. Megalon, my view is limited. Try to stay awake by 10 sleeves, a set or a whole enhanced image, be like a mammoth brain eating mug. The-did-i-ever-ever-sea-piece-off-zombie-dong blues. Unfortunately bad movies etc. -infinity / 10
