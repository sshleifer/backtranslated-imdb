I got the question of those who thought about this idea. Why? What did they do to make this second film? Memorial service, Cinderella ends, "they're all happy," I'm pretty sure I did, or as it was suggested. Wait a minute, if they're happy after all, how will the sequel be? Until they are trying to make the most boring story in history, there is not a sequel. I mean, they can sing Cinderella for two hours nonsense, but why? "Happy moments" is not a sequel to the unfolding movie; Then they will not live happily! Something that leads to problems with the first end is wrong! Why? It's not right, it's bad. My last word on this topic.
