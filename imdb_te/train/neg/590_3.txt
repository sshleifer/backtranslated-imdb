I was sadly disappointed with the film because it was not enough to make a pretty weak effort in the horror films and the characters in horror films. The basic idea of ​​the film is interesting but unfortunately it is not exciting, really intimidate or surprising me - I thought it was brutal in the whole movie but it did not even redeem. I really liked Kate's role because at the end of the movie I thought it was soft and soft, and the character of Jeremy Sheffield was not necessarily the film, and I had a solo effort to the part of director / writer Kate, and dropped out of the characters , It might be working - Jeremy's performance was insignificant to say very little and I felt uncomfortable looking at the evil chemistry - or lack of it. How insulting it is. Disappointed.
