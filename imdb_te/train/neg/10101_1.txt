If I gave the option I gave this star 1, I gave this zero. I put this DVD on my TV and sat down on my couch and looked forward to some of the worst pictures I'd say was the best of it. I saw this movie in the IMDb and I saw that it was a bad movie because I guess I had criticized every mistake. But it did not prepare me for the trash that springs out of my television screen. <br /> <br /> The box looks good in this movie. Do not help me. The film should be banned from all the shelves around the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe the film is like a romance, but it does not have any sex scenes. Acting (you can call it), "plot" (most holes should be like a Swiss cheese), and special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please tell me I can not do a better movie, but I think.
