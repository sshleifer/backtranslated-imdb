This is a very silly and less visible image about slavery in the West Indies and it plays Puddy from the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton was filmed for the first time in the film, and he was noticeable thin here. Oliver Reed earned the top billing but he was rare in the film. Warburton plays the role of a white slave and pleaded with him for his funny funny and all because of sexual intimidation wives who are sexually abused. Bhutan Kit is the owner of Bourdale and they have a lot of nudity in the film. If there are no alcoholic bodies at Bordello, then they turn to the young men with him. Then there was slavery rebellion and bloody stand off. The film is the original political message like "burn" but another tool to move the story along with another storyline. Surprisingly they did the sequel and Warburton and the rest of the cast back! This film was the first thing I had to do because I paid a lot of dough. Nudity keeps watch on it and makes no sense of amusing at Warburton's absence at times. Too bad image but accept I want to see the sequel.
