Most of the actors / actresses who starred in this project, they were humiliated in the film so they thought they were worse than if they were ignorant .The main problem is that this film is clearly a concept that just appeal to baby boomers .20 or 30 years NBC probably makes a film like this about the early 90s. When I meet children, a black house can be seen and children in the white family revolve and get to rock music. Soundtrack Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Sound Garden etc. The film is like 60 and I will be cheesy like the gurantee you will make it NBC .Purchase networks look at the biggest problem of the full - length pieces of the networks you are living in a certain period of time you 're not thinking I am living Sophisticated retro during the 60 's or whatever decade .Ew This is something that anyone who looked the more weight they put into the project
