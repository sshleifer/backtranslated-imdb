This is what you'll get if you have a 10 year old (Manic American) permission to write a story on a moon trip. The absolute worst without any trailing features may possibly have some attraction in 3D dept. But as an article and entertaining animation it has nothing to do to waste an hour and a half. Save your time and money and see the BOL instead <br /> <br /> Damon. There are not enough lines, and I have provided it ... well, I agree with the review - it's a cold war propaganda story. It may be more interesting if the Moon is about to reveal the fake of the landing, or if the fly dies in the first minute. BTW - Why are all the main character deformed flies? - No one has the full compliment of the organs!
