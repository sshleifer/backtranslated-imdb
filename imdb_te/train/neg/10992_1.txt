Underground comedy movie, the worst train accidents I have ever seen. Fortunately I did not pay for this film, and my friend reluctantly agreed to see it sit in that it was very terrible but he needed to prove to me how terrible it was. I love color comedy. I have found it at least and I will be entertained. No, instead of acting is very terrible, "jokes" are very cheesy, and where the plot is not found. Maybe I can not hold this hero but can not have a plot. It's the most ridiculous thing in comedy when it comes to a bat on her head .... Batman is a bat that wears a baseball uniform. Hilarious. Only genius. The feeling I was watching this film was made by its creators and laughing frantically with their friends about it. Maybe that's totally inside jokes we could not understand. Or even if it is the worst piece ever made, it is locked up in a treasury and rejected in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie!
