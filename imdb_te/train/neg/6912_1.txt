I gave 10 to 1 because 10 people did not allow me to give zero choice. This is the biggest waste of time I've ever endured. For about 75 minutes, you have to do a massacre, not just a plot, but also a plot of WORST acting (and I have a great terrible act as in Killer Nerdy) and funnier. I also have reason to rent this piece of garbage because the massacre in the title. The whole film has only one killing, it is very dull. You have to spend a lot of time watching the children and yard better than anything. The kids said that the little boy could be a very irritating baby actor from Bob's house in the cemetery. Did I know it was also shot in the video? If you want to remove money and stay within an hour of your life, then watch for everything. But if your hard earned dollars and time to savor, then distance as far as possible.
