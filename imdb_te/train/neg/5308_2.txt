You can prepare for another lousy bimbo outing! This time, it's always brought to you by Fred Olen Ray, the inevitable! Until you go to exploitation movies, this is not a click! As science fiction, it's unequal! Everything we see is an ugly woman dressed in a bikini to destroy the earth, and almost everything to resist! Give me f - - ink break !!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, why not change the old SI swimsuit without letting it go? It's pretty good if it does not set the sleaze factor on too high, but still this one is not great. I would like to highlight another movie by Jim Wynyrsky called The Assault (1996), similar to the identity of ALIENATOR. This is why the top-notch 1st person "Femme Fatale" explains why action movies are better translated into America. Sorry, dropped!
