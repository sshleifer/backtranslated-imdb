Sorry, but every time a movie I've seen is a woman who is a man who eats a man-man and can do nothing but a man, the movie will lose all credibility. So when the new (female) Starbuck landed the place immediately (today's intention). Dirk Benedict is more acceptable than the sensitive hero-type than the new-age Cutty Sockoffs - a result that politically correctly praises it as "a compelling, exciting, must-see, sensational performance" of today's review copy editors; But the essence is that it is tired of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as a townhouse, the oldest film: today the biggest clich√© on the screen. I give another shot to this series, but human satirical images do not just tune me up. As James Hilton once listened to, "a story, please give me a story."
