Cover art (which includes a scary cartridge gun) seems to be a martial art film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> (Condom's brand in Trojan US) This film is loaded with homoeroticism. If you want that item, this movie is not really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of actors' grooves and butts (each actor is emotional in his pants in each scene), colors like lemon, peach, and red. From a cinematographer perspective, the film is a drag queen! Many sequences are close to each other, occasionally touching when they talk. Also, the hero's relative likes women, and every other person in the film is trying to kill him. Want to let movie producers here? <br /> <br /> Do I go into combat scenes? (Yes, individual parts of a person hold a fight.) The marshal arts scenes are brief and unpredictable. Here are the fancy stuff, your standard tactics that you can see in old Chuck Norris. There is also a car chase scene, which is the first low-speed chase film.
