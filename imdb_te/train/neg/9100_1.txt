Christ, Oh Christ ... One of the marvelous surprises, unbelievable, possibly disturbing, this tawri exercise in the Mirrors Smoot will pass through all the intellect and capacity of a Pallius Galapagos Turtle. What are such things? Whether this film actually exists or some shady international pharmaceutical company has guinea pigs without knowing it, does not know my coffee is spelled with a dangerous halosicogen? I saw a lot of movies and saw very bad pictures, but I did not prepare it; In the end I was a gibbering, snivening ruin, with my teeth hanging on my teeth carpet and waving my lungs. I am desperate and merciless (I do not know whom this appeal has been made) and I love the longing desire of Ouju Yasujaire. Self-extinguishing Jesus and memories ... sometimes they come to me. When I am at least able to deal with them, I'm in my trouble. I smelt with tears, smashing my fingernails until my hands crushed with blood, but I can not remove the terrible storms from my mind. I followed. I was damaged. I'm a man's shell. <br /> I am suggesting that the comments of other users are not alone with this horrifying experience, which can only be one of two things: a) indeed exist or b) I am really a victim of the international conspiracy of dangerous ratios. Some people seem to experience a difficult test, or at least not suffering from it. Perhaps they were part of the operation. God damn them, maniacs! God's hell all of them damn !!!!!!
