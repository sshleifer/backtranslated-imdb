My friends and I do not know what to expect in this movie, but hoping for the best. When we came out, the storyline of the film provided little more information. Although I'm not the worst movie I have ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money on the theater. <br /> If you really want to see it, a friend can rent it for you (it is not worth the rental price). <br /> <br /> A movie is not known to you, the last five minutes, of course, not in its defense. This performance is fine, it's more than you'd expect from this movie, and some shots are good, but it's a slick plot and poor script. <br /> In fact it came out, as soon as I went to see a good image to cleanse my mind and buy a ticket. I will skip the first step of all of you and watch a good movie instead.
