Ronald Coleman has won an Oscar for Best Actor in a cast as a leading theater writer, most notably Shakespeare's Othello, as a complete loser of his roles. Written by Ruth Gordon and Garzon Canon's assessment team, George Cooker has a critically-acclaimed fantastic picture. Unfortunately, the humorous banter comes here as self-conscious, and the backstage business is overripe. Micklos Rosso also won an Oscar for his score and Shelley Winters asked for some good moments as a tough waitress (theater Coleman asked her when she spoke to her breathlessly, "what is yaw? Some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this illustration is very clear, surprisingly pulling, and not too funny. **** from * 1/2
