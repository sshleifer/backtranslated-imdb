I do not have any understanding in the writer Philippa Peirce or his novels and if TOM`S Midnight Garden is unique in her work, I was very much interested in her books as a child. I'm not really interested in literature until it's a small child, but it's hard to fight with a lot of giants. <br /> <br /> By judging by this version of the Tomo` Midnight Garden I find no garden from the stories of Pierce's middle class children around the story of Tom Long Go home without having to find metaphysical suddenly. There is no doubt that you have your own garden, and there are no working-class people in the 1950s, so here I have a subtitle with some political classes. Is there a romance with a young girl called Hatty, but with the children who have been frustrated by love stories again? Perhaps the worst criticism is much less in the story of excitement or adventure. <br /> <br /> It is a children's film dating to its origin. It is unlikely but IMDB voters are surprised by its high rating. I wonder how many of them would have given them so many marks if they were just 10 years old who saw the Lord of the Rings Trilogy just aged?
