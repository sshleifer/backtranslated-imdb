It was in the early 80s. There is a suspiciously visible teenage group. And there is a maniac hunt around. Yes, it's slasherville. <br /> <br /> The film is called pranks. Why is it called pranks? I'm not stupid. A great prank is unless your thought has repeatedly hit someone dinner with a baseball bat - the balance is not a great skeptical; The truth is true, the worst thing is that the worst. <br /> <br /> The film also concerns teenagers who are responsible for cleaning up the dormitory. They realize that a mental illness is loose. To resist this development, they are split and rotate in the dark. This too ends up in tears. <br /> <br /> Pranks are very good. One of the DVD release I saw was Vipco. It seems to have cut a fair bit of violence. It makes the DVD more understandable, because it's a dark picture of violence that is a waste of time. Slasher-for image and video nasty completely completists.
