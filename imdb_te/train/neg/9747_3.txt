Okay, this movie sucks. But why? A machine can power the energy with the material, store it, transport it, and re-entry is at least humorous. But until they take this campus. Instead of knowing what happened to this type of machine, they break up horrible things. This may be a good place. With the responsibility of this kind of authority, and the continuous temptation, ie .. invisible man. But they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then Dr Jerry-rigging is something together, and he tries to shift himself. Not only his cute but dumb secretary, it's goofed by (duh). Nothing happened if Lambeck did not leave. So now he's roaming to the country side because his little experiment failed, and they can not give him money. Wah. Then throw a pale British relationship between two semi-skilled professors appointed to help him make the film more worse. Among their loving sessions, he attempts to find him when he kills half a million in London. This may be headed off by breaking all whale machine, which would never have been left by Lembach. This film is a good thing if I gave the luck 2 stars for the effort and made Lambbach's vacation, if it did not break the thin machine. DAM YOU LUMBAC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
