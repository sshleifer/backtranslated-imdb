One: Richard Pieror and Jackie Gleason, two great comics have become saps for a Bretti Kid. They sold worse than both Prior's role. Two: The horrific, overly sentimental script used in Harold Lloyd was clich√©d. Three: A Black Actor's Choice; Its racial subtitle is unbearable because it never mentioned. There is no message here, a piece of Prior can be played by any comedian. Four: That kid ... I want to go back and prevent him from acting ... I do not understand movies like this one and kid co ... and my childhood free was their mind-depressing power. If you want to see a couple of great comics, do not dodge themselves in a sweetly sweet kiddie image, go ahead. If you want to see them good, like the honeymooners, Prior's old standup law and Gleason are good.
