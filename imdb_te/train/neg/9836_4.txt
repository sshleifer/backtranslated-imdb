John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) are trail buddies that lead to the Gulch Rodeo of Wrightlane. Scott is a pretty white contestant, but unless he prefers to accept twenty-five cents in a dollar in a prize money from a curly promoter, he will collect his winnings by pointing the gun. Most coincidentally, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they will like the rest of Rodeo; They shoot promoter Forthsworth (Henry Hall), and kill them like Scott and Kansas Charlie. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler are using Running Hog in the film, where they are going to move their fist on various tiny pieces. <br /> <br /> Chundeler takes a brutal swing, Wayne's foot curled up and hit him crazy. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, Scott's girlfriend Anne will be plundering the buddies at one stage in the next step. The change of heart and the faults in his ways, the bad guy agrees to Jim Clean and Sheriff, but Pete shoots him. While disagreeing, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne meets the sheriff in the middle of the gun between good guys and villains. <br /> <br /> <br /> John Wayne from Lawn Star in "The Desert Trial" Productions in this era of Westerns. The noticeable exception is George "Gabby" Heis and Yakima Canot, one or both of them commonly found in these voters. If you're a John Wayne fan, you should see it once, but that's enough.
