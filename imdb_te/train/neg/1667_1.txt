Finally, I really liked this movie. Sure, it's not cheesy and beautiful but it still kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, it was. For her final performance at the prestigious Conservative Conservator, other classically trained students suffered to catch her, what does the main character do? Was the musical tradition honored by Wow holding them and hanging at this time? Not far from her carmen Habanera tortures and butchers and completely unforgettable Britney Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears are strong! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her standing up! Any teacher at Spears's induced fantasy has failed on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
