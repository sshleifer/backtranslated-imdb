If they give me a choice of negative numbers, I'll use it. This movie is a real god-terrible. <br /> I thought I would be afraid of the theater, it exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script is weak and acting is painful. I wanted to go out but my friend was driving and she wanted to get money, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> The girls are wrong with their super power and hair color. Eddie Izzard just seemed to be a part of the super villain, he came out unusual and weakly silly. Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) was mentally and eccentric as Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Wagner (Rain Wilson).
