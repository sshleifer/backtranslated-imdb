His memory (now the original idea!) With an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII about the Unification of Rebecca West Book of Child, Rebecca West's book. It should be enough to set off some emotional sparks which Julie Christie does not remember when he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson but the current wife. This is a very well cast cast with director Alan Bridges, director and co-stars Jackson, Christie, On Margret, and Ian Holm, but all of the burners are low. There are some good sequences (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but the pacing of the bridge is silent slow and the color of the film's retirement. Long in the shelf, this "Soldier" is best forgotten. **** from * 1/2
