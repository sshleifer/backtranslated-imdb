First, what's good in the film? Some pretty actress exotic background? The fact that acting actors did not laugh (if I was in their situation)? I do not know. The storyline is simple: who is a Catholic priest who is abstract painting (another abstract artist) killed his younger brother and a male prostitute (he was raped by another priest when he was young). I'm afraid that there is nothing here to think a little about serious killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst part of the worst season of "Profiler" (Serie) with alternative actors and unbelievable coincidences. (Uncle is having a baby with a girl who lives in another victim's home, etc).
