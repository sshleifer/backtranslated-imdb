<br /> <br /> I guess the film is admirable for the first Superman film, which is just as black and painful. <br /> <br /> After the opening sequence with scary and gladiating scenes, the future sweep credits for the cryptic-looking of the original Superman film. Mont Kent finds some kind of villains in the field, and a good part of my life runs slowly to some ruins in the ranch. <br /> <br /> In the next period we meet Lex Luthor. We meet in a scene about a number of mysterious scenes of an elderly woman who is dying. We can not see Luther's face until the end of the scene, an early example of the film that left the rock without hackney. Lex Luthor is a man who does not like Superman because he is not human. Moreover, he does not like human beings, because the film has some plans for the Lex Luthor plan to kill the Earth's population occasionally. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent returned to the old job (I forgot to tell him that he was away in a five year tour where nothing had happened). He then finds Lois Lane an illegitimate kid and dying with cyclops. This increases him well, he loses control over his super-power, so he accidentally breaks the picture frame. <br /> <br /> Miss Lane is a type of space shuttle that is connected to some types of jets. This is an important event in the account on television. Then we learn that there are people in the control room that this program oversees. People on television also have pilots in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> As the events that led to the inevitable catastrophe began to build, I forgave myself to obtain soda. I accidentally walked into a bad theater and looked at pictures of Al Gore. I tried to go back to Superman Returns, but I saw in a row two times, I went somewhere in the Prairie home companion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " However, it has never been taken, so I went around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent it to college. When my son attended medical school graduation, I remembered to check in Superman Returns, so I forgot and wanted to go back to the theater, there was no need to learn there. It took about half an hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane. <br /> When they did, Superman saved everyone, it's great. <br /> <br /> Superman is really crazy and loses Lewes Lane and her family with her x-ray focus and super-hearing. <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor engaged in the competition to demonstrate every possible general villain behavior at the end of the film. I forgot to bring my scorecard home (they gave you one at the door), but I think he did more than a hundred percent. <br /> <br /> At this point, gears begin for bigger rodent. I think the projector was broken, for a while in the movie it seemed to be a loop. <br /> <br /> When you go here, <br /> <br /> Then superman died and returned to life. <br /> <br /> After nine years, the nursing home where I lived was a bit cooler. I realized that I gave up my sweatshirt in the theater and I went back to get it back. When I did, I was surprised to learn that Superman Returns was not there yet. <br /> <br /> When I sat in my old seat, I saw Louis Lane sprinkled around her house. For a while. <br /> <br /> Superman came and began to quote in the beginning of the film, and I thought it was right to leave it because I already saw that piece. <br /> So my review of Superman Returns. <br /> Oh, even, if you like jokes about eating dogs or joking about a dog eating another dog, you would love this film. There are two jokes.
