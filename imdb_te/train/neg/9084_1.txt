This is the worst picture I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) did not do anything! She had no emotion on all blah blah blues as she read from a boring textbook. The kid who loves the kid and the kid who loves food (there are not worth remembering the names there) are so annoying that it drove me crazy. Never have it talked about some scientific thing or food. Molly Dad did not show enough emotion for her daughter. Police officer and Molly's father said four times that. It's just terrible. Everything has come back to many people. Beatrice should be bad for her to understand her. I wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie!
