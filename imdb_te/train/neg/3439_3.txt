<br /> <br /> "I'm very glad I did not think it's bad like a shark that came out of nowhere to the worst CGI If there are things that I will definitely cut that part of the director, I have given myself the desire to stop seeing the rest of the film .. Some people feel it's boring reason for lack of action, sometimes it feels like home ... For example a friend has died and they <br /> <br /> "I'm sleeping, hundreds of candles in the table in front of them ... curtains of boat types ( The old windows are covered with windows) and by the sofa / cousus ... using candles, surroundings, rather than being in a high ocean alone ... <br /> <br /> Anu. Sometimes horror works well when it's hidden behind it, so the film is good, maybe it's not a low budget, but it works well for me! <br /> If you forget some holes like the ones mentioned above you will feel stressed. <br /> <br /> (Sorry about my raw English) <br /> <br /> Cheers
