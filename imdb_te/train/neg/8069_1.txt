The absurd mess with a tightly deafening sound track, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the style of horror movies "Who's dead and who's alive". Two adolescent couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabels, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before their participation until the Thanksgiving break, some may have a thick church imprudent Annabel (Elijah Dushu, Aka Faith, and other vampire slayer) in the church. Moving creepy boys start with much care for reasons Cassie (General Melissa Sagemiller) never explained, and long ago, quartet left the party. Driving away in their SUV, they chase and then pass through the creepy guys who do not intentionally do not intentionally intentionally intentionally intentionally intentionally 180 in the middle of the road, the SUV flips over a monument and plunges the river causing a nasty and malignant accident. Sean is killed (or he?), And Cassie follows her remaining sequences with a lonely and guilty (when she runs) when Sean's ghost is not hunted or driven by those crazy creepy guys. Imaginary Unconscious Since Cassie's mood has become more and more diminished, we will continue to come to the conclusion conclusion. So, who's dead and who's alive? After nine minutes of this hell, who really cares?
