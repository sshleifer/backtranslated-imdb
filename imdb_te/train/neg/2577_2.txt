This story surprised me with a different angle that I could not buy the previously viewed VHS scene. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of good stories about people in the hospital, and their different personalities. "Blues" (William Forsyth) is a stereotype racist white man who describes the f-word as a different text and so fantastic that they did not give him his first name. He is so much fun around. Then, "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast speaking woman. "White Men can not jump", because he likes them to play snips, fast-speaking "hip" pride characters. Playing with "Hannah Hunt" "Anna", he has an amazing attentive and loving person who has an immoral affair with a prominent role in "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). Hearty, feeling is kind of good stuff. It just melt my heart looking at these nice folks. But, if you are one of those who love the worst characters that have been filmed by the worst people in this moral movie ... you might like it! Include the dose of Hollywood political correctness and there you go! Want to do more to anyone?
