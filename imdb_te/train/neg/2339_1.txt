This whirlwind image appears to be a mixture of music-clips rather than a realistic film on MTV. Do not have a real story and ask yourself as the picture goes to you: "What happens?" But nothing happened. Eric Clock, the writer of despair, the story around is only a good thing. Other people usually feel nothing: then why put them together in an image. You can watch the worst picture with music. When Bach brings out music, most people like to see it but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a script for a 100-minute or more film before a film is directed.
