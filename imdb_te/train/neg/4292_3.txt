I usually like watching Burt Lancaster images - especially when Elmer Craneree needs to make his majestic screen presence nuts. Nevertheless, his great strength, his magnetism, is rarely his worst rare, if ever, is less of supernatural. And it really hinders the Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character is considered to be a kind of film makers but Catherine Hepburn is totally incapable of how she will fall under her spell. She should be smart but it does not appear when Lancaster's Blarney is thrown about the screen! In addition to this, this story is perhaps one of the most fascinating films I've seen and is very clear that this is a drama based on the drama. <br /> Overall, a very overtered image.
