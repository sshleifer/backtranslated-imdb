This should be some of the worst direction I've seen. Closeup is a very powerful shot, but it does not have every scene, it loses its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott is a beautiful estate in Mexico, Cantinus, Antoine Quin's beautiful estate, and sewage towns to work through his journey for revenge for Costner Rolls. Unfortunately, we only catch the quick moments of these places before the camera is cut in a bigger, big-headed image. Transition scenes also cut down to close-up when driving alone across Mexico. <br /> <br /> The score is over-dramatic and inappropriate, we should be guessing every emotion. The story is also well organized. Among other things, many people do not go out to help Costner along - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same campus and made the best of it. Costner's No Way Out is somewhat similar to the storyline, but this is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The end is completely anticoagulant and suffered the most dramatic scoring of the film. This film is not always great, but if Mexico still has fewer heads, the film might be viewable.
