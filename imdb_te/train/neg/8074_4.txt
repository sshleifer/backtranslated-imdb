As a kinsman who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place but travels with bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / directing effort is freely available from other good films like Jacques Ladder and Abrey Los Ozos (Open Your Eyes). For those who do not see something in these movies, I will not stay away from the campus. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller is about to go to college like Cassie, enough to say that the stars are not nearly performed here. The car was in danger of being followed by two killers (??) in the vague masks of her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), two friends, and Annabel (Ebbia Schash). She survived the wreckage, but was absent from the hospital, disappeared to the dead in the hospital and the dead, and she was totally confused: who died? Who's alive? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors have a bad look, done, nail-filled, blood-ankle, body stroking teen extortion image. True, it has its share of murder-stealing-victim scenes (abundant, repetitive and mind-numbing), but at least unfortunately does not succeed, attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than capillaries. <br /> <br /> The horror fans who choose a copy are no more than a body count for more anxiety to build an uncomfortable look for an image there. The credit carpenter tries to create something beyond a derivative teen horror film; Very bad he has created a derivative psychological thriller. The Sagemiller also deserves kudos to show strength in the Central Performance, in fact evolves his character and induce some feel of emotional as Cassie bored. <br /> Film producers are trying to make different attempts, but the film ends with a mixed bag and the experiment failed. <br /> <br />
