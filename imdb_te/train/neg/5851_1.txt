I also thought the jigsaw was also a hip at that time, the entire LSD theme married a murder mystery, a clear clear attempt to capture at least the era of younger audiences at least without any understanding of the negative perception. Loudspeaker, lapse acting, silly and pivotal conversations, even after the first 60 seconds, the LSD flashbacks that move simultaneously, make only a great vehicle on the original plot, on paper, and the climax is actually an anti-climax very quick and predictable (bad Not much about the memories of television shows). If it is a good image, it is possible to stop disbelief on some of the things that help for happiness, but stimulating weaknesses can not stimulate audiences. I saw jan on television and absolutely no nighttime TV fare to fill the airspace and if anyone can kill anybody else's sleep, nobody wants to be active. Very good, from 10 to three.
