Guys has already made a little disturbance about watching this movie. There is nothing to do with the film Jack the Ripper (you unexpectedly) its another B, I'm Grade Movie Some sex scenes have some teens in splitting on the tree near them Looking ahead. It's not horrendous, funny or fun. If you really feel the crystalline stuff without plot, then watch the cabin fever, at least the director does not fall asleep asleep through this rubbish direction. Only see if you have absolutely nothing in life & the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying in TV TV.
