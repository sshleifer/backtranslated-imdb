Anyone disguised by Stella Stevens in the old Nevada town (outside of Vegas for a cash haste at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas) is a very tired film with Sterla Stevens, who disguises anyone (it does not take me any time to estimate). Stevens leads to her three gangs, and they find that they work much faster than expected. Although the most appealing in Las Vegas in the 70s, the most intimate loyalty acting has a large boring egg, the most involved and probable plot, the Las Vegas Lady. It is forever for the film to kick into the gear, and it just sputters here and there and makes the speed up really up. He was disappointed with this film. Certainly, I did not expect anything great, but I thought it was one of those well-made films from the 1970s or something like that. Not even close. No one dies. The brutal Stuart Whitman and Helter Skelter had a short-time gun between Official George Djeszano a year before his great performance as a trial lawyer Baggiosa. There's all the suspense of looking at the gun waterfall. There is a punch and a head with a blunt instrument. Absolutely nothing in action. And for the girls, do not expect much there either. Stella and her girls (both get a lot of medieval and pretty talents, a steam and a bath. What do we see? Stella is wearing these nice open jackets as she comes true to her real talent, but I wish she had a bit more open to her performance. I will write a thing that I can recommend the film.Yes, it is not, and I am positive in this movie Ceppalekapotunnanuidi as grim picture of what is not, it just does not do anything for it.
