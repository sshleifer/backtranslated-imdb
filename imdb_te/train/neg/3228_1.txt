I've seen other Guinea pig films like Menhole in Menhole & He Never Dies and they have at least humorous (though dark) when they are ill. The devil's experiment, however, is that many of the methods of violence and violence are nothing more than a small group of punkblues gathering and no plot and no redemption values. It's probably not scary, except perhaps the mind set, but it is absolutely disgusting and I certainly can not call it fun. Now, I'm not paragon of good taste in the movies and I like my worst and sleaze, but this is really a lot for me. I'm nonsense, in fact, I'm looking for things that are unwanted whenever possible, but this is quite a bit. She knocked, knocked this young girl off to the continuous sound through the headphones, and then brought with the meat and the ingredients. If you think it sounds great, go for it, but it definitely put me looking at any guinea pig stuff. 10 to 1, definitely nausea.
