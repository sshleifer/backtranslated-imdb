Haha! If you've really made all the way through this movie just smile and smile. This is what I guess I said something about myself. The film is also a sort of psychological test, or medicinal type, that I've created to take you to a place that never happened before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical work, The Trektacus (Special), it says that it is meaningless and ineffective, but if you have read it, you're taken to a new level like a ladder, throwing the job up and looking at things with real understanding. <br /> <br /> The film is doubtful, I have seen for a long time in such a unique way. First of all, this is the snippets. I liked watching this guy kick ass in various films. And I've got some weak ones. However, if you know the film, you do not suspect that it is really bad. It's fun. I mean these snaps. You know it might be better, but it will be alright, right? <br /> <br /> Each level is pure boredom, pure falsehood. The professor's suggestion is both dead and evident, yet less humorous. At least one character in the film is not interesting. And to make the whole thing more surreal, they are not quite right, they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like different parts of the Bourne identification type films. In fact, although it seems to be close to the action movie background music, it can only happen in a manner to hang. <br /> <br /> The whole pitch is all black and honest, because the characters are much flattened, you do not really care what's going to happen, but regardless, if it happens and someone is killed, you should say, do you want to see me? Intemiti? For a time that is a long time spent, a strobe lights are about blindings at the pace, the scenes with the wicked witch. Certainly this is how boxing can throw that sign in. When you are hard and your eyes can not handle it anymore, some of them will not see what really happened in the dark to die. And on top of that, you do not care to allow it to be encountered. <br /> <br /> "And it will be able to see you at any level of your mind without being overwhelmed, so it's potentially a zone with you Out, and when you start thinking about your life, its name, its name, <br /> <br /> The real magic of this movie.
