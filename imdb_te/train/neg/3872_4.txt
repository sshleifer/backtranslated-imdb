This film does not always become intolerable to see. And straightforward, there is nothing to show, except for the brilliant Alicia Silverstone in the sexy romantic character that does not reveal much sexy clothes. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see how. There is no suspense, little action, impressive dialogues, unsatisfactory romance, same boring positions and very bland acting. Kevin Dillon is totally inactive. Silverstone ... Well, I did not pay much attention to her performance, I agree. As mentioned earlier, if nothing is done except watching a movie, it is not too bad. 4/10
