Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a lousy piece of garbage. I was surprised that it was rated as much as I did. What's wrong with this picture? Here's a good question: What's wrong with this picture? <br /> <br /> This storyline is just the worst and cliche. It's a good thing ... Some people who have no friends are killing, killing, and returning to take revenge. "All" is packed into a 86-minute, baseless image. If you do not see this movie will not waste your time watching. And yet, the second is not very good, so do not be bothered about it ... Because I did not feel good about the film, I shot three of the film because I liked Scarcro's outfit. I think you like the picture.
