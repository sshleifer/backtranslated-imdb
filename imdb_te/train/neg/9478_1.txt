If some odd controversial Oscar Academy Awards were held, the film would win all. It is a popular superstar in every role, with all the gods, excellent plot, good special effects, good acting skills and of course each character. Well, this is a scenario if the world breaks down, but it is not. Instead, it is the worst horror film that has shown less of the unique effects of not only the bad actors who can read scripts from a teleprint with the worst dyslexia. For example, the Devil's clothing (by the way) is the happiest thing I've ever seen. Whenever I saw a monster called a red-black on the screen I can not hold back my laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I made. <br /> <br /> The 2003 release of the IMDB shows that there are less than five votes and ideas: "One Shot is Valuable, Not Bad". <br /> That's it. /> <br /> I'm going to waste more words in this movie.
