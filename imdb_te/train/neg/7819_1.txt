... It's the worst movie I have ever seen. Hmmm, okay might have been with Boogeyman. <br /> I have low expectations and failed to meet them! I can not think of a good thing honestly. <br /> Action 2. Plot 3. CGI (Xbox 360 is good graphics .... is serious) 4. THE PLOT 5. Dialog and finally .... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> They do not keep Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together, or they are forced to settle for a 3-minute bit, or they do not notice if they have been filmed at 2:32 hours for most unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> As the main hero, the villain Superman k Duku had less time than that and kills him? <br /> Do you have half a budget to persuade Kevin spaces to do that? <br /> Doctors do not ask when doctors go to Superman Hospital "What do we want to do?! He is a f *** eng alien! Jack does not know about his anatomy! <br /> <br /> What happened in 5 years to Superman Technology has led to 28 years of development? <br /> <br /> Where are the people who wrote good reviews of the same movie? <br /> <br /> Why do not you? Just, why? <br /> <br /> Previously, Kryptonite does not have any effect, he looks green in the rocks, which is clearly visible on his head. <br /> Those writers or authors have half-hatred who do not think it's a clear apparent mistake.
