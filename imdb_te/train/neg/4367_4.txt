One of Boris Karlouff's real clinicians. A particularly scientist who needs cash to finish his experiments before he dies, most notably Carloff (who was 120 years old) to die. He goes to the south of France where he sees his branding from Morocco, where he works as a doctor when trying to pay enough money to prove his doctrines. Desperate for money he makes a deal with a cotton baron's young great wife dying. If her husband helps poison her husband, she can take her money and continue with Gigolo (I feel married). If you think I've earned you from watching the film that's wrong, I have to read other people who have posted what I want to do. Why? I do not know what will happen with its many characters and multiple conversion plot lines because this film has lost me from two minutes. Little is out there and in the end I did not really mention a lot of time which I really did not care. It is completely unobtrusive for Carlof's performance, which at times is odd. To be honest, I am the only time he came to Bela Lugosi's tremendous territory. It is not every scenery but some and I wonder how much they hung.
