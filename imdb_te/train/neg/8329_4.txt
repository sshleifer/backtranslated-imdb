<br /> <br /> I have questioned its importance for the queer movie. More about homosexuality can be seen in violent behavior by making clear statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> The three stories are undisturbed. When I tried to kill the worst story in the first 15 minutes, I did not sit well with me. <br /> <br /> There is a thick dialogue concept throughout the film. More than a 45-minute boy's unlike a short film rather than a short film. <br /> <br /> Part 1: The Boxer / Stalker hero is strong and it seems to be there. Slightly pull. Bob has been following Tim for four years and now he is going to face him? I thought, even though their cat-mouse game was not adequately developed enough for its end. We tell them more information about them and relatively less parking lot / locker scenes with Tim "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> In the second half: Danny's race, Tony, he beat him when he's off the jack. Tony does not appear in the mind, but he is also interested in exploring the consequences of his homo romance - not even after they are naked. I do not have all the important transitions from "a fun boy I've spent with my guy friend for fun", "I feel homophobic and hitting him because I want to spread his donkey and make him a S / M style." Clearly these stories were able to convey their points in half. The third part that killed each other with man and woman adds that idea. In addition, it is unnecessary and nothing to the film. Yes, the actors did a fine job in the circumstances and the four men's leads were very sexy. <br /> <br /> A grammatical school is made up of a talent show (made up of wounds and cuts). <br /> <br /> There is not enough meat for this story. The film did not make any announcement, wasted time and was not attractive enough for attentive investment. Its malignant fault makes its amateur method, ultimately impossible to take seriously.
