I read Ben Mejrich's novel Reaper a few years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this affiliation. <br /> <br /> This story is the first time I have read the first time, and the film is heavier. <br /> <br /> If this storyline is of interest to you: go and get the novel. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> If you look at Ben Majorrich's great deal, it's hard to see.
