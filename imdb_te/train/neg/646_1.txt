I have seen this film accidental and this film is in an accident ... should be fine. The blonde ladies were warming, the villain was then disappearing, disappearing from one place to another, disappearing and disappearing while hiding. He is also a superhero, so he does not know how to do it. He was not scared <br /> <br /> "The old oldest in the bathroom" mirror is not scary now, and actually stopped being scary years ago. You have a clue to the villain, another cliche (directed by Edis Elba with a very accentuated American accent, he's from London), who had a clue and made a complete film of Clich√© and made a "scary move" of making it a comedy look scary. Pathetic!
