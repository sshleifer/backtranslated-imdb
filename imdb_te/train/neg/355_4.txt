Just one of those movies that makes a lot of surprise why Just Cause at first it gets heavily slated when you come out of it - with no special but non-competent and excellent assistant performance from Ed Harris. Then you start to get crazy (and very young Scarlett Johansson) in an Alligator Skinner shock until you've hit the last third and everything gets you a killer with a flashlight that strapped to the finned Sean Connery wife (usually a mannered and astounding Kate Kapus) and a boy who strapped to his forehead. <br /> <br /> It's probably the best movie ever seen on an airplane, and only once.
