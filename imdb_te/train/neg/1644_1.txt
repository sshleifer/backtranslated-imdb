The worst picture I've seen so far is hands down. I thought I'd never take the last action hero, but it makes it easier. Around 3 guys who meet Sundays to discuss their sexual fantasies from the weekend. A fourth person - who marries and - serves as a part of that group and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny but they repeat throughout the movie. At the end of the film the big kicker is ridiculous. Avoid all costs.
