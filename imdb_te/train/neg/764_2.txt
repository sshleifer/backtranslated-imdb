The script for this Colombian film was taken out of the 1980s soap opera. Deeply driven movies are very good, but characters are compelling. There is only my desire to change the channel in the film. The villain dialog is written by a romance novelist. The great Lieutenant Colombo himself is not just his famous, friendly, self-reliant, cramped self; And the bride / kidnapped victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-suffering (a fearsome councer from a small scalpel that she fears !!!) I might have knocked him out of the scalpel in two seconds - you know what happened to her abductor hand flimsily. At any aspect of reality, the character will have at least an inquiry to fight or fight at least once. And talking about reality .... The story revolves around a kidnap, it will work and police will be solved. Guards Will you be. Everyone knows that the FBI takes on every kidnapping case. This is NO Columbus, our familiar Lt. A shallow and utterly predictable crime play written in Columbo and spread over 2 hours.
