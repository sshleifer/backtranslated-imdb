The end of the world looks like a good movie in the box box but it has a bad warning. I was deceived by Mega Starr Christopher Lee's big fan. (77) Good actors do not mean that good movie. It starts, it promises to turn into a tadium, many parts of the film are good. Liu Ayers, Dean Jagger, and MacDonald As Carey Security Guard I think it's better off from Charles Band, he again made good entertainment films like animator and dolls. Christopher Lee was upset with making this film. His co-stars are Jos√© Ferrer, John Carridine, and Dean Jagger. Dylan Jagger went on to do two good films, Alligator (80) and Game of Death (79) Lion (Lolita) also included in the movie Lollipop. I'm daring to wake up to 10 in the whole world.
