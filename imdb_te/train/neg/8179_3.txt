"Looking for the fortunes hidden by the three West Indies for treasure hunters, men who are close to the treasure of the earth raise the golden movement and increase the golden motion, that greed and hatred lead to murder," according to the summary of the DVD sleeve. "Manfish" is the name of their boat, not a monster. The skeleton of muscle captain John Bromfield (as Bramigon) is the best half of his treasure map. Old salt Viktor Jory (professor) offers the rest of the map. The first mate Lone Chaney Jr. (as Sweden) is mute, and sexy Tessa predecessor (such as Alita) protects the rum (very well, not sure). <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jari, Lone Chaney Jr.
