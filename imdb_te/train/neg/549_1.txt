I can not believe that the Indian film industry still has third-rate implications like Vakt. For starters, the storyline is totally incurable? The spoiled son's family disgusts from home and thereby teaches him self-sufficiency. What does he do? He won some national talent (I honestly joke here) doing some star jumps before a team of judges. During this time, his father died of lung cancer, but kept secret from his son, but lived long enough to make his son famous, to see his new grandson and to make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Is acting frightening in its performance? The film did not make any effort to try and act on any kind of dealing by mainstream journalists. <br /> <br /> Like in Indian movies, the family lived in a large building and was relatively unhappy with the real world's concerns. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers who made such horrific films were wrong to see the intelligent viewers of such a movie. Actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar are still honored as Gods for those who are not blind in Bollywood.
