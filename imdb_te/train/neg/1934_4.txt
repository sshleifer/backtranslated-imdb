Following President Truman, military African Americans (Cuba Gooding) are following a simple formula for the introduction of a new appointment for the first time - a racist jiavot (Robert Deno) by the US Navy's deep sea valley training program. If the program is not bad enough, it has to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert de Niro stimulates his southern slang and Gabbershift effectively shouts. Cuba Buddy, a poorly predictable paragon who grew up as a poor black farm boy in the south. Girls - one could hardly call them women - Charlene Theron and Lonette McKee. They have small roles and argue that their people exercise a simple sense. Other good performers - Powers Boothey and Hall Holbrook - are still not working properly. <br /> It's about it. Almost everything was met by a computer. The ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro's honorary hymns were recovered. After the brutal attacks on hospital staff, he transferred his clothes out of delivery. Someone shouts at the beginning of the 1950s, "I'm out of here". "Lieutenant", "The Companion of the Boat Wan" and "Commander" Navy are the ones who are normal "Mr." (if one officer) or their last name (enlisted). <br /> <br /> In 1950, I was unable to check whether there was a rank called "Senior Master Chief". <br /> <br /> Cuban gunning has strict rows. Everyone in the Navy hates exemptions except one person from Wisconsin. He defends and defies others in his class. <br /> <br /> It is similar to the scene in "Animal House" applied to Sin, a black man, and a Tony fraternity to wait in a room with blind kids. <br /> <br /> Gudaying man, second He is a classmate and he is married to a beautiful woman who graduated from medical school, one of their arguments, with whom she wants to become a doctor. "Yes, just be a doctor's partner and pass the life you want." <br /> <br /> Goku in Boca Raton You can wave from the course. <br /> <br /> These shoots are common in World War II, "Bombardier," "Aerial Gunner," that is something like that, Those aukaga, they have some of the educational features. If you learned something that admitted a bombardier or gunner. <br /> <br /> Here's to those who do not know anything about the technical details, perhaps because it had been crossed. (Boyle's law we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> I do not have a film without emergency situations. If I get mechanical problems correctly, I guess correctly. This direction does not help. The picture is plenty in close ups, so much that they lose any dramatic effect that they may have. <br /> <br /> Emergency situations are confusing because they are ill. <br /> Why should we go? Want to see a good example of this type of image? Almost anything - except for "G. I. Jane", the harassed hero is heroin. Try the scenes of the training camp in "The Young Lions". The victim is a Jew. Or "From Here to Eternity", in which the simple sympathetic buttons are pushed and the victim is actively involved in bringing the dispute and the "community hush loop". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole world is completely formal and does not do well.
