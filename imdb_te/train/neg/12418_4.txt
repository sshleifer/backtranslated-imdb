I just watched this movie just now, not just a year in Israel, but a good film earlier. <br /> <br /> It is a second feature film of Drew Shaul, and I have to admit that he did before his first and TV drama. This picture is much better. Further, it is his first attempt to direct the play. <br /> <br /> The first thing you should know is that you will see the film: Israel's 21st century hates Kibbtz and values ​​from it form the state of Israel. The real situation of kibbutzim is very terrible, and some of them disappear by one. Kibbtz, the Hebrew word for mass, is only a kind of village for members, where the values ​​of equality and socialism are spiritual in everyday life. With the change in social values ​​with time, Kibbtz realized that the human spirit was suppressed, now without such a ticket, was locked up in the Domus rules. The entrance of capitalist values ​​and lifestyle in the 90s has so far been hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once, dreams of every young couple who live in each kilobouse and raise children in this very beautiful environment. But the picture shows the opposite. Kibbtz, which is a place of socialism and the worship of the crazy people, with the crazy ideas that suppress every individual's freedom within the masses. The central philosophy of modern modern capitalism is: Your personality is the most important thing. You have to keep it in the middle, and no one else, but you are this thing. <br /> If you disagree with me in the political side, acting, the tone of the film, it's the script and the four sins that follow in it's direction. The film does not have a true visual text and no shots of it are remembered. It is also "sensitive", it's sensitive, it's not just the film in the movie, but rather the surface, it evokes emotion. <br /> Can anyone explain? Why did the film get so many prizes? Because it shows that Israel is hating social and human values ​​in accordance with the rest of the world? Or maybe it shows Israel a "delicate" place, not giving to etiquette and fanaticism? Do we feel that we are primarily human beings and good people, the capacity of emotions, especially when they become duplicates, like capitalism? Or perhaps one of Israel's biggest lies in recent years is because one is lying to justify the existence of the Jewish state? Whatever the answer, this is not good. Not to the Jews, not to human values, but to the world.
