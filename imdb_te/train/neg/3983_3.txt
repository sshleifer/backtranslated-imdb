Irene Dunne completed his career with this movie. After she was confused, she was not a classy actress, it was not in an unknown, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is not unique. It's pretty good in the first half which gets pretty stupid in the second half. Handwriting on the wall of Irene and exit. Even her high pitch voice came a bit annoying here. Rumor is not happy with this movie. <br /> <br /> This story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Speaking of this, I thought of David Nelson from the Ozzy & Harriet TV show, but it became a very young Richard Creena. He looked and looked like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Overall, the ultimate and ending with the ultimate sub-par for a great actress.
