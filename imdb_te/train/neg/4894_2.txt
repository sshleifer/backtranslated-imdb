Unimpressive, continuous shots, useless shots, useless scenes is what you will find in this movie. In other words, I was technically poor. Musical bits were enthusiastically directed (without dancing to actors from time to time, badly post-synchronized, bad and intuitive performance). <br /> <br /> This film is long and boring. In the end, this is somewhat point-and-less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas. Some comic elements are actually effective, especially the opening sequence. However, the film is worse and worse because it is impossible to understand and impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very much intimidated and it is not true for the movie. The difference between the trailer and the original image is very close to a tear.
