This is a page for "House of Exorcism", but many have confused the Miami masterpiece with "Lisa & the Devil", which explains the ridiculous high rating for "House of Exorcism." "Lisa & the Devil" was a critical success when it was shown at film festivals at the beginning of the 70s. The audience responded well to the gorgeous, Gothic horror film. Unfortunately this was a little ahead of time, and was considered very unusual, and not commercial enough for collective use. No distributor has purchased. Producer Alfredo Leone removed the original written scene and decided to edit 'Lisa' by adding new scenes that were originally shot two years later! It is noteworthy that these new and bizarre attachments are very low, so technically "House of Exorcism" is not a good image. The original product is slow, dreamy, classy product. A few minutes in the film, from the world of this dream suddenly looking at Lisa (two years old, and a very different haircut), chaotic sounds and crocoding epitopes from these tunes are "suck you my co @ k", etc. are tiny, huh? And the film will continue, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and grade Z "Exorcist" rip-off. Leone tried to incorporate these shock scenes. He failed miserably. When choosing to destroy "Lisa and the devil", Bauva declined, and was very beautiful to cut his image. He is right, and it should be very sad to see this artist destroy his work and dismantle the toilet. The original "Lisa and the Devil" appeared back on nightly television over several years before re-watching. I saw "Lisa" before seeing this new version, and one of my favorite films was such a devastating evidence. Worth worth only for curiosity. Avoid this artificial catastrophe, otherwise plague.
