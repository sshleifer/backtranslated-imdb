This film is going to me. The title is probably the greatest idea I've heard. I thought it was an independent film about their independent film planned to take a zombie outbreak and band together with the band, a stand-alone band, and independent of the independent film. Death is wrong! It comes to him as it comes from their graves to get the right revenge for zombie women about a psycho police with a weakness for his woman's arrests of arrests. You can see that there is nothing about a country or a county. <br /> <br /> For the first time, zombie women resemble Victoria's Secret pattern with dark hair and pale face. What are the zombies that feed on their primitive most basic needs but what are the intellectual, sensible, intelligent, killing-killing machines? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk about a poor movie noir movie and if they do not act like real zombies. Absolutely eating and killing, but where is the mindless and terrible failure? Although this is a very interesting concept and perhaps the greatest sarcasm on the zombie genre, it is fun of that genre and the question is "Why should not Zombies be the most beautiful and killing machines?" Asks. I would say that this film is made of garage jackies and is considered a really bad indie film made. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie styles, it's not just a shame and horror.
