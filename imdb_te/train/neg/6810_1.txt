To be honest, I do not like "Executive Decision" - this is very clear - it's very difficult, but compared to this piece of garbage, it's similar to the masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> People acting in the movie (the word actors are insulting all other actors) must attend more acting classes, even if the creator of the set does not find a plane away. It is very ridiculous, with only 3 airplane attendance in 747, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> The dirt in the film (eg, use sleep-gas, do not use it, use it anyway), which ultimately reduces my rating below. <br /> <br /> You need to re-dock a docker or a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.
