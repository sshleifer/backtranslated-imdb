If your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, if you really want to watch this movie, it will be a boy. <br /> <br /> After seeing a good movie like Asison (2003), it is terrible to see what they will do again in Indonesia. It is only the idea to make money, but nobody is serious about the work of Indonesia's film in the entertainment world. It's not 'Global' World that comes into mind of those who make films in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> Everything that has been taken over Indonesia's revenge is from the West's 'Made in Indonesia' flavor of the West. <br /> <br /> Well, the story begins. And it did not develop into a nice picture. But the director never really thought of any, all the music in the first place or at least a good playback, and the second good choreography? In this movie, playback SO BAD, it sounds like you read in the movie. <br /> You follow every single word, actor, or actor that you desire, and then sing it in the movie and it is very painful when watching the film. <br /> <br /> They thought the choreography to be dancing about the dance gymnastics, but ultimately it would be good to change the music ... they forgot to change the choreography. <br /> <br /> You can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is more romantic, DO!
