This is probably the worst movie ever seen. The storyline did not quite make sense and acting was terrifying. I am a big fan of Amber Benson, I usually feel like a wonderful actress and can not imagine why I decided to do this movie. Her character, Piper, was drunk for almost the entire film except the opening sequence. Plus, there are many points in the film which is very bad in acting, in fact I laughed out loudly. However, I do not recommend this film to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but 80 minutes of your life will be completely wasted.
