Absolute worst. It's not so terrible, because it's not going to be out of principle, but the plot is just curious. <br /> <br /> The unexpected star did nothing to solve the case - and no one really did anything - just ordinary police work. <br /> <br /> Finally you were hoping for a twist - and came with a huge feeling of despair. <br /> The ability to have a relative relationship in the kidnap clearly shows the potential. Could Lt personal intervention finally cloud his judgment? <br /> All clear signs are stranger. But a genius, such as Lt C, sees a ruthless plot involving a tape recorder who regularly plays a shirt chamber through a continuous conversation with her husband, but the masked groom surprises the bride, then hides the body and then shows the subtle bases. It may be good. This time is completely ruined.
