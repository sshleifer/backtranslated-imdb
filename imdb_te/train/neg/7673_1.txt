I do not know where to start. Tara Reid should be stopped in advance of another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got inspired by his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater slips through this vicious circle. Direction, editing, sound (not a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gun), costumes (bulletproof clothing with muscles), and hey, there is no significant story. It surprised me that no one was added to the project, "hey guys, it does not make sense, let's start." Hopefully Slater Career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> The worst picture I've ever seen is the hands down.
