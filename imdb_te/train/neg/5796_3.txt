I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and I was scared by graphic, sad-masochistic and child pornography. The story line is hidden under most graphic sex scenes - and is at least a bit romantic - there is more feeling of sickness. While director Shack goes on to the value, these characters explore why this way has different levels. If it's on the stomach, look at it - I still have past.
