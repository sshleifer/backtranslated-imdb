I did not spend money on going to the movie ---). This is nothing more than composition of some other classic titles, such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss. I do not really realize what the intention of creating this film is - there is nothing new in its story, it is also unrealistic. And there is no one to see - FX's looks like you've taken from a second hand store, you normally see all of the other movies. But that's definitely a good lazy.
