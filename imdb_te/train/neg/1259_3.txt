Thanks for Hollywood. Another movie classic is completely wasted by cheap, deep, impact-heavy and repetitive remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" is a thoughtful and thought-provoking film. It is a film that is totally baseless, it's very dull but very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, ends with pretty much conversations. Instead of a great image we get a very stupid two-hour chase image. The conversation is merely reduced, the role of interaction and development does not exist and it is difficult to determine what's going on over time. Instead, we'll get nonsense action scenes, some slight funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intellectual dialogues. <br /> <br /> The only thing to mention about the film is that it is absolutely fantastic. Makeup of monkeys is amazing, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful. Nevertheless, "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very poor and simple picture, paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and almost non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Hollywood attempts to stop funny movies by turning them into unintended blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Oh, no census has been done. <br/> * *, especially for visuals <br /> <br />
