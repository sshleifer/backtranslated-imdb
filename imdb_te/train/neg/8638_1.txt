Action, violence, sex, and coarse language are all the characters in the film. And what they are doing is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is known for his (violent) films (Commando, The Base). The story is stupid but stupid. Actors play their stupid roles very well ... I'm not saying stupid but they mean very bad actors. It is another low budget unknown B series action movie. If you see these bad movies like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or Misbegaten ... it will not be rented ... and the movies that I have said ... I will give them 1 and a half to 5 .
