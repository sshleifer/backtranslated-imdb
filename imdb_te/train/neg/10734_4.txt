I have read a negative professional review of this film. I think something is missing. It was initially intriguing, with three main characters entertaining each other in the bar in the late night at a vacant bar and the stories found. That's the best part. After three go through their different ways, the picture is divided into three threads. It's okay when setting up boredom. Certainly, the thread with the felicicus babuscos made of dolls from the cheese loaf is initially eye-opening curiosity. Unfortunately, the director defeats this matter with death, and sends a wild plots that will go somewhere in particular. Bottom line: A two-hour plot-thin listlessness. If you are suffering from insomnia, look at the bed and have a good night's sleep.
