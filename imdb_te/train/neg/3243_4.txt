The most important requirement for any movie that has been betrayed is that, at least occasionally, like one of us, their mute-witted marks, cops, mobs, and (ideally) each other. But this film never pull off this. Every scandal can be seen coming in a mile (especially biggen!). They are very interesting, complex or sophisticated. Maybe Mummy wanted to replace it for awesome dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are alright, but they're all distributing a stilted, weird, stylized way of thinking that we're doing some brilliant point about acting on time ... but it's not. For mental complexity, the main character is a bit effortless and some ridiculously feuding feudy slips as a prostitute about her father, but she gets on it. I really liked street scenes. I saw an Edward Hopper painting.
