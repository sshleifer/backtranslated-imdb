I see all the good reviews and it's not too quick to say this might be a good show. This performance is only good if you do not know what "talent" is. I'm also how dangerous it is (I know it's dangerous for most) .. people think it's funny to see what's upset .. It's our generation <br /> <br /> Usually plata <br /> <br /> It's a dangerous, self-centered, spoiled women (Sarah) <br /> One million times ... almost every joke does not happen or racism .. <br /> Sarah <br /> <br /> If you want to see hot women, everyone is dough And it happened, at the same time do not want to feel like crap if frafting and said the worst of the race, then this is the program for you ..
