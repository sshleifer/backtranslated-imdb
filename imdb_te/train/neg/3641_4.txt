Recap: According to mythology, Vakiri Braunhilda was broken down by Odin and bound to a peak surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a pure warrior in the heart goes through the Flames, Free Brunhilda and can release her from Odin's suit, and she has her. Now, the war in Norse lands has emerged, and the need for a coalition with King Bursars. Drugs include battles, blood and meat by Odin's walliaries, and thus the emergence of warfare in the war. The leader of the Burskars was King, Boar's disorganized son and his brother the future king, his brother Berke. But after winning the battle, he swears with him, leaving his remaining son, and betrays him and kills him. Bourne will be saved only through Birken's call on Odin. <br /> <br /> The battle between the two brothers had just begun. Some Viking grounds, a very low quality film about Viking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very sensitive, with a long and long shield, with sensitive and sturdy scenes and even with struggles. <br /> <br /> The foundation of the eesir myth is perfect and is very bad to me. Odin is very vengeful, hateful and absent, but I'm reminiscent of the school, and the jokes have turned into some vampire-monsters. <br /> <br /> In this film, the two brothers fought at the right time, with some good battles, the film was much better. Now the setting, suddenly changed the current day Stockholm. Still, there is Odin and sends Boyer and his Berzerker for Bruhilda and Burke, which offers silly scenes with barefoot-wearing and cutting Berzer's cuts between industries. Beautiful mountains and woods were exchanged for cement. <br /> <br /> As soon as I was allowed to focus on solitary conflicts instead of heavy fighting, I quickly saw that the actors' struggles and skills were slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> The final result is the narrow story, the harder and the other at times just silly, and the only action that is saved is taken from the action, slow, dull and clumsy cuts. It is very small from the Acer myth or Viking tradition. <br /> In the end, as a Sweden, the film is a bit confusing. South Africa has been filmed entirely, it still has some known Swedish codes, plates and a classic police car. Nevertheless, the effort is very low and only in Sweden it really goes so far. What names Swedish (the exception is probably an unfamiliar), the familiar scenery Swedish, they speak a bit (supposedly) Norwegian, not Swedish. And both uniforms, both the police and the medical, are not clearly Swedish. If they're trying to do it right - really give the fantasy set in Sweden, why are you struggling? <br /> <br />
