The last pair of Nelson Eddie and Jeanette MacDonalds is mainly misfire. The script is weak and displayed badly. It does not have any life in the film. Eddie and MacDonald have nothing to do with their singing in a painted concert for their final, thats just overcooked its just everything in this turkey.
