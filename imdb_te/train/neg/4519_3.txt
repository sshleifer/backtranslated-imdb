Three Stooges - Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 It is the first film to star in Stooges and it is very bad. It serves as a masterpiece of three dozen stooges in the world (from 1963). <br /> Stupid fools in a rocket space. They climb into a rocket and go to Venus. They have met some things with them, including a spoken unicorn called "uni", and they bring them back to the ground. "Yuni" speaks an average, pleasant person - oh, hello. How are you doing Here is the lovely planet. I hope you like it. ' <br /> <br /> There are very few gags and most scenes are just turned on and on. <br /> Stuccus will return from place and most of the movie goes away, but nobody has said that the filmmakers will continue for another 10 minutes if nothing happens. After the departure of Stuart's party, the film was almost over. <br /> <br /> The high point of the movie - Stuges damages a dapper mini song about their journey. Larry and Curly Joe beat the two pies. <br /> Another writer mentioned this music score. Huh? The only music I had observed was the two classic voices - I had to take Rockstones and play at the party. <br /> <br /> "The long sexy blonde" is good. <br /> <br /> Spooky - A brand new VHS video is only a store of 99 cents.
