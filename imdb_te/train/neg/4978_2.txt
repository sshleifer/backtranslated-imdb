This film was lost to me by crossbow RPG (rocket-based grenade). It was cut by someone and pasted a scene from Robboc. <br /> <br /> I've played the role of Chris Bruno from the TV show "The Dead Zone" and he played his role. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept the whole movie fixed - not what his cost was. They are from Old English to Modern English, in the same sentence sometimes slipping into all sorts of speeches. <br /> <br /> There are many comments on how this film differs from the source. However, on its own, the plot of this film is not good. It's just boring, it does not even have a low budget. If you have a low budget, you need at least a good story, dialogue and good acting. That does not cost a lot of things. Instead, they spent their money on half-donkey CGI and some good costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is very small to watch this movie.
