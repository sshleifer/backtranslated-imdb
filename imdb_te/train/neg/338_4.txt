This dissatisfaction about the kidnapped spiritual child, three hundred years dragons and a "selective" kidnapped in funny movies by Eddie Murphy of the funny man. <br /> <br /> Murphy's question marks the "first choice" man who is the "best person in the world". A lost and missing child explorer approaches a secret Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis), who says he is "The Chosen One" and finds his destiny to find and protect "The Golden Child". <br /> <br /> If the child dies, compassion will die with him, he will have compassion. <br /> <br /> If you do not ruin this hatches patch's trash, the film begins. The storyline is unreal and is enough to destroy the whole movie. Being another vehicle for comedy's comedic brand humor (comedy is not as great as you are), the film fails at many levels. Charles Dance also can not do much in the bad sordo numpse dealings. <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
