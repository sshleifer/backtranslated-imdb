Where to get started, I do not know where to start with and how many errors and horrors are about this film. Well, the two stooges written by this thief. Joseph Greene and Rex Carlton, for the first time, were not able to make their known minds a name. My guess is that they split the difference, so that's not the main header, but the end-screen head is not to say. Nothing about the medical profession is unknown. After all the doctors have taken the criteria to "do not harm". Killing a woman for head conversion is considered "harmful". Plus, a small thing called blood and tissue matching. The death of the rejection for the January in Panal is pronounced. Plus puts a patch work monster. What is a graduate of a medical school from Frankenstein University? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster does not name me, it makes me feel hell. Plus, excellent surgeon dock bill Bill Carter does not know how to keep a patient sedated? All and a disaster of an image, it is very stupid and unwatchable, except MST3K. I give a thanking turkey.
