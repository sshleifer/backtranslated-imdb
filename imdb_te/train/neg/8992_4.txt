This is a good effort but the screenwriter is a bit in the darkness of what exactly makes a zombie movie cool. No, it is not CGI bugs and software companies. Of course I'm not sure if this is a software company - I have not had a subtitle, so I had to guess what they were talking about. Whatever my point - do not waste your time mimicking a few dumb-grocery bugs, why more zombies and more do not throw in action. There are 2/3 news bulletins, bugs, and some people in 20 minutes. And the tragedies (more irritation) make the deaths occur off a lot off screen. I realized that this is quite common for any budget films, but I'm wondering why the director (or screenwriter, or whatever) started on the epidemic was a surprise to some of the best effects (well, kind of - it's small, no one will care.
