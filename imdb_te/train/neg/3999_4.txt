I have to say I'm disappointed with this film. I have never seen many BNL fans, their song type is childish and mysterious nostalgic (this is in the 9th class, if I have a million dollars, life's shoe box). However, I've seen clips of their live performance and really like the show's sophisticated and goofy nature. Unfortunately, I hoped the movie would be the most interesting part of the show, because their music is still well-played and not weak (the stand-up bass solo is in the middle, which is completely understandable and boring, even though Jim Craig himself dugs himself). And they only have a few moments (and they know that they have good moments), and they know that they have good moments (and "I'm really big", they are Afghanistan) While there were types of BNL and Effeil 99 or every 2 minutes, I returned to Canada, a month later that song * Again * ni elsewhere, of my own hand, I almost chewed. BNL is like this, years ago I was sitting around gunfire in Canada and remembering many favorite memories, "if I had a million dollars". BNL is a cult phenomenon in Canada, and most of their humor has a unique Canadian slant (the craft dinner is the most important for many students here, and the name "Gordon" is very brief in the Canadian) and I am somewhat thankful for the ambiguity. Then suddenly they all got heavily in all the states and everyone there they thought they branded this brand new band (yeah, they were brand new, but the rest of Canada "Oh Geez, I thought that Guys folded years ago, did I hear 'million dollars' again? /> <br /> concert footage is bad but not routine, shooting is not great, and from their huge free performance in Boston The things like the lipsticks are pretty much glowing.A funny bunch of interview guys are surprisingly dull, I think they are all old and they have families and houses and stuff settled down a bit.They have time to go to the spinal tap type of material, They release satiries, and then they laugh <br /> <br /> Interview with Moses Znaimer (a Canadian media mogule) and Terry David Mulligan (the music dude) quite unexpectedly and unexpectedly bridges into the top land. <br /> <br / > This film is not too documented too much, I mean, it's basically a program and at the beginning of the film, they already have a huge and huge tour entourage Igi, rising out of the darkness, and they are not the ones to popularize the "surprise", it is a paddhatiparanga plan out the event, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
