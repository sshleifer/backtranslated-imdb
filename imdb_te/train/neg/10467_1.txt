If there is a call to make a bad image reflecting how stupid humanity is made, it will take the prize. This storyline is centered around Bible prophecies, which is in hidden messages of the Scriptures, which seeks total control of the world. How many authors believe this author is stupid? <br /> Acting is fine. Casper van Dean made his talent in the film. Michael York's performance has played a good role for the film because he has done a job and a good job for the movie. <br /> <br /> This plot is sickening and very disturbing. This tender or immature mind should not be seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of floating mental illness around film rounds that can be found in ways to sell this kind of waste. Sensor to get a PG-13 rating, but still terrific.
