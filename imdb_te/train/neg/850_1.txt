This was the most stupid movie I've ever seen (forward spoilers)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little boy is unusual and they go to the hotels because his father is her guardian. We learn that the baby is a gift, "shining". This gift always has nothing to do except the child feels cool. This film is very boring and frustrating until it's gone crazy. Well, he feels it because he goes to a devastation killing Kid and his wife. Why would he do it? Suddenly we see a nude woman in the tub. The man kissing her and kills the dead body, it is completely frustrating. Somehow a black man dive into the hotel and whacked with an ax. Then take the baby and the woman with the black car and leave the father who dies in the year afterwards. Most movies are not a waste of time, but this right comes into that category. The music is trashy, except for characters (except for a good actor Jack Nicholson), the plot is sufficient for the twisted and vomiting description, the end is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This image is too overrated. All costs are away from this picture. I'm surprised that I have earned a high rating in IMDb.
