This film is not really terrible. Morrow commented that the American is a snacker of Europeans. But there is no Anglo-Saxon yahoo who does not care for French and French. <br /> <br /> Let us consider his stereotypical French features. <br /> <br /> Sinic - very stubborn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Recipes are great appreciated. <br /> <br /> Lighter work rule. Check. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that he is a great stockbroker since seeing him in a film that he might put in ten hours of work. <br /> <br /> Beautiful wife, check. <br /> <br /> Loose description of marriage vows. <br /> <br /> If you buy her dinner an American girl is a big sexual ego, which says you owe sex. <br /> If you're cheating or cheating, there's no reason to fall for this smuggler European twist than the script. <br /> On the other hand, having other male reviewers, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's beautiful, petite body. I give the film four stars. There are two of them.
