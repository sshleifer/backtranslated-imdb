When I was in school, when I read about a couple wandering around the trees and I was not halfway listening to this kind of failed aesthetic strategy, the Canadian film's clich√©: Suden Librisism is blank, metaphor-social commentary burdened. But the mistakes of my own film are very good after seeing this ... this ... the thing. For every thing, every bit of business here is fawned over four, five, six relentless minutes: for one thing, mine has 20 minutes, 85, and more content. The male lead is simply amazing, given the frustration of the drama-class between philosophical perceptions taken from a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep t pub, and given us the place and lots to make him hate. If he is not such a ** hole, then the third act also makes little sense, because the twin scarcity doods are shown to provide a distant and completely useless echo of the 'exploitation' values; But it's not easy to see the cloned crypipe in "please" momentum until the magazines go. I have a lot of confidence in its own unfortunately, the film's lyric and the worst Canadian film of all time. At least, I really really hope.
