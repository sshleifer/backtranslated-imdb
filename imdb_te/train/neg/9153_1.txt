I never posted a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! The film is very bad, I think it's a kitsch or a daddy. But it is not. This is true, self-intentioned bad. This was a serious attempt to fail. Other critics have highlighted many of the film's errors, so I try not to repeat this thing, but I've inspired you to see this film. I was speechless, literally disloyal, or rolling on the floor in the history of hysterics. I have not seen the movie for many years. In fact, my friends try to see it because it's the kind of picture to share with. My favorite episodes: - When Arthur goes through the exams (his dance is unbelievable) - thankless nudity (the director / veteran actor had to get a naked shot) - the cardboard and wax slit of Christ's Christ - Marriage palm trees and forgotten rings (what is the role of the hero?) - To catch his gun Former wife wrestling competition - a detailed scene that killed Arthur ancestor; Yes, my favorite brother - and my favorite, early soundtrack and the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as "Patchabelle's Cannon" - he shoots him with this incredibly slight match in D Major, with his bleeding hair and Veyo civilizations, yes, Soundtrack to close! - Go to the list - one must see !!!
