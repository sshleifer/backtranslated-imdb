This movie is very good. It plays Scot Bacula as a coach, but this is not important, the first four plays a role. At first it was at least 75 years old and still plays the role of a small league baseball, while he could run, although he could not run, he started the film in the Outfield. The coach's bass shimmered him in the first place, referring to the fact that he was in the same position as he tried to run. At the end of the back-up movie shows a more coaching coaching strategy (Spoiler), who tells his star player "downtown" to hit his home, which is clearly "bottom" good view. He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a small league team playing twins who were classmates class in the film. Royce's manager Tony Muser is the only coach in the back and the Royals can only lose one game, telling his players to hit every home in the batting.
