I rented and saw the movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading reviews about it. So, watching 15 minutes later I realized that something was wrong in this movie; It's terrific! <br /> <br /> If all the characters in the film are stupid, I think that the film is funny, Eli Roth (Mr. Director). He needs to know from the good horror-comedy films like "Fight Night", "The Last Boy" and "Living the Dead the Return of the Living Dead". <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason I have registered for www.IMDb.com and can release my thoughts about discontent. AAARGH! I have decided to watch for a second time and my movie has to make notes for "Review". "Resident Evil" (Horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Comedy) I can look over and over again and still have fun! But this ... <br /> <br /> How could the script and the director be? This is bad. <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, Henry hangs his dog out of its mouth and does not realize that the tongue is lying on the ground with the tongue and the dead is shining strangely <br /> <br /> The blonde who loves to bite the people does not explain anything about the long fur kid. <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("Woods?") "Nothing". <br /> <br /> The "attractive" bert of 5-pack is an example of how to start forest fire. . He prays for help and meets Henry, who wants to break the record using "F-Word" from here. Hert is great because Bert starts out. Bert: "Do not shoot me!" (He forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert cabin back to back but what about it? He meets Marci and Jeff with sex, but now suddenly decided to go for a walk! Bert had begun early (a moment of clarity for change), and Marcy had taken the advice of Bert Henry because he had killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Next, five estupodes are sitting around their camp and another veido looks with his dog. (What is a warning about forests? It's with veraidos and their dogs!) They do not sit with him because they have a big bag filled with cannabis. <br /> He was lying in their cabin all the time from their cabin !!!) Looks worse, almost like a zombie, Cover in the goo! He says he needs a doctor. But Young Einsteins will not help the poor to suck. He enters their unlock truck, which also has its key in the ignition. Henry seems almost smart enough to run hell out of there, but instead begins to sweep blood over all dashboard, seats and windows. A BB gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* huh?), A poker, and one (disinfectant) spray - is ready to face the same, unarmed and terrible sick person. (Clever script!) Bert performs to kill the car with a shot of his BB gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What do I want to do?" Bert shouts in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to hit Henry with their bat and poker, but instead crash the miss and truck's windows. Henry goes to the dumb girls: "He's coming to us!" (Thanks for the information, dumb width, I can see that! But he does not want you to do any harm!) Mercy makes sprays in his eyes, Henry sharp! And our "hero" pulled Paul Henry's hand out of the storm with a logged log that they neglected and put them in the cabin! (Where is that knowledge gone? I guess it started to take its toll on marijuana !:-) Henry turns away, turning away and screaming, runs away <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff head for a mechanic. And Mercy decides to "help" for help in the woods, as coming back with Paul Karen ... does not that sound idiot? <br /> <br /> I'm now going to cross my comments about how I suddenly see Marcy on a huge and closed river bank on Coneyio Roing because Marin Karen and Paul stood up! How did she come to Kano? Did she know where she would go? However, she goes to the river bank and looks at the big and unlikely cab that looks and sounds like the most horror film, runs inside the cabin: "Hello? Anybody?" Bert suddenly out of the back of the furniture and scares her (and me at first). And Jeff comes along, as well. How did they come here? Do they come to the river to swim ??? <br /> <br /> The Deputy Winston met with the attendant at the Cabin. He did not somehow notice blood on their truck. It takes about 35 minutes and I have decided to stop filming myself and get out of the DVD. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, you are in a favor and "Fright Night", "The Last Boy", or "The Return of the Living Dead". Then you are more entertaining than this thing. It is also a lousy movie "Toxic Avenger Part 2", way more ridiculous than "cabin fever".
