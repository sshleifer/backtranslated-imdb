Ah WINTER KILLS, based on the Richard Condon novel, which deals with a conspiracy that killed the President of the United States 20 years ago. Condon is also looking forward to seeing a sensational thriller to find out that he has played a similar game with the Monterey Candidate. <br /> <br /> Winter cold has left me cool. It's not a thriller - it's a piece of garbage that I have not worked with, which is the worst movie I have seen this month and in June I saw very bad images. In this direction and in both the script and William Ricert, the problem arises, then he should be utterly blamed for perplexing this defeat <br /> <br> Two things are wrong with the film. First off is the way fully displayed in the top fashion. David Nen and Peter Sellers are not like the OTT to be like the James Bond film, but the indoor edge of all of their performances is completely naked. If the movie has entertainment value, it's nothing. A sarcina is very silly, so silly it becomes almost unwatchable. The second is that they are very obscure in the scenes. Take a scene where the hero faced Lucy militia named Dawson, for example. Dawson tells the leader who is 30 seconds away, then cut it to the hero on a plane. <br /> <br /> Scenes start and end without poem or cause.
