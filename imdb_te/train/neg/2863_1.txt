I was happy to see this movie free because I was working in the hotel industry and got late to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this film is terrible acting and directing. How can you make a film? The director must be blacklisted, and for all poor actors, certainly not a jumping board career. Please make sure you can not watch this movie, acting is dull, camera and awful direction. There are some films that are called "less 10". Another example is "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give it to charity, so it works for good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I see another 10 (or at least once).
