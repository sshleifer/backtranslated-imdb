I see this film as a preview of Matthew Barney's art show. It is perfectly prepared for me. <br /> Great (Bjork) and photography are rich and colorful, but content is very tedious and predictable. Gee, I really need to see anyone wearing pearls to figure out what's up to Pearl Divers. The film is a tumultuous blend of Japanese cultural references and industrial scenes of modern whale technology used in mock-hunt / harvest. <br /> <br /> <br /> "The peaks" are unwanted shock-art images that are tuned to your stomach. <br /> <br /> What is the point of this film? Others argue that this is a reverse whale piece, arguing that it is somewhat whaling. Personally I think Barney's audience is "flashing" the audience with his pornography, defective, self-mutilation, and cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you understand Barney's art, it is not difficult to watch this movie. The message is unclear, the pace is slow and cultural references are excellent. If you're after shock-art, you'll be better off in many "dead-dead" movies, or hunter's old copy and take it in the Falk-Cartoon.
