I go in to the theater to embed away one night and see this one, I'm thinking in for a treat. Boy, I'm wrong. Considering the talent involved, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everyone in it has a bad reputation, and I find it really wonderful to read on this site, where people really liked it.
