... Then there's a good place to file this garbage. Sorry, it is not said to be a "mystery", which is the religious mumbo-jumbo. I'm looking forward to a "dazzling evil" that I promised, but "evil" in this movie is only unimaginable with learning disabilities at the age of five. <br /> I can not believe they can actually identify some big-name actors who are willing to take part in this difficulty. Unfortunately, this has changed my opinion about them anytime, and I can escape what they do in the future. <br /> <br /> Now I have a writer's name and the name of the director, and I'll be able to avoid the plague from now on. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that religious fans are posting here and this film is 10 out of 10, the first time they post their reviews. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film is more than religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> It turned off the video store to get my money back for false advertising. It's not really bad for me, for 105 minutes that I thought was really a Hollywood horror / supernatural film.
