An inconvenient Truth is a tornado slap created by rush and idiot republics, and it is like a public figure, until it kills something in your face, it dies in a few hundred years, it is already indisputable, but who cares, human beings, self-destructive, destructive creatures, About the extinction of human beings I do not waste my time. I call it "natural progression". Apocalypse must begin, but at the same time, we do not listen to the brass proposed by another "new society" and corrupt politicians, we are still wealthy, empowered and idiots who created the disaster in the first place. No one is changing. <br /> <br /> With the use of a customer, he is seen in a gas gauging car, and his fictitious image is very clear, he lives on a huge aerial land. Livestock, tobacco, pigs (related to methane gas gases) and his wealth are exploited, greed and investments are bigger and more controversial. I do not think this man deserves to be less fortunate, but his dignity is based on his opposition to another hilarious political party, in which he releases the same fraudulent features that politics and politicians are scared of. Will this bozo be living in comfortable life and yet he burns speeches and cut and technology of poor people in Africa about crop farming? He travels around the world with first class seats in fuel wastelized jets, uses computers placed in the documentary production, yet he thinks everything is a "moral issue". He fully absorbed in his own fraudulent nightmares, says he has got these resolutions from his sister's death (from tobacco-induced cancer and the death of his son through all the contents of automobile). Did he fight against tobacco companies or banned automobiles because they are dangerous hoolock mechanisms? NO. <br /> He is no different, the answer is not he. <br /> <br /> His indefinite and depressed efforts in human philosophy are dangerous, while he is filmed in the forest or with a little river coastline. Well Mr Gore, why do not you try to live like normal people? He is a politician, simple and simple, he has a career in investing in energy structure. My question is, why does not the earth look at the powerful industrial countries? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ " He said everything would go to hell. There is no interruption, but I'm definitely failing this problem, the way capitalism has taken for the planet, it's cost-effective and scarce. Once he has never said how industrialization has created these problems, he wants to make light bands on them, but not the entire repressive system. Its apparently he was spoiled, sent schools for Elitees and has the same fundamental temper on politics as any other re-stabbed, staggered dullard in Washington. Those who made this campaign are not different from the Republicans, but only the goals that are directed by capitalism. That is, anyone is going to benefit, and "new green" politicians supporting the venture capitalist companies who buy landlords are trying to develop "new technologies" with "new technologies." It's the same old story, Al Gore believes in Elitist production, and he really believes that America has "democracy", and I'm very innocent. If we do not pay salaries to oil companies, then we have to pay them to air and solar companies. <br /> <br /> The GW had something to do with the Bush downgrades, what he had to do with global warming, saying he was "united to defeat communism" in 1990, however, he tries to make emotional excitement among the people. In this sense, the systems in Europe and the USSR did not mean that communism in the world had never existed, being the tyranny of capitalism and capitalism, less than those of America's interests. The social ecology is not mentioned here, it is really a mockery. If you want to change the world, you must discard those ancient systems that are based on greed, extortion and violence.
