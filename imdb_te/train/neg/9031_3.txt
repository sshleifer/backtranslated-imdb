The play and revenge story play in the play was canceled by the absurd storyline line set on the fireworks platform. Why is a man in gangster's own building with the wife of the innocent mob owner's troop surrounding suspicious peers? Why would a delightful wife encourage the stranger's attention to her and expect her to keep her away and expect her husband and bored to live happily later with her new love? There must surely be a response from the cottage husband who gives the hero, here Kevin Costner, witty gore and torture is an excuse to indulge in the film. Anthony Quinn, he's a great actor, is definitely good, and Madleyline Stowe is a tragic guy who suffers so much as latches on her prince beautiful. Stowe was ok but she did not work with Spanish accent. Lesser players' characters are good, especially the Miguel Ferrer and John Legacyau and Sally Kirkland as interesting as a dying rock star.
