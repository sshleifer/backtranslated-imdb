This cutting piece is part of my curriculum when I study this movie. So imagine how I'm going to be done to finish. Believing that going through hell is very easy. Our professor told us that this film was some, but he never thought that we could accept or disagree. I do not think there are any gods on earth, we are human beings, so all filmmakers, so they can make mistakes, bad movies or even very bad. The main problem is to endless perspectives, but most people can not get it, every man has his own taste and his own opinion, so I think it's the greatest film ever made, even worse, and how it's two, but how many people Can you understand this correctly? So my professor believes in this film, and not just me. However, the only way to analyze this "thing" is to show us what to do with the original folk stories or the psychology, imagination and nature of this society. You have to say that Mr. Pierre Paolo Powellini is a script writer and the director is very unlikely to see in the first place. This movie is very ugly. I can not stand, learn about it, and find out the potential beauty in it !! This is beyond your mind's stupidity, and the film is not a case or wonder for anything, it's for staggering vision (pasolini). His work is too old to be developed. The deadly cinematic technique, the efficacy of illness, and terrific terrible things has all been bad. Miserable acting, useless cinematography, look very poor sets. Oh my God I've already nausea. Watching this movie can end your targeted violence, like taking a smart teeth by the orphan doctor is a real pain. There are more compassionate nightmares than this. So actually, how should it continue? Actually, you do not. This movie is not for you. Some guys are trying to connect some things like with the end of Pasolini as the murder of the really memorable scenery here (!) Where the tear into the eye of the camera.
