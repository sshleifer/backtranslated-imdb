First let me tell you that Dukes is not a fan, but the film then looked like a series law and order. Rossko and Bass Hogg's cast are the worst. Burt Reynolds is not boss hog, but worse M.C. Gainey as Rosco, show Rosco is not a hard ass cop if they have ever watched. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are common errors and cars that can not be destroyed. This was worse when General Billy joined the prick, and the general fell into a dirty hill, which was obviously sluggish, but won the race.
