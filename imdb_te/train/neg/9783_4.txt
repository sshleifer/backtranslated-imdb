The worst movie I've seen but definitely not the best one. I'm a paintball player, playing a lot of airball and going to air ball from forests is a big change. The film displays the same quality, with the film initially starting with the band trying to shoot the "Phantom" or they appear as a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autoccursors. A bush is a player. The movie is very wrong but how much more it is perceived as being too cheesy. Woodsball players who do not have a bunch of kids who have good money and have dreams of getting "good guns". Another team constantly chooses them and insults them by playing forests and blah blah blah. The forest in these forests leads to the forests and leads them in the training, where he defeats all the teams, including Air Ball and "Expert". <br /> What exactly is wrong with this picture? Well the budget is a huge thing, not a paintball movie is bad but the budget is pretty low and it feels like an amateur has happened. The film does not have big names and acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is very bad. They seem to understand that everyone is going to the speedball and all this other rubbish. It does not give a real sense of what a lousy picture and paintball in my opinion. The honest true paintball is not like all the buddies, it's not too "lying" and not a bonus, and playing through the rules. Do not watch this movie and shouted for a field "4 is 1 !!"
