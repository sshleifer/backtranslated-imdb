I really do not like this movie. The plot is predictable. Simple American plot, I'm sorry. Guy eventually gets the girl kind of thing. And Monorail in London? The Bank of London Bank of England is what it really is! - I liked the look of Tracy Island and Thunderbirds though. And brits are baddies? (Apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What's That Up Up? Oh and they kept saying things like "Thurn Birds" coming here - but it was not called 'Thunder Birds' in the series, why? I would like to see what I designed in 20 years with this British cast. I liked the original series. Sorry!
