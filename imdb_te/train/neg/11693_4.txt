A fun feeling, but less execution. Except for very good makeup effects, it does not have much. There are obvious problems; For example, after discovering that there are weeks and weeks to get the normal size from fat, the main character is thicker and thicker from the normal size of the days ... and once he is dead, he is a fairly deadly thinner <br /> <br /> It's a lot worse than the movie - cinematography is a low budget-TV-show quality All the acting is very beautifully looked awful all around. Robert John Burke has always been trying to do something with Charton Haysten hypocrisy and is very painful to see ... Lundinda Jenny and Kary Wuherer are both worse. If the film enters the third 1/3 or so and plays the role of Joe Montegna, the film is somewhat fun to watch the gangster's silly schemes to feel a fun, campy 'cheesyfest slaughterhouse' feel, and the abusive gipsy abuse. If imaginable, the ending is even better. Cycling in the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice, unless you are a King-O-Fiile or scared the Gypsy camp from Simpsons.
