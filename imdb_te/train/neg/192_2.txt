The beautiful part about this film is beautiful scenery. This film is long and boring. He must rest from his proclamations to his son Paul away from his teachings. How many times can the Lord's name be made in this picture from the Presbyterian background? It does not fit. I wish that the fiery, laughing, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt) was wiped out of the river without a boat without us. So Norm becomes a guru and Paul becomes a perfect gambler who wants to save the Norm but does not. It's very unhealthy. We saw three nasty whites about his native American girl. It was of some interest and it was said to have been developed as a true "wild west". There is a town that is sleeping though there are no two sons of the two ministers we see. But deal with Norminize's spouse and his family. 2. Stuffing his head should make stories and sins closed in the newspaper shop. Tie a lot of lemon juice and flies. I want to see a presentation about phishing, the film will never again.
