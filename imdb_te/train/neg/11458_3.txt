I remember Bo Derek's outrageous and UK press attention (particularly the Munich Sun & News of the world's magazines), following a minor role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Her photonic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly evolving breasts have made many movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting, and her fault never existed! I want you to make one of the triple disc collections that you always see in bargain DVDs, Orca, Tarzan the Ape Man and Bolero. <br /> <br /> You can nominate all of this movie "So Bad They Are Great". <br /> <br /> It is a "must necessarily" convict of mine! If you've ever read your press, or this comment Ms Derek, please do not worry - there's always a soft place for you and there are more important things in the world than your acting ability. Much Love. X
