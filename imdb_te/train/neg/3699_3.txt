<br /> <br /> If you want a comedy movie, the movie will be a major comedian in the film. It's not here. I want to be loud throughout the entire film, not in the last comedy-scene (which also feels ridiculous). This is what you can see when it comes to the TV, it does not cost rent for other money.
