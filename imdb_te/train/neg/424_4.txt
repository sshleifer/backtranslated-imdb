Yesterday I went to see the full-featured film-version of "Earth" by Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and DisneyEnter. I guess, like auto makers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do not care about the planet, I do not know, but it can help a particular unit be "nature". I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell my personal feelings about Disney at the age of one year? <br /> <br /> From the incredible cinematography, this is a simple Disney disappointment for me. Half-dozen Disney movie trailers, known as Disney Cliché ("Life Story", "Style With Folding"), Over-Dramatic Music, Recycle Footage (Disney "40% New Footage"). I also started to think that the James Earl Jones article is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his Warner Bros. story for Disney and Morgan Freeman is starting to work fine. <br /> <br /> I really bought Disney with some BBC nature photography, which was very fantastic, and they thought they would sell some orchestral music and notable sound-bites. <br /> <br /> Disney's chasing animals and killing baby animals? Half a dozen were such scenes, and young people were fired on the edges of their throat. I want Disney to recognize that I have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to action-movie-based teenagers who are dragging their parents in the film. I also realized how much Disney discontinued the idea of ​​a man with climate change. Are they afraid of rejection of minorities? Is it still a controversy? <br /> <br /> "At this time, British films are best seen in nature films.
