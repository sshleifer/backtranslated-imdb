"A Gentleman's Game" golf game uses a country club set to explain the invention of an adolescent about honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. Many times I thought this film was wrongly proved. Unfortunately, the moment that the film makers have ever known, the moment the film is defined, maybe Gary Sinise moves the "The Karate Kid" and brings any feelings that he's going to become a teacher of the teenage golfer. This is a very simple and reflexive film that follows the principles of movie-making, which is refreshing in a way. However, most of it comes as contrived. When people fall in the cap, all people lose their representative to civilization, or fail to stand for what they believe or are less revered than their place in society. Unfortunately, these moments do not have any clarity. And unless the fact that the club acts as a background for them, no real continuity or linking them. Authors and directors can not save the improved movies, especially the talented actors and some of the setup.
