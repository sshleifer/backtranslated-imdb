The film, The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, is completely worse. The acting is dreadful, which is very patriotic and its historical accuracy is never the best (historians have a field day). It has some good moments, but it is not enough to continue to be interested in a long time. Rating * Out of **********.
