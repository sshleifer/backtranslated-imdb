I have read all the rave reviews here and am impressed by the imagination of loved ones in this movie. I can not say I can not recommend it. The Leonard Cohen sound track is much less than a non-weighted measure. The image appears to be authentic, but it's a work to do and nothing has done: a serial plot (not a real problem for me), does not develop a lot of character, there is nothing like the theme. It just slogs along. Simone's "Heaven's Gate" has some of the genuine wonders and is the film I watch again. For an excellent remake of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is much better "McCabe."
