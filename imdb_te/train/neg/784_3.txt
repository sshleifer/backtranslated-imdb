<br /> The story is quite similar to other films, in which two young people need to cross the most common person in the immigrant family. The issues of her age, and the race traditions in her family fight against stress. She faces some of her problems and achievements because she chooses some kind of sport and falls in love with a local boy. <br /> <br /> But the fighter is much less productive than the two, which is just insulting to see. Samra Turan, "actress", plays the role of a young girl, probably can do many things, but she does not have one thing to work on. Her anemic and brutal, dramatic conditions on the screen, in which she tries to show some emotions, is terrible, her body and facial language enthusiastic actress, badly suggested by the director. The rest of the cast is slightly better, but they can not save the clich√© film with stereotypical characters and shallow stories. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Fighting is not just a reason to see, it's just boring. Slow motion is really unnecessary, choreography is fundamental and has lost motivation and most kung fu scenes are just standing in combat or in all kinds of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. A small and thinner girl is struggling with big and muscular guys, and not how ridiculous it is when their feet knock on them. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Europe because the film is the only reason observed. The first martial arts film from Denmark - the film is easy to advertise, but do not be fooled, it's not. <br /> <br /> Stupid Teenage girl and just a play about her problems, it's not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad image with difficult lines, acting and stories.
