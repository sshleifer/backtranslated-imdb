First, I'm not really a fan of "Fan's new ways to eat meat", but I'm a bad movie fanatic that my neighbor's neighbor always has a bad image. It is. So we started watching. First and foremost - it's recorded on the Camcorder Sans Tripod! The second is the voice of the bathing white doctor being told by a big black man! Third, nothing in the conversation is understandable. Fourth, zombie scenes, poorly decorative and tomato paste are ridiculous and chockful, however, lead me to believe the director (and my adjoining neighbors) need psychological help. It's about 5 minutes funny but old comes fast. It's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video earbook when it's naive .... with zombies. A note to anyone who is associated with the film - before I fell asleep, I spent 20 minutes in my life before I was asleep.
