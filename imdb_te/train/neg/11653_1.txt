The first is different and funny. This effort never missed the studio. This movie does not laugh at you. It is a weak effort at bulky humor. The film has chosen to break current and old films. At this time the jokes will be used and overdone. The audience I saw returned to Hannibal's dinner scene and was not asleep.
