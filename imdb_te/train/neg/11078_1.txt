Honestly, where can I start? This low-budget, funniest movie starring us is very cheesy for how much laughter we are getting lost! The sword-fighting scenes are not even sword-fights, they play around with a few plastic knives who have purchased at Wal-Mart and have tried to look all they're doing and look like they're struggling! Both me and my family were in one of the best action films, so we decided to go to the store and watch one, and it was a film of Savatoth Island. <br /> Oh and the plot of the film, Storyboard, Script, etc. I'm even worst why a group producer and producer also waste why making their time !! But if you make a mistake on this movie, do not get it !!!!!
