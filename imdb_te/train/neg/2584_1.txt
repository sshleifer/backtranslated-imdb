So, American pie: the 6th American film in the beta house series. However, the real trilogy and characters are none other than the original three American films, except for the characters in the Eugene Levy. (Did the guy get good venues?). <br /> <br /> The compliment is very low. There are no funny jokes. The acting is very painful, most notably the "south" girl, who appears to be acting as a Hilbill by using a Canadian woman's "yahl". This film looks like an idiot for me. No one can go to class (but everyone gets good grades), girls continually pick up their clothes, have undesirable sexual relationships with everyone without burdens of children and MTs, and you can photograph her family without her girl? Really, the series softened itself to the standards of soft core Porn. Perhaps next, they'll eventually break down and Ron Jeremy will be hired as main. I'm sure he will tie it in the series by removing his character Stifler's 3rd uncle once or something like that.
