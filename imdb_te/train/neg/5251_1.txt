This self-described "very talented artist" has made it easier to direct the 21st century's worst Spanish film. Lack of emotion, conformity, rhythm, skills, humor ... It repeats the same situation again and again. No character is developed. It does not show any violent and / or sexual content and does not add anything new to the mental-killer sub genre. An example of "what not to do" in the first film is to be shown in film schools. <br /> <br /> Where is BTW Hell "Talent"? There are scattered scenes; There are scenes with two or more master shots and it's terrible to see jumping from one master to another without a reason. The camera does not almost always move as "a very talented artist" scares the lack of visual skills. Actors who play major roles like enthusiasts, and the supporting cast is rarely reliable. The script has more holes than the plot (if ever). <br /> <br /> A really painful movie, and a very talented director.
