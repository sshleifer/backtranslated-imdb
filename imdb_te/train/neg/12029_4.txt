Generally, if I did not hear about a movie before I saw it on DVD, I found it to be a good reason. I was on a blockbuster on the other day and I did not hear about this film until I saw it on a shelf. <br /> All the movies had already been rented (I wanted to see anything), I thought I would give this one a shot. <br /> It's not much different than other movies. The genre like The Singles Ward or RM, if you come to the movies, you probably enjoy it. <br /> If you're not a marmon, this film probably will not appeal to you. There is no way to prevent the religious (mormon) message inside, and sometimes it looks perfectly and cheating. Finally, if you do not fall into the Mormon population, it is better to look at something else. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny moments in the film, but it is enough to save the entire movie.
