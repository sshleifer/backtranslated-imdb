"Rugrats" should have no plans for the classy-sipolo rebels, since the good and funny cartoon series from the category of the last three or four years to two-year-olds falling mediocre and really disappointing. In one km episode I looked at the other, even the snopper adding the new ones, the day after the dumbing down all of the characters, the Tommy and the dog every dog ​​(ex:. The baby has come, but the next episode, the dogs mentioned above do not), the creators think that the show may be a demonstration for compassion. <br /> <br /> I would say this is something special. Kimi is not as terrible as episodes, everyone is less than himself, grandfather (my god! He played an outstanding role in the show, but now he has no real benefit). The end is necessarily fluffy, and the only thing different between these and other crappy new episodes ('98 -'01) is that the children interact with adults. <br /> <br /> "The Rugrats All Growd Up" are not all stars. Classy-Clop, please remove this presentation before any worse.
