The film is very ignorant, it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I want to see "Darkness Falls" and I think this is a movie. Boy, no mistake! I sent it as fast as I could and I still could not get rid of boring moments. I'm jealous of people who paid to play or work in this film. They were actually given money for this trash. Is not that wonderful? I killed a guy in this movie, smashed a little grilled pieces into a tree grinder and a few minutes later the mother and the baby were not calm at the table. Please! Come on! Who cares for such films? Oh, and "Tooth Fairy" is lame. Not pretty afraid and it is clear that a bored stuntman wearing a badly made makeup.
