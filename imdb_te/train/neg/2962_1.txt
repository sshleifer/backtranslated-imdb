Movies about dinosaurs are entertaining. So Hupie Goldberg movies. <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes, "Theodore Rex", I came to a resolution: this film is bad. The evil, the wicked, the wicked and the audience is guilty of it. This side effect is not in danger. first of all <br /> <br />, hupi action movies are not good (I think that's not going to lie, "Fatal Beauty" look), but Chitra producers don 't care - she is a tough cop, yet again. <br /> One million people have seen police friends this week? <br /> <br /> Do not like cute, manual animated dinosaurs from the Spielberg TV show about them? /> <br /> you car chase <br, the shoot-out, sloppy speech, boring future FX and talented people (Goldberg, muller Stahl, Roundtree) is a tax write-off is difficult in a film? <br /> You've read this review by the end. You mock the sequel. <br /> You are not a star. <br /> If they really continue to "Theodore Rex", the Hollywood sensory-cracking foam rubber dinosaurs will attack the entire flock. <br /> Now, I have to pay to see.
