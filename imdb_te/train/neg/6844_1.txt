I have this copy in the VHS, I think they (television networks) play every twenty years every year. We can not forget and do not remember again and again and again. The directors' chair is like putting some people in there, not belonging to them. The film is similar to a woodward, for those who can not sing, or act. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peoples) just walked out of jail and returned to the old neighbors. Of course all-for-good-criminal offenses, of course working. <br /> <br /> John goes back to St. John's Street and children's dogs with the elderly and his companions, who dance and sing. <br /> <br /> If I make a sentiment, I would recommend it or someone smoking a prescription for a glaucoma. Whatever it was, the hooded life of the Ghetto was saturated, written, acted, and produced (I did not think it would sit). Nevertheless, I feel a piece of the story's ransom, with the Vennem gang fighting scenes and dance numbers, his friends take care of their neighbors and wish to keep Katrote safe and clean. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the spoon of Sony, Mario wins the Oscar compared to this rap. Oh well if you find yourself crazy and wanting to triple the three quarters intolerance, be sure to drink first. <br /> <br /> And, look responsibly. (No stars, good luck next time!)
