Imagine transforming the American national anthem into cartoon. <br /> <br /> A couple of cute animals, throw in a couple of terrible punches and roller skates and find the film with an almost perfect image. I rented my mother 5 times from the video shop. <br /> <br /> This story is not too bad, no marksystems have to be complained exactly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you do not like this movie.
