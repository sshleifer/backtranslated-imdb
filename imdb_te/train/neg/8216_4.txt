Fred Sadford is one of the "lips on the lips". It is for those who release this film on a unsuspecting people. <br /> <br /> This is good for the person in the "Rue Morgue", which is called this "Fender Helbender". <br /> <br /> Stop five young girls from home to a short cut home from high school football and stop asking for directions at a small store in the middle of nowhere. There the driver accidentally hits the SUV of a car & falling out of a headlight, but the girls all just leave & decide to go find the driver. But the driver had to find them, and it's just not got her head dinged on the vehicle, it is another reason that the girls still do not understand. When the driver first catches them, she (Yes, it's her) shotgun brings the gun and removes them and screams them, "How much did you see?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually, they return to the store and cause the woman's mental anguish. <br /> <br /> The elements of this film are very upset and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are bad acting, bad dialogue, and huge flaws of fidelity. A girl was hit by a shotgun explosion and it looks like she has been killed, and she is cool, her life goes before her eyes, but is not she good? How little does a small-run run on an empty gas tank with 80 miles per hour? <br /> <br /> The girls may end up with a vengeance, but after that the movie will continue, the climax, but they will learn some of the women who have set the woman and the driver is still " Worry about ", which is obviously in the throes of anyone. <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's very good and still quite scary and frightening to be so scary. But it will take the cake for the furor epilepsy and you'll want to put both your ears across to you to see this. No, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 10 to 4.
