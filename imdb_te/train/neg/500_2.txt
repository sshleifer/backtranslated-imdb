Blood Scarf Dance Leeds - no ridiculous title, it's totally misleading. <br /> <br /> The story consists of a murder mystery in a castle mainly on remote island. <Br / The film is very small. And when something awakens audiences from his stupor, it's unexpectedly humorous in the form of miserable dialogue by the hopeless group of disappointing comedians. These guys are actors of victims as they appear to be a group of preventive level marans. It's hard to notice how bad acting is when you dub this quietly. But the voice-artists can not claim the script. This is a mockery. Unexpectedly the best at the funny, the tragic. The simple story, at least say, is unequal. Women's characters are particularly dirty; <br /> <br /> The audience smells the whole company of pure exploitation. It's all about the screen, even when it prompts what's remotely and when the murders are (eventually) going on. <br /> <br /> Some people say that the film is in Jia. I agree with this opinion less. Anyone enjoying Italian thrillers should give this film a wide berth, there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. It is a soft-main romantic movie with a horror angle primarily. <br /> I can not recommend anyone.
