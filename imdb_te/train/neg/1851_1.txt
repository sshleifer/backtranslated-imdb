I suggested a "friend" with a taste or class to look at the work of Ron Atkins. If it's his sun's representative, I can not see him. It's an enthusiastic, self-sensitive, criminal, and criminal garbage. The group's "Where Mangler" hooker group killed is an angry low budget filmmaker. There is little nudity and some errors, but no single element from the joint fireworks is saved. The lighting is terrified, the dialogue is lethal and screaming mostly, and the direction is clueless. I saw Daco on American looting filmmakers in the recent Fungoria Convention. Atkins is one of those features. He spoke of something important about his work, but after its view, I did not see any import. Any style, or terrible video effects (such as solarisation) only increase the ambition. It's also nice. Avoid.
