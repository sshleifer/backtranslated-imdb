Everybody who commented on this film has done an amazing analysis of why this film is going to be very slow. I'm not going to comment, but the movie has many bugs, especially the author / director. <br /> <br /> I saw the original "The Wicker Man" and truly a clash of music, sensitivity, paganism in the modern world, and theological beliefs. It is not part of a group that does not want to reconstruct great movies. For example, I liked the 1950s original "Body Snatches Invasion", but enjoyed the 1978 remake equally. Two films can stand on their own. Another example is "The Thing". Actually, it is a campus compared to today's standards, and has been proud of the 1982 remake of Kurt Russell (my all-time favorite horror film). <br /> <br /> It is a small minority of people who liked the "The Whacker Man" to make it back because I can not blame me to separate this rubbish piece. <br /> <br /> This film is for me the Neil Labut's sexism and transgender tendencies. It also made wonder how the authorities wanting to make an incredible thriller, so the anti-green product of the anti-green one produces. There are so many female scenes in the cage just because he is bored with his missing investigation of a missing girl. Will he take such action on the island in other cases if he does not come up with suspects? The original religion and religion created a society in which women are equal partners in a religion-based religion. The threat to the main character comes from everyone, male and female. <br /> <br /> The beauties, drones, etc. are a bit heavy hand and are suitable ("the drone must die!"), especially the cage character Bee Allergies. Why did not the men of the island fight back, and why I thought it was just a matter of utilizing the physics to avoid such women as cuts. Not only are women with these special supernatural powers, half of them pregnant, the other half older and fat, and the rest of the girls and thin bland waiver, so if men really want to escape, they hates women. They are physically dominant. If they are dissatisfied, the tools to cut them have no guns or weapons. But if they are concerned about drones, are they unable to speak? They can be used as a threat to Cage, because they will save the society. Neil Lobot is believed to be a society driven by women by men, because they are drones. (The film was already made by "The Stephanie Wives"?) There were classics and equal citizens from men who feared what had happened when women wrapped their sheets. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to watch a movie with a male-female female association and create a sense of humor when cage women start to cope. I believe that I left the Integrated Community Society, putting sexuality and unemployment a livelihood, and pushing the discomfort of children in that island. No one likes pedophiles or children for sexual exploitation. How would a policeman respond if he saw the actions performed by adults with children? There is a logical mental illness that these children are being abandoned, so there is a need to protect the missing children and get help for all children. He said that his fianc√© and daughter created the thread of the story to encourage the lobbying cage's role. I do not think I need you. If any kid is abused, the elderly will save them. <br /> The child's cage "saves" is of course the irony of course that brings him death. <br /> This conversation is fictional and campy. The whole third law is hilarious. Audience I encrypt it (and eventually in the end). When I wrote the letter in the fancy handwriting, all the haystacks cut to show that the cage was wounded thought that the film was wrong. We do not need it. Show him that he has come to the island for the trial of the missing children. Most of us in America are "law and order" and other cop procedures. <br /> <br /> We come into the cage as Cage Partner solves a mystery. <br /> <br /> Very powerful ... ruined. Neil Lobot, your male stomach plays and stick to the head to talk to people who enjoy such flicks. Stay with your own company of men. Leave thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here's your jar of honey. I'll see.
