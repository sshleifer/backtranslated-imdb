This film is the only unique film you have ever seen. But this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails of this mess. It seems almost like a series of challenges you set out to figure out and decide whether or not you want to pay the money you have just paid. If you feel that you sit through this horrible movie and feel the pity for the actors, they all look good days, but then they actually do some money and you'll be kind to them as you have already done for the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know enough about this horrible film, and Ed Wood was the subject of it, it was definitely her work. <br /> <br /> You have never seen or heard a conversation, it's five minutes long. This is indicated above, to indicate that you have not read the viewer. Then we will meet Mr. Slater and the horrible lines of tragedy continue, if he only works to get the lines to the movie poster tag line. I will soon meet Stephen Dorff, and I usually enjoy it) and he will not drown in this way and he will eventually do that. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid plays a clever role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and she has to adhere to American films, but in my opinion, she constantly plays in films. <br /> When it comes to video, if you want to see for yourself everything, I know I got a kick, I'm all honest here, enjoy the faults of others.
