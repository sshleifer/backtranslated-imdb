I'm in the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have lived in Arlington for a few years. The film made him look like an Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of a scene! Texas has no mountains. I do not imagine when the film in Texas wants to be shot in Canada. The accents are also very bad. They have to earn stars from Texas to play parts. There are very exciting actors from Texas in Hollywood. This movie is really sad because it's a real story. I found the killer and pray that the guilty. A good thing is that she had an amber warning to help her find BC, we do not immediately after the kidnapping.
