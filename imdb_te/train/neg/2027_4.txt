Unlike the two other current game shows of Endemol USA (Deal or No No Deal and 1 vs. 100), this show is slow to what is going on the pacing screen. <br /> <br /> DND and 1 vs. Games pace - or end - at any time because 100 games can get away with slow bet. Every action the player takes is a risk, gifts are irregular, and it is difficult to leave players with significant money. Suspense is usually kept for good use. <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, is very slow. When a question is revealed and the player knows the correct answer is clear, you can be assured that after a few minutes you will not do anything amazing. This will help the pace of the show to reveal the correct answer to FIRST and the player chooses a dancer to talk about what went wrong when it comes to knowing the player is wrong instead of the shutting time. It's a random dancing filler. <br /> <br /> With enough time, you will be wasted a lot of time ... The fact that the players have time to spend a lot of time guaranteeing the initial guarantees. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong playback fan, but I have suffered for several hours. This requires major changes or early retirement.
