Winning the Vargas is just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Peter Sleetz concluded that he did not have the money to do the film he wanted to do and decided to take the easy path. Fails to unravel the current doctrines of "taking the current picture". Perhaps he is not well known. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to say. <br /> <br /> Some people, except for some viewers who are intellectually ill-intellectual in an attempt to duplicate realism, enjoy. <br /> I know I did not. Your favorite and pass in this picture.
