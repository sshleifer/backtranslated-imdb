Irwin Allen is great. His TV shows have a great pilot or first episode. The rest were mainly the seizures of his other performances. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson's rip off of his older TV shows. An episode of the Swiss Family is identical to the episode of Land of the Giants when a party member is supposed to supplement the operation. The show is high budget and very expensive to continue. Irwin lost his relationship with TV programs after 60s. Casting with Martin Milner is strong. Child Stars starts at this event, such as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. A bright spot, Irwin Allen, hurricane scenes and volcanic eruptions like his storm "Master of Disaster"
