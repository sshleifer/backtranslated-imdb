A woman (Silvia Crystal) attracts a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all stupid plot or something else. <br /> <br /> One of the most hassle romantic comedies ever. Does anyone know who this child is sexually exposed? Suppose I'm a young boy - if we are angry with a man who is misusing the young man. Sorry, but do not forgive it because it's a boy. It is still sick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> <br /> "I'm sleeping back in 1981 as a theater, with 19 and my 14-year-old cousin (who easily pass for 18) and he wanted to see it - I did not do but what heck did I do? I got tickets and I really bought tickets for three young boys ages perfectly. My cousin idea was boring and three other kids left by half ! Let me make this clear - Three teenage boy s tons of nudity woman dropped from the film! It can tell you how much of what is bad. I'm surprised that this was never released. One way to 1.
