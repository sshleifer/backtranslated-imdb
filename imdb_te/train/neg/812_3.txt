I was disappointed with "K-911". There is no original "good" quality of "K-9". It's more like sitcom! Some of the cast from the original movie came back and some of my memory came back. Doolie Captain now plays a scene from the old comedy show. It's crazy. What is the deal with Police Change? They look like LAPD now! San Diego is not PD. It's a completely different movie "
