This film is worth watching when Nicholson is on the screen. Nevertheless, I had to fight to get out of boredom based on Meryl Streep to bring scenes without Jack; As bland as she might be. The relationship between the characters is not unique; These characters are pre-filmed - and better. It is assumed to be a real-virtual scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring, and it's not worth writing or watching about it. It's interesting for me why Effron experienced her life and escaped with Karl Bernstein. Perhaps she wrote it as therapy - for most writers, a part of their life is epitomized as epitomized. Fine: But I think this story is valuable to anyone in Hollywood.
