I've seen these unpleasant images in a film that is five years old. I have never been there ever since. <br /> <br /> This "movie" filled with drug-inspired images that reduce the average tension of your average asylum residence, is not children, especially children, despite its colorful appearance. A poor boy who fits innocently destroys the drum of his classmate (wait for it) by turning his head; Yes, keeping his HEAD through it. But not my friends! <br /> <br /> The film: Wizard of Oz, and where wild Things Are, <br /> <br /> This seven-feet yellow cousin of Barney makes friends with this poor boy and falls in despair. <br /> <br /> And, a wonderful friend of the humorous crew, including a grandparents and doped-up "dragons", added a mess of marmalade to add a non-vegetarian boat, a non-vegetarian boat. The most camouflaged film in the midst of these chaos is called the "Witchiepoo" (?). However, she has problems related to her: with a clear plastic mask with her facial expression moving her facial expression, its gas level is always at its lowest level in very short moments. As a result, one of her favorite times drowned in nose-diving water, she distinguished Pumpsthef's land from her deterioration and deteriorating residence (I do not know what I wanted to live). <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie that has similar effects on its audience like the exosist, this is for you. Enjoy.
