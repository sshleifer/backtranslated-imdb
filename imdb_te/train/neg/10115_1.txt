I have done my personal work to go to those responsible for the film. <br /> When I argued that I had been involved in false propaganda, I got a rental company to return my money. <br /> <br /> This film is a p.o.s. This is not enough, but the cover art sold me. I've finished my kids good makeup effects at Halloween than the film actually depicts versus art art. <br /> <br /> I'm going to waste more detail on the upcoming details but come, the main character of the film, raised in Alabama - but has a German accent! This is insulting.
