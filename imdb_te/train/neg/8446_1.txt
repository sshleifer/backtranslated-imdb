The worst image I have ever seen so far ... where do I tell where I should be laughed? There is no single reference or shadow of an idea. The three main actors, especially the Cecilian from Sicily, make a Sicilian accent (I think Aldo). About the insertion of Dracula about the Dracula ... The film's "film" is another purpose that has been taken from the worst cabaret tradition to spend some time. Massironi and Littizzetto know what they do, but this so-called film is really very difficult to protect, too. I gave "0" / 10, but the lowest mark 1/10 and I had to overestimate it by a mark.
