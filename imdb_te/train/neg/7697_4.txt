This short-range is much more entertaining than some of the big budgets and innovative aspirations. SOTD now comes between entertainment spectrum between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff". Even though it is not long enough (about 3 hours), I think the kids would love it a little bit. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes" and is not very romance or other "icky" stuff. When you're younger, you are not very critical of rubber knives, campy acting and recurring scenes. (At least two scenes repeat in the same way as older cinematic serials to accelerate the audience) Finally, children generally agree with American English conversations, which are actors in Asia. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give three stars to this film, but I thought it was the director, the producers and the cast. At least some additional credit qualifies to run through the project. This film is not art, but it's like painting your house, it took some time, effort and discipline. <br /> <br /> All your recommendations are not use, <br /> Oh, yes ... hey, IMDB! "Dialog" is a preference and a traditional spelling. Your spell checking "dialog" is expected to be the correct spelling. Although "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED assume that it is an alternative form.
