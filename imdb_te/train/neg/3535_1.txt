Okay. Who is this Who gave the revolver 10 in 10? Are you tripping over your head over extasi pipes? There are many of you. Did you do it for courage? What is this kind of tradition? Or Guy Richie 787 times signing under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I could say anything, I would say this. It's not the movie because you do not understand. Perhaps you have a bad day in work or you're sitting in line with your wife and you're sitting in the mood when you watch the movie. Perhaps a more basic stumbling block is that you have a more mental ability or a well-developed philosophical sense to stay in touch with it. But. And it's too big but too big. <br /> <br /> Do not be confused with the complexity of the complexity, please do not worry for the two-hour non-squirting film interesting. Really. You may think that you are pretty smart. You can also think of yourself as a natural person: an independent thinker arranges a masterpiece against a group of nerishers like the Gorrell. Please do not. You are upsetting yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is the waste of everyone's time. If you think about a few minutes, you'll recognize it. It's a waste of darkness, a waste of staff, waste of staff, cataracts waste and precarious minutes (you can not get back to what you know). Unfortunately, this vicious, wretched <br /> "No - wait," a voice comes in the darkness. "If you do not understand, if its non-liar is not exactly the story, it's REALLY AUTEUR's COMPLEX and the useful work, it's complicated moving questions, and anyway - when FIGHT CLUB first came into it - did you hear it - because they could not deal with COMPLEXITY <br /> <br /> You hate to be discouraged, but I'm a big lynch fan. Although I have studied briefly a few years ago, philosophy has a lot to do with me, and I do not like the revolver for these reasons, and I do not like it because it's a heavy, big-brain Thinking about things but it's ridiculous in such a humiliating surface Arito deals. I'm not a chess player, but also an unhealthy idea of ​​Richie's chess works is that the four-year-old. I did not want the characters because, without exception, completely away from me. "Wow!" Richie apologized. "Guy cleverly connects his hat to Brett!" You may be right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fight Club Acid-Tangguette, you will laugh at the dialogue. The revolver refuses the one-liner who has blood on your ears. Fight Club is a great twist that makes you reassess everything that happens. The revolver is, until I say, because there are many inappropriate turns that provide no satisfaction ... well, they do not make sense. If you pull out the rug from under the people, they eventually kick you from their home. And then they locked all the doors and windows. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie's being temporary is to reconcile the mantra of small buzz-phrases. Most often they speak, but often they flash up on the screen allegedly. It is almost disheartened. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly noticeable, so we can marry bizarrely with bored gangster cliches in the world that is incomprehensible in this way. Finally its inaccurate. You do not care about anything. You can not understand anything. <br /> Really, there is a bit that I really like: a great murderer who has a crisis of self-confidence. He is great. But I'll see this picture to see him. He is only a few minutes away. <br /> Please believe me. It's terrible.
