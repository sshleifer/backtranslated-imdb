"Stella", a fierce Taraccair who plays the title role of Betta Midler, Upstate set in New York, Stella Claire works nights as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in a craftsman's salon. One night, a garbage expert, Stephen Dallas, plays the role of Stella, and meets her in their affair. She spurns her marriage and abortion two of her offers, sends him packing to a profitable medical profession, and her daughter raises her poverty. Flash-forward was 16 years old and the daughter grew into a beautiful, loving, young woman. Doctor Dallas is not from the film, but has a sharp and more attentive relationship with her daughter? I'm still worse and worse, making the film sound somewhat interesting. Acting and screenwriting so let's give you a groove in almost every scene. Chief Offender Betty Midler, but his alcoholic owner is John Goodman. Each scene feels more contrived than the previous one, which is really owl. This film is not more than a grade d, but as a camp, it is untold B + scores.
