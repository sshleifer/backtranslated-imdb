Until so far I have not seen a worst picture. I've seen pretty pretty awkward movies in my time but this means they take cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is very bad that I believe one word to describe the way you create it after creating this bad idea. If you are looking at this and want to see that annoying purple dinosaur's Thirty minutes of Barney, fold your thirty times and you'll still get a little fraction of the horrors that will only be in store. In the summer, I really guess you can call a horror movie, but only if you are willing to be worried about the worst acting in the business and knowledgeable through a fully understandable story. <br /> Real Rating, -10 Disgrace
