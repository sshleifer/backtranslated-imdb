I have to confess that I was deeply disappointed. <br /> This version did not compete with the 1995 version. Wentworth and Rupert Perry-Jones looked like the captain I imagined when I read the book. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is the quality that can only be achieved in the movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Eliot does not travel through the streets of Bath in this way. It was not in her role and it was not made by a woman at those times. Anne Elliot of the book is a woman and her honor. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they have warned those who are completely inappropriate moments, the book that is another important part of the book. <br /> If this version is less than the other one, everything seems to be beside it. Little attention was taken to introduce characters, showing their illusions and intentions. Important scenes are omitted. Have they probably killed the last scenes in this way? A disaster! <br /> <br /> It is not very beautiful. <br /> No, no, no. If you love Aston, do not waste your time.
