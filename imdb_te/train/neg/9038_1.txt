This was a terrible product of Bartlebilby, although the other critic was "unacceptable" because it was kept but the version did not perform the spirit of the book. This is almost a storytelling story. Looking at it, I can change the pages in my book and follow it, it's not too fun to deal with a follow up. Besides, see BartleB's 2001 version of Crispin Glover. That version, while joking, preserves the spirit of the novel and brings new details in the film. What is important is not related to topics such as arrangement, character names, and costumes. The difference between the film and the version is like night and day, tedious and happy. This version is a lesson of what's going to happen because maintaining a poor, painful, wholehearted skull.
