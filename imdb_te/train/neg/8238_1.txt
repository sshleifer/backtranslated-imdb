The film is the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not sit through the whole thing. I also think the author should have some weird fetish for peeing and crapping puking ... I mean what's all about! I can not believe that I'm also disgusted at this # 4 and Â£ 4 rental fee #wingwasted. Both the quality and sound quality are terrible, acting ... well. It reminds me of 1 cup of 2 girls who need a poorly-needed and pee, garbage and Puuk scenes for a movie. Resistance ........ The girls looked like they were picking up the street and only came to COS as part of their willingness to take their tops ... While these girls had nice corporations it was absolutely awkward to their attentiveness <br /> <br /> It's probably worse (probably worse) than an ammover school product and hey does not need a set because it's just around a car? <br /> "Sorry my first comment was terribly negative but I found something positive to say and I would like to feel like I can save someone else wasting their money.
