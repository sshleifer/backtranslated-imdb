A photographer who dreams of killing his specimens is a cast of 1980's TV movie and TV series guest stars (such as Misty Rove, Pamela Hemsley, Clevel's Little, Seymour Castle). <br /> <br /> There is enough nudity and violence to get R's rating in a very good thriller, but there is not enough good enough for anything to come true. Interest. It is best described as a film given by Cable Channel Cinemax Schenamix Alternative Name. I can not really see this watching point unless you see every worst thriller out there. (I have to comment that this film might be filled with smokers, it's ridiculous when it's in light of anyone)
