The first half of this version is the best I've ever seen (I think I've made every version of Jane Eyre so far). Jane's childhood and character development is exceptional. Then, "Oh Oh, it's running too long" and the rest of the story was cut into pieces. The main sights, including all included, drawn, combined, and completely out of the line are altered. Very little transformation or scene development can make it difficult for someone to get to know the story well. The big disappointment began with a lot of hope, and then all ended.
