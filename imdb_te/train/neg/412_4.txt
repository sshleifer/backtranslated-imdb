In the sci-fi scope, two distinct themes steadily increase interest, first explored in previous film literature, and since then, filmmakers and writers have often returned to different levels of success. The first theme to spend time, cine fans, as well as HG Wells Classic, another time version of The Time Machine, has been an unpredictable attraction for fans on the recent screen. The second theme that captures audiences in the thrill is invisible, which prompted fiction with endless and endless possibilities. This theme also includes another HG Wells Classic became the foundation for the movie received from 'The Invisible Man', where it was directed by Paul Holloyn and 'Hollow Man', and Kevin Bacon Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Cain (Bacon) and his colleagues briefly conduct experiments for the US government, explore the possibility of disappearance and originality, of their method of testing primates. In fact, they came up with the idea that they would affect the invisibility. Their only problem now brings the original original visibility. It's a problem, though, Caine, after a lot of effort in the laborious effort and the lab - or he thinks. And if it is successful to implement his theory on the subject of the project, he decides to submit the results of the Board of Directors in an attempt to fund the project's continuity. At the last minute, however, Caine demurs, worried that project control wrested him out of control before they could carry on to the next level - a test of a human subject. And by taking up his research team's collaboration, he takes over his head, by telling them that the board has given approval. But if something goes wrong, and Kaiyin gets caught on his garment for the invisibility; And in the struggle to find a solution to his considerable confusion before he and his band are too late, it begins to exclude Kinay's mind. And suddenly, the fear of losing money and losing control is becoming increasingly common, as he faces danger of losing more than his. Now he has a real opportunity to lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Initially an inspiring, even thought provocative picture crafted what Verhoeven; He founded a good pace and had a great effect on his disposal of F / X, but spectacular scenes allow him to overtake the development. Anyone who knows about 'disappearing man' or anyone who can logically follow the story's story, will initially find that Cain is not guided at happy times. Still, Verhoeven is certainly the storytelling style that is grabbing attention and going closer to his audience. But he was seen as bent on rumors of climax, and he was successful at any cost and his film was successful, which was an unsuccessful blood and Gore Fest appealed to his audience and everything he worked in the film. Instead of seeking an intellectual resolution to the pain of Cain, rather than using some creativity and imagination to portray the end of the end, Verhoeen takes a low road and is completely successful at the visceral level, meaning any meaning derived from the story is diluted as many ashes in the air, a memorable film. <br /> <br /> The Verohevane is much higher than what is given in this genre and makes it much less unnecessarily sinking. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon works to create a reliable role of a good job, if only on the surface, it works in the interests of Veroovan. Bacon is deeply in depth, but has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities. Bernanke can not allow time to develop Kane; The character primarily consists of a vessel that can build its story and eventually it works. However, the film was well-worked, although Veroheven and Bacon were more cooperative to develop a relationship between Ken and the audience, while some of the audience's part had some emotional involvement, as little as little drawn to them. <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Shui himself linda McKay The character is well composed, fortunately experimentally, but basically a little fun Is a thankless part that offers, especially the talented actor of the shoe. This is said in the Kim Dickens (2001 film, 'Things Behind the Sun'). Her character, Sarah Kennedy, makes little more than the action and F / X support. <br /> <br /> Assistant cast Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Granberg (Carter), Joe Slatnick (Frank)), Mary Randell (Janice) and William Devon (Dr. Kramer). Although one hit (and lower) level, 'The Hollow Man' is one of those films you think. Annual fireworks performance, which gives you some momentary thrills, but after a little later you start mixing with all the others you've seen, without being set separately. And it's very bad, given the talents and capabilities of those here, it may be more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
