At the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedey's Gunt's next day film is creatively used, more than one harmful bad image. If a nasty Betty Davis-type character can come in her way, she convinces her if it is going to be awesome. Unfortunately, I do not find many other reasons for seeing this. You wondered how Shade looked in a vintage glass couple (but why for anyone?) Your answer here. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sexually-laden crazy woman is really tiresome, and if you like this kind of thing, I would have to accept the tensions in these teens. The drunken broth of the insurance agent's savage is equally unpleasant but at least it is a small character. Among the leading actors, Nicholas Walker does not have any sympathy for Paul Keller's plight and his performance is a woodwork. Dara Tomanovich is good and some of his scenes with Shetty increases. Sheidi's precise, poor performance (she is often seen as an automatic pilot) is admirable, but with the rest of it. The sets are drab, the camera's work is undistinguished.
