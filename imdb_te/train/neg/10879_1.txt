Thick, sluggish, bloated !!! A 90-minute cringe-fest is 89 minutes long. The climax with the atmosphere and the probability (abandoned convent) creates a stinker in a filled oh-hard and intellectual script with a hard-hitting conversation. It is often frustrating, and attempts at the Gonzo Horror (a model of this movie dialogue: After performing her artillery, Barley's alarmed character's shot of Fast Dolly, she: "Any questions?" Is a hi haik hike). Judging from bad acting, idiot, gay jokes and creature effects, 'The Evil Dead' can be seen many times as the director sees. <br /> My friends have a big time for renting this turkey. What a turd.
