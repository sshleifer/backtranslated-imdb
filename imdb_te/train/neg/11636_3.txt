I'm not going to waste my time writing an article and going to waste your time. Nevertheless, I said that those who judge the film are totally ridiculous. You can not play that card, and I understand nationalist card card, and people can not see this movie. Although the director is German and he deserves a slap on the wrist every time he arrives for the camera, this is the film that expresses his free will (in that card played), but the world is controversial and the same thing you heard of the GTA dispute. It's not a comedy, laughter, and hateful, it's not discomfortable, its dark humor, and obviously you do not have the heart to take, the past is past, yes people remember those who lost, but its time, 7 !!! Years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> I am mad and need the soul?
