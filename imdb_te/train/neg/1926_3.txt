My kids have been forced to pass my verdict on this version of the classic story of Dr. Seuss, forcing my dad to see at least 10 times each of the last 2 crimals, and well ... it's not very good. First, the classic action like Chuck Jones's animated TV special can be difficult for anybody, but this commentary is very big and is nicely negative. I agree that there are quite a few of the inspired clothes, but the overall amount of the movie is pulled into cash, which clearly illustrates the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrie is usually at the top here, but completely different from the character of Grinch. As Boris Karloff described, he was a slow flame; Method and sly. There is no method for Cherry's madness, and this is a very clear error. The talented actors such as Jeffrey Tombor and Christine Burnski were thoroughly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand Tony Hopkins's role (like his native Michael Caine), but the film is to be filmed under "Never Films". This does not make the cat bad in the hat, the thinner Tom ready for Universal Christmas. I feel that in this case I will do the same recommendation: Skip, and read the book or see TV specialty. It can never be returned for 2 hours, never again.
