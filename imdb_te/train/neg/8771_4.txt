Well, I'm bored and decided to watch this movie. But the main thing I brought the movie was that it was an hour of footage, and then the same hour was repeated 4 times. It will have 1. Assemble the troops and discuss the attack plan, 2. Men's wives flashbacks 3. Method of marching in a long line 4. Men run to the hill and shooting, to get shot in the first head, and then another 3 people have been rescued. 5. Call the base to tell about the defeat and victory of the enemy 6. Men wives flashing back and singing 10 minutes songs. This is the primary film, and the events took place 4 or 5 times in the same sequence. And every time he made a spouse for his wives, it shows him his wife and him. There were a maximum of 10 men or more people, which took up tons of time. Except, men can not kill their enemies except the bayonets or the grenade. I liked music and had a lot of actions, but that action was repeated. Overall, I probably can not see again, but it's not so terrible.
