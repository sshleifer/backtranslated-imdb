I have read other commentary about this film, and I'm not usually the hardest in my criticism because I am trying to be a good person. However, this film is one of the worst ever movies I've ever seen (and it's very bad USA USA and Cinemax nights). This movie was lost to me before any movie. I really think these people are mad. Save your time and do not look at this fllm. Please - I wish I could. Acting is terrible, plot (no plot) STUPID and insulting and insane. I do not really think it will be made into this film. But I'm trying to protect you from my opinion, and waste your time.
