This woman stops talking throughout the film. She remembered each line and delivered it all without a bit of natural emotion. She has a very exceptional lysp, and her pitch is like a nail on a blackboard. This film has a lot more Betsy Drake, and not enough Cory Grant, he has completely left his own film.
