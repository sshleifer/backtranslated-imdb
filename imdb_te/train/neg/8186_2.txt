Anyone read the script. It should be some of the worst writing and direction of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Gaymitti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could pull this one out. Approximately two-thirds of the people say giant eyes, I can not believe that I will sign the deal. It's not the worst image I saw, but it's really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what can be said? Well, the picture does not just move with Vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character just is a creepy person you can not get past. It's just an understated walk, that no one seemed to get into.
