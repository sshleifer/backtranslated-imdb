The first two images in the series (eg Alligator Fight was used for the last time), using tons of stock footage, rather than the tricker horn, was one of the weakest films in the MGM series. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Tarzan and his companion are very large after the film's finest film. <br /> <br /> The plot is Jane's cousins, 'come back to claim it. They are in some kind of bondage from relatives who have left the relative who left their money. As a great white hunter who tries to capture Tarzan and make him happy to sell him, the pair are common jungle hazards (mostly due to stock footage). Tak Jane decides to go to civilization and tarzan and james are faced with kisses. Finally, in the last half an hour, the plot is placed in motion to capture the tarzan and the last things are interesting, all of which are very horrible. <br /> An enigmatic product. The film has been collected from several different films with the first half of the first repetition of the first film. The third shows between the things stretch out and the signs of having plots that eventually went somewhere. Tarzan is captured and the last third party party is in danger, which eventually comes to life (it also shows the signs of graphic violence that require much of the film's re-filming). I know the great surprise of how this sequence will continue from here because this film is not good (except at last). I have to force myself to explain that, as Tarzan and Jane waiters and Ousleywon people are coming back. <br /> I really like this movie with the appearance of Tarzan tree and it is even more amazing.) I really did not like the first hour or so of this film and find a great waste of time and energy. If you can come to the end, I try the movie. Otherwise I will cross the whole movie and go to the next movie.
