I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. Acting is the worst I have seen in so long. Lighting and sound are the best. The plot is less clear though free (alert: I do not advise watching this movie when it's clever). This movie looks like you watch the home movie of a man who does not come out of it. It's really a shame I went to such waste with very little money to spend in this project, and I look forward to it if any of those envoled still have a career, it's the only "star" who's other than Eva Lauderia and it could clearly hit with the bad acting stick. I'm sorry that this criticism is not constructive, but I've told James Cahill something, and do not try again. In the words of Squirlyem "It is not bad in the good branch".
