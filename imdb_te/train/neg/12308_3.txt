Even Steve Martin and Don Aykroyd could not save this image from laying an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silver Stars TV series, it has been bombarded: a) It was updated to the 1990s and became a confusing, weak and silly screen play on the general premise of the B) TV series. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray the affordable characters of laughing simple and happy mockery. In the 1990s, the building has been struggling to expand, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit on this stinker for the second time.
