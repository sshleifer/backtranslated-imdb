This is a bigger budget film than the art director Honda (with clearly defined sets). Special effects still have a distinctive bite (large bats and rats on display). Joseph Cotton's director looks ill and weak (but his role is 204 years old!), A dangerous Richard Zekel photographer hero, chief villains, we get Caesar Romero and Patricia Medina (two campus camps). As I often said, I grew up watching English-language films in Italian. But it is absolutely another thing to hear from Japanese actors in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Lately ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Vern adventure, and that is quite entertaining at that level; In fact, because of the characteristic controversial attraction of the setup in this case, it is best for Honda's low-brow variations on monsters-destructive formula. Has the protagonist Romero been kidnapped by a famous scientist? He was intended to establish himself in the underwater, technologically advanced city of Cotton (the world's first minds being appointed). We are treating plenty of silly battles between rival subs, but most amusing scenes are definitely the raid in the Romero cave ?? In fact, Cotton must be hunted by men in blood attacks and excluding through lasers released from his armhole) to be precisely calculated in his acting career; The other big, cast of the cast, is more in his element? After all, he is the Batman TV series and the Joker in the 1960s movie! Cuttle is a very minimalist blonde in his team, and Hulking helps Asia; Romero, on the other hand, can be seen by an oriental Femme Fatale? However, his efforts end up getting a raw deal (the girl's brain is eventually planted as a lion and a hybrid of condoms! It's one of the animals that you see among the richest people ever seen!). Apparently, this 2-disc set from the media blasters streets today!
