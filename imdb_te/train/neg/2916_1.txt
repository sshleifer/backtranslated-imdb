This is the worst picture I have ever seen in my life. Plots and message are terrible. There are many mistakes in this movie. I do not even understand how this film can get any nomination, alone 2. Here: 1) Sam Lee portrayed an angry / irrational detective which is due to disappointment from his father. Pros: He's angry alright. Cons: When it comes to a descriptive scene, he can not express his sorrow / discouragement with his father. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect to the title title, the bucking or dog sound is sounded. Fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand this is not a metaphor or what ... but it's just dumb mute! 3) Why do not the Cops shoot a killer? Heck is wrong with this image. When the killer cuts an officer, hold him. He has already died! What the heck? The killer has the possibility of murder, but I do not know why he is! 4) The scene where the girl sang her foot. In the scene, the girls' LEFT foot was damaged, and it is clear in the next step how the heck will grant his weight on his left foot. Which actress was nominated for Best Actress? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are in sync. <br /> <br /> I am guessing that the film can bring a sense of cruelty and violence in children in South East Asia. Wins and later the police fought? 7) This film is very violent without a purpose. Police are pulping the CI and if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is the whole worst image. I really feel that the person who wrote this film is a sadist and sick person. I did not see very bizarre images of my whole life. The worst picture ever!
