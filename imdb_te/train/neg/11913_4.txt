Good idea, badly implemented. While it is 99% of the SCIFI channel movies, this really applies here. I love movies that have a good story behind me, and I like action films and I love all the major actors, so it might be great. However, despite some good acting, the film failed due to the bad writing and direction of Bill Plot. <br /> Another review is a good point to know where you are going. This image is missing. You know that the "second draft" is not in the vocabulary of Bill Platt. There is a completely unnecessary scene and can be removed without notice. This scene starts and ends with driving in a car so you can cut from one car to another and never lose the nonsense scene. <br /> <br /> The film also describes a strange habit explaining some of the details, while others predict the whole plot. It has the habit of abandoning the early fight, perhaps it can not afford them. <br /> <br /> "Plot" is also a computer and a few bad bad scenarios associated with "toxic assisive" (seriously, what?) in the final battle. Shari is a fan of Appleby, because she's OK to see this movie. She makes a "Rosewell" for a few times to leave and a good tough chick (but not always). <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
