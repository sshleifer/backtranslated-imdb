First of all: I'm not afraid to engage in the love and art of good Splattermovies, but this zero-budget-flick it's none! The picture-quality is low, the soundtrack I'm never (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In the real picture (here is not a waste of it) I have counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, a concept, a layer-thin storyline, primitive acting, and rare dialog - all of which are repeated 20 times. .. audiences made of this kind of movie-scenes too!) This story is a young boy his father Epnu looking and killing his mother, emotional damage and an adult self-deformed during the tour of the exhibition was held. So far, it's good ... but for these fake-art-idiot-directors this plot is not just a way to keep cheap shock scenes in a row, no message or any sense (freshly taken stomachs are a naked in the hole on the ground , Bound thrown over the woman ... Why? Why do you see both the woman and the guy in the whole bloody "movie"? ) ??? Disturbing? Yes !! Illness? Yes !! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO !!!!! If you understand this inexpensive sheep-show for the art, everyone can visit his psychiatrist or see how Pink Floyd's "The Wall" can be used as an item in an artistic way ... I am your first and last (!!!!!!!! !) Film, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And remember, there are all you gore-headers: everything looks cheap and clearly makes any sense makes "art" automatically ...
