The poor shows of Sinatra, Martin and Herr. Developing supporting roles. Annoying talkies without real plot. Ending leaves you flatter more than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could cut up (if you did not even cared about these wooden vessels), four sequels. MacLine is the only real property. The last sequence that searches "Chicago Hood" for the role of Sinatra is ridiculous. Music is also weak in that order. In the final scene, Martin's role was to call her a "Pig" when she removed her hat, and went out and found a stone to throw through my television screen.
