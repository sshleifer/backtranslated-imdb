After reading many good reviews, as well as hearing the good things about the word, I decided to rent a Come Andon. I'm disappointed. The story is difficult because the past series of lines between the current and recent past of the story are very difficult. The characters and actors are flat and inexpensive despite the best efforts. Sex and nudity need to be more clear. I never saw a movie where the plot seemed too unnecessary. The ending has left many unanswered questions to the very opposite atmosphere and initially inexplicable storytelling. In my opinion, wasting time.
