I went into this movie to expect the matrix or similar to be similar. Boy, I'm wrong. Yes, the film is poorly written, poorly acting plot (boot with CG animated cells and peptides). Nevertheless, the realistic focus of the film is the new age feeling between the plot divisions-good hogwash "specialist" speaking leaders. <br /> <br /> Definitely, it is acting fittingly fit. Initially there was quite a bit of real quantum physics. For example, the electrons are in both molecule and wavelength, and this indicates that a molecule is largely empty space. Nevertheless, the film takes on a large (and unreliable) leap, with sub-atomic quantum effects being even larger. Talking heads will take it further. <br /> When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the locals could not see their ships because their minds could not be quite different. -Alcohol can reduce the murder rate. - With a positive thought, you can walk in water. <br /> Hey, this is the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> The film is aimed at torture. The film is considered a film that shows you to join a culture. <br /> On the other hand, this can be seen as campy comedy (though not funny). <br /> <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: Do not see this movie.
