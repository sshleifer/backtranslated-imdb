Sholay: considered one of the greatest films. I always wondered if they ever remade the classic. The film has been announced by RGV this time and I'm a bit happy to see. Perhaps I thought this movie was a good movie, but every week we'll change something to make it happen. <br /> <br /> The film is a very B-grade film, which I did not expect. <br /> <br /> I tried looking for positives, but I promised to keep my mind in the show. Cinematography is awesome. The film tries to be its own. But that is on the side. Action sequence is weak. Screenplay is capable. The biggest mistake is compilation. No one of the scenes excited you. For example, comedy sequences came out of place and forced to do so. It's ridiculous because it's ridiculously original entertaining. And no roles have been developed. No scenes are delayed until the end. <br /> <br /> The biggest question is acting. Amitabh Bachchan is good as Gabbar Singh, nothing great. They seemed to have kept his look much more focused, the character was only frightening, but you would not be killed. Mohan Lal is good in this movie, but he is impressed with some scenes. Ajay Devgan is good. It was not quite a show, he gave it all, it was weak script. <br /> <br /> Prasanthi Raj is very confident. He has the ability to do a lot of good films. <br /> <br /> Sushmita Sen had a lot of expectations. Her expression, but it is still not enough. Nisha Kothari surprised me. She seemed unpleasant for most part, but her emotional scene was good after her friend's death. Her talent will help her, it seems if the director needs to find her will help her look beautiful. But I'm very disappointed that chemistry. Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj did not appear as friends. Ajay-Nisha is not a strong couple. There is no passion between Sushmita and Prashat. <br /> <br /> Amitabh and Mohan Lal do not have the hate speech they need. <br /> <br /> They are very good for songs. Mehboobah of Urmila was very extreme and I was very sleepy by that. It has danced well. The number of Holi is enjoyable, but not memorable. That's the same for other songs. I was disappointed with the person who looks forward to this film. I am due to his Jungle. I have great hopes for it, but it seems to have lost its talent during the shooting. But he will get back his talent for Sarkar Raj. But this film is better forgotten. Not all positives still make for a boring image.
