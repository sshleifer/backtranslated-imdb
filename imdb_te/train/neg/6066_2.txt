I look forward to watching John Carpenter's episode in Season 2, because his first, Cigarette Burns, was the best from Season 1 (since that season I liked the other episodes). Oh, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I respect the carpenter I feel that the primary problem with this episode is a totally terrible writing. The literal, adjoining characters seemed to behave as if Walker was written for the episode of the Texas Ranger. Acting is very bad, and I usually like Ron Perlman very much, but I can only blame them only because the writing is terrible. I'm not going to find out what the authors are trying to do. It would be useless, but it appeared even though they tried to combine horror (apparently) with some social comment on abortion and religion. In this case, surprisingly, it is possible to support a particular type or religious beans as well as over-the-counter anti-miscarriages. And I'm in favor of both ambitions but I'm so confused to see the characters and so terrible to speak such stupid volatility. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no failure to provide any valuable view on these issues, and the horror element has also failed with such frivolous work. <br /> <br /> I do not think the carpenter is responsible for the very misconduct. He chose the teleplay directing and therefore was responsible. <br /> <br /> The effects of the original gore and monster are good, but CGI gore (two different pistols on the head), so obviously the low quality CGI should never have given them OK. I usually have a lot of criticism for CGI, but I do not have a problem with the principle. I had a problem with its implementation. Technology, in some cases, is not good to compare "real" effects, even if they are small or are thought to match with something particularly organic and / or alive, and can not be used without them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] There are not just many "horrific masters" around. Maybe two or three. If the performance is a "story of horror" or something like that would be fine. But there are at least one horror film in their career, despite criticism for not being "the owner of the horror" because there are standards to direct one of these episodes. And it's not even good.
