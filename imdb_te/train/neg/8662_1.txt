No awesome movie. I love monster flicks but I can not even see half of the horrible acting, cardboard characters and uneasy special effects. This film is not redeemed. The characters are constantly being supplied as a stupid stupid artillery animal or otherwise they are incomplete and unhealthy tiles. Plot formulaic, cut and paste, standard science-run amok drift. Even CGI is terrible. Did you know that you should not be depending on the film that offers you good eye candy. There is no surprise here, the same old old old. This is one of the most deadly films ever made. Director Roger Korman should hang out of a light as the kids use him as a pinata.
