I saw that the film was insulting. It's probably got some of them, but it's not bad. Well, I'm honest: I want to see this film again. This is a bad image. But I hate this movie, trying to tell a story. As a play, this film can actually work well. I think the road producers I made in this film were mistaken (they would have added more fun bits if they wanted to be comedy). With reversals, it's a great movie. But sarcastically, it does not work in its current form - many scenes are not enough in the plot case: for example, the exploitative scene makes some sense in the story. However, it's not the lowest independent film ever made - is it the worst of the top 10? It's debatable.
