Since Dominic Monaghan has worked in his performance, I gave the film 2 stars. There is so much enthusiasm about this film. The item associated with the direction of the film is much less implemented. Even if the director does not expect what he's doing for life, some movies should be seen. Dominic Monaghan is a very loyal actor, keeping him in this caliber film makes him terrific. "Actor" starring Jack's best friend should never happen before. I can not expect much from such a small movie, but perhaps more time and effort to put in the characters and their surroundings. Do not waste your time or money in this movie (as I did) you will be disappointed.
