<br /> <br /> When I heard about George Orwell's future masterpiece throughout my life, I was 37 years old, but I did not read this book, and I was totally confused by what I saw. The covers in the novel are familiar, I'm pretty sure, but only by the heir and the quotes. Without this limited knowledge, the film is full of mystery, and it is more than I was before I saw that I was more educated in the story of 1984. <br /> On the plus side. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is excellent, Hurt & Burton distributed fine shows and the overall feel of the film is tremendously terrible and desolate. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of downside, and there are plenty of ... <br /> <br /> A war is going on, at least for the campaign), but why & who? Nothing has been explained. <br /> <br /> There are two names captured (Eurasia etc.), but they do not understand anything without explanation. <br /> Who is Winston? What would he do? Where does he come from? Where does he work? Why does he change news reports? Why is not he in the front line? Why does he not eat food in canteen? What drink is he drinking through the entire drink? Why is he weak and ill? Why he's not brainwashed like the rest of them? What's the deal with his mother and sister? What was his father doing? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub, that's not necessary for those like me who do not read the book. Without it, it's confusing and difficult to follow the art-home picture that keeps you guessing just what is really going on. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack work and what's happening is what is badly edited and continuously chattering Big Brother screens places dialogue marshmallows more. <br /> <br /> Previously this is a reference, but why nudity? <br /> <br /> It seemed totally grateful and thought I was thrown out of there for lack of any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> I'm Hollywood storytelling for the word these days. We are not all the lights in the brain, but it's some way too many ways. I can only imagine that it depends on the fact that I read this book because I'm saying that this film is really a 'literal translation', which is hard to understand why 1984 has been appreciated. </ ref> It does not deny the light years of the time and is pretty much expected of every change in our society to date, (perhaps it is a sort of bible <br /> <br <br /> <br /> I've been disappointed for years at all years, and I've been waiting for years to see.
