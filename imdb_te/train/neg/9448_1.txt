There is no ransom feature, this movie is even worse. Its jokes are not funny. Humor is a curiosity for children, and efforts to appeal to older ones add to the inadequate memory of the whole desperate package. Sit it with my kids and made me uncomfortable about what's going on. I could not enjoy the movie. Although the DVD was purchased by her new DVD, she or she expressed more interest, Monsters ink, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King etc. Get replays often for replays.
