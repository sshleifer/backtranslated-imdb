Well, good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I was not a fan of Cher, she performed an amazing performance and she was well written. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Rest: At first, every time Cage I opened the mouth. I do not know what kind of racket he uses. Not honest, it's definitely not a New York or Italian accent I've ever heard of. It is very surreal. And not because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice is cloyed in my ears. I liked Nicolas Cage in other shows. Secondly, and it's totally parallel, but I'm a lot of Italian friends, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and I've gotten more laughing and more appreciated by the Italian family's family. And there will be a boring night at home. Let's down what.
