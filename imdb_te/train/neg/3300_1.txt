This is the distinction of the biggest films of this kind. Strangely, actors are generally good at acting. The cast went down, which you hoped for something (I did not say what). The main character is awful ... they do not know where to find her. Anyway, stay away from this and instead see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen", the biggest act in this biggest action.
