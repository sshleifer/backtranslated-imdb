What's with the start-up and occasional obscure video throughout the movie? <br /> <br /> Some people may change violence and nudity, but, along with a very bad acting, a good cult film that I think is. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin Vampire, "Whoops, your race is dumb." Well, if they do not live in English and the 18th century, no one will ever say "okay". <br /> <br /> Van Helsing's character and bad girl "Rally" is bad. Master Little likes the model by Ron Little. Bad martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
