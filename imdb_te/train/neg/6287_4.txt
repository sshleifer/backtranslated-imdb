I read a movie about this film and I was surprised. One day, she sees a woman looking at her car. <br /> ... but it is not. First, the title. Broken? Broken ... what? What is broken That ... oh, wait ... I get, the title is also "broken"! Wow, smart! Unfortunately, this only happens. <br /> <br /> It is not that bad, but I feel that Kidar has done better in Suderland's 'Mirrors'. A cross between the body snatches and the invasion of the Mirrors, and instead of the usual one. By taking each scene for bloody ages, the more favorable title becomes 'boring'. Or not in the ambiguity or the story, but some vague idea about bad copies and somasuk, filled with inexpensive fears and scenes, but nothing. <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are good, but again, it is not a difficult task to work. <br /> <br /> Film twice, I still feel a bit unhappy, may be a little confused, and EA Po or Stephen King is not in the kind of way. Love yourself and do not see it. Keep it easy, there are good thrillers.
