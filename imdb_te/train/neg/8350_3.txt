I came back from "El Vitro" to play here in Buenos Aires and I'd be very disappointed. The film shook very slowly (I'm not wrong, I'm enjoying the slow-moving films!), You slow down the crazy driving point. Julio Chavez heard all of the whole movie breathed. It's a poorly-produced movie, but it's so important, I do not think of a movie, story or its characters without the play of inspiration. <br /> <br /> "El Vitro" If you want to see better Argentine images, look for pictures of siren.
