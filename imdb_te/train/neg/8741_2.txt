You will see five minutes before this movie. This is the boiler room. This is an FIR. And it's the Devil's Advocate. There are no new items here. Except Bill-Gates-Allgrey-All-to-Clear. Talking always has good things for making film, but why not be so serious? The boiler room is a good image, because - for a while - seems realistic. Everything in the antitrust is wrong. How realistic is your employer's example of paying your employer to make your girlfriend work hard and control you? I'd give 1, but the soundtrack is okay, so 2/10.
