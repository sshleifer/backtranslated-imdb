It's unfortunate that I saw it at the Sidhank Film Festival. The whole trail is a disappointment and the film is the last nail in the coffin. I am very excited about the premiere of this film, a devout fan of Louis Carroll's 'Alice' books, which is very uncomfortable. I'm really excited about advanced feedback when they treat. It is interesting to see parallels between past and present in a familiar story generally. Unfortunately this film is a modern replacement of the pop culture perversion and much less. The adaptation of the original characters seemed juvenile and was usually filled with frightening pain. It probably does not help that the actors are not good either. Many of the shows were ridiculous, which I thought was due to bad work or a bad script. I did not laugh at the time frame of the film. There are no deadline instructions for the current events that are sure jokes lose their poignancy as all the time runs out. In fact, the film initially was a highlight when a white rabbit was going to meet Alice, but by then the score was very low in Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would have to say that transitioning croquet into a rave dance is awful. <br /> <br /> The low point of the film is a doubt. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not watch this movie. After that, I'm really angry.
