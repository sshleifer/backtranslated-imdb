<br /> <br /> The mood of the film is great and it binds the feel of the 80s with good performances. <br /> <br /> I thought the mill and the obscene were to be exempt from exceptions to the script run exclusion moments. These characters are dramatic and reliable and complete with clich√©s on the right, a script writer may have seen a panorama documentary with national focus. The biggest problem is that this film is not a true story. It blows all the right "arty" boxes but nothing is real and in the end you leave wondering what point is. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
