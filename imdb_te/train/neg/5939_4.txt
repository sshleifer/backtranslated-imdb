I thought the film was right but was very disappointed, and they did not catch the true picture of her life. I was waiting for me to see his mother become a true Jamaican, it's driving me crazy. At the beginning of the film, I told you that this film is not perfect. I've lost interest in the thing only seconds from the start of the film completely. I'm very upset, Mark is looking at a biography of Anthony and playing the role of Arnold. I'm not sure what his mother was thinking of missing a precious piece of the film which I'm sure would have played a huge role in his life. I will not say that the film is correct along with losing !!!!!!
