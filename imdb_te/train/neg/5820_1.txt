This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm studying French in college, so I understand all the conversations, so language barrier is not a problem. It is really difficult to adapt to any of the letters I've painted in the picture. Only a professional actor in the cast and I can not imagine professional directors or writers. <br /> If I rate 10 to 1, it probably does not have such a poor rating. This is a waste of effort that reduces the current reality rating 7.3 further realistically. <br /> <br /> You will never come back for 100 minutes or so long this event is not true. Twice a half and a half long. If you want to join the IMDb enclosed link, you can go further, and give the "Lost Last" 10.
