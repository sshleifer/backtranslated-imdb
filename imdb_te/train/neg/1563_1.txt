I saw this movie in Sundance 2005 and was surprised at how bad it was, but I enjoyed seeing it based on the list of details. A "mockumentary" of two high school students who produced a documentary of high school life, which is bad acting, bad direction, full participation of characters written and total-total fall. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. Although the characters are "one-dimensional" and "self-conscious", they have to come out. You get the whole impression of a bunch sitting around making a deliberate-bad image to show their friends, yet somehow it comes into Sundance. Mystifying.
