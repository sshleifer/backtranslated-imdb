Worst picture, IMDb is a statement that people often throw around. Whether it's a Owl Boll, Manaus Hates of Fate or the latest bestseller from Michael Bay is bad classics like Festo, people are often not messy <br /> <br /> They are jealous of these people because they are happy with the innocent and worst films The rabbit hole does not know how deep it really is to go. Movies are very good, so unhappy and fun, because their awful and their discussion boards celebrate their movie. <br /> <br /> Ladies and Gentlemen, I know you're awful Ben and Arthur, an 85 minutes gay epic that is very bad that it's too bad a violent car accident, but you can not stop looking at it. The self-declared "Hollywood actor, director" and I can add beached whale Sam Mravovich, this film is legendarily horrible. Let me give you a suggestion about how this project will run. Mr. Miravich did not direct the film, wrote it, built it, executive produces it, acquired, edited and finally acted. This is a person who is blinded by his own ego and a believer in his firebag, who fails to find out how truly calamitous to his bastard creation. <br /> If you have a chance to witness, acting and cinematography is very enthusiastic and music is like a nail in a chalkboard. I know that I have gone on a bit of a tangent here, but I believe that this movie is really bad, I will say the movie is squashed into a movie reel, but the truth is that this is not shot on the image, it's more than just sitting on the ditch sitting in your room Can not be shot in the camcorder. I do not make a mistake, I am sorry for the movies low budgets, the concept is interesting, for example, I have found that the Blair Witch Project has low budgets that still lead to a weather interesting. Although the film is filmed with Hollywood's finest actors in a budget of 20 million, Ben and Arthur do not have a good idea of ​​returning, the story still looms, the storyline is gorgeous, and the characters are the worst. One of the main characters, Arthur, played by other roles rather than Sam Marwick was one of the smallest hardships that had previously been made into one of the films. You should like him in 5 minutes at the beginning of the movie and the disillusioned movie becomes reluctant by the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the pleasure of all the gut devastation I've experienced watching this movie. Mr Mraovich forgot. ) I give two stupid examples of how stupid this film is, and between the erroneous mistakes in the film and the soft. In a cut we hear one of the main characters "I know they are a good lawyer and give him a call" and then fades back and then they talked before. This fact is a woman, I think in the most excellent wrong post production. Second, after the transfer attorney, the second is easy, the characters are said to go to Vermont, then we try to land a plane landing between palm trees in a sunny area. I have never been to Vermont personally, but I'm sure you will not find any tree trees. <br /> <br /> The stupid enthusiasm of this type is about half an hour of ridiculous dialogue and plot to increase it by 10, and it is still not fully prepared for Ben and Arthur. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you imagine the most expensive movies you have seen in your life, and worse, and you're still not Ben and Arthur, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> While we should be happy in a way, such films are rare. They hope to see us one day we are ourselves as filmmakers or we can be screen writers. <br /> <br /> We have a new concept of confidence because of the fact that we are about to create an enthusiastic view of ourselves. <br /> Finally, the worst image of all is found and is called Ben and Arthur.
