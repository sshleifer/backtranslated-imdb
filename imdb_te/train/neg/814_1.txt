This movie is just bad. Just about every police film clich√© and accounting. Bad guy stay away Check. Partner? Check. Clash of Wacky Personality with Partner? Check. Is there anything to prove the rookie? Check. Rookie Gray Expert. Check. It does not touch only about foot and shoot idiot in retirony but I guess they're saving that old chestnut for Duley's next outing. Doolie's gift car will trash all the time and add tired old scene gags as you have a recipe for a really bad movie and add it to the sex battle with Girl Power along with simple overdone materials. Avoid this with all the costs.
