The movie "okay". Not bad, not good, just okay. If there is anything in the theater it will be too far. Sadly, Fast and Furious 2 is also beaten, but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or other young punk, this will be a "beautiful" image for you. Personally, I'll wait for an HBO or a blockbuster.
