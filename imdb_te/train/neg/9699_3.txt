Although most people think about the first film, I really liked it. But this one. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Her / , Splice, royal offspring for some elegant and full hair to battle and sell his gray hair. She desperately seeks to help Snow White Buby (Otto Wakis) to find her other six friends and then try to find the name of the royal offspring or rampstaldtskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over the weekend, where the writers are very alcoholic, but they have been pressed out of the studio to write the screenplay. <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. The first part is not worth the DVD purchase for fans or fans of other actors. Trust me <br /> <br /> The only way to save the movie from the same, complete traffic is the performances of some actors. That's why I gave a 3/10 move. <br /> <br /> For instance, at one time, they are also running in our reality, and while they are here, they do nothing funny. <br /> <br /> Many of the greatest actors in this movie are Otto Valkes, Ralph Schmidz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Casma Shiva Heghen, (especially funny): Rowdygar Hoffman, Helge Schneider and many more sadly but these comedians make this really The bad script was taken to life. <br /> <br /> It is not worth the money for some hardcore fans but for regular movies or for currently DVD tenants or buyers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to rent a movie.
