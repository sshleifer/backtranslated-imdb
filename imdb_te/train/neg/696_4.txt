Eh, not a particular good slasher image. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film there are three deaths, which can lead to a good decline. In addition, most characters are wandering around, absorbing what is happening or chasing after red herring; Killing more people than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer, which is not a partial implementation. The killer likes others to kill the innocent. <br /> <br /> The film is not revealed at the end, and the intention is very thin, and we do not really care. <br /> <br /> This film takes place around Christmas, but it is not the main factor. <br /> <br /> This movie is very dark, at least I watch video tape. Some dialogs were lost in the opening sequences. The end should be stronger than that. We hope to find out what happened, but there is some possibility.
