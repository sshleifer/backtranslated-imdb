I purchased the DVD version of this film on my wife's recommendation for a version that was broadcast on television. But the DVD is a disaster. Lighting is poor and the whole scenes are simply inspired. In one case Adele was put to bed, and we immediately cut another scene - coming in mid-sentence - where it was the next night. <br /> <br /> Grace Poole and Mason have never been introduced, which makes them surprising if they are disappointed in the movie for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> We saw the DVD Platinum Disc Carp and at $ 6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> Be careful what version of this picture you purchase! We're sending it back.
