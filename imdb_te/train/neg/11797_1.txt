The biggest waste of time watching this movie is 2 bucks for rent in my life. There is nothing catastrophic before I die, this is the biggest regret in my life. Any time you think of this film, or a kick between finance finances, they are thinking when they do this movie. It writes pretentious drivel that a desperate romantic is about an overweight, and seeks to pass like poetry. He joined his friend when he was on the coast. Where they meet girls and. Only fat man does not have a girl. Skin flicks do not annoy me, I take 'em for facial value. But this film tries more than a skin. This is a fat man who is looking for love in some girl, but meets another bikini silicon girl who enjoys her poetry. He earns his talent for volleyball to his family and impresses women, who only owns his lady. This dialogue is also very bad for a C film. It supports black templates, no character development, it supports a glimpse of a glorified romance, without any romance. Never seen this film anymore.
