The film is very unsatisfactory and I can not believe what I saw. It's shot in the video! The picture is not! Since the early 70s I did not see these favorites, when the last night networks were filmed in the 'horror flicks' of the week ... It looks like a bad soap opera and it pays a compliment. Some actors give their best shot. Michael des Barrels is ok with what he has given, and it should act as a restrained sex slave. <br /> <br /> Nastaso Kinski is a therapist who is sitting in a chair for a practically complete movie with very little variations in the camera angle. I can not do it wrong to resist the poorest of others, but she is completely unreliable in her role. Her little girl acts against her where the voice is. And I feel like a fan of Nustazzo Kinski. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul is tired of being biased. Each line on her line is three exclamation points. Someone wanted to run all of his expenses aloud. <br /> Lastly, Rosanna Arquette is a sweet, abusive wife, perhaps most reliable of the bunch. <br /> <br /> It's the lowest film I've ever seen in many years.
