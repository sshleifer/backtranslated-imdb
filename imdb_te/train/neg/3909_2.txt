When I saw my favorite actresses were Meryl Streep and Vinnona Rider, I went through the roof! But when I saw this sluggish picture, I fell seriously and I still had a bruise. Jeremy Irons (I still admire this disappointment) plays are just awful. He played with his family the trash, especially his sister, Glenn Close. I have not been able to get closer or sympathetic with any characters and I'm not proud of it, but sex scenes are really unnecessary or they are reduced. Vinnona and Antonio's characters were further developed and their romance was very much appreciated. And what is Meryl's character and her "spiritual powers"? Why do not they go further with this? This movie is a lot of dead ends and the bottom line is a really lousy movie and a lot of wasted talent here.
