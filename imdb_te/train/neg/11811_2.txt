You know that you are on the bus and someone decides to tell their life story, and when you really want to, you'll have to sit on your face with a zealous smile. I have a similar experience when watching this film. Well, I actually went and chose to look at Aprile, and I knew about the taste of my brother Mirotti for making one and only star from Carro Diario, but after half an hour of this latest installment from his memoir I was asked to give Moretti the Madre of all the slaps. Kara Diorio is funny, unusual, and has received at least two words in a few other roles. But in April, Morite has exclusive rights to dialogue, so his politics is best for everything you hear for one and a half hours, or a fascinating piece of popular culture is his fancy right now. He also finds time to get out of unpleasant movies, and I thought I was reserved for those losing like me. Still like being in a position like him you'd'd want to try and make a point about a little smarter movie than he was. Perhaps by proper image, some ideas and a good structure, or perhaps his annoying voice is one that does not dominate. And when he started fawning on his newborn baby, I wanted to be in the company of the general and firm, until I was a self-interested film director with a strange tension for frivolous music. Someone you do not know is trying to tell their life story, give them a slap from me. Each blow is a little bit of a victory in the fight against mortality.
