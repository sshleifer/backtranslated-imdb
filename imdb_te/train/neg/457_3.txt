Sure, I like small cartoons, but I did not like it. Naturally, children love it. <br /> I'm not a little kid again (I'm still young). <br /> I do not tell you about the story, the simple reason is that there is no story. How has this dragon been nominated for an Oscar? Well ... I guess because I'm more happy with 30 people than not now. Now that we are living, everything must be done fast. Watch movies nowadays, and you come to the same conclusion: We live in a society that does not allow us to be slow. This is really a shame. I lived in 30 years because it was very quiet. <br /> <br /> If you like music (and frogs), you have to watch this cartoon. Otherwise, do not spill your time.
