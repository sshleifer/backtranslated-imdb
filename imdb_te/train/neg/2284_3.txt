Now, when I bought this with EB, I do not deny that I have high expectations. This is a wonderful out-of-print work from the comedy master that I enjoy. But I was disappointed. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I'm a hard one to see. I got some smiles, obviously, but the funny majority came from music videos (I got on DVD) and the rest is basically complementary. This is not the best video win (not UHF to honor). Honestly, if you suspect that you can jump on DVD anytime, if you are an ultra hardcore fan, buy eBay off tape to get everything done. There is no need to pay much for it.
