It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work will be disappointed in this regard. But surely the fan of the sellers is delighted with all of his films, because he has a huge talent of man. And the Fondish Plot of Dr. Fu Munch is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, it proves to be the last film of the sellers (which was released even after his death), but it is still better to see how his unstable talent has been achieved until his staggering death. And we get a Sellers, but we get only the Detective on Hunting for the title role but his nemesis, equally hideous Nailland Smith, the crazed 168-year-old Fu, we get. This story is equally extreme because of the fierce flattering of Phu's for trying to prevent him from breaking the age of his age and preventing a group of naylandand and his colleagues. Like most of the sellers, the film has an unmanageable performance from him, as well as several co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dun and Helen Mirren. It is also good to play a guest role with the Pink Panther Bourd Quart (Kato) Sellers - still well played, though still playing the same role. This story is actually pretty ridiculous, involving a lot of participating characters, which strongly categorizes as a film in the Goan Effect. And, although it has never reached the heights of goon comedy, there are a lot of fun jokes in the right direction. The film was released due to the mourning of the whole world after the movie Sellers' Death (which was released in less than 3 weeks), and the last film that has no lamented sadness behind your mind. It's a very great movie - it's very slow, very ridiculous, and sometimes just jokes - but it is reluctant - only for another top rated performance from Peter Sellers.
