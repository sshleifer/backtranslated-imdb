Every time I rent an action / adventure movie, it is not important to relax and embrace my mind. I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - it's not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and let me stop for a while. <br /> <br /> These days I would probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> However, I rented this movie because I was entertained without challenging. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The storyline is poorly written by Jena's episode, and Kathy Long acting is the most community theater (not for professional kick boxer and amateur actress). There are some high points in cyborgs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of them die very quickly. <br /> Like most martial arts films, you enter into a more movie, where there is action, and the plot (which is not strong enough to begin with) acting quickly degrades. However, most of Kathy Long fights, most of the time the director is dedicated to his back. <br /> <br /> Finally, I count that Kathy Lang's tight red stories are the center of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not have enough meat to make the film a second time looking satisfactorous curiosity. If you're a hard-core Xena fan with something to stay away for a few hours - by all means go to the grocery store and rent .50 cents cost. <br /> <br /> If you like Kathy Long's Derricker you may want to buy a copy.
