Sometimes, making something strange and contemporary does not always work for everyone's benefit. I agree that the design and concept of the film are very interesting, and the implementation of these ideas is not an equal story. Robin Williams could not even save this trash. It clearly fell on Barry Levinson's dream face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slope.
