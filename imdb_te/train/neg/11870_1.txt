The most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I first saw it as a child and even now thinking about it really disappoints me. I know that life is set at a time when it is difficult and these people know that the poor and crops are important. Yes, I get it. I can not remember a single light moment in the whole picture. Maybe it's true to life, I do not know. I'm incredibly exciting with the direction and quality of filming the acting top notch and etc etc and I know every picture is not happy but a family picture is terrible in my opinion. <br /> <br /> "This film depicts me how the children affected me, I'm talking about it recently and all tragic memories have been flooded again and I will reach the heart of Prozac.
