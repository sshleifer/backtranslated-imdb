I did some of the people and I did some of the animation and graphic design and the show was terrible! They are rich little kids who do not have any talent, and probably just begged Nick to accept them! Alex has played drums for a year, I play for 4 1/2! The film is terrible and the show itself! This is also the most fun mixed comedy I've also seen. It's so stupid that makes me want to barf !!! This is so silly because Nickelodeon accepts such dumb and such dumb at anytime! They are very stupid and weird! I hate them and their performance and think Nick once it realizes how stupid they are so hopefully it takes!
