Richard Dreyfus is in fact, in this film, but in a small part. He is not "indecent" filmmaker - he is the group's business manager / accountant. The picture correctly describes the picture. Ermotic scenes with Sondra Locke are not promoted, unless one uses the word "romance" quite simply. I saw this movie without Richard Dreyfus. Nevertheless, I recognize the artistic effect of Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne," 60th Psalm. The interesting visual reference to the conclusion of James Jois's "Ulysses" from the end of lines from the end of "Ulysses" and the ending of Engerman Bergmann's "The Seventh Seal" found a poor effort to combine live symbolic elements and sentiments in such films as "Last Year at Marianabad" and " Chien Andulo. " If you like the idea of ​​an outstanding artistic group, there are many high-profile films from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" and "Cecil B. Dimented".
