Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining. The same old story (if you lived through the 80s). Fight together with buddies against injustice in the States of Vietnam Vets. <br /> <br /> When the time elapses, the soldiers go home, and a few years later the friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, friend is dead and his dad is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by the tasty supper (super-pointed) meat tenderizer, since trying to save his father's small shop from the local "defense" gang despite the wheelchair committed against the war. <br /> <br /> When Joey's older unit leader from Vietnam speaks to Sarge when he is shown a funeral. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br But if the unit is not disgusting, the first place in Vietnam should not be in the Joey Wheel chair by gun! Then when they were fighting with the gangs, good things happened in the city and they would do it again. Without any reason, they try to skip the entire plan and wake up the gang without getting to each other. Phh !!!! I increased my hand with disgust. <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious time that all existing members of the unit are trying to get the hero out of the gang. Each of them. <br /> What do you do? Looking, I guess. The film is not so terrible to watch, but it's a tease. There are all of these climactic moments when nothing actually winds happening. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, the death of Joey and the worst of the innocent teddy bear (poor teddy!) are the most dramatic things in the gang's movie. I guess my main beef with this film, I think it's rotated. Substrates with "mystery assistants" and their fiercely cross-purpose motives are not enough to save it in the end. But somehow it all reaches the right and they'll make a sequel. Ha ha ha ha!
