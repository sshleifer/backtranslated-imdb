First of all, I'm not a fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, because the usual model of box office success is to hit the bottom of the waistline. As the directory and marketing announcements indicate, the film is not an artistic work dealing with movies. In my opinion, the sole purpose of the film is to earn money by touching sensitive courage (actually it is considered illegal in the home), and the cheapest public offering a brief definition of my purpose. <br /> However, acting is accurate. In fact, the cast had a much theatrical background and tried to make it harder for the lack of the altioclair; Talent! All members of the cast are perfectly fit in their roles, are well-qualified for the job, and even less veterans. He is deserving of a short word, as he knows better how to choose a cast of Altoockler (as Janeset). Not only that, he's just a media, he thinks is a director who has an artistic talent. Come on, art is not just something to have dealing with naked / half naked women. And just because the media has survived, the director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkey's history. Close your ears and something truly true, I'm eagerly awaiting to appreciate your next work. Hope, this time you have an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros: Good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Cons> Everything rather than cast
