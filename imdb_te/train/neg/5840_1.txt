Well then. I saw the worst-load of movies - with all the quality levels. I'm not sure about what I originally wanted to review. Then it hit me like a thief-rod: Roddhose. Alert people about Rodente. Nobody is monitored and silent quiet. And it's about mutating rats that killed people. Yes ... the original one. Is "the food of the gods" or "anybody"? <br /> <br /> There is the story here: Inana laboratory scientist and his plucky assistant mice and moronic friends of a crappy neighbors and crappy building and plucky assistant who are experimenting in their laboratory show the drinking and everyone will feed for crazed rats and just Everybody dies and, yes, there is a giant rat that looks crappy, but gets killed, Impu. There, all once a sentence! Spoiler, did you say Ppfff !! I have tried to resist! <br /> <br /> I do not know what you are doing, Nothing is good here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you ' <br /> <br /> "And in other films, CG rats are poorly visible. See, if your image has a lower budget, you probably should not rely on CG. Lesson to take heart. <br /> - Acting is very poor. <br /> <br /> The characters are not unnecessary - we have mish-mesh of clocks and do not do any of them well. <br /> - Completed. <br /> <br /> Stupid story, stupid. <br /> <br /> Giant Eat looks like human being fat in poorly dressed bearish - funny kind - but not funny enough <br /> <br /> - Recurring, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> All college student rat chow people are drinking tequila from pulp mushrooms - and they do not drink anything more than a few seconds. <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Just terrible. Even worse than you expected. For example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." You can now enjoy those movies. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes: <br /> <br /> - The slum action movie ending, full of unharmed heroes and explosives. <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Weather: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Characteristic Development Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (During the film I will take care of my son at times, 1/10 Music: 1/10 (Average for Time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesecake: 7/10 Compression: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 1/10 <br /> <br /> If you like rat and pressure-based horror movies Dandi. Wait ... Keep an eye on it. Do not see it. It's the worst. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
