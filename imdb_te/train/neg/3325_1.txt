It hated. If you think everyone in the south is mute, normal bankruptcy, stupid, violent, religious nut or baby cholesterol, this movie might be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly intelligent. In one scene, two adults were talking in a simple shop and claimed that a group of sisters were raped before they could build their shoes. The man was proud of his actions, and the other person apparently took a normal part of life. Very nice. A young girl runs on the roads behind looking for her sister and offers no one to help her - clear limp and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not entirely disgusting and slimy, but he is a religious believer who reflects the vile nature of Christians (typical for Hollywood). The scene in the film is highly reminiscent of Cape Fear (with the Deer) - the Bible verses are bad by the evil person. I'm from the Great Northwest, but it's dangerous because of the wonderful people I know from NC film, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
