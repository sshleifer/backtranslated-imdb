The Liongate has yet to prove. Every movie from the throne is endless. I tried it and tried to give them more opportunities and they would have to beat me again and again. <br /> <br /> I do not care about most of the people in this film. The guy will cut the dead dog for some reason. A random virus infects and transmits it to the camp at the camp, where children are infected and begin to die, the town learns about it and kills them, rather than helping them. Then the water is infected and everyone will die. <br /> Really, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely reduced, you do not care about any of them, and a kid boy meets the world. I and my friend figured out talking about fat and bitchy how much an enjoyable our mate would be than to focus on this film. <br /> <br /> I am confused by random slow motion karate movements. A random kid and how it clearly responded to everyone in the country and completely dissociated. Again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why are kicks sitting in a chair waiting for them to kill them and trying to kill? Are they part of their plan? Wow. Best Plan. I can not believe I have the theatrical release of this movie. I can not just dive on the DVD, just listen to an hour and a half in a theater. It's not frightening or funny, nor cool, or anything. It's just 90 minutes waste. You can use ... I do not know, plant or plant something. It's worth more than this piece of garbage. Acting, special effects and script are a joke. <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever A dirty leg shaving scene comes out of 10
