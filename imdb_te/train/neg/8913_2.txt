When I first tuned in the news this morning, "Wow, finally, some fun." It's a week or a little bit fun ... but we have to face it, this news reporters have time to "play around" a lot (if one can call them too) <br /> <br /> First, I thought breathing. But seriously, this woman got her journalist at least not bit. She is very unemployed. Steve is not interrupted when she begins to report to a particular news report. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. Hell, a celebrity she loves as a celebrity. Therefore, she becomes a popular figure around the celebrities who have to be interviewed. <br /> <br /> She is not very professional and she thinks her relationship is more important than the ones she says to anyone - and I can tell you about her. <br /> <br /> Even news reports that are necessary (and unhappy) are about the benefit of the world, government, US, or public interest and / or useful. When they focus on the conversation, the reaction they speak is a commercial product. <br /> <br /> <br /> "I really want to see KTLA instead, but sometimes Oh, well, I'm NBC's "today." ABC's "Good Morning America" ​​is also ok ... Diane Sawyer is not very serious.)
