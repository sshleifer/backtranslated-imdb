Ira Levine's Broadway Smash is the bone of the bones where there is no meat, just a few tricks and twists on a secret road. The boring author Michael Cain plot steals a chic young man's work and takes it to his own path; His shameless plan can kill a talented kid, who has a lifetime partner of Cain's. The first act that everyone introduced, excludes dead, and Cain will do everything to make an actor. Diane Cannon is very uncomfortable in the role of his wife (she is very clever and intelligent as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie). These three characters, Irene Worth, are inexorable neighbors, even after the second act begins, without being registered until it is setup. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy, the set design is astounding and poorly-lit, and the end disaster. The actors are struggling to give the script some material, but their efforts with the narrowest subjects we see. **** from * 1/2
