The story and presentation are good, but it's frustrating and disappointing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put a top-notch performance, and the girl who played his sister is really amazing and beautiful. Seriously, I thought Carmen Electra was until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say bad about Peter Galgar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but I've seen the movie before reading the book. It's too small for me to be "real". I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs for slavery struggles. Bhutan kit was very cumbersome and her work after her role was that the film was ruined; I could not see the rest of the show. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not give it away) Sorry, but it is not my type show.
