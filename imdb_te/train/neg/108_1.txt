<br /> <br /> Plot summary: A female reporter runs a hatchbacker who tells her stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: I have never seen bad movies in my life. TZC filmed on a budget that looks like 20 bucks is a horrific horror film, it's dull, unforgettable actors, not more bulky than protecting and threatening their lives. How is this movie made? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "My last 2 cents:" Ironically enough, this film is made by Brain Damage Films. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (if it is up to me, this film gets negative rating bajillion)
