The big action star that has fallen from the face of the earth once ends with the issue of drug dealers in a small town and the dead body of a federal agent. Rebuild with some former co-stars to clean the town. <br /> <br /> With low-key, often blandness, the "action" comedy does not work much. The part of the problem is casting Christine Klien former Action Hero. He is not bad, but some people who have taken him really hard are not believable. I said he was not bad, he was just wrong what just the story behind him. The real problem here is the scripting combination, which is not really funny and is artificial at times and is pedestrians to the Dallas harbor. There is life as things have been arranged. If the director has a list of strokes and goes through that list. It makes for an un-cheery image. And yet the film ends with the occasional life, as in the final show as the movie ends. This sequence is complete, but the opening parts of the film have lost a lot of power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend the movie. Whether it is a fan of its cast or a huge fan of the independent movie in all forms, its value is a shot, but it's just disappointing.
