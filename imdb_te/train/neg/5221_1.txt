Hello I came from Denmark, and one day I was wearing an evening with my friends. One was brought with the picture "Russian Terminator" and it was very awful. After less than half a minute, we decided to go ahead with a few fantasy "headlines" or just say "little" in the picture. I was surprised to see that the film was built here in my homeland in Denmark ... The biggest mistake that this nation has ever done.
