Obviously, many of the talent behind the crew members who are scene for this scene are in the film, do not see the credits in the end, you only catch them against them. Nobody was interested in seeing this movie, only in 3 theaters; The two came out after 10 minutes, and they were fortunate. Star Trek 2, "The Demons" from The Rath of Khan, was rejected by the unemployed worm, and designs for space creatures in aliens. The creators of the film are not exactly willing to cover up the third-rate film monsters, so they have appointed rate actors who can not remember their performances, or in some cases learn to pronounce words before filming begins. Some scenes are quite useless in what's supposed to be what's going on, if any. If you're unlucky to be in a theater showing this movie, and if you do not come out, you'll laugh at what's shocking or breathtaking moments. The engagement of many scenes will make you discouraged and will tell everyone's feelings that Stephen Deorf's "spurious" Queen Mary's pays to see it. If you have to watch this movie, help yourself and wait for it to be in the bargain bin in the video store. If there is any justice in the cinema industry, one of the major actors will rent it for you.
