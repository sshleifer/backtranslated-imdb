Can anyone do good CGI movies with Pics I really mean, the animation was seen as the oldest by 2006 standards and even 1995 Toy Story scales. Or they would spend their budget on Hugh Jackman. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a toilet rotten rat. Yes I know, it's a stereotypical one. But then combine the paths of London in the sewage - to an extent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> I want to say something fun. Maybe hook up in the movie? Or maybe happily never-rat relationship. But nothing has happened. It has talent, but it is blown up. D-
