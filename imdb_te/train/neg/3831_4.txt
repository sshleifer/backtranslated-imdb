I disagree with this comment and with Maldin. It creaks and groans trying to keep across Wide West's centerpiece high-speed Western second time, time tamed and kicked out. It wants to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", but does not have the film's fraud and charm. Andrew McLaughlin's director is Limp, and with some incomprehensible tactics as part of the last 30 minutes or true movies, Heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Give me holler if you explain to me why some were set on the hill.) The rape scene is something innocent about the whole treatment, and the woman's response is definitely not ringing. Coberne is very scary, avoiding punishment for half the racial revenge, but his fellow attitudes are thoroughly evolving (they bowled the bowling pins one by one in front of each other). Michael Parks gives him one of the shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances in general, but in this case it is appropriate to indicate negligence that his advanced style sheriff technology could bring progress.
