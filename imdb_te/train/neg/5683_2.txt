From the beginning of the film I have a feeling like a movie about another Jason from 13th Friday. And this ... the film starts with interesting. But times muted, supernatural, quiet serial killer goes through its just a meaningful movie. I have not seen anyone, meaning he goes under the bed of the person without having any noise. He was blind after failing the death penalty, but people walk and kill as he used them. I'm tired. <br /> In other words - not true. Very flawed and confusing information. <br /> <br /> It's a nice sight to drive a woman but just for the first time:} It's and mysterious intro 2 stars.
