Man-Man Man tries to be as good as a good image: it has its heart in the right place, which aspires epic and has a message that everyone can doubt it will appreciate. But there are some issues of this film. It's very hard to get better and sometimes it's receiving a message that is not contrary to the viewer. So the images used in this image are simple - the man-to-man viewer will not judge his opinion correctly, but emphasizes his message in his message. Joseph Finnes in his role illustrated: He is doing his best to worry, move well and take care of all the other emotions you can express with the only facial expression that gives his feelings. Say that the film is long and eventually loses its speed, and it is not man's visible to man. But there are enough points to protect it: it's entertaining, some funny scenes and show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. In fact you can not compare to manual artworks like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you are satisfied with the theater. It tries to grab your heart (though your brain thinks it's very clear) and will succeed.
