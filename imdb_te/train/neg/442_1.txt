This game is made by Sega. I did not expect much by Sega, but I did not even expect this junk. Camera angles for starters will work against you in this game. It is your way to get around the motorcycle. The worst part of the motorcycle game. Whenever you go there you go and you can not move. You will never lose bike or debris in that regard. Although he has a voice that suits him, the main character speaks hardly. Graphics are terrible. You run through trees on your bike. The camera will make the enemy impossible impossible. This game is also not suitable for rent.
