This is not really a zombie movie, if we define zombies as we walk dead. Here the protagonist, Armand Lack (played by an unbelievable young Dean Jagger), in fact, his 'method' mentally evaluates his thoughts and controls the minds of other people who are converted into hypnotized slaves. There is an interesting concept for the film and his series is more efficient by Fritz Lang. Mabus movies, 'Doctor. Gabriel '(1922) and' The Testament of Doctor Mabuse '(1933). Unfortunately, his former fianc√©e, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Hay, played by Bad Head, Dorothy Stone), is under the control of his quest to be really important. This movie was an exciting beginning because Louquich sent Cambodia to the military archaeological excursion to end the culture of zombies from there. Some kind of compound (we're getting great 30th sets and clothes) he announced his engagement to Claire, and five minutes later, she will give her ring as her friend for her friend Clifford Grison (Robert Noland). It's unexpectedly funny way they talk to each other regardless of the eye. <br /> <br /> This is because the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' has not already been roasted. <br /> <br /> How does Luck actually learn the secret of 'Westernization', create a huge army of rifles carrying soldiers and body guards to kill enemies. <br /> <br /> John Ahar can not see tremendous power in 'Brain from Planet Arouse' (1957). </ P> <p> Finally, Claire Graceon lives up and returns to the United States if he wishes to marry him. Luke agrees, but in reality he changes one of his hypnotized slaves. Knowing that Claire loves him if he leaves his 'powers' at night for their wedding. To earn his love, he does so, causing the title 'rebellion', his slaves to wake up and kill him and kill him. Grayson embraces Claire, and we seem to be at the end of an illustration: "Whoever first destroys the gods will make them mad at first." <br /> <br /> So really, even if the IMDB rating is present, it's not bad of a movie. In the recurring views (?) The art of the well-formed script can be seen! Dean Jagger has developed into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his childhood - really his own hair? Recall him for his bald, old man characters in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'Ex an Anne' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). The story contains the most prominent themes from the Halperin Brothers, in the 'White Zombie' (1932), Robert Frazier (like Charles Beymont) Madge Bellamy (Madeline Parker) <br /> You are real zombie movies (hundreds of them (1932), 'I'm a Zombie' (1943), 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968), 'The Last Man On Rt '(1964) and its two remakes. In the modern era of classy films, 'Horror Express' (1972),' The Serpent and the Rainbow '(1988), '28 Days Later' (2002) and its sequel, as well as many, This is not really a zombie movie. Getting the film with its own words, it's more of semi-Gothic romance. In addition, the lower build B horror films of Universal are slightly lower in the late 30s and early 40s. So I give it to 5.
