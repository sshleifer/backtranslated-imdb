Productive money is proof that this fairy waste is great and famous is just like stupid and waste like politicians. Tenorie and Burton and Noel Coward, played by Tennessee Williams and (Silly), from the play (silly) drama - Wonder when submitting in 1967 to the Fire Universal, which was filmed in a mountain archipelago on a magnificent hill in the Mediterranean. As a result it is absurd and tedious. Visually the image is spectacular but it allowed the setting and the fact that a set was used for a real home instead of the nature of nature. A screeching Taylor, Burton's half-worming wanderings, loony dialogue, noel cavard himself laughs, ridiculous the storyline of the funniest story and plot tools and the absurd costuming. BOOM is a disgrace, money and talent and a well-known perception of talent and clear proof, just like the rest of the pleasures of the planet will be idiots. Not even fun. Just terrible and mad shocking waste.
