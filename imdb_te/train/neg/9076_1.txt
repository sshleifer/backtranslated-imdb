It's definitely adamant, ruthless, very repulsive movie I've seen in quite a while. I tried to stop the VCR, but like a terrible car crash, I literally found it in every conceivable way that it was totally irreverent and slowed it from the end. I'm not a prodigy of the art of sexual abuse on the screen. House of Animal, of Porky, is something about Mary, American Pie movies, and even the brutal Freddy Got I have found most enjoyable in their own crude terms. Mamie Van Doran's breast-bearing sponge bathing is the most horrific appearance by naked aging from the shining. With the most annoying performances from Devon Sava and Jason Schwartzman, correctly editing and burning, the film ended, and I once added a voice. The only useful purpose for the film is a textbook example of how to make a gross out image. Oh, and it works well as a pasture fertilizer.
