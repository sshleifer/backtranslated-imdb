The image is bad. There is no other way to say. The story is weak and old, especially for this country. I do not really know what a "walker" is for most people or really care. From the 70s I thought I was watching the movie. This issue is not confident in 2007, but also in DC. I think this is true for everyone I read. Not many Q & A for the A. <br /> <br /> I do not think Scrauder really thinks about the movie beforehand. Many scenes seemed to be cut off or if they did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try and figure out what happened. I did not really take Woody's (Carter) personal life or boyfriend. What about all "artistic" male slavery and torture pictures (from the Iraqi jails)? What is he thinking? I think he is a very small attempt when trying to create life of these dark private subcultures for Woody's character (Car). It did not work. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson is the only good thing about this film. He played his character (car) flawlessly. You may have been really like "walker" (a twentieth anniversary) had a great sense of significance. He is great and is largely unknown. <br /> For Lauren, Lily and Christine ... Boring. <br /> Do not look at it! It's painful! If you're a true Harrelon fan.
