It is one of the 50 times better than the trailer film. In 1991, I saw the trailer for the first time, it looked great. I've always wanted to see it but never found it ... <br /> Yes, 14 years later. <br /> I know that I am unhappy, I know that I am not an Oscar winner, but it is still a nice Roxoport printer no-brain film. <br /> <br /> All acting alongside American rock and roll music feared greatly. <br /> <br /> These fighting sequences are rubbish and <br /> <br /> While this DVD cost me £ 5, I believe that I was overcharged by £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now that hour I will never get A half back.
