A terrible meaning and, worse, boring image. Fiction has nothing more than fiction, but there is no role beyond the most unimaginable generalizations and is based on a clunky central concept that deals exclusively or does not exist in a vague, innovative way. <br /> <br /> Ferrell is completely ruined by Jim Carrey's Truman Show as his response, and his usual cating routine alternatives (which is good if you discount Teltey Nights). <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is not more of a male frustration (some reviews that I read here are ridiculous for Oscar nomination). Maggie Gyllenhaal did not form her role as a former lawyer to become a biker from Harvard in order to create people's happiness with a very weak script. Please. <br /> <br /> It is completely ridiculous that she's gone for Ferrell's 'role'. <br /> <br /> Mark Forster's attempts to jazz using computer graphics encourage the objects he needs to work on. <br /> <br /> I have seen Prestige for a third time or have chosen to see this. I have opted for Prestige.
