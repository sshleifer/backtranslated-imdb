<br /> <br /> This review contains the first cinematic spoiler - so if you have not seen the movie and want spoilers, do not read this review! <br /> The film is expected to meet Christian and Catherine's meeting for the first time, a poor copy of the first cruel intentions of the film. They are very poor alternatives for actors who portray Katherine of Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Geller's. The original actors did not even remove the long, sticky Rich Kid's attitude. I'm afraid that some of the conversation is verbatim - not very much between the Christian and the Cathris, but if you can hear it enough, you'll recognize it. There is also inequality in the plot-if it is really Christian and Catherine's first meeting, why is a Christian in love with a girl at the end of the film? <br /> <br /> Also, the original film (with Reiss Witherspoon's character) wanted to be in love for the first time with a comment on photography / "You Can Be a Model". The end is completely dull and does not add anything at all. Overall, the film is wasted time. I can not believe they do cruel intents.
