<br /> When did you get an unfit skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a scheme and a nutjoe breeder, a minister and his wife? <br /> <br /> AIP replied to insomnia. <br /> <br /> "Screening Skull" earns points for courage, offering free boxes to anyone who wants to scare the film. <br /> <br /> You have been disappointed by the people you feel are feeling in the product of "Dummies for Sumpspen". <br /> <br /> Peggy Weber is a beautiful picker. She has some good moments acting here and there (especially when the gardener is trying to communicate) and no one fills the nightgown like her. Frightened face - it scares. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is some suspense here and everything is telegrapped like a punch thrown by a mime. You can not be afraid of this film, it's impossible. <br /> <br /> But thanks to Mike Nelson and his two robot pals, they are very happy with a special copy, but one star for eight and a half MST3K version of "The Screaming Skull". <br /> <br /> A "screaming" bored ....
