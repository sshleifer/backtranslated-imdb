I have to admit, there are some books with related movies, and I really read it before the movie simulation. Eighteen eighty four is one of these rare cases. The book is great. It is immersive and curious prophet. But the film is just intimacy. It's the worst picture I've ever seen. The first 5 minutes later I could not stop the film because watching this movie was half of the two parts for a class. It's dark and grotesque, but nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. Acting is not more than average, and it is very disappointing that there is not much to take action. For example, the book does not give me the impression that Winston did not move more than one letter at a time. Without boring, disturbing, and visually appearing, the film is completely banned from cannibals. Wait a second ... Is not it British?
