The title song for this film ........... is a great free zealous ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> When I first subscribed to the cable in 1978-79, I saw this film. In 1979, the cable was simply a common place in homes. (Or at least it's common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This is the first film I've ever seen in a paid channel called "Theater Channel." Star Channel ", they renamed" The Movie Channel "at the beginning of 1980 ........ My new cable subscription received a monthly" star channel ". <br /> <br /> The film was a huge hit in the film <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I forgot to watch this movie, it's a normal teen movie like other media budget teen flicks) ... where the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I recently chit this I forgot to see the film until after seeing this movie again, <br /> <br /> " is). <br /> It is a different experience than watching (30+ years later). <br /> <br /> Children rock and roll music, smoke, a fancy van (often at the same time). This should be a good teen party image. <br /> <br /> The main character is romantic about watching sex with his main rivals, to attract his attention to Dodge Wan (with shag carpet walls, a roof in the mirror and a water bed), and eventually sex with him to misuse all his college savings money. Buying it to have. But his main rival comes out and sees for him (both of which can resolve their differences by pulling their differences) .... When he and his bouncer dropped both their vans, his main rival's girlfriend, he looked at the preppy (less attractive) girl, half / He pretends to be very movie and he is happy / happy The rope and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has funny moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more of a trip down the memory lane. మేము ఇప్పటికీ పిజ్జా పార్లర్లను, పిన్బాల్ ఆర్కేడ్లు గుర్తుంచుకోగలిగినందున, మేము చిన్న చిన్న పట్టణాన్ని క్రూజింగ్ చేస్తున్న జ్ఞాపకాలను తిరిగి తీసుకువచ్చాము, మనం చూస్తున్న అమ్మాయిల వద్ద మంచి అరుణోత్పత్తులతో అరుదుగా ఉండిపోతాము మరియు వేయబడినందుకు ఆశించటం (కొన్నిసార్లు నేను అదృష్టవంతుడవుతాను మరియు కొన్ని మంచి నాతో ఒక ఉమ్మడి పంచుకునేందుకు అమ్మాయి చూస్తున్నది మరియు మ  I'll screw in the back-front bars, and I remember a number of songs in this move (when they were new) ......

I never remember as full size vans, I remember that era very well, and they were young boys dream of their van Ki did not like to stay, I would rather Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang hot rod, but it is not always the van. And as a young man wanted to (it just does not belong to that era)
