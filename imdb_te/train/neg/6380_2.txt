Well, what can I say about this film? I did not get the word. Even if I ever wanna be stupid this movie, it's really music. And it's the best of all, they commented on who they liked. For all of them, it was removed from one of Fidoff Fury's best martial arts films starring Bruce Lee. He is still alive and he feels frightened throughout the film. The rest of the film is completely ridiculous and the waste of the tape. Such a film was not shot on the film because I said tape. For 30 minutes in my life, I feel more stupid now. The only reason I saw it was because my colleague downloaded it from the ill-tempered curiosity. This world is coming.
