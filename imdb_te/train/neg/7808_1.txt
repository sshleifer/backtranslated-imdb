I'm a very big Michael Madsen fan, so no, I bought this movie without renting it ... This film is so terrible, I did not come back to the store, I'm not interested in any other human poison, I threw in the trash and never mind , It is worth the price to throw away. Acting is not that bad, it's not good. The story is terrible, and I'm disappointed that it ends. He is a broken man, alcoholic. His life junk off the bunch. I thought his horse, peanut, a horrible instrument to show his childhood innocence, the dog was very well. I also hate religion, so this is without doubt. Jesus Heals All ... I hate the people I know are big Christians and Catholics, and God does not cause everything to cure, and does not heal all. If it has a choice to see it, pass it, or better yet buy, or rent, and throw in the garbage, and leave it in the morning coffee grounds a terrible image
