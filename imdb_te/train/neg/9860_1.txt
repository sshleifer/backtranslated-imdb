I usually enjoy movies like this. It portrays the documentary style, but acting and writing are just awful. Acting wood and tight and writing is just so cliche, but in a good way at all. By typing this, I'm at 5.2 / 10 in IMDb. I must be sure that many of these votes come from relatives in the film. I think if that is the case, you can manage your laughing partner, because watching your relatives / friends in a movie is always funny. Well, in a way, I hope it gives everyone and future writers, directors, actors, etc, if they can do this, you can do it. However, you probably should not.
