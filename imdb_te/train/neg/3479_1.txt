These films have gone to watch me in the movie and I was surprised when I was in the room. Only me and my girlfriend! I remember that this film is not very good. <br /> I'm not surprised. Ben Affleck plays a person who bought a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable story to fall in love with a girl who hates him. His performance is not okkish but cinematic comedy is not very good. <br /> <br /> There are some good points. For example, the family is distinguished and the mother is very funny. <br /> This review results in other people who are wasting their money. I'm very impatient when I come out of the room !!!
