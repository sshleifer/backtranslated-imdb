It's the worst movie ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T Pitfell, the dialogue is totally awful, and the hockey does not begin to explain the performances by each actor in the film. This plot is heavily stealing from executive decision, but compared with Air Rage, Executive Decision is an Academy Award. I was always disappointed when I saw a movie. Air Rage should again be burned with its ash locked in a vault that never see the light of day. Anyone who sees it should take a shower and wash off the stink of the terrible film off of them. The best part of this image comes from the end when credits are rolled. It's a worst picture I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T is committed to Law and Order, and other people in the film should resign or commit suicide. Either way, they should not try to stay in a movie again.
