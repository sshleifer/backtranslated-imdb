I can not help when we realize that she is suffering from a life-threatening illness, I wonder if her death is such a terrible loss to poor Olivier or anyone watching this film. If she had been killed and killed, she knocked Oliver off the edge and eventually launched them in the divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie but this is the worst of the 70s.
