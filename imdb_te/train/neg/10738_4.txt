The DVD used to buy this blind. <br /> <br /> It is a bubble-headed comedy, but it's Um. Poverty. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters seem so small and upset and comfortably contrive each other and I finally found it depressing to see it. <br /> Maybe the box is something uneven, goofy caper film than me. (I know, I know, the coats in the box and the Academy Award is not a nomination.)
