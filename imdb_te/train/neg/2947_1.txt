There are very few movies I could not sit. I did not get through the battlefield Earth. But this is one of the worst films. I tried to play Hoop Goldberg. I can not blame her. I'm ashamed of having a resume. Almost every gag in a movie belive when it comes flat on the face I belive in a rare case. Well done here. Not to mention the SFX, look for Dino with control cables that hang in the rear !!!!!! I'm still looking for a plot by Halfway through the movie. I never found it. This is difficult to rent and save your life saved for 90 minutes.
