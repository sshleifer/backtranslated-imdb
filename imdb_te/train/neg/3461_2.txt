Slasher movies can often be derivative, repetitive and frankly unrealistic. I want to be a horror film fanatic, but the film is just weak, the words fail me. The script is not bad, the plot is funnier, acting is pretty bad. A round stinker who wasted my life time. The film became the first of all the 15th sequel's entertainment entries. <br /> Who is cool in this mess? <br /> <br /> In this film, I liked only two things. The first is the mask of the killer - that's fine. <br /> Save yourself, avoid this bizarre confusion.
