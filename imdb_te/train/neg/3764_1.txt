This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I have ever seen and probably the worst movie I've probably seen in my life. Actors and actresses were horrific and they seemed to be trying hard to find their roles in Dorx, Tough Guys, Jerks, It's All, etc. It appeared as a kind of computer type in Atari & IntelVision days. As the end of the film, one of the Saskatchets' army hits after the other survivors, and a shot is seen as the man in the poor man's donkey Kang himself! And the blood that came out of it is just a terrifying animation by a bullet. Another annoying thing is music. The whole image is the most music (classical score or you are calling). It's not over. Oh, the picture is very boring. One of the worst films I've ever seen is definitely one. I recommend you take your $ 3 or whatever charge they charge for this image and spend it out of gas gas or a value menu somewhere. Truth!
