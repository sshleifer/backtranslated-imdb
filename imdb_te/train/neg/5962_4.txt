Paul Naschie made many horror films. In terms of quality, they are from very good to undesirable trash; And unfortunately, the horror rises from the tomb is close to the end. The plot is merely a witch, wizard, or your average story of Warlock, in which case (where it is located) - but before such a vengeance takes a swear ... etc. One thing that leads to another, and pretty soon running warlock is up to good again. This plot is slow, painful boring and the film is constantly mean. Diatrib's Ryams Out String characters and the film never works in any way. Paul Naschie wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should stick to talking, because the dialogue is serious, and the film only works for more boring. Naschie's directorial debut in Carlos Aurad, Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil's Blue Eyes does not want to help the film dialogue. Sometimes films like this have a particular charm about them; But there are no horror raises from the tomb. This is a painful boring image that is not a little or nothing interesting.
