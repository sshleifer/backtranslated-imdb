LOC was a well-made film in the fight against the Kargil war; It was the location, budget and expertise of India's "Save Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, the 4-hour bore that attempts to forgive combat action in a spicy picture. War scenes were also terribly enforced, using the same hill in all combat scenarios, and spending unnecessary time in the casual discussion. Instead of appealing to the Indian people, what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or a terrorist perspective (like Tira, Tora), Tora, etc.) It is better to visit and direct the director, directed by Ram Gopal Varma. , I would like to see some of the re-editing of this film, which includes only the parts that are included; As our more cudadaginadiga.
