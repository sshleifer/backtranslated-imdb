An awful picture! It should be against some real stinkers to nominate for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first renowned female Renaissance painter and led it outside of identity. My complaint is not that they have taken freedom with the facts; If the story is good, it's fine. But it's just bizarre - all the artworks The true story of this artist is a very good movie, so why come with this dishwasher-dumb script? I think there are people who are not naked enough in the original version. It was finally cut off with the essence of the life of the artist - we could save two hours if they liked the rest of the picture with the same bouquet.
