I've been online recently on a site that has public domain images. The film is in the list of their longest films and I wanted to have a foul title in the scene and the premise. But, no, that's what it really is. I try this once it's only 27 minutes long. If it becomes a porno movie, I will stop watching. Instead, it became the most peculiar film I had ever seen. The Danish product crew attempted about $ 49, budget, to make a star trek-style film that tells about a group of gay men who are traveling about wiping out women's oppression by killing all the women in the galaxy as they go forward to do! And in each case, they met cheers and thanks from gay people now on the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, this is not. Some of the characters I've heard so far have been obscene and some of the childhood names, I can not even think I could write them to IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite all of it's frustrating, it is visually appealing and a peek value. But as I have already mentioned in raw names and odd stuff (even though there is no nudity), it's the only movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, leave me with 1001 questions like this picture WHO can make this look like, why make and intended audience? It may not be the exact worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably amazing and highly dangerous!
