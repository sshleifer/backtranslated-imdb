This sports is a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver actors and deliver more than talk. The first third of the film is not just talk, but more talk. Many of them are bitching about each one. <br /> <br /> Here are the top five actors who are women, so this really confirms that it's really "chick flick" and a little different. It's probably played on the Life Time network. <br /> There was a murder scene and a discussion later. By half, they have lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field was here at the age of 15.
