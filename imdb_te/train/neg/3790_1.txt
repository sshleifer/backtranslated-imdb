I can not really post comments, but I wanted to make people alert from this movie. This is a complete student film with no vomiting features. On a technical level, completely enthusiastic - stable random jump editions in scenes, dubiously off dubbing etc. The storyline is completely clicked, the production is ridiculous and acting is insulting. I do not want to be too strict: I've done my stake in student movies, and they are all terrifying, but there is no reason to be in the world to see the film's innocent fans. /> <br /> The concept of a safe - like most cast filmmakers, friends and family.
