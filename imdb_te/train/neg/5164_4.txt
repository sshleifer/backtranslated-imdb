The basic plot of the film is not bad. A woman makes it big and comes back to worship her alma mater. But, despite the good acting of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. This performance I put in either Jon Crawford or Director or both, her performance is just awful. Instead of being a true man, she is a tremendous hypocrisy of a deer holding her in the headlights. In other words, she is out of space and has a "Gary I More SOOOO Stannand" expression. After a few minutes I was really hurt. She is not the only Crawford film that I do not like for her appearance, as she has done more than her share of her overacting now - movies like Bearserk, such as JOHNNY GUITAR or her many movies, My advice is to try a different Crawford movie - there are definitely good.
