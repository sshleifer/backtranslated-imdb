As a filmmaker, White Noise is completely disappointing, cinematography is very beautiful, well lit and good camera work is reasonable. But the film was portrayed as just like all other 'so-called' horror films. Although it has some part of 'chill factor', the concept of E.V.O (electronic voice phenomenon) is unreliable. The film did not explain the reasons for some events but went ahead with them. The acting is not as intricate as the main thrillers / horror films. <br /> <br /> Certainly I will buy the movie on DVD and it is not recommended that nobody recommends anyone to see it. .
