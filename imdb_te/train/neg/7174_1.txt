Before I left my review I wanted to read other comments and the majority were strict rules: this movie is very serious! Countless errors for realistic animation from acting. I'm hoping the fact would have been stretched through the stretch of flapped imagination (not to stretch flaps without engines). The landing gear can not be reduced if you do not have electricity. There's no way enough to minimize the smallest landing gear going on. One thing I thought was very strange, when they returned, the rear wheels were drowning, and the nozzle was broken, and the plane was temporarily suspended by two tires. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to the tires on the floor? Did they forget spoilers? Director to the Director: Before you make an "airplane" picture, you can learn all the flights. Sorry for the technical rout, but I give this movie 1/10.
