There are no spoilers in this review because everything is already shown in the movie's trailer. I am trying to balance in my review because I strongly support local films, but I can not support the setbacks against this film. It is slow, boring and boundary on pointless. Even "almost nice and unbelievable moments" are soon below the painful clich√©s and bad acting. Vernata Lopez and Wang Li Lin, are the only ones in the film that I usually like. The director thought he was trying to make a dramatic TV soap, then took it away and decided to keep it on the big screen. Leap Years must come with a RA rating (rated horror) but my faith in local movies has not changed. More good movies come, these films can not be done for a long time.
