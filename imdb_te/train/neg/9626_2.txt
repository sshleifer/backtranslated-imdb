Do not bounce about it. There are a lot of things in this movie. This is the whole way, not very funny, predictable, and logical. Let's start with the beginning: letters. Stiller in fat, weird guy belt is another breeze - boring, luckless guy, a comrade friend, and an assortment of cliches: anime - not just jungle, but the reality is just too simple, love interest - but really does not require any effort to do so Daredevil Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The storyline: A little unusual in the beginning , But no later film style, your average knock-knock joke. The "development" of Stiller's character did not really appear from anything - your average school play, the writers he started and the end he knew, but the middle bit did not have enough stock to say exactly. Finally, the versions of the alleged 'jokes' standard gross-out humor were very low; <br /> <br /> It is a simple fact about the film. It is good to understand the word 'shirt'. Hamburg can truly split a dog's feast here and Stiller and Aniston's sugar-plated audience may have attracted viewers, but the remaining flavor is just overflowing. <br /> Last comment: This movie may have been terrible, but Aniston is still friends of Kudrow's unpleasant 'Marzie X'
