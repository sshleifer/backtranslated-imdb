I love the bill because of its great script and characters, but I feel like changing the emotional type of soap. If you look at the promotional pictures / posters of the bill, two officers now see hugging / kissing or anything to do with a friendship, but the promotional images of the bill have long shown anything to do with the offense. This proves that the average type of television soap has changed a lot from a completely outstanding police drama. When I look at it, I feel like watching a police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I'm interested in police work and I have to say I'd still like the bill about that kind of thing, but I will really miss the greatness I've had. <br /> I am completely ruined by people who have taken the bill. <br /> <br /> They both went downhill to the script and the characters. I am telling you that the new characters are poor or anything because they are not gone (although some still still feel) and they are not sure, because they are just tough, personalities and script lines have all of the old characters so many new ones are associated with crazy relationships and family problems are. <br /> <br /> The Bill is always a crappily interesting thing to watch, but I lost a lot of its uniqueness (thats the right spelling) and is now classified as a horrible, untrue television soap As stated. 2/10 - Involved police officers recommended to watch for a good laugh of stupidity
