This film is good to start with. It was really muted after he told people he wanted to kill himself. After watching this film, I was angry and I felt like coming from such a small town. They made these people look too dumb and crazy. Nowadays there are people who follow him around the day. Many times these people are saying ways to kill him, and they are encouraging him. How many people have little respect for other people? I also think I have done a very good ending for this film. There are some good parts for this movie. Some people may like it, but I have not recommended this to anyone.
