Okay and a friend have been renting these days ago because we want to track B-movies from what we do. However, the girls in the cover of blood and the naked naked fangs and stuff ... Tom Savinini! This film can not fail! Right? Wrong !! It just seems like a waste! There is really no story, the dialogue is terrible (there is someone there? X 1000 !!!), the characters are .. well, they really lost any sort of personality ... the effects are terrible .. and this is a long walk through the rush of people Shots .. We're looking forward to something ... nothing has happened ... but ... "Oh, here comes nymphs! Oh .. they kiss ... Well ... and now oh ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they run around ... and the eyes closeups ... again ... oh, hes Tom Savini! Oh ... he Okay ... okay ... okay, maybe now something cool or interesting will happen .. Oh! Cool! Severed head! End ... oh crap .. "And finally i 'm of mine .. I' ll tell this! Give me a van, six actors, a good house, Tom Savin, naked girls with blood and foxes with fibers and I will do the coolest movie I've seen ... I have done movies with zero budget in two days of having good effects and a better performance and better script More than this ... What is this Johannes Guy doing? It's easy to make cool movies!
