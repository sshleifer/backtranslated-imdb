The only reason for giving this movie to the same star is the ending of the end. I usually like bad campy holiday movies, but it's not just eligible. It slowly becomes mad, it's not a bad plot again, but it's exactly what happens here. Some scenes (such as the end) are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh. I thought this film would really go in an interesting direction, but whatever it was and whatever it did was not fulfilled. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher movie, quiet night, try the Deadly Knight.
