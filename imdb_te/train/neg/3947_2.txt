In the comic, humility is strong. Alexandra Steaden, who played the role of Modesty Blaze, looks like an anoretic fashion model. She does not have moral or personality in comics. The rich does not advise a woman to show more skin to earn more money. I can not see any similarity with Modesty and my movie with my comic books. Like Mission Impossible, he played at the High School, Ethan Hunt in the compulsory chambers, when he went to junior high school and played by Hunt DJ Cavals (on a road trip). If you're a modesty fan, you'll be angry if you look at the movie. If you do not know much about Modesty Comics rent, you can not take your time back with this movie. Quentin Tarantino can not understand how to keep his name. I will ask a refund at my DVD rental store tomorrow.
