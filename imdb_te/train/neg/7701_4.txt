The original presentation is very good. They should leave a good note. The film killed the whole idea. It's too far between boring, overwhelming dramatic, and funny episodes to slow down. The film seemed to be really serious, and it's not exactly what I wanted from this sequel. In fact, for a long time now it is discouraging about the same thing. So sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder the next time. This film is just too dull, and that's not funny. Sorry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
