When I first heard about "down to earth", I was pretty happy. I'm a pretty big fan of Chris Rock, and he's particularly lively in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance is not nearly as good as his past performances, and the film is all very painful. <br /> Chris Rock, first off. He plays the whole movie as a stand-comedy routine. Clearly, this works fine with scenes where he is supposed to be standing up, but in the rest of the film, it does not. When he's talking to another character, he seems to think people are trying to make a roomful of laughs. He has some funny moments, but they are mostly stand-up scenes (decided to make his character a comedian). For the rest of the cast, they are very beautiful to give someone a rock to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> This film is not well directed. The film mainly consists of a joke plot: an old white man who pretends to be a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this might still work, and is very funny. The problem is, we saw a lot of rock and it's not enough old white person. It's supposed to be funny because of this white guy telling Chris Rock Jokes, but for longer time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. Some scenes are, in fact, hilarious where they decide the white guy who speaks like rock. If he showed more, the film was very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Down to Earth" is poorly acted, and poorly directed. This is a pretty big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
