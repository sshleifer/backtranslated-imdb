See originality with the same title since 1944! It was built for the TV movie, it's just god-awful! Although it is used (almost as I can) almost the same dialog, it does not work! Acting, poor directing OK, so it's made for TV, but why should you look for a bad copy when you can get an amazing hand in your original hands? Especially if you are spoiled the plot and enjoy very original, as if you were first watched! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (different), but it's worse than anything! Actors played here and only fit the bill! You can not trust them and who can not topplay Edward G. Robinson's original from the original? If you want, you can see only after seeing the original and if you look at it, you'll be so brave! It's almost sacred!
