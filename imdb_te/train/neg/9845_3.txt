!!!! <br /> When I see the first half of the GUINTY AS SIN I believe it was made in 1993 because it was JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas Clone 80s. It starts with a murderer and tells the audience that "he is confession or innocence, is he going to bed with his attorney?" The audience went to say, but half the film shows the credentials of this film. <br /> This is a very poor thriller but a very unforgivable thing. It is that Sydney Lite has directed us the same man who brought us classic courtroom play all the time 12 Agra Men
