Did a few years ago recall a chain-smoking channel in 60 Minutes? This is her. Many of the folks have reviewed the film without taking advantage of filmmakers. Producers have used the "mouth-word" promotions to successfully launch without financial and philosophical underpages for this piece of marketing trip. If you believe the channel, rebirth, new age, and everyday balloons, this picture is for you. If you want to talk about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you give her a bunch of your money. If you can confidently go through the website of Ramada without disappointment, you probably think that the fallen bucks on this infomercial spending are well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
