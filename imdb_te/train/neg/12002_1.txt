A tragedy made for these tragedies. I'm sitting in my hairdogs, and I want to break my predecessor's chairs. <br /> <br /> Nikhil Sharah has six stories. And there are no interesting characters. The screenplay was dull, he probably was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new, nothing to catch audiences and dialogues, you heard a million times ago. One of the stories is that this couple is not having sex because the series of disasters every time they want to do. Is not really this story really necessary? It's not creativity, but it does not have Advani's comedy. Other stories (this is the only story I have of interest) is based on a man's disbelief and it ends up in the slum old-old Satyatri Poors-Parameshwar trash. I do not know anything about Salman-Priyanka plot. There is no problem in the plot to be the plot. She can not take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salman. Why did she not marry him and could still make a movie? Or do they want to prove to the world of Advani and Priyanka? It is true that female actors can not succeed if they are married or want to work in movies after they get married. The movie will be produced by six actors. So he utilizes the sponsors like Times Group, who unfairly promote their Famous Magazines. Also, the ladies love to wear a jewelery brand too! I came to IMDb to give the worst rating and I was amazed to see the smashing posts. It just goes to show the sad state of Bollywood and how much the star struck. With fans like this, movies such as Salam e Ishq may continue and maybe even worse.
