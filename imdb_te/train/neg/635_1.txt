Louis Rayner received Oscar for his performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, there is no need for her role. She did not say much and looked tender throughout the film. The slave (he did a fantastic job for his acting) after being married to the role of Louise Paul Muni. Set in ancient Asia, although the two actors are not Asian, many of their characters are convinced. I hope that Paul has received an Oscar for his performance since Louise earned him an Oscar. Her progressive actress should be one of the first to be the first. It's Hollywood's often done. Al Pacino has played Italian and Cuban roles. I felt louder throughout Louis's performance, and when she died, she did not change in expression from previous scenes. Her entire film remained throughout; She changed her expression or emotion only twice. If her amazing performance is very subtle, I think I did not see it.
