The National Treasure is Over-Rated and Over-Hipping. Nicholas Cage is not an incredible action hero, the film is not "Indiana Jones". <br /> <br /> People who have compared the film to the Indian Jones Classic Trilogy lost their rocker seriously. <br /> <br /> I do not really see any audience shooting this movie. Perhaps teen-teen spectators prefer it, but I'm absolutely ridiculous. I can not imagine adults or young people to make this movie bigger. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure will not borrow anything from the "The Da Vinci Code", which is unexpected and enthusiastic. This whole idea is to steal the declaration of independence and be able to move across Washington DC and Philadelphia. This is when the "bad guys" are battling and being considered as "non stop action" (at any time when damaging). I love the scene in particular, connecting the cars with cars that do not damage it with a tick-declaring declaration in the middle of a busy road. Oh brother! <br /> They reminded me of the episode of Brady Bunch, where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his production plans. Except, Brady Bunch's episode is much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> Such a tremendous treasure idea that nobody believes is buried in the US's secret tide. Literally, this treasure of thousands of undiscovered "precious" items is in the scrap. Yes true !! Ridiculous !! <br /> Even worse, speed and accuracy cage finds out and the "hardest" evidence for these ancient complications is the first different! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Vote and other actors in the "National Treasure" they are strong, woody, and flat. However, when you're working with such a lousy conversation, it's 100% bad for the actor. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is an okay picture to see once. I can not recommend it crossing it and certainly can not buy it on the top, a tremendous scavenger hunt. <br /> If you want to see the first one, rent it .......
