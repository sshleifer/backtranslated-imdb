My friends and I have seen this film a week ago and I feel absolutely essential to say that this film is not only the top five worst films I've ever seen (or at least those who read this). I've seen a lot of movies but nobody beats this one being stupid. You can say I suffered watching ... My only need is that we were waiting for a few hours and were able to go anywhere without freezing off our buttocks. I do not recommend this to anyone. At first we saw some really bad porn movie but found that the case was not discovered after 10 minutes. It's not comedy, it's not a play, it's not action, it's not horrible, it's just terrible!
