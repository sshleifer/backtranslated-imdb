I do not know why, but after all the hype in the NPR I thought this was the new movie ... If you were interested in nature programs you had all the best footages for BBC Docs and Natzeo projects ... It's a complete story for Disney and high-dramatic music Re-creates, which has great moments to gain the benefit of Earth Day and e Darth Vader is always good to hear ....... hmm, .. James Earl Jones is talking, but I hoped for a ground breaking film taking into consideration the new camera technology used in making this film ...... It is refined to a child audience, so you can watch good footage for free on YouTube ... I'm Choiounkawatsi (S) for some reason, and this film is not sure
