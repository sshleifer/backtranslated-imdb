So the other night I decided to see the tales from Hollywood Hills: Natick Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer had acted in it and thought that I had to say something about quality. <br /> <br /> This storyline is really confusing. The film has two heroes simultaneously running. They have nothing in common. The whole story of this film is waiting for me to meet these two heroines, so the plot is clear to me. <br /> <br /> 2) The film says Natica is about Jackson. Well, sometimes. The film narrates two different fables and a short piece of drama about Jackson. Another title for this image is not a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> This is where I left the movie to end my story. Doing this will not waste 90 minutes in your life.
