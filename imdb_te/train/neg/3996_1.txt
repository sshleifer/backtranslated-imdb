I can not see what everyone likes about this film. Setup was too long and talked, and when it was finished, the main character was flat and opaque as he was in the first scene. After Cusack came to the hotel room at the end of the movie, I was surprised, as well as what was going on to keep me engaged the next day or so. Answer: Too much, just John Cusack has a long, drawn out, mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> If the Cusack character has more depth. . His voluntary may be more complete recurrence of his everyday life. . . If the film could well develop its half-baked themes about losses and confidence or possibly tacked them in the first place. . . Perhaps one of these styles is one of these styles, if the film is chosen to be a psychological horror or thrill-ride horror. . . I do not know. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with two horror fans and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> The hotel split, an alarming crazy lady, is a stupid-it-et-f-fun fun keeper in the Air Duke, which does not have more than three minutes or more minutes, the film is a bore. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story uses stealing ideas from the shining and uses them for a less powerful effect. Stephen King has now reduced himself to steal ideas
