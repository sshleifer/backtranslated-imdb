I told Mork and Mindy that the film is over, I saw it cool, and I was a bit too wet. The sparks in his neck that korea people started kicking people I like my Lord smell the Asian people and suck the reason they dogs eat all the time. The back track chuck has some terrible appearance and does not have the intelligence of a simple but robotic human. Some people compare it to his earlier days when his car wash analyst and holy devil and the last ghost of Christmas believed. The film is very good, I put my newborn children in a box and dropped it in Mr. Norris Mailbox. I'd raise my child without him knowing Chuck Norris as a karate expert in the world that I thought he would have for the rest of his life in real life.
