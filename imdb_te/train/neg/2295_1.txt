The dirty boring image with attractive mercury is completely wasted. Perhaps a local movie was released for a minute Thursday, and four others pulled me apart from Sydney's entire population. Native actors such as John Paulson and Terry Cirio have been well-received (notably the Popson Swimfane, which turns out to be the director of cinematic thrillers as hidden and hiding) and Terry Serie Thag never gained a Gaverson. But Paul Mercury will be one of Australia's largest exports on the screen. The characters like this are major disappointments and waste of time just like talents and movies.
