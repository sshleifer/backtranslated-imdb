After the repeat of the Jilligans Island TV movie, several TV movies have been made from classical shows from the 1980s. Most of these films lost the boat completely and captured the performances of a very special humor. Mundaster's Revenge is the most disappointing since the Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style is not really in the original series. Yvonne de Carlo, an outstanding comedian and essential to the series, was totally wasted - she had a short time in the 90-minute film than in her 30 minute episode. And what does the "Eddie" and "Merlin" characters in the film are not more than comos, what is it that makes them youthful and reworking them? With very little rewriting, they can use Butch Patrick and Pat Priestes. In 1981, Caesar's old partner comic film, Emozen Coca, also a major part of the Beverly Hilbillie return in a TV movie reunion was a major lead, although Sid Caesar was very happy with some of his spooky relatives, Did not appear in the role). At the beginning of the film there is another weird unsustainable bit, the Munster family that represents wax dolls at the local horror wax museum. They are not the "typical" (strange) American family, but why are they there rather than famous monsters? It was the final mantestars project, originally cast in their roles, a family dinner in the late 1980s and completely new cast and guest appearances in the 1990s TV movie DeCarlo, Louise, Priest, and Patrick.
