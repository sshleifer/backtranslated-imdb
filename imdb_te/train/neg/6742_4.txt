For the romantic comedy and the end of the experience, I often determine the quality of the film based on the compliments of my eyes. Unfortunately, "The Wedding Date," I can rate this movie with more than 10 tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies for Debra messing and Dermot Mulroney fans, but I did not see a lot of chemistry between them two characters. Reverse "Pretty Woman" in the role of the Deermott character Nick is a reverse "Pretty Woman" film with a high priced male escort hired by Debra's character's Cat, along with England for her sister's marriage. A romantic relationship between the patron and the client is probably evolving. But the conversation seemed forcefully and artificial. <br /> <br /> There are not enough romantic sparks to fly in the relationship of Nick and Cat. <br /> <br /> In supporting role, Amy Adams is the sister of Cat's sister. When Amy came up the screen, she worked as a spark plug and catalyst for the power of the film. If Amy plays Adams Cat, it may be more active. But instead of reaching Clenex, I'm looking for a whisin in an attempt to at least act as if I have some real feelings and love in this film.
