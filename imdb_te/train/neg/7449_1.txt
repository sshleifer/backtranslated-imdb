Very frustrating version of Lorna Doone. Most missing characters, romantic scenes, changes in story line, are very small and low budget. Enough enough communication to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. Some scenes Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I'll make it better to hide it. I wanted to ban them until I was healed, and I felt compassion. Why did not this movie kissing scenes? At the end just a frustrated kiss scene. Lorna Doon is a great epic story and truth. 2000 Lorn Doon Reform is two times more romantic, more enjoyable in the book and more true.
