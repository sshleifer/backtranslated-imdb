The film has a number of problems, but the bottom line has tried to do very little. The storyline is good, but there is no money to do the story justice. The non-existent budget really killed the film. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) credits in 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which is a box office smash. However, the film has some serious cash support from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example when it does not make a movie. Whether he should wait for a few more years, technology has made little impact on the effects. (He did not say he found a company with money.)
