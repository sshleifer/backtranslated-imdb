Bruce Lee is a great martial artist, but this film is one of the most deadly films ever made. It dies as a helicopter drops after Bruce Lee's neck hit the kind of a ninja knife back but the front scene is near him not to explain how he got on a helicopter but not in the air already 200 feet in the helicopter. It gets irrelevant as irrational as something from the cheapest comic book ever since. Perhaps this idea is not very depressed, but it does not work with artistic creativity in view of a scenario. Dozens of such marshal arts bombers are made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude Van Dam has added credible tales to his films and has filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Steven Seagal films are better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk films in Hong Kong in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Game of Death II' comes into the waste movie category in my opinion, even though it is being Bruce Lee.
