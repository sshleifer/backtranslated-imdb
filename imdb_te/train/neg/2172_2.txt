Bottle of road warriors, unexpected, and practically unwatchable remake bottom. The film follows the exact story as the Philippine film STRYKER and is so worse! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences ... in the list and continues. In the early 80s, literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in Italy are some good, some bad. It is very competitive, there is no competition. The mood of the film is not entirely tragedy and painful, bore and half of the experience sitting by this. At the start of the film there are 1 (one) good chase sequence and a cool shot of the man holding the hand grenade explosion. But everything else about this film reeks seriously! For a genuine post-neuk fun, track the copy of ENDGAME, after the Fall of NEW YORK, or rather from the BRONX. They were more enjoyable than this.
