The first installment of childhood ("The Little Mermaid") is my favorite movie. It is filled with great characters, songs and a fun family image. For the first time a week or so I saw this film again. I think this movie is very sequels and does not exceed their original. I feel like this because I have high expectations and I grew up. <br /> <br /> It starts when Eryl gives birth to a beautiful baby, Melody. Eric and Ariel feared frightened by Morgan (Ersel's sister), so they built a large wall around their home in the seaside. Melody grows and she begins to wonder beyond the walls where she is forbidden. <br /> <br /> Morgan tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> Do not want to give the film anyway. I like the voices the same again and again wonderful song. Overall, I think this is a good family film!
