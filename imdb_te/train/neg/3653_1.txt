I could not help but I mean movies that are scary and just like movies that are just plain bad. I personally list it in my own top 10 worst films under the Alice Beasts! Do not imagine any academy awards for acting, watch this movie and have a laugh. The image is more likely to be self-aware. In all honesty, I'm worse than this one. Plus some manhood is unbelievable that the same people who have just died have got its original cruising desert round. I think one of its love or hate movies. You can make your own mind yes its awful but thats why I love why I somehow pulls it off
