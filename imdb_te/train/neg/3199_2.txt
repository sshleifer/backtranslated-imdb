Joe Don Baker. He was the greatest in "Walking Tall" and had a good bit-part in "Goldie", but all hope in "ultimate justice" here ... the Dark Side won. <br /> <br /> Like most of humanity, this experience has been with me in MST3K and it is an experience! Mike and Robots pull out their claws and bake the bacon's flesh and slide it completely in the film. It is clear that they started with their "anti-Zoe" kick in "Michel", and their sequel with a background here. <br /> It makes for a funny experience: There are plenty of choices that are chosen. My favorite ones - "It's' 'Moodoof: Texas Ranger' <br /> <br />" A big fat node ". But here, it really has some fun value. You get the chance, catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> The two stars for "Final Justice" <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when in town Joe Don.
