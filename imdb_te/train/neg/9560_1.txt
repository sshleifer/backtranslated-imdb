Thanks to God I watched this as a friend's place and did not need to pay for it. The storyline is horribly transparent and the whole movie is considered to be the episode of a TV show. If you know about computers or electronics, watch out. You think that the film is insulting your intellect. <br /> <br /> Also, actress Mitch Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows off the worst performance I've seen, except in sex. She's lucky that Matt Launter is actually good. He is the one who takes the picture. <br /> <br /> Watching this film I wasted nearly two hours in my life. It's a shame they had to call a sequel, because it's really a fan of the original, which looks really great.
