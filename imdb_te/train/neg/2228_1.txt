This film is weak, the box-cover East LA's hardest gang and it really works like a clay queen to take down all the tough guys in Santa Ana's, James Cahill tough Cho Gang. It's fake, boring, sensible and whack, I tried to get my money back from the video store and this picture is very bad. It is also in the homo-romantic tip away from the video-box. Jay Cahill will be starring in gay porn .James is in every scene, and he can not work to save his life. The film will make Eva Longoria hot, but James can not even score with her !!!!!!!!!!! I thought when I was looking at Gay Porn and stopped by the whole movie. James clearly wanted to stay with men but instead he would like to submit his gay wishes that he was back up by gang members over and over. His martial arts skills are very small, and some real gang members take him and his weak skills and break him out.
