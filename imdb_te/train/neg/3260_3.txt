Dock Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Poorly scripted, over-acted, and just plain silly. It is said ... it's a somewhat enjoyable movie. The film wants to be viewed in a group with a vast supply of inexpensive beer. This is one of the movies, "Santa Claus Martians wins" or "Euro, The Hunter from the Future" ... that's great. If you have the right group of people, this is an explosion to watch the film. It's campy. It's fun. It has a theme by Sousa. If you're looking for a good image, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors about some studio remake prospects ...
