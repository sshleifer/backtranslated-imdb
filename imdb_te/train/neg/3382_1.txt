This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical score ever made. The version of the chorus line is amazing. The film will miss the mark in almost every way. Even casting is baffling. Take Audrey Land Val as "Dancing 10 Look 3" Walls Song. The val story is a great dancer but a 3 looks department. Yes, she will find a solution, but in the end she is a great dancer. What do the brilliant filmmakers do? They are an actress who can not dance and is famous for watching great. <br /> <br /> Then there is choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett is moving in his grave. Why do not they use his choreography? It's not really improving.
