If there is a movie that deserves a big fat zero rating, it's a worst pile. I love zombie movies and even bad ones usually have something for them but this is not outrageous. <br /> <br /> I'm really angry at seeing this film because it's insulting to be poor, in fact I think it's acceptable. <br /> <br /> There are no plots, there are ambiguity and buttocks. People respond, take action or resemble humans in any way. The whole picture is also depicted in two rooms, which resembles very rarely decorated places. The whole thing is a nonsense mess, it does not go anywhere and when zombies turn to the end they will look rubbish and do not do too much. <br /> <br /> I was able to make a better film than you and never could ever see a movie. <br /> Honestly, the worst image of all times. You'll only note positive ways of giving this a 10/10 and that's the way to urge you to purchase the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
