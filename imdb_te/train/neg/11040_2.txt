You should see this show just once, the formula is perfect in each episode. Jim did well, but he ridiculed his wife, eventually discovering what she really did, she looks at her cheek and gives a gum smile when she looks confused. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you have a baby, She yells and goes home to see how scary she is. On Valentine's Day he filled a ball with tickets (hence he explained the missing wages). She finds 'she' mistaken and the common 'Oh Jim, you're so lovely'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be relieved, No and Jim comes just like a proud self-centered jerk. <br /> <br /> The only reason for IMO is to succeed, because we're now in a lot of people with TVs, and nowadays you are talking about the person who is blocking the walls and you <br /> <br /> The 'two and a half men' And happy.
