Is there anything worse than a humorous comedy? The answer is yes; Failed to produce any interest throughout the film. The premise is not very bad - the innocent person for an illegal business - but it works as a potboiler with poor script and screenplay and does not work. <br /> Is this good 'B' 1942? It's hard to imagine. The positive aspect of the film is that the '30s' and' 40s have many well-known actors such as Warren Hyman, Vince Burnett and Robert Armstrong (I'm Richard Cromwell by Gary Cooper <br /> "It's a Bengal Lancer Lives ", I could not count him). <br /> <br /> You can not recommend this item and it does not give you 3 ratings - if you choose, the root canal.
