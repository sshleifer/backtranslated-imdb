Oh my. I decided to go into the cinemas with some friends, and wanted to see those lightweight, feel-good Christmas films, and I hate it. The picture failed. Full stop. Paul Gyamitti, who I felt as a good actor, played his part and was just frightened with Vince Vaughn, a personal favorite with me. They turn a Christmas movie and some new-style. The harmonious combination of the bad, the better, but it turned out to be very bad. The first ten minutes or so are not too bad, but when Santa saw it, it ended. No good no, the same stay on the rate, no character development, and certainly one of the worst Christmas movies ever found. Do not see it.
