I had a bit of time to kill before watching football, so I saw this film in the channel and saw it literally looked like I had mentally faced my version of Baton's death, a film that unveiled the Mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the early credits were a highlight of the film and it went into such an endless descent that seemed like a hiccup of the recent drop in the stock market. This acting was very bad, and I hoped that everything would be buried in the end. Steven Seagal's high-performing performance in the "On Deadly Ground" under Casper van Dean made me a long time, Woody Woodpecker was thinking of sitting on his shoulder with his line reading wood. I thought my kitten was more expressive when I wanted popcorn to eat his emotional sequence. The director is very rare and I have anxious to recover my nephew's Grade 3 drama recital which has more pace and good vision and this film has spliced ​​together from the then-mentioned franchise afterthoughts it's also a tribute. The FX of the film is very bad and I think the director and producers feel enviormentally friendly by cheap special special recycling from grade Z horror flicks from former Z. Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis look beyond me and see how they misrepresent their relationship with their agents in relation to such an intricacies. The film is the reason why this film is to reduce your IQ to a long look. My warning to you and everyone is your dangerous film. On one hand note I saw at IMDb Sometimes wages are being published for movies, I am surprised if the actors are on their way to pay for poor performance in such films. Be careful at all costs and stay safe.
