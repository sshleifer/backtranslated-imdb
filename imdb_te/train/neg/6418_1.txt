Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. <br /> <br /> I want to see my friend and her friends, because <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience. Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Happy Feet, but it's better than cinema. Anyway, we can not imagine that we are really good ... we laugh at it. Cool with me ... I was having trouble destroying the movie for other people in the theater, but it does not matter if other couples talk and get out. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, the other people who went to infiltrate into 2 Borat are happy to see this again. It turns out to be funny so the film is not scary, it's not scary ... it's just boring. It's not terrible "Baby Genuises" terrible, it's as terrible as ... Not all is fun. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but today the problem with the horror industry is a PG-13 horror that is not boring and horrifying to you, or you are very rude to either too much blood or people in an R horror horror movie. <br /> Do you want a PG-13 horror that you agree with? See "The Grudge." <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague ... It literally led to death. <br /> <br/10
