Well watching this exciting movie and here is a basic summary of my life and an hour and a few minutes: the jeto booth comes out of the box, this kid gives 3 cries of shaggy hair <br /> I mainly laughed, I cried ...... But basically I've laughed at Shear's comedy come from fantastic acting skills Ggari friends to sit around and drink a little more, serious need of a good laugh I recommend this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> The film was taken from 3 magical desires. <br /> If I have 3 wishes, I'm not earning money for everyone who plays like Hollywood.
