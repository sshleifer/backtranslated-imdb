Dude, really !!!! Where have you been for the last 20 years, which is horrifying in all kinds of ways? It's wrong to be a joke, low budget, but it's a smile, you can not compare it to classic, toad browning freaks, Dracula and Frankenstein victims, endant monster, Ernest Tegger, Paul Venner's Ghost Train and passengers, it's bad name, bad Acting, bad screenplay, etc. The whole waist of money and free time is horrifying at the sight of most movies My favorite of all time, I have really nothing to say, so do not try to see something daft something I have nothing to say
