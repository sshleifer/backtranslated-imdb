1940. - Nazi-occupied Poland recorded with the innocent collaboration of the Jewish community through a German cameraman in Lodge Ghetto in Poland, compiled from an old collection, from international newspapers clips and related cultural imagery World's Jews are called fraudsters and parasites. This 'documentary' understands Jewish life from the perspective of anti-Semiticism and Nazi ideology. An honest, cinematic-unique expression of ethnic hatred. I personally find that the film is frightening and highly dangerous. Such images only hope that the screen can never be reached again.
