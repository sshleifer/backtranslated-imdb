"The film that came out of" Andy Laml, "but I agree that Jodik Killer was drowning under my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend in young filmmakers who use digital video for their initial projects, which would make it possible for children to create their own work without costing in expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers are also thought to be filtered by filming, thus making it look more like a celluloid. The effect is not perfect, but it helps. Unpublished digital video really only works for "mockumentary" style, because it feels more than a video. There is a primary problem with Jodik Killer. Watching the film seems to be the soap opera in the daytime about the murderer. That's not like watching the movie. It is not forgiven that Lommeel is not a young filmmaker. He should know very well. He needs to know that creating a horror (or suspense!) In the video is virtually impossible. This person is directed from the sixties for the love of God! Being the only director who failed to improve the career of more than forty years in business. And lucky us, he wrote the script too! So you can expect nothing, frustrating behavior, and revolving actions that are at least a really pretentious plot element that you leave completely unpleasant. Please miss this movie. You will thank me later.
