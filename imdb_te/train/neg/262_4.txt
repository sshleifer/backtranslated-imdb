Jamie Fox is my favorite comedian. However, he thinks he has sold his first big budget lead role. Foxx Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chappel appear as follows, which is considered a funny concept (wash money taxes, blue streak) for black men who are pretty offenders. <br /> <br /> I laughed a few times and all these comedians chose happy characters, but these guys love to see Alex Marlon Wayan's Dream in Dream to Dream. Or in the live color of Tommy Davidson and Damon Waits Spike Lee's sarcastic illustrator for moving the shows in Bamboozle.
