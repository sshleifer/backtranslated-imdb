This film is the worst horror film I've ever seen. Acting is terrible, talk about the horrible and cheesy and predictable plot! I can never see this movie or I will not recommend this movie to anyone. What time wasted! First, I realized what I was going to do when the movie was started. There are copies of the scene from all other horror movies they made for the film and they captured everything in a movie. Suspicious phone calls, Halloween night, a mental, and a knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not afraid of the film that I thought I needed to do horror movies. For the preparation of the film, its pretty hilarious to talk about how this film is so great and scary. I do not recognize how the films are cheaper than the "scary movie". At least there were some good actors and then it was pulling a good horror movie.
