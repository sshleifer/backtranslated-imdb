It often does not see a movie that I think this is a terrible one. I continued to look at it, and it was thought to be considered seriously as it was thought to be a joke for every minute. <br /> <br /> The acting is insulting and conditions are badly hit and clich√©s. If an image is made in 1920 (for example) and has its quality in the direction of the hide & sequence, we think the film is innocent again. It happens, this film was done in 2000 and I have a little charm as this one is yet to see a movie from the silent era <br /> <br /> Make sure to go to a serious movie. <Br> <br /> [Not a rating value]
