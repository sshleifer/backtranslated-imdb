The 1950s (London) Soho and the upcoming entertaining people. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. More, less. Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar video. Here he forgets that he is two minutes with people who can not really work - but two hours? What is he thinking? Who are the viewers? A well-way-back reminder of who cares about a book. Chancellor's usual London story takes his chance. <br /> <br /> Can you really drag the movie further down? Oh I know, the third rated songs that sound like they are made on the spot. David Bowie is the film title and a few times and it is highlighted. The soundtrack album is mound pigeon material. <br /> There is a good thing there. Soho's good entertainment for a long time. Insult can not think of what they put forward.
