Reading through these positive reviews I find myself baffled. How much do you feel as my second favorite Jane Austen's grief is felt? There are many problems with the picture, already mentioned in some reviews; <br /> <br /> Many characters have a bad cast and Ivan McGregor or Tony Colelot, while keeping them in a show, is valuable and very worse for Paltrow. I enjoyed her acting in some roles, but here she is disgusting - she is removed from her own consciousness, nostalgia, treacherous and completely from her characters and around her. The most disappointing effort - although Emma could not save the film.
