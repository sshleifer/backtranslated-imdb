Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 and / or whatever you want to call. <br/> <br /> .. A group of people in the Massachusetts island resort is a nasty witch who kills each person using ruthless, torture methods. Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff) takes pictures for Linda (Catherine Huckland, whose voice and attitude is similar to EE-YOR of the Cartoon), a virgin practicing witchcraft at the island resort without permission. Jerry Brooks (All Ross Ross, who played a very rare bitch) Reidor Tony Giordano's son Jerry (Rick Forestsworth), along with his daughter, Jean (Linda Blair) and grandson Freddie, husband Freddy (Robert Shampon, ) To go to Riot's boat to pay attention to the property by Tommy (Michael Ancestar, bored throughout, to work on this in the trash, preferring instead to watch Sesame Street) to get his feet wet in the business is definitely a kid. Architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is a Nampho) can help create a resort of Rose's back. The captain's captain, The Lady in Black (Hildegard Kaneff, her make-up and lip-stick wear extra thick) and a storm. The boat will go out (will be guided by the invisible force of the lady in black, I guess) with it again and again and again and again. Most of the victims lead to another type (possibly hell or some kind) through a kind of hoop by a red wormhole before encountering their grisly luck. Here they are wearing garments wearing clothed garments. A mouthpiece sowed her mouth before hanging her mouth in the chimney, while others burned the oven. A poor soul sat with a knife that penetrates around her flesh and wrapped her flesh tightly before she could be seen. A veteran slowly wakes up because of his veins knobs (and bleeding) and the blood vessels of the neck sparks the skin on the face of Hasselhoff! A man was crucified with nails in his hands before being hanged on an open fire. Blair's pregnant victim is filled with her hair while another woman ends up talking in tone. This demon-rape man raises a "infected" mouth, and the homeless sheep are happily happy. Although the movie is overly diminished, it is the slowest animal for those who would like to see the lowest point in Hesselhoff and Blair's career. It is almost impossible at times, short-to-suspense building. The worst and ludicrous death scenes are hanging clumsy. Certainly some gore is okay, but the picture shows a lot of victims after they run through the ringer. We have a chance to see pregnant women jumping up to three story windows (who look like stuntmen dressed in bad deeds). Oh, and the lady in the reflection face of the block often pop up for objects to see the characters. Tommy has a slightly Sesame Street Recorder, which tape The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo champs, which is definitely used later. For some reason, the lady in black likes to visit small Tommy. He was not fearing, Tommy was very frustrated to show any expression on his face, little fear. I want to say more? This is a real stinker. The Hague.
