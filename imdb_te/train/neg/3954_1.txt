Footage from the first Boogeyman film as well as footage from the last Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love movie Brain Waves, is the whole film. It is framed with some of the more current (from the early 90's) footage, boring, less work and cheaply filmed. The film will not only completely complete past, but the film will repeat the same flashbacks. So you can see the recycle footage again, if you have not already seen it. The originals are not right. So far I have never seen a film that I have ever seen .... Someone has dipped past dollars from these films. The whole ripoff. And talk about padding ... why do not I write 10 lines about this rubbish? If I can tell that it's the worst in 2 lines, that should be enough.
