Gore and Sex In the days ahead, real horror films were made. The Blood of the Blood, in my estimation, is the best, although other critics have given mixed ratings. <br /> <br /> Director Antonio Margherty was named Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno) on the web in 1970 to recreate his own image. He did not understand why, but remake Anthony Francesa and Klaus Kinski in the film and was very good at its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wanted to give American audience a greater preference. I'm not really sure. He remade the original and color in black and white. <br /> <br /> <br /> Blood Castle is an amazing Italian gothic. La Donja Macabra is said to be an unpublished work by Edgar Allen Poe, appearing in the film. Po and Lord Blackwood, owner of a haunted fortress, American writer Alan Foster (George Rivier) did not spend the fort on Also Souls Night, and did not survive the castle. Foster agrees to eagerly wager but soon regrets it, he witnesses a series of murders committed by ghosts. Every few years the ghosts seem to come to life, but they attempt to re-enter the crimes committed in life. Lord Blackwood comfortably forgot to tell Foster that his blood needed for reproduction in the next Blood All Souls Night! <br /> <br /> Even though Elisabeth was one of the ghosts, their fondness for foster and beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (played by unmatched Barbara Steel) did not last long. I do not end up, but because of the horror story, the castle of the blood is not every romantic tragedy. <br /> Comments. The film is a great climate, and it's also the Italian standards. My personal opinion is good for the horror than they are anyone, and somewhat black and white shoot only increases this. In aesthetics, Spider's Web is good in its own right, color and more brightness. I liked temporary shots, and most modern directors do not have the patience. In fact, when Alan first came into the eternal castle, we would treat him for several minutes, go from room to room, fear, and disgust in his face and habits. By the time the first ghost appeared, the audience was fully encouraged and ready to go. The amazing dialogue between Alan and the demons is not often in the classic ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes, there are many scenes for this kind of film. <br /> <br /> Elisabeth's "murder" and dance scene (which reminds the single dance of the vampire in 1962's Carnival of Souls) is very good. <br /> <br /> Sad, some general interest viewers can hear anytime, this movie. This is insult, because the rest is the cut above. I got my copy of the cinema scene and can not buy anywhere else. This is a must see for people who are interested in this genre.
