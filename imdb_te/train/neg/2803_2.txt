The film's limitations (the whole movie in one setting - a music studio - only 5 or 6 stars on the whole) should be better. If you have these limits in making a movie, how would lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, Clerx was speaking of a hair under acting, except for an enjoyable film, this ingredient. <br /> <br /> It attempts to self-reference a couple of episodes, but these characters are badly distributed by casting. And the main character Neil Guy, what a curiosity looser. Apparently 10 people made this film and they all know each other, and it's probably a real rock band they have, but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how horrible all around. <br /> <br /> I do not see this grateful (Starz on demand again!) but it is under the title "The Possessed" Studio 666, which does not matter what you do for the title, it does not help. This might be a much better movie - they should make the stuff you make and things that work within those limits, when they have clear image parameters that have no clear film parameters when there is no need for making this bad image you can work better. Instead they figured they would be good enough for mediocrity. <br /> <br /> If you're in the whole b-movie trash, let's go and see it. .
