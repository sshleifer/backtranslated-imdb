I have seen the worst camera work, the use of the sapphire filter, the movie grainy, the script is terrible, and finally the big battle is predictable? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Bad murderers will forget how to roll around the same vehicle throughout the whole movie .. After witnessing key witnesses and federal agents, they think they're tracked down, ETC really does not bother looking at it ..
