Yash Raj films and corrupt Chopra are losing insulting experience and are not even worth the film tip standard. I started to hit my teeth in a full-fledged whole line with a complete line of skyscraper that was not fully completed, and in the last scene, my country and its co-filmmakers had withdrawn millions of rupees on such stupidity. The actors are insulting to comment and comment on it and they have some vocals. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in your film selection. Kareen shows the skin that is infected and gets Akshay as Dim-Whit. Anil is another retard with a playful charm for English. His friends appreciated their performance and would have enough to pop the bloodstream with a strange cinematography in the last 15 minutes. Do not look at any kind of brain cells, fuel or your money - instead of the independent film of independent film with the Konkana sensor with SEK / Rent AMU - India. I think it's a brilliant, sharp and fantastic story story that touches everyone with intellectual actors and does not lose all of the Indian film production.
