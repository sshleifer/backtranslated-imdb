Take care of comments behind the curtain! Most of the people who comment positive about the film are royalties. It is a terrible film in every way. There is no comedy that makes a funniest / comedy video assuming high school students without any money. They will receive a D for this. College children are asked to receive F or leave school. The jail time or at least the cinematic observation should have been created because this professor was created by "Professionals". I enjoy watching bad movies like "Plan 9 from external space" but this does not even come into that category. The script, acting, sound and direction are very vulnerable, it is almost impossible to see. If you enjoyed watching the funny pictures of Ed Wood, Blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. After viewing it you will get an experience of wasting an hour and a half in your life.
