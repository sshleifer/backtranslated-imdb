I saw the film's debut screening in New York and was disappointed with my friends and many other audiences. This film is not so bad. The snake-bite victim is dead. Samuel L. Many saw Jackson surprisingly tired and snake effects were dull. It reminded me of one of those cheesy Scipi movies, the film's not being funny or campy. It is all worn, flat, and outwardly formula. I think the fact is that Anaconda is fun. SOAP recognizes part of it and plays along with it, but the script with any fears of the compound is easy to understand. This is the worst kind of lame image: it's a pleasure.
