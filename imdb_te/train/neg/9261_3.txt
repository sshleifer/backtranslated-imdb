Since I've seen the other three, I also figured it might be this catch made for the fourth part of the TV in the Omen series. A stand alone image, this image is mediocre; But the continuation of the 1976 work; This is a mockery. The movie will go down when running from several rows' thoughts; That is the idea of ​​leading a woman to a woman. It is clear that acting is very standard for television, which lacks the plot and the gruesome murder scenes appearing in previous three are a bloodless minimum. The film keeps a thread with the original, although it is clear that I can not get out of it; That revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Plot basics are largely copied by Richard Donner's original name, a young couple, Delia (they are not fortunate for Damilla or Damia). There is a big dog involved, and a child minder; And very quickly, the wife starts doubting that the child is not quite normal; <br /> <br /> The first two sequels to The Omen were not bad at all, and the series was really number three. I think there is no money involved in the line because there is really no artistic reason why this movie is made. This does not bring nothing to the table in terms of realism, and the only thing that can succeed is that it's just annoying fans of the series. The film looks like a TV movie and most plays like a movie about a little girl's troubled upbringing. In fact, Asia Viera looks like a small bitch; But she never convinced her that she was the Antichrist, as her playful and her 'evil' was too much she was ridiculous. Faye Grant gives the role of the Metiist, and not impressing; The rest of the cast accepts the time of worrying to act in such a horror junk. The only good thing about this film is the theme tune, which of course ripped from the original; And is in excessive usage. Overall, this film is not really valuable; It offers nothing famous for the series and does not have a weak second sequel justice.
