She may have an Oscar and Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is constantly a candidate for Razzie. It should be noted that she needs money to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> She took four thugs in the mall parking, and the first thing they had is the gun. What does she do? She begins to push and curse them as she knows martial arts or something. She tries to stay away, but after the crash she loses in the forest. Why did not she go home to anyone? We get four thugs with guns pursuing a woman with a pistol. Of course, their guns have no match for her wrench. Ha! However, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. <br /> Now, Christmas is her home for her - and she has brought a gun!
