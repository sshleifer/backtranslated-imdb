I do not know the silent film with this story. I do not care for silent films - cool humor, light and pictures flickering, etc. I have given the low score that I was assigned. I mentioned about Chapter 8 to show any interest in this story and I have a popcorn that may have thrown on the screen. Perhaps these appeals to the science fiction group? The only thing missing is a zombie scene and brain conversion. On Friday night I went with two people and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Roselli is an enjoyable item of the film - commenting on the film. How much do they appreciate or praise an extraordinary approach to tell this story. I can not recommend this movie.
