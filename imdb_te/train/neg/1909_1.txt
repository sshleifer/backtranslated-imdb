One of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen (not the worst films). The boy (who works like a phone mentally!) Must pretend homosexual to move into the apartment with his dream woman. Happiness does not happen. Boredom, light gay-bashing, and terrible conversation. If you're reading Brad Meltzer and his bad speech, you'll love this movie. <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. If you see it, destroy a copy.
