<br /> I've seen all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid that something is missing. The role of the Mona has little or no personality without having to live a life for anybody, living for anyone, and no one can contribute to life. She is not interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> "They can not be anywhere near me, steal something that never hangs down and make friends with her friends" She's really troubled - because she has nothing to do with junkies, vinos and booms are troublesome; <br /> <br /> I would not like to watch a movie about them. The otherwise superior art assuming the people assuming anything that I made of all the reviews made by a French female director.
