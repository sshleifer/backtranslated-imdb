This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay in its chair that attracted this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, where both the filmmaker and the actor. The storyline is very simple: after ten years of divorced and Hollywood non-career, the author plays the quest for love before the camera. The first question is how true is this: what is written, what happened? Two answers, "Yes" or "No" M. Burkovitz is portrayed as a low average human beeing. <br /> <br /> If you look for a self-imagination about love next to me, I would recommend you to read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> On this side, I hear I was very disappointed with my country, France. I mean Americans usually have the pride of the French they (then true), etc., and certainly the French (and the whole world) have lots of mourning against America, but why so much hate? But do not think that I will not like this movie anyway.
