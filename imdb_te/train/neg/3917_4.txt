"House of spirits" is very awful. In a country where I live in South America, it suffers from a military dictator that attempts to portray the film, and if the films that are known to all are far from reality, this particular film is viewed by the audience as innocent and stupid. Things are not so simple and straightforward to be found here, and the political process is very complex and interesting in the "house ..." plot. If you do not show the complexity on the screen, it's not good to improve the movie. There are many examples of how the film can be made in politics with most common places. In some areas I thought I would be seen in carmen Miranda parrots and palm trees. Be careful of your public's intelligence when you talk about some things but be respected.
