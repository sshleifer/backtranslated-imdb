<br /> <br /> The film is based on a young teacher in a Catholic school in which the RAWANDAN JONESIDE un-furs around him is seen. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a brief description of past history and rival. Rawanda. It then jumps to the story as told by the story of the young protagonist "New-commer". This is not a young teacher, life or situation. He and the driver mechanism blocked a road to his drivers I.D. If this is a serious moment, they will be killed if the drivers do not recognize the correct race. That's how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolds around him. Suddenly, every Ravan is involved (including his driver) and suddenly finds that European soldiers and tourists can not help. Media cameras can not stop Machete's, and most Macket is a lot of armored armed men-men. When the army comes from captain of the captain he is going to shoot dogs eating dead bodies around his compound, but can not shoot militia men who killed people around the compound. Mainly because they are still fired at soldiers. Finally he tells the evacuation team that the frustration of the situation and the passing team he wants to give up his seat to one of the intended victims, rather than the school kids immanent death rather than the face of immanent death It is a study of the alphabet than the story, and Jesus is coming for a moment. The film did not take place in RAWANDA, and at any time there were giantsidell hell around the world.
