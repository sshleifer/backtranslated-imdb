<br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" will sit at home, a misleading and desperate comedy. TV look like heaven is a chris rock standup-comedy watch sofa. The film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Weight". This is a good movie, and it's good - to demonstrate how a stirring screenwriters team make good things. Directors Chris and Paul Wheatz lose almost every target. From concept to storytelling, "down to earth" has failed miserably; This is a very bad product. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a lousy standup comedian in his role in this movie and in real life. Lance Barton, whose manager, (Frankie Fasson) feels sorry for him when he booed off the stage during the amateur night at the local theater. As the script lacks its skill, the character is killed with a speedy trick. Death by Eugene Levi, made his mistake by taking the previous Lance. God's assistant (Chaz Panteraire) was very angry and Lance left him until the rest of his earth was taken to the White Millennium, only 60 years old. <br /> The elderly name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) had his affair with his assistant (Greg German), who stole his money. Within a Wellington, Lance, a young black woman named Sons (Regina King) fell in love with a young black woman because Wellington had a plot to kill, Lance tries to get a better body, and Sonite's tumultuous feelings <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" It has some good ideas, but they take part in a contradictory and unreliable love story. The biggest problem that we've been running is how we realized Mr. Wellington Lawns. Chris Rock is an actor with popularity and promotion, which is why he does not attend much of the film; All of the characters look like new Lance Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It is suitable for love story; We believe that we will fall for a young lady, but in fact, he is actually an old, gray-haired geezer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But the characters laugh when they come into conflict without their knowledge. Just look "there is something about Mary." The characters in funny scenes reveal the awkward experiences, and not at their discretion. Here, Lance knows he is in the body of an old man, and things are not common in older men. <br /> <br /> Another issue with this concept: We never recognize Mr. Wellington for the first time, so when we do not know how the body looks like what he was originally doing. Most of all, Chris Rock should be concentrated here, and the character makes the rock a lot higher. He reads regular stand-up routine jokes that are tedious and painful; His speech is very clear, wooden and straightforward. I hate the sense of humor. There are many unhealthy jokes and terrible comic situations. Chris Rock in the film is like watching Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> <br /> Let us press the positives in "down to earth". Marc Addy is no worse here than he has done "Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas." Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmateri are well-known actors, but they are at the mercy of a shortened script. All the good features I mentioned at this time, and if you give me another week to remember me, I will come to nothing.
