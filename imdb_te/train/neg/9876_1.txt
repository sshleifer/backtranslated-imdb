I went unnoticed about this film and knowing everything about it, I walked out in half an hour. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm usually a nice person but if someone told me they liked this movie, I probably never talked to them again. Anyone who likes it will have a very dry, monastic type of personality. I'm also gonna have been thinking they are pretty pretty intelligent, just like self-centered fart bags that make voices for the movie. I know that everyone has a variety of humor, some may not like mine, but it's OK; I do not think this applies to any range of humor. The film is flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Be ready to go and walk; It's best to get your money back.
