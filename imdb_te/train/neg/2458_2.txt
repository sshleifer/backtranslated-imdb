I can not tell you how terrible it is. Did I find the only person who found it hated? Rohan Men see 100% duplicate with their poorly colored hair, which does not even match what the actors look like. Orcs looked terrible. Why should Gandhipe walk with bad limp? Why do they say things correctly? Sarman Aruman is not. The terrible accent of the Tolkiens characters * are alarmed as SP *. Pulling the plug from the sequel to the studio made by all and all this fun, it's just a terrible terrible adaptaion. Watch the hobbit cartoon for a good cartoon of Tolkins work. Hell, ROTK's cartoon version is good after this dribbling. 2/10
