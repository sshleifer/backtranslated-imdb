I initially had low expectations for this film, but failed to meet that point. There are some funny episodes, laugh out one or two loud episodes, this film fell terribly short what I call good. The ludicrous jokes are unexpected and very quick, where are we sitting "WTF just happened?" In addition, there are some jokes and just dragged on and on. When he fell on the hill I fell a little. Also, editing is not really. There are poor visual transitions, but these days it's style. It made me smile, but I can not see again, and I'm very happy to wait for rent. Give it a chance, you can enjoy it, but you do not think it's for the 40-year-old maiden, or anything like the Superbad.
