Since some amateur directors may not read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free of charge) from the viewer's perspective. If you want to make an extreme exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to be a lover of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. Do not try to do it at the same time, it will not work. For example, you know that a goofy kills the "humorous relief" character, cut down, shaking a tree and throwing a coconut on a coconut head, you want to make any image. This is a boring, shaky, cheap, racist .... you get the picture. Smart moments Couple and Kathy Shower (here are the most prissy way) Nakedness Some sneak peeks are rarely worth your attention. Everyone forgot about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
