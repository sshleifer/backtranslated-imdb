The gap and the opacity of the classic novel. I want people to stop messing about with the classics when I'm not really clear of the original motive or point of view. This version is no different. I thought Ralf Finns reform was very bad, and Juliet Briochee's casting as Katie seemed to be the worst cast decision ... anyway back to this version. It is intended to create a story about a contemporary setting and a musical style. It is a non-successful art in both. Towards the view for a rainy day ... Perhaps the mean and editing in the direction is stable. Even worse than the old quincy. Deepak Verma turned out to be like a Hindu, and in fact one in Britain wastes talent. The part of Heath played with great charm and belief and the cast of this project was the most powerful thing. Even though a more skilled director is able to use his facilities well. He clearly stated that he was the director of the rent and the project did not make the hobby fit.
