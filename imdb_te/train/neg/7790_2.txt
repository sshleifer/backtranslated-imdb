Like other folks reviewing this film, I'm also using nostalgic about it ... before I'm unfortunate to see it again. But my childhood memories of the film are totally infidel and Pauline's Peres now seems to be an awkward exercise in simpler, racist and simplified boring imagery. Old Pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas's presence also have a ranch screenplay, a terrible theme song and some wretched 'special effects'. Moreover, the stereotypical implications of African and Arab characters are caused by a traumatic view, most notably in the immediate aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports, The Pails of Pauline was originally produced for television, but unpredictable in theaters. Judging from the results, it is completely reliable (and blocking) scenes.
