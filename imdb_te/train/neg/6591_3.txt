<br /> This is not because they do not list the basic shortcomings of the film, they are clear without telling. Small things, such as "Laurel and Hardy All New Adventures of", have occurred for more than thirty years. Such small things. <br /> <br /> It is a bad idea to have the gray playing stars known as Laurel and Hardy. That's bad, it might have worked. For a really bad idea, two actors are acting to betray the duo. Well, they say neenas, but this is the final result. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Branson may be funny picot. Well, he forgot his absurd alien "cousin lorry" stick in the Perfect Strangers, and see him in True Romance. Here, however, he stinks. It's probably not his fault, the director and the supporting cast - all those who are better than things - he's probably upset about money. They say that it is difficult for Americans to learn effective English accent. The reason for this is not allowed here by picot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? In Stan's trademark he is only overly close to the point of tedium not to come home, but yelp is nothing to write home. Ally like Gaylord Sartain is a bit better, but worse - in a dog duck or a kick in the nicker? <br /> Do you remember their split-second timing, natural teamwork and the originality of the underlying love? Totally mistaken, two stupid old men and jokes replaced so you could park a bus through spaces mistimed. <br /> <br /> I have not been able to tell each of Laurel and Hardy's 108 films, but this is their safe bet, even though they have plot to use the original plates in two plates, and this is a mixed human being (and a secular title!) Nayar picked up the leagues. <br /> <br /> The main problem is the fact that they are playing themselves or using their own voices And I think it's natural and weak against the characters that were framed against Pinchot and Sartain.When did Stan make mischief and there were so many people before? "I'm sleeping" "I want to marinate my friend." Stop it! br> Share the moment with Bojo the Clown, Larry Harmon's L & H comic .Developed related to the cartoon character. Of course the name of the hormone copyright (see Laurel and Hardy then analyzing how Â®) and co-director and producer, who was the director. <br /> There are plenty of questions. Stan and Olly survive today, are they alive today? Will they make glass mummies with broken bottles? Have a bigger CGI-end with a knife and a stroke of Stan civilizations? <br /> <br /> I laugh at once, but I think it's disloyal about how scary it is. Why did the film take place in the first place? Who did the makers want to think? The worst thing I've ever seen is a perfect impatience, the first five minutes after I grew sick. The red-hot poker and rushing nettles are forced into your back and your head is mocked in a cataclysm.
