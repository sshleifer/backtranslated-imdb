<br /> This is not true. <br /> It certainly does not mean anything, no plot, no characters, no acting, nothing. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it when I was 28 when I was 28, ** It's a spoiler warning. It complains of how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> Okay, the film begins and characters are introduced, but the character does not describe it. The main role I know is that this school is new, but not clear. Even he appeared to have lived himself ... then he was a pet kid ... then his mother was still a feared alcoholic who lived with him. <br /> <br /> Now we are coming to a main storytelling room, this frantic man walks out of the mad shelter. Now our main character is engaged with this guy and keeps watching the movie's sudden perspective. I think I've lost a major theme here, there's no reason to be hooked to the main character. <br /> Why do all his friends who are suspicious before 5 minutes before him suddenly follow him and need to do what he wants. <br /> <br /> This film continues, but it's okay. They are running blav blah blah blogging on school. But wait a minute ... Suddenly everyone knows that the main character is 'show'. Wait for the second, do not you tell the main character without a frenzy guy? <br /> <br /> Another important storyline is lifted ... the madman should not be mad ... everyone says he is not mad. But as the story progresses, he is very clear in his mind. <br /> <br /> Now this movie is closed. Is it close? What is hell? There is no answer to any questions about the ultimate only the main character, it does not answer any questions about the mad person. In the same situation these people? If yes, then there are some very basic story lines that do not include this. <br /> <br /> What do you mean by "two weeks?" <br /> * End of the end * I'm still pretty much what I want to do now. It is 6 months down the line, and if I can get it for free, I might give another chance, but I doubt it. I am very doubtful.
