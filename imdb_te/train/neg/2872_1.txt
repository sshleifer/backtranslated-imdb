This is the worst horror / thriller I've ever seen in my 29 years. Say NO if someone gives you freely. This movie makes you dumber person to see it. The plot is not the worst part of the film ... its acting, camera work, lighting, and sound. Nothing about this film. Whoever has earned this film has now broken up. I hope the director has never got a green light for another film. In its defense, the film was quickly made to invest in the actual BTK killer's extraction, but I saw the film that looked like Oscar winners compared to these films.
