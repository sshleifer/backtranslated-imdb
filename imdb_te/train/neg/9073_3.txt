This movie seemed good but it is very bad. The premise is O.K, but the plot is also terrible. Actors tried their best with a limited amount of content, but they were not able to increase the average enthusiasm for this frivolous college movie. Jason Schwartzman once again has a tremendous frustration - much more than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast is not very inclusive. The fun scenes are off-putting and too young. Road Trip / American tries over but fails at all levels. All the time all the waste.
