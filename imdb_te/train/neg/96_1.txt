Oh wait, I am! Unless you want to brush your distinctive film definitions like "Continuity Amendment" and "Geography Match", the film is not for a snap to the typical. I can not say where I am in this film. They are wearing a modern second SUV in their next 70 minutes, where they are present and wearing what's found in the style of 80's. I think. I was unable to care enough when acting was just terrible. I think I only got attention because I have a 3D which I did not see. If you're a B-movie buff and B-movie means I'm a bad movie, then this picture is for you. You'll be laughing as long as you're home-movie and all unhealthy. If your interests are high for Goddard and Antoniones, it will only skip one.
