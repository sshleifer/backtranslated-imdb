OK .. This movie may be very good! All generations reveal the Thunder birds and love it and this film has some features to look for in the movie The Good thunderbirds. We transferred themselves and Tracey Island to a really big screen, while we are committed to the designs we fell in love with. Sofia Miles, just amazing, Lady P and Bill Paxton, was solid enough when I was not sure that Jeff Tracy was being ... but the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe that the 8-year-old will fly 200 ton machines. <br /> <br /> In this film, Jonathan Frocks hit me with a wet fish and centered around my favorite children when I spent my spending time in the film Alan Tracy is very bad in the film and actually he seems to have flown the machines as well as his brothers ... at least 19/20 . <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to be intense or fearful. It was frustrating and tried to pay tribute while it usually fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 machines, 1 for Lady P)
