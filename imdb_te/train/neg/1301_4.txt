Recently I saw this in 2009 Palm Springs International Film. The feature length of the famous dancer Monique Van de Way was directed by her, and based on my observation was her last. I hate movies that you do not expect to take each scene apart from practically. This film will soon leave you scratching your head. It is a young photographer and a girlfriend working for an international auxiliary company that has a conversation about their love of love, because their girlfriend has a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains, and a rocket disables them as a truck. They get out of their vehicle to see Taliban fighters who run all five people with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts to take all these pictures when he hits one of the rebels who hand them a hand grenade labs that kills his girlfriend. They should not be more than 50 yards away, because he is at a distance from the hand, he will somehow be away. His girlfriend has flown and takes a picture of the moment of the grenade effect he killed and wins the prize as a photographer for the photo. Each scene and scenario in the film has been opened to funniest. The following year he has been recognized for the National Geographic at the Dutch Resort Island where he met Bob Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and penetrates into the international drug trafficking victims. Avoid this picture. I give 10 to 4.0.
