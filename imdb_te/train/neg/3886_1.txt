Is not it a stupid image? You bet! I can not find any moment in the film that is fuzzy or scary. Stupid moments? Plenty. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker has gone and has done bigger and better things, not one of them. Oh well people should start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheesed. He's a very whiny doctor I've ever seen. He got a melodic man running somewhere in Ventura County, where he has no crackers that his wife is pregnant (maybe she is 55 years old and is responsible for 90 lbs) is not very happy and can be found anywhere. Plus he got very helpful simple on his interception he wants to find astronaut Steve. And local sheriff Mr. Nelson wants to know what's going on though he can not say anything. Some random letters are also thrown in for a good measure to face a soluble person. Eventually the movie ends and the monster makes it even worse for composting. And finally there is just what you need for a great MST episode.
