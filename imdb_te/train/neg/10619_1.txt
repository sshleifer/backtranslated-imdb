... but a lousy movie. This is an attempt to make Christopher Lee's intense horror film as Malin has said. Well, it is serious ... very serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about the little kids to achieve immortality about older kids) ... The film is Talk Talk Talk to Talk Talk Talk Talk over and over again. I really dozed off a few times! This movie is very sensitive! This cast was slipping with Peter Cushing and Lee's unique exceptions ... but both were lovingly (they often complained that horror films were too violent ... it was not any violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this keeps you sleeping!
