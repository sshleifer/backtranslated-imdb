This was a mistake with the film, but to compile it: horrible acting - so bad. Poor script - They may have some good ideas but this is not the best way to provide the story. The ridiculous bad end - in some cases the film will save the film to save it. You will want to kick yourself at the end because it is not worth waiting at the end if you sit and manage through the full image. It's the worst picture I've seen in a long time. The film was totally tortured and I congratulated the person who warned me earlier. Make yourself a favor. Watch this movie if you do not do anything perfectly. Even then you will be sorry to put yourself through violence that you can not say.
