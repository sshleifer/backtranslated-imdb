The Bang House of Dolls (1973, 1974 or 1977, given for many years for this title) is a Hong Kong veteran of Chinh Hung Kui (killer snakes, boxer's omen, blood in payment etc.). Yes, they took these less predatory illnesses into their own hands, and even when compared with the lighter western attempts compared to the eastern paintings, bamboo is definitely one of the worst efforts of the whole genre! <br /> <p> The story is about a Japan war camp, in which Chinese women misuse Japanese during World War II and abuse the Japanese. The girls also find the gold box full of gold and even a Chinese military officer who grew up in Japan (Shah Extraordinary Lo Lieh) is now a secret agent among other Japanese and naturally girls girls hell. The bottom part is what makes the pure and honest garbage nudity, feminine kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and a very dangerous anti-Japan scenario that does not go much further. <br /> <br /> The Bamboo House of Dolls has no interesting aspects. Occasionally photography is particularly good at the end with its sunshine and beautiful nature, but it's a great deal about it. There are plenty of fighting sequences, and half the naked women are hitting and kicking one another. Several bullet injuries, unfortunately torture scenes (for example, a poor girl is oppressed in a broken glass) and behind it is extremely violent and morally too violent. <br /> <br /> If I'm stupid to talk about this kind of film and talk about "moral", I do not agree with any movie. </ P> <p> Turkey stuff for sure! For example, a huge gold-plated golden box appears to be suspiciously flattered by girls who are weak and suffering, and it does not seem to be lifted and it does not seem to move, it is not to be thrown out! Even many "skin fight scenes" make this very smile that stimulates the worst movie fans. I saw the same director's killer snakes (1973), which is ten times more noticeable than a piece and it is also very interesting, though it is a very deadly snake that has actually been killed and is a big city and society on our other side. <br /> <br /> It is necessary for those who are afraid of snakes. <br /> <br /> The Damala Bamboo House has encountered some censorships and it is not surprising. The unpublished version of Europe, released in France, Italy and Switzerland, runs at 104 PAL minutes, while English dubbing printed in Holland, Belgium and Greece runs only 84 minutes on print PAL. From what I heard, cut scenes are not just violence or other graphic stuff, like dialogue and "plot development" and so forth. <br /> <br /> The Bamboo House of Dolls is the worst movie in its worst form and is definitely something I did not like to see from Shawn Brothers or Hong Kong. Some of the Italian exploitative paintings of the same thing are very interesting and noteworthy, which is very ridiculous, counting and exploiting the images. 2/10
