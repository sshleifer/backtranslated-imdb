Hey look, to deal with it, there are very good pictures of black America's hardship than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism focuses on the poor performance of the story. <br /> <br /> It was created during the 80s and the music / score section. It's funny to see Oprah in the next day as a cracker. <br /> <br /> The Bigger Elizabeth McGuern is brought to the scene. Pure classic movie. First of all, how much did I drink, you react to 1200F degree flames (no matter how bad your acting is). But they really shared that scene ... it's funny. I have great satisfaction for seeing Elizabeth Macquarun burning in Fox's death. She makes me angry.
