Although Robert "Knox" had Benfar's fans, I was not one of them. His films are asynchronous and enthusiastic, and not just too funny, except for the 14 years you are developing a sense of humor. <br /> You do not want to believe that he is undoubtedly fans, teasing people in Wikipedia or casting votes at IMDb. <br /> He is not explicitly informed of any large media outlets that speak volumes about "fame" of his and his creation. <br /> <br /> Bener has little expertise in the limited animation, but he will learn to write some real funny things before he or she is considered serious as a sequo-fo and realistic entertainment artist. By this moment, he is just a boy with a camera, and it shows.
