Slackers is just another teen movie that is not really worth watching. Dave (Devon Savage), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Myona) graduated with honors from Holden University graduating and implementing the scheme. These three colleagues are proudly confused by the last four years of college, and these rare men are rarely frustrated at campus schools during the final exams. But why do you think the plot is too stupid and you have to close the brain for a while? Slackers just imaginable teen movie does not really add nothing new to the genre. The comedy in the slackers is not hit or miss but the movie is a real true funny or original moment. It's actually just a collection of gags and very pretty funny. At least eight more people do not work each joke. The screenplay is filled with penis and breast jokes that some will enjoy high school and college students. Even if they do not recall the film, this movie is not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays the weird Ethan, and he has a very low profile after starring in some good comedy films. Jaime King and Devan SAA are other main actors but they do a lot of work in the film. It is directed by Dewey Nix and this is his first movie, so you can not blame him too much. Although the funniest character is probably Lara Preston, she is not in the movie too. However, the film is only 86 minutes long and some people who are not really interested in this type of comedy may be too long. Slackers is not the worst film of 2002 but it's definitely below average. Compared to other movies in the genre, there is a dance version of the movie, American Pie and its sequels, Scary Movie 1 & 2. Then the slackers may be in line with that bill, but if you look at something that's fine. Average Teen Comedy below is worth rating 4.3 / 10.
