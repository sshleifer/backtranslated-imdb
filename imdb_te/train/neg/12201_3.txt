The essence is pretty much present. It's not as close as it is. Stalin and James Cameron both collaborated with a script (at the same time he was writing Aliens). Stalin wrote many of Cameron's works and political themes. <br /> <br /> In Rambo and Rocky 4 he is in a better position and he looks or jokes in great form <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in jail and visits Colonel Truman, who asks to take part in a special event, It can take him presidential apology. He finally admits and Charles goes to the briefing camp organized by the Washington suit seeking to leave himself as former ex-forces to calm Napier Rambo. <br /> <br /> This mission does not have any pieces in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was selected as a camping inspector, who had previously been a prisoner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The prisoners are still rescued. The ship sailing on the river shore of the Vietnamese army of about 3 ships, but Rambo is killing them and their boat is bombed with Rambo and they take a picnic on the pad. <br /> <br /> Rambo was again deceived and he was abandoned because Napier had ordered to recall the rescue helicopter. <br /> <br /> Steven Bergoff is a Russian Spetsnot Colonel, Rambo is tortured and ultimately escapes while escaping the Vietnamese forces and Spetznatz. Rambo finally stolen a chopper and saves many of the prisoners back to his base. <br /> <br /> He is angry to leave Napier and destroy the center of the center. <br /> Like the Rambo, the weakest plots and very weak endless man goes into the sunset.
