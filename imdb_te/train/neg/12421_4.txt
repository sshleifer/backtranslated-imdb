Marc Pirrow's "Death Throttle" of 1987 is a black comedy in many areas, but occasionally a lot of fun. This film is certainly quite good, acting is terrible, and some very cheesy scenes are difficult to see over time, but the feeling is funny, and some lively moments. <br /> In the near future (year 1991), game appearances have been changed. Chuck Tideon (John McCafferty) performs a game show called "Live or Die", in which the death penalty is likely to play for their lives, and for money. Failing candidates, using a variety of methods such as using gilatines, electric chairs and other overheating techniques, can be implemented in the air, and later praised by a vibrant studio audience. <br /> <br /> "Deaththrough Gamesshow" is very cheesy and aggressive in many dimensions, and acting is terrible, but it is fun in many areas, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. If you do not see anything you missed anything, but it's definitely funny and good time lazy. 4/10
