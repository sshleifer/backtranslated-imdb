Seriously, I thought it was very serious, and I started watching the show first, and I thought it was good. But the plot got worse. The storyline is very boring or predictable. George is not always funny, he sometimes stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. Silly character of his mother's performance. How can a mother treat her own son, ok if it's lawful daughter, but this is her own son. I give this show a 4/10 because the first shows are a little funny. Actors Constance Mary and Masiela Lusha perform great work. It is not known how long these programs are playing. <br /> If you're really frustrated, I'm not sure if I can not see it or else you should look at it.
