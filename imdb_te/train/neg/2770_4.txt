Hollywood hotel Busby Berkeley is the last film to direct Warner Bros. His directing style has been changed or changed, his signature overhead shots or thousands of extra production. For the last few years of thirty years, swing-style big bands record popular hits throughout the year. The Swing Era, also known as The Big Band Era, dates from 1935 to 1944, or dates from 1939 to 1949. Benny Goodman's engagement to the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles is one of the earliest references to the mainstream American youth in the Summer of Summer in the summer of 1935, although the moment Swing Era was not exactly perfect. When Goodman performed his swing concert instead of community-style dance music playing by his band, young people in the audience were in the forest. It was the beginning, but, radio, live concerts, and mouthpieces were the primary means of spreading this phenomenon, which took some time to produce enough motion to produce huge hits that appear in the pop charts. In the Hollywood hotel, Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Peugey and his orchestral film indicate that the film industry is ready to change the musical flavor (after a film and a half goodman's palmor ball room engagement). There are some interesting musical movements here and there in the Hollywood Hotel, but Benny Goodman and his orchestra's "Singh, Singh, Sing" do not need to be excluded. Otherwise, the "Hollywood for Hollywood" parade, which started with the most interesting musical sequences, and "Let That Be A Lesson to You", is in production drive-in restaurant. The film is very interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his orchestra play and Dick Powell and Francis Langford songs.
