I loved it when I first saw this movie 11 years ago. I still direct and cinematography is good, as well as music. But there really is the script that has the time it started to bother me more. I have found the self-absorbed and betrayal of the original book by Emma Thompson; She is very old, most challenging to Elinor - in her film 'vision moments' are given in many ways, and often they are Thompson. <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I love Katie Winslet and I do not give her the best script in the world to work, but she is still very unhappy, Alan Rekha Man is perhaps a bit older, but it plays beautifully. And Elizabeth sprrigs, she is absolutely terrific as always.
