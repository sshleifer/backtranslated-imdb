<br /> <br /> Exodhos Part 2 and other important parts are one of the best ones on TV, not in the series. <br /> I'm not sure if it's a disappointing episode, but with a closed sequence cheesy guitar music is ridiculous and was at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> Its nearly corporate executives close the lower-key note and close it to the jazz if it wanted to. <br /> It's not a trend in the future. <br /> <br /> Even though some people are surprised, they will be trimmed.
