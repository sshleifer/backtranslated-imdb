The film is a bit tedious. It is mostly a silent film, and a huge amount of voice voice is provided by the story. It's not a bad idea when making a silent film like this, it's one of those movies that lack of dialogue and repetitive opening scenes make it just tedious. You can not easily understand the picture, but it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is a slower piece of Mexican soft romance, and there is something unpredictable soft romantic. The next 40 minute style starts with the movie, but it is too late, then the audience will lose. There is some good location shooting at the Mexico National Autonomous University. I often think that why most movies are not shot there. The Campus Campus is built on the edge of the lava fields that provide a much more global feeling. My big problem with this film is that if the director / writer does not know the movie, he wants to see how it does not know the story. You can not ignore audiences when you tell the story.
