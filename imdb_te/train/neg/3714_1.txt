The film is a remake of the 1978 Warren Beatty film "Heaven Ken Wait", but it was written for Mr. Rock's stand-up comedy style. The campus is identical: Lance Barton, (Rock) spends his life time and agrees with God's representative, Mr. King to return to another. Beat in the movie; Charles Wellington, who killed him, chooses a great white man because he is a fan of Sonatie Jenkins (Regina King) who are not in Wellington's home at the time of his murder. Sony can not work with Ms. Wellington and her sweetheart role in the thought of changing this reconstruction and a big-age multi-millionaire black comedian. Intercasts used to show rock as Wellington and the real 'White' Wellington have also failed miserably. The original Beatty Plate has been enhanced - it did not carry the idea of ​​posthumous death - but they were certainly not found in "down to earth".
