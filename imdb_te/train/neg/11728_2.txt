In the past many have enjoyed Wesley Snipes in action dreams and I have been playing "bad" scenes with some bad acting "strong" feelings, even though the film failed entertainment and even though the story is thin and unrealistic, since the very 5.8 IMDb score, the acting goes unnoticedly thin and mimicking ... This film is not your amusing amusing, tears of your tears, <br /> <br /> Enu give this 2/10, it was really terrible, you want to see a good movie to see or rent the shooter, its all good things, not the image.
