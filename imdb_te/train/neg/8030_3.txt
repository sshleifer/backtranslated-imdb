This is not really very interested. The story is pretty horrible and incredible. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes. Then it's pretty terrible. Not fit for the role of Tim, he appears as a self-confident self-inflicted ass, and Feuert Taylor Vince is a painful player. It's a bit sad after seeing it as an idealist film and a musician. He did not work with his fellow band mates in any of the scenes in 1900, he was completely self-reliant. I do not think it's difficult to build a relationship with this kind of character, perhaps I'm seeing a wrong movie. If you do not have any feelings about life or all the music, then you will be happy to be banned and will see this hook.
