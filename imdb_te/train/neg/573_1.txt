The final reviewer was very generous. I am silent like the first movie, but I can not quite say I enjoy this one. It is initially bearable, but it goes downhill very quickly. I can not see Jon Bon Jovi as the "bad-ass vampire hunter" and the bloodthirsty princess is not sexy or scary. Most of the scenes just do not make sense. Even if a strange woman suddenly finds you somewhere not funny, any ordinary person suspects something that is only an experienced hunter. Why can Jovi communicate with Una? No one has explained in this movie, would it be fun? This should be one of the worst bloodthirsty pictures I've ever seen.
