I thought "intensive care" was very bad and unexpectedly funny. But at least not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> Spiral deer today <br /> <br /> Fun ridiculous moments. But the classic moment of all the time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) killer stabbed and beaten. He groan in the corner of the hall. Amy (Nada van Nai) knees beside him and "poor Peter, can I help you get the band?" Asks. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed in Dutch and English. To reduce costs, all license plates are Skyland's backdrop of Manhattan in the USA and US News Studios. Very hilarious if you look at the original version in Dutch and Dutch.
