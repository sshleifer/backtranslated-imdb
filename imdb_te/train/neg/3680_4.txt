I remember one morning in the morning of 18/6/02. I tried to persuade him to come out of bed when I heard a terrible eruption. I went to a kitchen with many neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem and saw a staircase from a distant place, a smoke scene took about a minute later by sirens wiring. I remember taking my binoculars and going back to the kitchen and looking at the picture of a shuttle bus and running to my bedroom. The bus station was near the station and attacked the terrorist and killed 25 passengers in one click on the TNT device, many of whom went to school. <br /> <br /> My wife's wife, sitting on the bus in the back row with a seemingly unilateral and meaningless decision to save her life. <br /> Every Israeli has at least one terror-related memoir that he never desires and only a short time before it takes a picture. As it turned out, the film became its repressed memory. <br /> <br /> The film was written about writing a dry run, written and directed by Hamm Buzg (Humm, Haymum Buzg, who had a good part of his day competing with his workshop processor page). At this time, a girl journalist decides to make a piece of the former boss of the borrower to his girlfriend, the Israeli trade channel. <br /> <br /> In Bujgo, boredom and a bit paranoid clinically call this "hot dog on earth" syndrome, asking a private eye to maintain a money on his girlfriend. <br /> When the detective was proceeding in his investigation, his study was dramatically expanded after drama in the lives of dramas. At this time, the game metamorphosis from comic drama has become an indictment against the variation of the Israeli society. For the film, well, the film becomes an exercise in the larger editing, dealing with its small cardboard characters and reliable dialogues to deal in the first place from the drifting point for miles away. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard characters", there is no role in genuine dialogues and credibility in the siege of the author / director for "meaningful" film. I did not say much about it. I'm going to the theater with the homeless barefoot hooker rarely. <br /> The first part of the current agenda trilogy according to Hemm Bujug. I hope the other two films emerged from experiences like I wrote about at the start of my review against anything but the solitary world of characters that are anything but a plot that exists but anything but compelling. /> <br /> 10 out of 4 in my FilmOmeter <br /> <br /> PS This is a milestone in the film Hardness. It was filmed in ten days, all the cast was free and the total cost was $ 12,000 (no, I did not exclude zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You wonder why it took 34,000 dollars to complete the Blair witch project.
