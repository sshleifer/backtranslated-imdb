The most ridiculous thing about this funniest movie is that if he is a saint, he or she and his family and his or her other important life will live forever. To be a saint, be holy, and saints are not important. That is, for a millennium, Jolly Elf of Nick Fred's Scrooge never been suggested! Open up how you learn how to make toys, then learn how to run Fred and Numbers; Nick is giving a Dolly a sick child, along with Fred Dolly repossessing, family farm! After some such episodes, Fred, who killed his Freud in the Siblings anonymously, persuaded his fellow losers. <br /> <br /> I wrote a more cohesive storyline than this confusion. <br /> <br /> From this huge permanent heart, this "Santa, Easter, Bunny" is a Harpice queen who gave his pink egg, an operation straight from Mega-Mall Hell, and answers to the board ("Ho, Ho, Ho, huh?). Oh, and his right hand man is an unfortunate blonde in the mini-dress and go-go boots that tighten the skin. Hi ... hi ... hi ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> Really sent me to the edge, I was named # 1 in Slam Notti's list. Is not a NATI list reserved for future Hitler and Stalin's? Children with the true aspirations of evil? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fred Claus Behind the Nimrods in their own pudding! Bah!
