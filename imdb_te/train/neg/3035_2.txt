<br /> <br /> Okay, I'm whiter and I do not have the practical experience of "step-dancing compete in the world", this kind of film is exactly the power. <br /> <br /> Previously, I know bad movie when I'm watching. <br /> I saw the boy. <br /> <br /> The low budget-vision ("A Touch of Pink"), directed by "How Shi Move", tells the story of how important it is to follow a dream - those dreams are loud and boring hip-hop music and The spoken conversation is that the average person does not understand if he or she has an international translator. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to give a small compilation of "plot". The first is the two actors who look like LL Cool J who work in an auto shop in Toronto (Mecca of ethnic diversity), but still have time to dance for eight hours. <br /> <br /> "Toll White Dude" and "Malcolm X", which looks like Denzel Washington in "Tokyo", have two women - Serena Williams and the older "Flip Wilson Show" as Geraldine is. One of these women was dismissed from a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on the drug-addict sister. <br /> <br /> Hullie Bear is another actor who is knock-off, another man who looks like Eddie Murphy's bookworm. These guys are step-by-step dancers. <br /> <br /> They are everywhere for the big "Dasha monster" jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> The 90 percent of the dialogue I use is probably a music video by Bergman film or snow), Serena Williams's girl (never smiles), becomes a freelance stepper (clustered from the crowd) Dancing and hip-hop music is very frustrating. <br /> <br /> This is a wealthy story from a simple wand; "Ruddy" with a really bad soundtrack, like "Rocky", "Ruddy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without laughing. <br /> <br /> The film that can have a big impact on black audience - why does this film make? - A title that sounds like a drug addiction, bad parents and first-grader. <br /> I'm "moved" by this movie. Whenever the theater went away as soon as possible.
