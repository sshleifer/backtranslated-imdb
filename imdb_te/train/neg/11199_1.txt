The tedious speed of the film will mimic any obstacles to us. No original suspense. Many characters are unclear. Chest Irish priest was as lazy as the love interest. The interest is misleading. They can be good for the girl who chooses to provide the romance of the film. The main character's central controversy is unexpected. This film is completely untrue. It did not want to go to the gym on that day, but it was like a tedious exercise.
