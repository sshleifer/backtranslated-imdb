Never a Pix, never, ever right? This movie is seen in Letterbox format on TV. Since there is no confidence in the A-Pix pan and scan, see the entire scenes with the shoulder on the right side of the shoulder on the left of the screen. Of course, you do not have much. This image is very bad. Characters are screaming in their lungs at 80% of the film without any reason.
