Poor Robert Englund spends another and spends Tobey Hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but this one makes a pretty bad effort. England suffered pain in pain in the 17th century and the pain that caused pain on him and others also had the pleasure of having pain. This story was a bit confusing with a flip flop from one century to another and I was confused what was going on and what was the purpose of this film. A young woman I've seen has become entrapped by herself a strange stranger who refuses to keep herself and the young lady is attracted to this Arab with alot of money and finds out from the steps of England that she has been murdered and then finds another century for another century and tries to kill her because she is madam Mommoselie (written wrong) or d On the wall of the sedus reminiscent of the picture. The film is terrible, I was surprised at Hooper to appoint England in the film and the special effects were particularly fake and laughable about the eyes. England attempts to reverse its once-hitting move from "Nightmare on Elm Saint". By using these needles and needles to put people's eyes out. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
