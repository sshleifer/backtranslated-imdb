With three lines of lines and a mix of them, "Inside Man" is very jumpy and artistic and realistic incomplete attempt. Despite its moments, the film began to look like a fast thriller, quickly slowly crawled, rising in the middle and low and grabbing steam near the last 20 minutes. I give credit to Denzel Washington, who has played a role in full understanding of his humanity and is not a distinct "super detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen has done well with his dual episode "Evil Genius" and "Criminal Principle" (not the same in both). However, each person has personally created a great sub-division. Moreover, when the episodes finally come together and counted, suddenly "hah-h!" Or the summation of everything. It ended with a lot of all the plots-holes, tons of power, ended up with very little, and as I mentioned earlier, no matter where the spike is near the normal level of Lee. I must totally disagree with what is called "professional critics" ... this is not a movie they play.
