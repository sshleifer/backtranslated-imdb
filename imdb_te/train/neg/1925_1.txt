Directed by Ron Howard The 1966 cartoon is lovely, teaching a simple lesson for children with a simple theme. In the film, Howard fills us with unfortunately, manipulating, self-centered Vas Ville. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure he's not his fault; I guess I could imagine a script called a nastyist, so Kerry went to Tom Green and the result was a magic magic. Like Danny DeVito's Penguin at Batney Returns, it is not very visible that Carrie's Grinch drains any degree of comedy dug from his character. In the 1966 cartoon we have a grinch, we can all recognize, curry grinch, we can all see at the same time, sitting in a parked car or toddler in the supermarket to his cane. This Grinch is a complete abandonment of his redemption at any end of humanity, humor, or insight, and film rings. The whole image rings are false: some sly Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt to fail why Grinch was a jerk by digging into his childhood, and why some Whos have that strange lip extension and some of them do not have an undesirable mystery. In contrast to the 1966 cartoon, I see these films filled with movie tiresome, irritating, and conflicting messages. Would you really like to see Slurty Smurfs as Martha May Voivier Aska Christine Barnsky? In addition, Ron Howard cast his lone cousins. Throw batt jokes, fart jokes, sexy jokes and other destiny kariasque low-brow humor, and you get a rational, brilliant idea from the 1966 cartoon from George W. Bush (or it's inspiration book). This big fat down on the turkey is nice.
