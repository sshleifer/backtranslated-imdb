This film is very boring. Naked meat snippets are surrounded in an attempt to engage in skiptes but they are not successful. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is that of Leena Olin - the character, but Day Lewis spends a lot of his lines. <br /> <br /> Caffman is unclear. Bounce inequality between the housing housing / marriage issues and political crises is serious enough. Characteristic attitudes change without explanation. Badly confusing.
