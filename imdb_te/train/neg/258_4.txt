I've always seen the film with Jamie Fox, and I'm betting this is my last one. <br /> <br /> When audiences faced the camera, or when they said, "I'm going to take a shower," I felt that it was not funny why he was funny. The plot is completely imaginable. Bad guy comes after a good guy. A good man is a woman, so the bad man uses her. In between, the authorities screwing up. The final scenes are completely reliable. <br /> <br /> 2 years and millions of dollars are chasing a person, but you can not do your homework to solve the small children's riddle. <br /> There is no great performance, and shooting is done MTV. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. <br /> <br />
