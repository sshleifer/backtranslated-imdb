About Minion ... well, a minion. Satan's servant and his boss get the key to unlock the locked door of his employer. He has a human beings and a man who dies when the body dies. Anyone seizing the berserker will go to anger. Dolph Lundgren, a member of the mysterious order of the Templars, who plays the role of Lukas, is responsible for keeping Kini away from Misnia. The film starts a thousand years ago, a couple of horse goddesses from the Middle East run away from Münya. Then there was nowhere to go underground in New York in 1999, to flash ahead. An archaeologist will be assigned to study / dive where the key is found. After Minion's crucial, the film will be a long time between Minion and Lucas and Archeologists. <br /> <br /> The film is a low-budget B-movie movie. The film is not power, and just along with the trods. You follow the hunt, but you never participated in the story of ideas from previous films (particularly The Terminator Films). The fight scenes with Minion is troublesome, that you never get the sense of how good or how bad this troll is for a warrior. It is a man with a "skillful" army, who struggles with a group of Templars but sucks when it comes to one another. And it is supposed to be around for a long time. The sense of all this logic goes to show that it just throws the stream for comfort. The whole idea of ​​the secret sequence of the Templars, a door to hell, and the key is not well defined. They agree that they exist only. This story is not too powerful for the story, but it is enough to make some bucks. <br /> <br /> Decision: 2 5 stars.
