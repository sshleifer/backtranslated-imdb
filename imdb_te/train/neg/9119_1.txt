I actually saw it in the original release again in this movie theater. It is painful to see Peter Sellers worrying himself. The story is too lame and difficult to follow, and the end is ridiculous. It is sad to see how it fell. I can not say that I'm a big Peter Sellers fan, but I have enjoyed the Pink Panther series so much that I thought he had a strong performance in there. But this film should never be done. From what I read, he produced this film on the advice of people around him. Fine, but it still does not release the studio.
