Some kind of drawn by romantic scenes, this is one of the most amateur and unbelievable bits I've ever seen. Sorted as a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And all those stock characters in that hideous Midwest town? Pretty hard to take part in this one. The lessons learned from it, the intelligent thoughts are just enormous and very ridiculous (but the skin is the one that you can imagine) is nonsense .... With bisexuality, without any hesitation, And with that inappropriate dance, everyone played their stereotypes? Give this a pass, it's a bad, wasted film like a million miles away, hungry children in Africa or money that can cost AIDS .....
