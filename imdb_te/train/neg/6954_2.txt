I saw the second part of yesterday. And I must say, the first one is good. Initially, I realized, in fact it was not a remake but a sequel. I do not like old movies and galactic sequences because the cylans toasters (as stated in this new film) were totally dangerous for the old galactic. The picture turns to the sides - human beings are harmless but the whole movie made me totally confused and stupid. Most scenes are unnecessary, for example the story of "computer experts" - completely rubbish. If I were a written writer, I would die in his home. And move from the planet? Oh, please 50 Megatons (why exactly 50 MT ??) bombed by nukes, they are killed by radiation. And how is it possible that a large army is completely hidden before the confrontation? Aha, it's probably created by this computer virus, Silen - this script is probably written by a ten-year-old schoolboy. The good side of the film, that humans are finally defeated !! The reality is that people are dying - the kids are dying - two times clear in the movie: 1. A baby! Maybe a month old and a girl aged 10 - no violence ...). And the evil-donkeys have won and I feel like the first time in such a science fiction galaxy fight. I can also congratulate the design of the Silans (Man of the Silen :-) is a good job with these ships - I liked the design of the two ships - human cylons. Human ships are the best version ever for the old ones. And Galactica - these pets are really beautiful, I liked that. But all of this, only design is not enough. The acting is very bad, and the whole plot is predictable (both for the two subjects - man cylon the ragnardax and at the end of the human-silen) .The topics are small (and just stupid in Slovak, not the film's fault). This film appeared as a pilot image for a series, but who would shoot such a series? What about that? One star for design is the second to end humanity.
