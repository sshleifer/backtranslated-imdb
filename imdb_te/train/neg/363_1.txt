This film ends with killing its self-consciousness, among other things. Here's a short list: 1. Objectionable behavior. When the Beatles arrived and introduced the brand of "gorgeous, disgusting" behavior / humor, it was freshly received. It happened 4 decades ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> Sleeping glitter. The foundation of the foundation, Quasi-Social-Political Ideas are the hardest to make fun of work. <br /> <br /> 3. Post-modern "I'm strong in this brave world, yes, I recognize that" snake eating - is used as an example of another animal in the film! <br /> <br /> 5. Amazing writing, acting, directing ... Student movies that I have ever seen? One victim, I can say only positively, at least it itself, and the shesh, <br /> But what about it? Rings are empty like any other actors - hey, anytime wooden Allen's Bergma It takes over, ie: "Interiors" Well, it just makes it more enthusiastic.
