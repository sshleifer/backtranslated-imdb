I can not be a critic, but I think about this film here. Well I have just seen the movie on cinemax and first of all I have to say how much I hate the storyline to understand what a snowman scare along with little kids, the other is pretty ghost but the film is very low budget I have probably used ketchup so my critically vote ball !!! Good try and suck twice the sequel.
