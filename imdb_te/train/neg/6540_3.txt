I can not believe that this film is comparable to most Argentine. His work is very imaginative and evil - is very fun. <br /> The director does not just have the ability to increase real tension. Murder scenes - and let's face it, is what to do about this genre - is not that interesting. It's not hard to guess which murderer is, and I really do not care if it's leaked. Cirasmaraniyamainadi cinematography and the gothic atmosphere of the 19th century captivated me. Many of the actors are very good (especially the young students hedmistras and the girl on the awards) /> <br /> Yes, but they <br, incest, satomosokijam, and lebalijanivadam, but strangely, they add very little spice or suspense. <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
