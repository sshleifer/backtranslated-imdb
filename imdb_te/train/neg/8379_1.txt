As some of the other reviewers mentioned in the past, I actually read the script and went to 'moron what to do, yes it was.This is the next film we are going to green light !! " And that person should be examined for his or her head true brain actions. Well, I'd like to give you my email address and maybe you'd only want to give away some money because it's actually done after reading this script for dishing out money out of the money. This film is horrific in every way. /> <br /> At least they will be, the Wayans are funny. They have made some good films and have some wonderful comedy shows along the way. But here, only the premise does not disagree with all logic, acting is terrible, the whole film is dangerous only from start to finish, only in the direction you can find is in the direction, but they actually pay to see this movie you want. If it's free ... naaah, it will still waste time. /> <br /> Normally I'd be inclined to write some long-winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but it's enough to say that my stupidity is let's talk. This lowest common denominator is making the film and it is unfunny about as a heart attack. <br /> <br/ 10/10 in my top ten list of worst movies of all time!
