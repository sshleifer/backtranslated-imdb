My first review of 2010 was "Into the Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers who played Chris Carmack and Laura Wandwort who love to explore the hidden wealth of a local reef bottom. One day after their exploration, they will reach a pair of David Anders and Marsha Thomas. <br /> <br /> They want to explore the Reef and appoint them to find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that was reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, after four days of diving for four diving, they would not appear at the bottom of the reef and coarse. A few more days and two rental divers have found that they will be killed if they fail to be part of a huge deadly plot. They were appointed to find two large containers. Has a nuclear reactor and another one is a core. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a back story about another person (brother of the main character) who is trying to do things with his girlfriend, I will take into consideration this part of the story's time wasted, the couple have me wasted in full waste and There are also very sexy scenes between the couple. This is why the film has some good underwater photography and it has received 4 stars which mix well with the colors. The only sequel to the name of Blue 2. No original actors or characters will come back, it has dumb plots, stupid characters and boring climax.
