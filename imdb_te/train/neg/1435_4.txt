The film is made in Saskatoon and Manitoba Parks and has brought the world eye back to nothing in "Wild Western Canada". Archie started writing his stories for magazines; The idea is to use the idea of ​​converting the forest into the forest and using the first Nation Peoples. <br /> <br /> The movie goes forward and asks the question; <br /> <br /> Archie is a dreamer of an English boy but it is unique and precious to understand the meaning of the dream. . <br /> In my opinion, I saw my life image of Archie "Cigar Story Indian" and it is not true of everything - very well done in Mr Brosnan. In the dance scene for the tourists, he also painted wild Indian. <br /> <br /> The Archie was brought forward to bring the Archie to the world stage, but he did not recognize its fullness and originality. <br /> <br /> Commentary by Mr Brosnan, as well as Mr Brosnan's commentary, as well as both of the directors are doing well. I saw the documentaries in Gray Owl and I think it's a bigger screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - The last scenes with the Archie Grandmaster of Chiefs <br /> <br /> The most beautiful Canadian lake scene and the real "gray owl" positions. <br /> <br />
