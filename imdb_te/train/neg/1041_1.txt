How many of those fake "piece of life" movies should be made? <br /> <br /> Increasing Victor Vargas is a self-conscious attempt by Peter Soletter, a director who draws attention to Hollywood. Usually it's nothing wrong. This is particularly wrong in the film because it neglects viewers and piles in every cliche in relation to "prestigious" Hollywood independent production. <br /> <br /> It is "experimental", so do not waste any time loading the film. <br /> <br /> It's a "hip", so let's use the scale of words like Al Pacino, in Scarface ... <br /> And so, and so forth. A lot of self-conscious effort to impress all the hollywood you've left, no one can get anyone outside the "rare" indie audience who still appreciates every bad image.
