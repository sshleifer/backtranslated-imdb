For my life, they do not get why they want to make a movie about "Jerry Springer Show". It's very dangerous. In some ways, sadly it is a guilty pleasure. We're agreeing to see at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I have recently seen it in America. This is very bad. I accept that. Jerry makes terrible job of what he thinks as acting. Or something like that. Jamie Presley has it. She basically plays her. She needs her boyfriend boy and kid rock. It is then perfect. So, I'll spin out "Ringmaster". Just watch "Jerry Springer Show". <br /> <br /> It is more enjoyable than this. <br /> <br />
