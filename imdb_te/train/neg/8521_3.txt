It is by the way, giving away some of the plot. Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the timeless classics that you enjoy the holiday, while preparing a valuable Christmas. But this is not. It tries to capture the emotion of Christmas by Charlie Brown, another Christmas game, but fails with poor and easy jokes. Charlie Brown is no longer thinking of the Christmas spirit but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the film. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to spell Charlie (she may be in her letter for some reason), instead she decides to name Sam Spell Sam. Also, Sally plays a goddess in drama with one word per day: "Hark!" She instead tells the hockey stick (Har Har). Sally says that Hark has 12 times (exactly the same thing) you do not kill, nothing will. Peppermit Patty and Marcy are a big center point, but it is not as good. Marty Patty's fun with her responses, but Patty is another story. She gets mad when she is a boy (it does not dispel rumors) and she should be the lamb in drama (horrible mummy and all). Apparently her sheep every year, and she's worried she forgets her lines (she does not have the lines). She feared earlier, she was twice, one after another, and the same response. I have to miss her short term memory, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (though Linus still has annoying advice), but spends a lot of time. I'm sure Schroeder is not even this. Overall, it seeks parasiticity for reality but has compromised the message for some quick laugh.
