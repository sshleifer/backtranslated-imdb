Daphne Juanai is shining in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If she does not, than this other reason to see. Five college children are signed to make old accommodation for the demolition of the demolition date. Problems will occur automatically when an inactive person requests, and the group is a bit smaller. Then, the killer is loose. I honestly wanted to say I'm going to enjoy this one. It's a fair arrangement, or it's just Daphne juni. The film is very slow, and is almost as silent as the library. Acting is very low, and "Point of View" moments are old news. Christopher Young, the acclaimed composer of films such as "The Hillarizer" and "Entrapment", made this song better for a TV movie on the recurring queue. However, it is more than enough for the film. So, other than the young and zuniga, this scrapes to the bottom of a barrel.
