The film begins with people on Earth, their rocket has gone to Mars, but jumped into space near the outside planet. When it was found, one of the staff was ill, one was alive and the other two were missing. <br /> <br /> On Mars, the crew was attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters. Unusually, when the sets are pretty good, the monsters are the silliest I have seen in the movie. Plus, in an odd effort at reality, the product uses the "Cinemagic" process. Unfortunately, this amazing discovery made the film look very cheap when they make my eyes bleed on the surface of Mars and the intensity of darkness practically - it's bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film has some interesting plot as well as good news about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it is very valuable. <br /> <br /> If you are not a good sci-fi movie compared to these films today, do not worry about Dr. Tremane when you see the movie. He looks like the picture of Dr. Quest's spitting from the "Johnny Quest" cartoon! Plus, he sounds and works a lot like him.
