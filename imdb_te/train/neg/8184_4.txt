It's almost like two movies - a literacy and engaging, other stupid and cliched. It did not really work out all the problems, but it is not uncommon, as it is very ill, that B-movies were written and produced faster. <br /> This may be a very good movie, it's a real shame. <br /> <br /> It is good. The image is the original and WWII code breakers. This is pretty lovely and I liked watching the main guy (Lee Bowman) master code breaker go through his paces. In fact, the first two-quarters picture is very good. But now it's bad, the film is just over 50 minutes long and lost steam. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as the "cookie sweetheart" should be one of the worst-handed and attention-raising roles in film history! For every smart move made by Bowman, Idiot Rogers then came forward to put down things like "comedy relief" that made mistakes. If her role is cleverly written, the whole picture is immensely enhanced! Instead, looking at her, it's hard to understand how we actually won WWII!
