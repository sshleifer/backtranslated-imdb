Although the book is certainly not accurate for realistic situations, it still has a sense of Japanese. I think Japan does not have any Japanese people for anyone involved in this film. Almost everything about it is horrible. I agree that the actors are generally very good, but it is not possible to save it. I was surprised to see that there were only ten people on Friday night in the film shortly after I opened in Japan in the film before the film started. 30 minutes I was surprised. I have the right to criticize. The whole picture is my groans and repressive laughing punctuation of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everybody who comes out of the film has been confused and disappointed in their faces. <br /> <br /> You will be grateful to me for two film producers.
