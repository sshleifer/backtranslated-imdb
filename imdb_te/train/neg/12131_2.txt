Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately not directed. I got high expectations about the film before I rented it and that's why I did not like it too much. I admire Spiesy's attempt to make a small movie on a small setting, but this is not an attempt to be impossible. I found the picture dull, boring, and stretched. Acting is not amazing. Gary Sinise has done very well, especially since most of her other films are discovering. Skeel Ulrich was frustrating, but it was one of his first films (how I came out of the youth and chubby with this scream star). The only thing that impresses me about this film is a shot of car debris from above. The central route of the road is perfectly concentrated and the camera goes along the border and is ruined. However, that shot was very "normal suspicions" ish and my impression of spicy came from the idea of ​​his previous movie (which is a very good mind you). If you want to see an amazing picture on a small background, see Hitchcock's Life Boat. Maybe spicy should see before the film is shot.
