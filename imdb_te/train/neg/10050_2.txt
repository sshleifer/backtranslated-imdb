A big disappointment from writer ham and director Dante. Their previous contribution to the first season's "Homecoming" was distorted and darkly fun all the way. This poor management in a secret camp shattered me. The "pay" shown by simple aliens who uncover something from the brain of infected psychologists is completely unsatisfactory and nothing is explained. If the story's point is an alien "cleaning" of the planet's human obsession, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion? Why not just throw a "Step" of a La Stephen King completely masculine malignant virus instead of having female female butcher females? While I watched, I hoped the episode could improve, but it was very serious and insulting. The religious subtitle appeared just forcing but it was clear that Sam Ham was deemed deep by the weight he gave it. I like Dante and Ham's work, but it's just not to be seen.
