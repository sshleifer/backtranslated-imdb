This is how I read these reviews here. Geez, this film is speculative and pretty boring. Acting is very small at this time, especially McCann. I did not try to make anyone "baadas" in a movie. Oh man, this film is discouraging. I read somewhere it might be a cult classic. <br /> <br /> The director will bow to many people, the film is dirty. <Br> <br /> Oh and pray for the man in Cheers. He looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The guy in the office space is perhaps the best actor in the film, he is only about eight minutes in the film. <br /> <br />
