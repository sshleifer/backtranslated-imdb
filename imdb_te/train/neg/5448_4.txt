Doris Day always leaves her a bad script. In most situations, the day gives 100% and usually goes out. The comedy, inspired by New York City block-out in real life in 1965, but Claude Magnier has been drawn from the French '50s drama, Doris makes little, but his own good-lovely film Second Half, Entertaining). There are some funny lines, yet the discourse of this substance can be taken from the play ... Instead of stirring up some amusing events within Big Apple, we are stuck on the outskirts. Doris co-stars (Patrick O'Neil, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) do not do well with her, and they are not even a formless hairdresser. Still, it's not terrible, it displays some big laughs and must see for Day-Hays. ** from **
