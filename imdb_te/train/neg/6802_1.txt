This movie does not describe how bad it is. I can not explain it by writing. You will see very well about how terrible the movie is to catch. I did not recommend doing it. There are so many clicks, errors (and all the other negative things you can imagine), it shouts. To begin with technology first, there are many mistakes about the aircraft. I do not list them here, but tell the plane's description. They did not even stop showing a plane in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used 747 images on the original Boeing livery. What's wrong. The plot was stupid and many times before, much more, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I missed the first. I'm bad guys' side all the time because good guys are very stupid, in the movie. "Executive Decision" Without a doubt you will be selected over this, even "turbulence" - the movies are good. In fact, every other image in the world is better than this.
