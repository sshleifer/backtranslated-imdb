It may not be bad comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this film stole an hour and a half in my life, and I want to recover! <br /> <br /> Chris Cutton is funny about 10 minutes. His high pitched voice and madness starts to get older, then the rest of the movie is much worse. He comes into a long line of former SNLs who tried to make films. Some wise people, some have failed miserably. There is not much middle class in this category. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley is wonderful, and then OK, and then very funny, and then not dead ... so I suppose he hits the entire spectrum in a career <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague. br> <br /> c
