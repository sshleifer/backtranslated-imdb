<br /> <br /> The worst thing about the crush is that it's pretty bad or the plot does not exist anymore, even if it's good for the camerawork. <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic moments that you'd expect to see in the movie coming more and more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too late, too late. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of violin-music and underage tearing scenes, the 40-year-old women are crying and talking about kids and marriage, and thrilled to see the above mentioned things in a picture correctly, and as a result I'm pretty terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste my time. <br /> <br />
