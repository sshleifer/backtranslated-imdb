This film does not show us the original. Every thought or (action) scenario can be seen in many previously released films. Fabulous Nick is absolutely plain. Even Patton will be calm and bad or good. Mr. Duvall is okay, but there is a very small part. So Angelina, so how can we recognize her newly appreciated stardom? Overall, there are so many characters, so nobody and nothing is not specifically explained. It forgets the movie. Very bad, do not you think?
