Dooohhh! My bunny hurts! It definitely does after this endurance test of the movie. How fast have I been on earth? <br /> <br /> I am unable to fetch the hero of the film or perhaps claim that it is a spiritual environment. <br /> <br /> Although this film has a very spiritual atmosphere for McDonald's tour, it is my humble opinion. <br /> In addition, the characters are all terrible and have more character in the Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do i do it Why do I see such a trip? It is enough to flee and join a monastery or foreign legion !! YAARGH !! Just an absolutley horrible movie in every respect. And it's not bad.
