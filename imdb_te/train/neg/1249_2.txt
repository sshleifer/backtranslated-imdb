Particularly disappointing, especially in the light of the provided budget, available technical resources, and talents are assembled. The basic rule for science fiction / drama is not to ban disbelief in audiences. POA 2001 creates an unbelievable beginning, breathes us, but then forgets that Mr Burton is working with his painters brain. Helen Bonham Carter's chimp's top freestyle, the absence of man's lockup, the ability to run away, the horse's extraordinary skills (this astronaut and suddenly a full-fledged human roots group), the massive and immediate human rebellion is all too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg has never once been upside down the concepts of real fear, dangers or kapatopans in this world. Compare with the original, Chuck Heston's nudity captures his true helplessness and astonishment during his events. Uniformly Wahlberg maintains his humility, and he has a clear sense of management and control inherent in the absurd situation and we are not really surprised to be good at it. Unlike Heston, he never gets real risk. Tim Burton should use some f / x budget for some effective screenwriting. In fact, after this low-level fiasco, I wonder why the Hollywood producers are bothered to solve the threats of screen writers and directors. Keep them up. The trained monkeys were able to do the same in the 2001 Planet of the Apes. I do not have recurring views of this endeavor. It's a new franchise, and a fantastic new step for imagination. Another chance is lost.
