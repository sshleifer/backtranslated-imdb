Timberlake's performance almost attacked the screen. It's not all bad, I think the role of journalists was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical rapper character, the toughest, bad guy around. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman took the whole movie to all. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is not good or bad, he is "there". <br /> Overall the picture. Bad plot. Very bad acting or wrong characters for actors.
