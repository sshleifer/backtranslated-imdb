Sometimes it's a long time in the film, it's terrible, I'm trying to warn people. <br /> <br /> I work in my days and I can save a soul from watching this movie, how will my happiness be? For starters, every five minutes there is a music montage. No character is developed. Each character is a stereotype. We deny donuts, goofy, foreigner, fat man. The script is thought to have been written as the film was shot. The product value is very low as I see a junior high video presentation. Directors, producers, etc. Have you ever seen the film before? Halastaster with each new entry is worse and worse. The concept of this film sounded very funny. How can you make a mistake with Gary Coleman and some legitimate actors. Trust me when I say, things are so bad.
