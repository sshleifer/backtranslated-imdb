Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska, and tad bit of modern mental billy, then it's worth watching only when you see live shows. Tons of tons and tons for the film, Tayla's president, Lloyd Kaufman, is a semi-lead character and many of Goofy's death scenes. Are these sounds good or right? Well, deaths are repeated to fans of Warang Tour's many bands and fans. Some deaths start to be stylish, but they are recycled over and over again, to a fully recurring stage. Almost everyone shatters their head, or the intestines are removed from their stomachs. It looks like Andreas Schnaus has come from 'Zombie 90: Extreme Peralalans'; This is "Water-Blood of Blood", but the film is actually better, and the film offers a humorous humor-something. Sure, the movie is made by Dow Sakmann from Troma, it got a great low budget potential, and it tries ... but it's very difficult. Everything means that this movie is funny, and thats what it brings down. Everything is very comic and goofy, intentionally using bad acting, overuse of nonsense mortality, and the same thing over and over. <br /> <br /> It's basically funny, it's about it: "Mulva: Zombie Us Kicker", "Chairman of the Board", or any movie you made with your friends. <br /> <br /> If a band plays, a band will die, fans die - over and over. <br /> <br /> These films are primarily 'bad slap-stick'-they are very hard or not?
