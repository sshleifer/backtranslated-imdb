When you come into your hands on a British film, you expect some of the quality. When it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; The movie is doing business. It was made by highly skilled artists. You can bring one and a half hour of enjoyment alone. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you can not really find anything. You do not really have a good feeling and do not offer a free-spirited perspective. The script should be simple, plot predictable and the end of Hollywood's worst east. In all English cosiness, it is just an insulting and dull attempt to make another "full monte". Why did they make this film? Without getting a lot of money, I do not have a clue.
