This is not good. The characters do not develop and the personality is only from the memories of the previous film that contradict the 'new' personalities (or lack of). I am confused because the opening sequence was a nightmare by Ariel. It's serious. It reminded me of all the annoying characters in the Disney Channel-everyone has moved the scenes to be embarrassing and hassle-free without any problems from the story. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing part is not terrific songs - is not spectacular. The amazing and powerful voice in the original Ariel and all the songs are impressive and fun. You would like to remember them and sing them. But the songs in this movie are not at least creative; If they speak in an unpleasant song-voice, very weak and disappointing. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to make this film, I think they will do just that. . . This film requires a new story line, with curiosity and excitement without new impressive songs and annoying "Look at me! Look at me! I'm annoying!" Disney's mentality of this generation. : '(
