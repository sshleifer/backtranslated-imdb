I'm never a fan of violent stolen movie, a violent or unwelcome movie. I feel like a masterpiece of "Kannibal Holocaust" and always protects the controversial images of "The Day of the Woman" or "Left Last On the Left" as a true classic. Anyone who is browsing through my other user comments will be very violent when I come to the movies. However, I think there is at least some point of violence. There is no point in this piece of garbage. The first film in the "Guinea Pig" series, "The Devil's Experiments" (1985) is widely controversial, but it has not been recommended for this stinker against many other controversial films. Before I saw the Guinea-Pig films, I thought I would feel this hatred when I learned this much. But because of its status as one of its controversial films, I have decided to see it. <br /> <br /> The story of this subject (I do not even like it). I could not waste any money on this rubbish pile. It's called 'cinema'): It's not one. Some scumbags are tormenting a woman for some 40 minutes of death. That's it. No artistic value, no 'shocking' story, no suspense; Nothing. An image that does not show anything except to torture the woman for any reason has a very inappropriate worship. It's upset and I'll give it. In fact, it's upset to watch a video of violence for 40 minutes. Whatever is most unhappy, however, most people consider this sort of garbage as the best masterpiece. I can not really understand why. The fact that Gore effects are realistic is not the cause, I hope. The girl who plays the victim is not a very good actor, and reacts very calmly to all the violence. This film produces less realism, which is good in this single case. This is a movie. <br /> <br /> The only purpose of showing 40 minutes torture is its presence. <br /> <br /> I strongly oppose any kind of censorship. It's 100% duplicate and it is legitimate to make it a movie because no one is injured during its production. Anyway, I can not imagine why one would like to do something, except the pain and experience of violence. The film's sequel "Flowers of Flush and Blood" star Charlie Sheen was misinterpreted for a real black movie and reported to the FBI. Fortunately, the image has become a duplicate. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Devil's Experiment" is a fake torture / laughter image, with the sole intention of looking closely to a real cannibal image as it is possible. <br /> <br /> "Devil's Experiment" The worst films I've ever had is bad luck. This piece of garbage does not bully you by giving a try for a controversial status. Make yourself a favor and avoid it. From 10 to Zero stars, I wish I could have a bad pile rate that is in the right shape.
