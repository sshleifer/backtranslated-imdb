There are some lovely poetic bits but really only one artsy-farsi tot-it is in any direction or without a resolution. How did these people come through film school? Who will give money to make this garbage? It was a very good actor, and I was always like a fine boss, but the masonry merely seemed tired of not being blank, but it's definitely not good movies. The director needs to go away and live for a better period and the camera does not come back until they really say. This art-making throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall-street-like school is just like a bunch of gritty paintings and hope for hell as poetry emerges. If the director actually has any kind of attention or the brain, it can work, but here it is just an empty filler with no consequence. It felt like lazy end coming moments before it hit, and the word "you lazy bastard" was on the screen when the credits popped up.
