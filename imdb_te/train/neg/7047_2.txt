WARNING: Jet Jones or McGregor plays a major role in the poster you can trust. <br /> <br /> The film is very intense among the exaggerated comedy and original play in the movie. Especially I did not mention his screwball friends and sexy obsessed husband, to find the most sympathetic group for the main character is impossible. The plot is terribly drunk, and I stopped this one after 2/3 - I want to finish what I want to start, and it's unusual for me. Good acting and beautiful setting takes up to 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br />
