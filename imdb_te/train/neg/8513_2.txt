Awful! Absolutely awful! No plot, no point, no end. The director seems to be turning on camera, and then the whole staff went to dinner. Every day. I'm trying to give this video away, but nobody will. I love Benign because it will give a 1 instead of 2. <br /> <br /> Roger, I'm going to say this one thumbs down <br /> <br />
