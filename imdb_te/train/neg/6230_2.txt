I am so keen on a smiley film in this movie. I was disappointed. The same sort of I felt I was looking at was 'Friday 13th: Jason takes Manhattan'. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a good attention grabber. It turned to a halt. Fashionable with breasts and over 80s will not help the film. Piranha is just eating near this island of cannons! I do not ask the 'cannibal' gore level, but I'm looking for cheap looting. <br /> <br /> I found two stars in some extremes. While I do not think its really worth it to take time to look at it. Nobody cares about what's going to happen and I'll see it in a party that you want something in the background. But I can not tell anyone, "Oh, dude, you have to watch this movie." It's not good or it's enough to be very attentive.
