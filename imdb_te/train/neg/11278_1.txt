The film has so far been made in the films, and not only the British film industry, but also today's unskilled hacks. The film is not only a major distributor but also a good cast of British actors, so why was it wrong? I do not know and because I do not care enough to be engaged in the discussion because the film is not so terrible, it is not worthy of any idea. Be alert and hell away from this rubbish. But obviously I had to write ten lines in this review, so I could have a plot too. A person's mouth is set up by his father's friend and colleague from his father's organization, thus meeting with Russian mafia and daddy accents and stupid, very stupid plot turns / devices. I asked for my money back but the shock may still be from the experience. If you want to see a good suspect or godfather if you want a good criminal film, about lock and stock ... it's the maximum level of contemporary British crime film ...
