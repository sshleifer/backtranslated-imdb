I talked about how to play a spoiler box. 99% of this show may already be seen by any follower of scrubs, perhaps not into the spoiler's category. <br /> Clip shows. Grrr. <br /> <br /> We know that the friends are going into the tube when they start the clip shows ... and for five and half years they went into the scrubs and dropped the hole. <br /> The writers were unable to get the week's writing and just told them to "show other funny stuff." It did not work. <br /> <br /> For starters, the context of what people have seen fallen is not relevant. <br /> Second, a compilation of the JD's fantasies is desirable, a turkey dream, which does not see dangling by his banana hood. <br /> <br /> Since this is nothing, this episode is completely unforgettable. We've seen these things before. And collecting clips of people who dance? Why? <br /> Finally, I've shown the last two summaries in my favorite scrubs in the last edition ... Doctor. Ben learns that he is dead ... JD tells him how proud he is <br /> <br /> The move did not even save that episode. Summary It's all done. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE Do not let your show friends do the same, keep it fresh, keep it funny ... or wrap it up.
