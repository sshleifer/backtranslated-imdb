Although I have seen this film and have initially made some effort to build a good picture, it's definitely terrible - but I did not intend to think. <Br /> The child is insulted by this child by believing that all the audience is very hard for both the worries or the worries for the worries or the spectators. I can not imagine that the producer is in the mind of the producer while doing this film. I mean, the actors are just trying to be serious, and just scribbling script for total rewriting .... I can not say it anymore. If Harlequin decides to make romance horror films, this is a very good endeavor. </ P> <br /> If you find that the film is entertaining, I strongly suggest that you would like some guidelines for movies. There are too many beter charges. Join the club, read reviews, but avoid all such trash.
