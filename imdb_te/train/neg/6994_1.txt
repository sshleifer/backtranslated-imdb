I went and saw this movie, I have great expectations. But I have done a lot wrong. The film is similar to each other horror movies. This is a virus, zombies etc. Absolutely Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But this, and the difference in other movies, is that the story is a lot of weeks. It's bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK but the rest is the worst. Do not look at this "horror" movie, go see the ring 2 or the other one in a story. I hope they spread virus and virus and stop making people horrific images made by zombies. We've seen enough. The good thing in this movie is that they stand at the ceiling and shoot famous, infected celebrities.
