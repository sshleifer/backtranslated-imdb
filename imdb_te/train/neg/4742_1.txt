Wow. This is probably the worst DCOM ever. I saw the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays silver, Hot Joy plays a famous girl with lover and ties friends who decide to be the queen of the house. She has to save the world as a warrior and Shin helps her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her a snake and a tiger and learns some techniques to protect the world. <br /> <br /> The film is martial arts and Chinese culture <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comic actress and I can not play a role in her role. She loudly laughed at her shin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> This film is very fake and stunts so Power Ranger-esquire called it bland and stupid. The characters did not like it and I could not stand to see. Disney really needs time to make some good movies. High School Musical deserves to stay on Disney Channel, Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Apep, & Suckert in Sabers If you like action adventure and trump jokes, you'll love this movie.
