This movie is very bad, with 'memorable' lines and script with incredible bad performances. Special effects are also bad (not the worst I've ever seen) and the music is very bad, so listen to it. <br /> <br /> The two smallest pictures previously seen (30 seconds or more) are repeated continuously.
