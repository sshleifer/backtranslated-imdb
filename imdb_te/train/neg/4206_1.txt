In 1997, I was at the premiere of the Toronto Film Festival. After the screening, the author / director and some cast members answered the questions, no one will ever bother to ask. Sometimes the film is rarely sighted (from some scenes to the land of random frames, why?), Acted viciously (David Arkquette, Paraphrase Dorothy Parker, AA from B. brings a meal) and fully understood. Characters behave entirely without exception, without compromising the moving platform in certain directions. Finally, this film comes in full of random and nonsense, which is "really you can think." Unfortunately, what would you think of, "Well, my life has been 90 minutes and I never get back."
