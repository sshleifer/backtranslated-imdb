This should be the creepiest, most twisted holiday film I've ever clapped with eyes, and something. I know that the Mexican people have some odd ideas about religion, combining ancient Aztec beliefs in Classical Christian theology. <br /> <br /> Santa Claus is not some fun, there is not a fat red fit (a look at those Rosie cheeks)!). Besides, he lives of skinny sociopathic pedophile in Heaven (or heaven, which is), with a group of kids working harder than Kathy Leigh Gifford's sweatshop. They do not have a small African-American boy in 'mommy' singing black face while spoiling their homeland OH-so beautiful traditional songs while wearing clothes that I am stunned. This Santa hears everybody looking at everything that he sees from his 'eye in the sky'. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Claus, no ghosts (he does not need Elves for him) when he got child labor) and reindeer mechanical wind up toys! This floating freak show is held in a cloud and maintained by its silver lining. <br /> <br /> <br /> Santa's enmity ... the devil? What is it, Santa our Lord and Savior? Abnormal. Anyway, Satan punches one of his allies, he calls the pitch, seizing Christmas. Are you trying to destroy these pure evil powers completely commercial and greedy walk? <br /> <br /> The pitch is not completely waste. He tries to talk some kids badly, but not too luck. I struck through the storyline of saintly little girl Lupe, who was very poor in the family. All she wants is a toy for Christmas, but he can not buy her a buy (they spend their money on the cardboard built their house). So the pitch encourages her to steal a toy. In fact, the only way to get a picture of a poor girl. Because, being pure, praying to God and holy Santa does not really work. But Lupe hinders the temptation and retains the pitch behind her, so she is rewarded by giving a toy with creepy learning that it is the sister of the chick. <br /> <br /> The Santa Claus was caught in a tree protected by Uri-huh! Merlin? You got to make me fun! With mythical unexpected figures in Christmas stories, or with any connection with Christian religions? And do not disagree with God's magic? Some hundreds of years ago, Merlin is thought to be burning, and does not ask him to save one of God's purposes (or I must go against Satan). Is this film a long HUH? From start to finish, and you'll wonder if the eggnog that you are drinking is not spiked or something. This movie is like a long giant DT because it probably is.
