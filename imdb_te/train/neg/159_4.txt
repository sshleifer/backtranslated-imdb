I have always appreciated Susan Sarandan for his personal life as well as his talent, her honesty and honesty as an actor. I found it to be sarcastic, and she seems distorted in the film. The defense of her role from South Pole traveled to Canadian Canadian charter Company Etmonton, a Canadian design and built twin-voter aircraft from Alberta. The tour was rejected by US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard beyond their capabilities. A few years later, the same company did the same rescue to bring out one person from the South Pole base. The film is about a very persistent thing and I feel that the frightening woman is the most frightening figure. I can not understand why the producers need to ignore the bravery of the necessary rescue pilots and show the rescue aircraft as USAF Hercules.
