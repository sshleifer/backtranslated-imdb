A young band in the college "St Elmose Fire", who is a graduate from college, can do any less than four years of high school at high school. For the most part, these kids hold them as irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, and co-writer and director Joel Schumacher as a touchstone of a generation. An old time cast called "Up and Hammers" is quite different to the "Endmere rules", and the circle's euphoria is pulled onto us, "Fire" is a useless lightning that becomes more embarrassing as years pass. **** from * 1/2
