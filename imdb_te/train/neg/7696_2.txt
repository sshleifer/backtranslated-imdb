Yes, stupidity! I ended up watching and in my mouth is still bad taste. Many stories, too much unnecessary "AdSense" for a story, a lot of stupid characters (I thought I would like to make fun relaxation, but I only wanted it) ... everything is a lot. Shame can be ruined by one of the divine stories from such "Arabian Knights". Child, innocent (both bad way) and a lot of magic breaking mistakes, I do not think this would put five children for ten minutes then. The princess is lovely, but she has toggles, and does not know how to play the role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. "Good guy" is insulting that it is not good. The only light in this dark, unfortunately deeper deeper David Cordrine, but at least put his actor / "fighter" skills at the top. I'm still sorry to see a thing in this matter, but I am so glad that I see him in full swing, so thank you David. Only, for him, I give this fiasco these 2 stars ... I give him more for him, but the whole picture will increase in the final score. The rest are very bad, I would probably want to grade, but here's the grade girlfriend 1 here, and I think it's too much.
