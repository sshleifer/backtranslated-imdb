The film is not just a religion that promotes traditional Hinduism and New Age witchcraft, it is decorated with Western paintings and does not know about religious comparisons. The primary tenants of Hinduism have elements of rebirth. (Some characters appear in the present and in the 1600s) are clearly reincarnated. God is not a person. Animal life and plant life are identical. (This is the pantheism). Redfield attempted to combine Eastern Mysticism with Western Christians. His attempt with summitism is foolish or confusing to anyone who seeks the truth, but the film does not have a weak need for any ultimate reality. The announcement in the old Berkeley Bar will show you how to start your own religion used to say $ 10.00. As a famous prophet says, "use the Force Luke".
