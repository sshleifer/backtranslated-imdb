Guy running without intention ... that two hours of my life will never come back. Person recognizes and cheating on a recognized wife. What am I thinking Where do you buy a price? I understand that he loves his father, but I do not know the film completely. What is the benefit of going for a stranger funeral for a lot walking and for no apparent reason. How did it improve his life? Why should we see the old lady dead on her underwear ?? <br /> Even though I'm about something deep or interesting. I do not even recommend this movie while sleeping ...
