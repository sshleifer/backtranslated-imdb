After seeing the movie trailer in the film, it is the concept for the thriller, which has created a competing world of competing companies. This is another message that all the films are good. But when I did not go to see it in the first week of release it disappeared week 2 I feared something missed something. I waited for the release of the release of the patiently released DVD, and then rushed home for a happy evening view. The imagination to go home is far better than cinema. In the beginning there is fear in the direction. Nothing is there and the director just plays a role, so he may appear in the film. I'm not rushing to appoint him in the future. The latter is entirely incorrect as Ryan Phillippe in the lead role. Philip is usually a cool role as in Cruel Intentions and Gunway but this is a male hero, which he tries to portray while slipping when he is slipping and geeky friends when he's running, but he is supposed to not look right. Female stars, Rachel League Cook and Clare Four, are not enough to appear, but are close to their best when none of the shows are present. The highlight of the film is in a role modeled for him by Tim Robbins, and this is a mysterious way of dragging his fiery temper and image. Finally, the movie will fill in the trailer filled with another and only appears in the sequence section deleted on DVD. While some of these scenes are tied, filling important gaps in this story can cause more discouragement.
