I believe in this DVD. It's also very low in my local video store. <br /> If you take into account this is a good image. It's just a budget of 4000 dollars. I found this funny. <br /> <br /> "I love the horror, if you love something like Dual (1971). <br /> <br /> You would like this movie to be thrown out by some pretty girls with a long story. <br /> <br / > I give a "0" so I give "1" I did not see this movie entertaining anymore.
