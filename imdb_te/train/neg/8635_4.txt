This is certainly not one of Lucio Fulzi's best flicks by any stretch of imagination. The plot was pretty bad, a millionaire murdered and called for his daughter to know what his daughter did. But the biggest problem for me is that why are you worried about anyone? He had a bigger push for everyone who came across all those who came across (including the daughter he wanted to help). But no one really sees a full-fledged movie for a good storyline, so incredibly script is like a romantic look for writing and acting. Usually his films will try to replace this, by adding high-profile gore but not in this movie. If you're looking for a good fullscreen image, check Beyond.
