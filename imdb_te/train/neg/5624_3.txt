In his short 40 years on earth, writer Jack London was able to crawl as much adventure and event as possible. This 90-minute film, the biography of the man's life, but patented fictional fiction, does not even have surface lines, and has a very sharp story for a modern day resume. Here, Michael O'Sheri is one of her first roles, played in London, and her performance is strict and sympathetic. He's not a problem here. Susan Hayward, the younger and the most beautiful, played the role of his fiancée Charmian, whose biography was "base" in London. London's life was broken in the series of episodes, the film was much simpler. Hence the oyster pirate with London, a sealer in the bearing sea, a golden opportunity in Yucatan and a correspondent during the Russia-Japan war ... complex events in London ... colorful events, certainly, in-depth treatment. And directed by Alfred Santel (Susan's first films "Our Leading Citizen", also directed in 1939) is not the best. There is a low-quality DVD that rougrates things here, with a crème-visible print source and the Hussey sound. The catalog of alpha video images that contain hundreds of hundreds and full-color film posters: Perhaps the greatest thing about this movie rental is one of the DVD's extras. Let's just have a better shape than these films "Jack London"!
