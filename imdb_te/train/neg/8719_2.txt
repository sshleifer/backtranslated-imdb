Well here I go with another B industry image. It's very sad for a bit badly featured movies, but I do not care if the B industry or C industry produces this film. Show some of your work. The characters are really bad. Acting is not a question of this matter (surprise), but the plot. How hard-knife squad two of their fellow soldiers have been killed, and then go away if nothing happens. I am responsible for the writer in the rest of the members who also threw a scene where they joked how good the doctor's donkey was. Will you be.
