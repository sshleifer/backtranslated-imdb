I thought this film was pretty dull. If you're looking for cheesecake, you might like it. I do not mind, for me, a fair amount of cheese, but this is ridiculous. The progress of the film is boring and the storyline is very weak. <br /> <br /> There is only one day-glow zombies entertaining about this film, but it is not enough reason to watch this movie.
