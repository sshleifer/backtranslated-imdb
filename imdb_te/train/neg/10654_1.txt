Large hair, big breasts, bad music and huge security pin ....... are good to describe this horrible picture. I love the cheesy horror movies and I've seen hundreds..but this has always got the worst of the worst. The plot is thin and ridiculous, the acting is obscene, the script is totally ridiculous (the best thing to do with the police is the closing showdown and the murderer-it's just terrible), clothes tendon, and similar actions funny, hair bigger, boobs bounced, men show their stomach The cut is worn with t-shirts (men's Trick and screw the music just like the synthesizer and repeat ... Trash music, breasts and paramedics in almost every scene ... and Jim still close for death !! The next comedy film is all a bad movie, looking back at the 80th anniversary of the disaster and all bad things are bad.
