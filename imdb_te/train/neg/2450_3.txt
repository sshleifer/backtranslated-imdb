When I saw the Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I was half way through reading two towers I thought it was totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> "I really bored for 20 minutes because I loved the book, At least 2 and 8 minutes of books in the film are at least 1, half books are fit. <br /> <br /> There are no characters, reading a page, my favorite character also Gandalf who does not look interesting at all. <br /> <br /> Oranges are only okay in the movies except the Oranges (they looked awful) and the Aurangan and Sam face. <br /> <br /> The film was released because I did not know the exact end, but this movie is not good because it is not good because this movie is not good. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone can judge the books by this film. <br /> <br />
