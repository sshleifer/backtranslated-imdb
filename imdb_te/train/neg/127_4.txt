When I was released in 1967, I rented Carias-Yelley from my controversial video store. When I initially attempted to enter the country, it was the first of these conventions that I had captured, so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htr_sltf&feature=search&id=1 "<br> <br /> The storyline is Lina Is a young Swedish drama student who wants to learn about life around. Specifically, she wants to focus her attention on producing a somewhat documentary about what the average Swedish thinks about some political issues, such as Vietnam War and ethnic issues in the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> Stockholm politicians and general representatives of their views in politics have sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married people asking their ideas in politics. <br /> <br /> When I was 40 years ago, I was treated as sexy. Really, sex and nudity scenes are relatively small, though it is not like some less made romance. Although my domestic mind is shocked, the reality sex and nudity are the mainstay of Swedish films. <br /> <br /> Inquiry Bergman, their oldest boy John Fowd, has their own romantic scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I recommend filmmakers that what sex shown in the picture is shown for sex purposes is to impress people and make money in showing pornographic theaters in America. A good movie for anyone who wants to study the self-film's meat and potatoes. But in reality, there is not much in this movie.
