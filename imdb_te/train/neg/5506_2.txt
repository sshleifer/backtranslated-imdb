We got into the film because my husband enjoyed the original version of `my favorite martin '. Our 6 year old daughter has come to us with us. She wanted to leave half of her parents in a good film! The parts we see are occasionally funny, mostly very silly or bulky. I would expect that movie will appeal to children between 9-12. It's not exactly fit for small children. I hear that the original series is extravagant and you will be disappointed if you want to be "repeat" in the past.
