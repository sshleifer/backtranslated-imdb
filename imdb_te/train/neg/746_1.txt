<br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and HG As an avid fan of Wells, I had to buy. I hope to stay entertained for three hours. Instead, it took me four days to finish watching because I could not see it for more than 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines has a $ 20 million budget for this product. Where did the heck go? Has he used a large part of it to buy a new home? Finance for retirement? Or what? Start what's really good about this movie. It's true in the book and it has some good performances. I respect the actors who tried to make this good film. But good performances quickly overwhelmed the horrible ... and I understand terrible special effects. A Fermann film school student might have done a better job with CGI. <br /> <br /> For me, it's like "Stop Action" cardboard cutouts that use advanced CGI software to use the $ 20 million project. <br /> <br /> You have applied for this movie to an amateur post production. My own partner and I sat down and rebuilt our version of the Ferrari scene using a five minute scene that looked better and costlier than $ 1500.00 and better than the one created by Hines in a day. I saw movies with a budget of less than $ 2 million. Very good. <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong are better than the Hines Special Effects. In fact, I have this majority for the Attack of Killer Tomatoes. <br /> <br /> There is no need for today's technology with today's technology to look like a 50's B-movie, unless intended to be with this particular project. <br /> <br /> I am a DVD transmitter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I built a $ 45,000 project in 2003, with better cinematography and special effects than the film. /> <br /> I strongly encourage those who appreciate the good filmmaking or those who are attacking the 50-foot attack instead of leaving this movie on WolfW's fan shelf. It will be easy for the eyes.
