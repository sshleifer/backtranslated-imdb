Finally, I have seen in this movie for 30 minutes. Finally, the film is shady on the head with the picture. Soundtrack, the so-called 'plot' and every actor. They all say they are the main part of the movie and the scream "Notice me!" Mallie Mallie. The bad guy continues his bad-guy music and tells you things like a bad man-evil, in which case you do not hold too much. The good guy makes the brave and noble things in case he does not know that he is a good person. And Oh Lord, the plane of the plane. "My husbands are missing! Oh my God! If it's going to make his league or TOILET or go, it must be miss!" (And yes, I know, his clothes are still there, but honestly, she woke up and she started to panic before he was in and had time to look at the damn seat. <br /> <br /> I'd like to return for 30 minutes.
