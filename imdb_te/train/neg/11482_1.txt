This is just as you see when Harry meets Salley. Why do not you bang your head in the table so why not make a good remake of Bollywood? But it is so funny that the funny moments that will annoy you. Do not miss the feature of the film. Rainy looks awful. Saif tries to act as a hell to the actor. Plots taken from the original are not visible effectively. The part that they both bring to their friends and the hitting of a note is not attractive. What's more dangerous? You can waste some money, you can get it. Otherwise, put more bucks, and watch the original. Miss its very good ..
