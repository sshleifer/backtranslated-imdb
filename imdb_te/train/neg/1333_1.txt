I was completely disappointed with this film. I have read other reviews here and have too many expectations. I expected to play a more dramatic role. But never happened in the film. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor, but some critics are not good at believing here. I repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. <br /> Acting: 6 is from 10 to direct. The script is even worse: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The picture from my DVR in 70 minutes has been deleted. Into the image. Very good movies ...
