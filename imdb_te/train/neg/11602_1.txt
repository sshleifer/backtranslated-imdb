This is the worst .... totally the worst. I can not believe any company can work in this film. The full moon has a lot of horror films, but it's even worse. First, the plot does not exist. It's odd. As with it, they took an idea for the story, and kind of never really got around to develop it. Two "heroes" were reprimanded in the desert, and wasted a lot of time during filming outside shots when Bradbury talks for about 10 minutes. There are two scenes in this movie (when Doz and Dzazz is driving, and when Doz and Bradbury is driving) it's just turned on and on ... It's like some music videos, some dialogue or action. <br /> They traveled just 5 minutes. Without the music and shots of the surrounding landscape nothing. First off, the girl who plays Dazzie is just a beast. She was very scary looking, she wanted to stay away when she was on the screen! Horrible casting. Then, you have a person who does not work if his life depends on it. His "crying" is actually funny, and his madman antics are also ridiculous. The person who plays desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad as the person who plays Bradbury. <br /> <br /> There is no identity in the film. <br /> <br /> The decorative effects ... Hmmm, what makes curiosity? The "effects" are so fake, they're ridiculous. The silly little robot looking catapilar thing pulls someone up, they cut away, and when they come back, the guy is completely fake looking meat injury. Nice. Did they cancel the money in the make-up budget? I have to say Drugie Chick in a girl's apartment ... there is a good decoration there. I think they're going for a drugger look and I think I should have a black man, but it looks like a cheap zombie decoration for Halloween. <br /> <br /> The film is just terrible from the beginning. The story is stupid and very, very unrealistic, directed by a 10-year-old has been featured as tho, acting is minimal, and so on. Stay at all costs from this movie. It is only 70 minutes in the first place, and is taken at least 20 minutes by music and no dialogue or sitting around in the hotel. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage.
