I remember this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival, if I recall. I liked it, it showed great potential. <br /> <br /> The film has been filmed by the film because it appears to be a Hubble (by entering the filmmaker's official site - the smallest being "tough cut"). <br /> However, this is an easy comedy. I will try to read a lot of comedy in most. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did it in its performance, so it succeeded at that level. My 2 cents.
