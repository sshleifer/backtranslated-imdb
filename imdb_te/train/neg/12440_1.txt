This trunk brain is damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, crazy, the nonsense part of the Trash I've ever seen, the untrustworthy garbage of an instant conviction among the overwhelming fan base. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, like "Citizen Kane". Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Â¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson Al Pacino ... so it really is really, really. But if you are looking for that kind of stunning movies, it's for you! I am an American international fan of fantastic horror movies, price-carmine-poo saga and some great blakesploitation stuff, but with "Star Creatures" they come right to Z level. If you want to watch bad movies for fun, if you work in reverse in my 1 in 10 (an Indian chief play guy is great) so have fun and have fun ... you can.
