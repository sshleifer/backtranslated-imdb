The film is the most terrible film ever made on the planet, and I like Barney more than this film. The graphics suck, half the film is animated, suck deaths, and more than anything, I'm ready to pick up people who made this film! Please do not use the bells in your life watching this movie. The movie ******* is only a good part of the outcome! This film is 50% Jurassic Park, 1% Sabertoth, and 49.9% DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you regret it. Want to see why this movie sucks up? Well, the sucks covered, the graphics sucked, the blood looked (I mean) ketchup, people tried to blow themselves up, think college students all stand up and stand up to the animal. I mean, there is a 5 foot tiger running directly to a woman, she throws it with a knife from 100 feet away! You can really get embarrassed! Acting is terrible. The Jurassic Park is indeed a good image, just to go and destroy it.
