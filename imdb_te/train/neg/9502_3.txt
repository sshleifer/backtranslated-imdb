The movie is a huge, different and silly way to see friends while drinking in a large empty room. I really love the start thing with Lisa wandering about losing a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger who lost in some exotic European locomotives, probably not in the low budget horror film. There are surprisingly sexually non-sexual scenes (however, in my DVD copy) are definitely the end of the cut. Do not try to understand it, just go and look for strange bits ... it's everything. Do not see this if you really like the plot or the characters or anything else. Pretty pretty, if you give it up, if you want to watch a genuine horror film, you can see Dead Alive.
