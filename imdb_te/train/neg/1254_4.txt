<br /> <br /> It is good: effects and makeup are good. There are no complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate and the performances (Tim Roth is wonderful, the other main characters are well and "supporting actors" have played very limited roles). <br /> <br /> Bad: Escape from Ape City is terrible. The characters are going in circles, then suddenly there are tunnels to escape anywhere in the town. Plus, what escape path does everybody pass through the bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to take as much action as possible. I like action scenes but the original film has a lot of meat and more respect. <br /> Finally, the ending is not completely understandable. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/>
