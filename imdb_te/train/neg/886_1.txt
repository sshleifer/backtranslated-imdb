<br /> In Paris, J'TAIME. It created a worse piece about New York City a few years ago. , I Love You (Jitime) created a concept for Paris & made in many parts of the beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In New York there are 5 boroughs, no scenes in Bronx or Queens I do not see in Brooklyn (in Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village, There are no scenes in beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a large cast, although most of the performers are not even stereotypes, they are very low caricature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <p> Very few funny jokes are a sexual nature or a disgrace to many <br /> <br /> Some of the images nominated for 'razzie' awards are very good. <br /> <br /> I think the title should have been, as I think, <br /> <br /> NEW YORK , I love you.
