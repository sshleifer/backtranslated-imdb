Yes, the movie goes to the empty place and it is okay that you are learning the ropes when you meet each other. Then in 1986, a robot called Jinks was introduced, and now they are nothing with such artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a buddy with robot and root and the other infantry group fills the kid by firing him and goes into outer space with very limited oxygen supply and radios that are not signal to reach space. This camp is also not very fun because these kids make real training and trainers get everything they do without fail or doing the right things. Give them a rest, they are for fun and not astronauts, just give them a vacant air experience as a camp as a camp. However, you should see Jokin Phoenix in the very first role. So at the end of a movie that attempts to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you can have children of space space aliens on top of everything else that is happening in the same way film is at least enjoying the movie. Perhaps some others, who would like to see Katie Kapsa's face emerged apart from some strange super-alien creature.
