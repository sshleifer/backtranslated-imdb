I never saw it in 1973. I'm a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way, acting as usual). If you can not recognize this horrifying ending in the first thirty minutes, this movie probably takes all the minutes of Hammer out of the entire plot (I can see a cocktail towel at dinner), perhaps this movie is entertaining. It's the last one, to give enough credit to audiences with the Hollywood horror / mystery / thriller generation and write the latest, smart and tantelizing screenplay, they throw creepy music and a couple of things to make you go off a little jump and the last print of your local theater. At least, it does not have juggling hand-held camera syndrome.
