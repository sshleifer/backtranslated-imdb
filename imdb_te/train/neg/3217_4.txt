The missing train. Wrong phone number. An additional cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you take a seemingly harmful decision? <br /> <br /> "Happensstance" refers to the story of the relationship between the plot and the cause and effect of the plot. The typical Parisian folk group. <br /> <br /> A cheating spouse, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish room, and homeless man. Audrey Tatou is unable to find the right rhythm of her life (in the sense that she is in the camera and opens and closes) and acts as a normal girl. <br /> <her The horoscope learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on any train for her. During the day she is told by various characters what will happen. Is the prediction true? The concept is good, but the story is the brother. Connections from an event are weak. <br /> <br /> You have a good story in 15 seconds in Liberty mutual insurance trade, where one person goes out for more than two hours in Happensstown. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tatou, you can definitely sacrifice time for this film, but you'll finish dissatisfaction and wondering what this might be the same storyline if it is a good producer and director.
