Perhaps television is a day of ruthlessness. Perhaps the 'Big Brother' is the first step in Stephen's direction. Richard Bachman explains the end point of King. But enough about it. I'm hoping that the producers will choose this if I spend a lot of words talking about the serious theme of this film. This is the 6th day of the same. The film promotes discussion about its subject, which serves as a promotion to producers. Let's not take it through. The social criticism suggested by the storyline makes it more possible for video marketing rather than an imaginary, violent film, film. <br /> I did not read the book. I criticize Stephen King without reading it. But when I saw the film I thought they were not able to do a good book from such a terrible film: in the 1980s, music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger found himself as a policeman running away from the murderers on a cruel TV show. The audience is cheering. <br /> <br /> With 'Predator', this is certainly the most stupid image of Schwarzenegger. 10 to 2 stars.
