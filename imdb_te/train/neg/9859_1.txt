This film is just lazy. Waste of time and money. The jokes are speculative, the way the characters speak so clich√© and RPG gamers are not as funny as well. The problem is that the authors do not know how an RPG game works and how to make jokes about this game is important. Of course, there are some who have lost the player and lost the player as a whole. But I'm not a ridiculous way to do jokes about this game. There is no feeling of the story. Who asks for how long the game is played? The biggest problem in the film is that the writers and actors did not try to find out about the jokes about it. I am ashamed of this thick film.
