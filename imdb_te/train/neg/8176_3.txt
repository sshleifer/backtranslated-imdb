<br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo", I thought acting was poor and the narrative was limited. <br /> It is designed for 'TV' made for play. At the beginning of the hammering set amount (yes, we get that this is Britain 80 - you can now stop it) is tiresome, and life has given a very unilateral view of life like in Britain 80 - poverty, war, Margaret Thatcher, nothing nothing happened between nothing? In fact, the middle classes already existed - just ordinary working people, with good salaries and mortgages. <br /> <br /> The Falklands clips were added randomly to the end, for "dramatic effect", I thought. <br /> <br /> There was a tad confusing in the order of events, <br /> <br /> Relationships between 'shan' and 'smell' were toe curling. I could not even look at the snogging scene. I believe that she will be attracted to a very young boy, but I believe she is still very young. I know they are only four years old, but there are four years to reach your twenties, but the big difference in your teens! In my experience, teen age difference occurs when a young girl is younger, because girls are very rapidly mature and the wavelength of boys of some years is very high. Sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. <br /> The end is somewhat spontaneously and again. <br /> <br /> If the flag thrown the legend, it fell a bit less in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It is a mistake for me that British films are suffering from upper classes or poverty. Do not get me wrong, I love trainings, and four weddings have its attractions, but did we not come up with something different than Brights? Why our films have always been hung on the class system? I was born in 1973, so in 1982, 'Shan' was not very different. In a city in England I grew up in a parent family in a very few tedded council estates. However, my childhood experiences are very different from what they feature in the film - I do not think racism is a problem (I can not say but I can not say). "What is this England?" Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> I thought I had this movie for the film, I was completely frustrated and disappointed.
