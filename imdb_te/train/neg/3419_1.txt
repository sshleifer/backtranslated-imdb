OK, so Chuck Norris found a way to get this sequel production. I have a question-why? Read this script and say, "The sound is great! I am telling you that this film is not my toilet bowl. In fact, it was the MIA, invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, the tradition of Delta Force, and the other one by Chuck Norris, a man from the same people from some bad people. He does not need a gun many times. It removes the mind as a stupid patriotic journal. Eric, the son of Chuck, is the only person to direct this Norris film. Eric Norris primarily worked on his father's movies and TV shows. Did not strike anyone as it had no direct talent? Moreover, the same person is directing the same hero before ... the characters are just different. If it were to make the country patriotic and cheerful, our country would be far worse than I expected. Hopefully, it will nail in the acting coffin of Chuck Norris.
