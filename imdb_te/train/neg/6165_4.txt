<br /> <br /> Allen goes to his country (somewhere he goes in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - many of his films are typically successful white middle-class mothers. Usually Woody Allen finds anything amusing in the comedy, but here he really comes flat on his face. Even a liner seems to have left him. Truly the plot (bar bits and waste pieces of Shakespeare) - but Allen uses the city to allow a partial spiritual wind, which makes it more intelligent and half-dried. <Br /> It just does not work at any level and just a big bore. The best about the film (along with the final credits) is that bad reviews awaken him and threw a slapdash script and make sure that you do not make your partners entertaining.
