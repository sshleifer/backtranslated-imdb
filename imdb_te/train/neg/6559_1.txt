My girlfriend chose it; As a South African-born and growing African American, I found the film story and the campus completely reliable. If you believe that class and ethnic paralysis are easily and conveniently suspended, all comes from the one who does not know the south of the jungle. Totally absurd !!! I'm wondering how a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actor like Andy McDowell (well know south) to take part in this trash
