I really noticed that the first 50's of Geico releases I found them and also found them to be a bit inclined and amusing, but seriously! What is the best thing these people should get ?! This program sucks! It's a trumpet and looks like a piece of "office" with characters that are disguised as cavemen (I hate you but I know that the "office" did not do it). Okay, I get: We are a crabpy boss who is trying to keep the poor slab just his nose clean and he hates him; Fake intellectuals really only have the knowledge of just working; And dopey wants to accept one, but SO WHAT !!! I worked with these people and found that I was in a real life when I was doing TV ... Seeing those kind of nominees why waste my wallet again once in 1/336? Please call your parents and think about it if you fall on your head to believe in your entertainment.
