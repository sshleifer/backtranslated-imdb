I was a rainy Saturday afternoon of Colombo's fan and it was fun to see Oscar Werner after Ferrinheit 451, but this episode is very small. The original plot and plot turns are clear and the modern detective performances have also been speculated over the years. But it is amusing to look at crazy bed models and "modern" electronics equipment and, of course, fun suburbanite humorous fun at modern art. <br /> <br /> The high-tech home is a jetson or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and it's fun to think of the authors who invented the "way-out gizmos". <br /> If it is outside, the Colombo episodes. However, we should be grateful to Cable TV that these episodes are on air.
