Do they ever do movies that are not nudity and non-sexy? It came at 3:00 pm on Sunday afternoon and I can not believe what they have shown. Thanks to God who is outside my son, I'll freak out if he sees soft / medium sex! Do people who create movies do not care if they are hurt or corrupted? Children look after the church and what have they shown ??? !!! Acting is good and I enjoyed the Suspense but GEE! There are violence and bad people but Western imagery is anticipated. Randy Travis is good in his role. Authors, directors and producers rarely fall into sex scenes. What should happen to get them in that direction? Where can I complain?
