I like the * scary movie. I am a ridiculous fan - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes the most intelligent form of humor. Weanes boys seemed to have realized the real idea of ​​the film, which was temporarily forgotten when the sequel was made. I was the family of Yias' comic manigis. <br /> <br /> Film begins with the promise. I liked the "Exorcist" parody, especially the "Out on, our" gag. Now, it's a wines-quality thing. But, except for that, I laughed up two more times. 1) When Tori spelling is attracted by a spirit in the middle of the night, she begins to talk about marriage. Meanwhile, he said, "It's just a shotgun call!" It's great fun. 2) Chin plays the role of "Save the Last Dance" in the simulation when she moves in the new moves. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure and worse, with less expensive delusions. The jokes are bigger and heavier from the first picture of a subtle or prescribed picture. For example, in Scary Movie I, journalists make many innovations to understand that Ray is homosexual. It's so happy. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-throat scene with Ray under the bed is mind-touchless and very spectacular. The whole model of this film. Shock humor * alone * does not take a picture too far away. Unfortunately, this is the trend in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> If it is rated by the lowest Weiens film, I should give one of the 10 to the 2.
