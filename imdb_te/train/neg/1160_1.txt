This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is the story of a rebel college basketball player, his tough-but-not-fair coach, his girlfriend, and fellow student (played by Michael Margato) with persistent nervous breakdowns. The story goes somewhere, the zero character is developing, there is no one to care for, and performances, except for Bruce Dern as coach, terrible. It is hard to believe that talent like Jack Nicholson can be directed to any awful movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.
