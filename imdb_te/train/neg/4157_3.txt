<br /> <br /> The romantic, horror, suspense, and well thought movie will fail. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny, slow sound effects and bad dubbing in recent years as one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.

In fact, since they do not have a high budget for the film in an extensive space, they are once again in the forest circuit, or the director does not want to distinguish his precious time in the filming <br /> <br /> In fact the director has done a lot of fun, he does not have enough time to hire anytime. Even big enough cast or editor. So he said that he did not want to wear and obscure the cast as the eight people of the cast, and accidentally began sniping at the film reels, saying that he changed his name, "Amendment is not the right thing anyway?" The reason for this "movie" entry into our bag is that it is confused with Freddie vs Jason, and it's strange how it happened. <br /> <br /> "Oh yes we did not laugh at the end, but I will do my best when I lose him wisely ......... ......
