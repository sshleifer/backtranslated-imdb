A few months before the film's release, you have been promoting all kinds of print media, so I am waiting patiently for its video release to learn all the videos. After this ended, I had to apologize to my friend for having occupied the VRR for the past six and a half hours. This will surely fail, because it is a character based image about indescribable characters. With the exception of Amanda Pete (she is only Amanda Pete) you can not stand any of them. The film depends on its speech, such as Sophomoric, Moronic and Crood. Eric, a slightly amusing character, has played the role of a single married member of a group of friends. The last three turns are designed to look at the three main characters, rather than peit towards the petite. On the whole, rent only if you are disappointed or have a dark sense of humor.
