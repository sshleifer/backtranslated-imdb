I can not believe that people think this rubbish pile is funny. Transfer the humor attempts between brutality, disgust and stupidity, leaving a little reason to stay until the end of 'there is something about Mary'. Certainly, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but it is not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller tries very hard to work inside the plot, and is clearly very talented, but the film is lost. <br /> Once scenes are not reliable. The shots ended up badly and were not properly handed. Ferrell brothers should keep away from making films with all the expenses. I will check IMDB to find out what I'm working on. Bonus One time I smiled. It's not like I'm immersed in humor or in my opinion. My wife also hated it. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and we laughed at ourselves. This film is slipping.
