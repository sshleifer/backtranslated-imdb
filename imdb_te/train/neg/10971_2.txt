Irish critics are not so much about this film. All Irish films ending with a regular band of Irish cast. With the terrible script, forced character quirks (wheat sauce). Romanticizing everything bad about Dublin 'Ah's attitude, it's a dump but definitely not all that great'. Tips for the American audience (supermarket owner and his terribly cohesive catchment) are perfectly suited. And the role of nail in the coffin is Ameney's role. A great actor was forced to play this role at the age of five. Dangerous things. Farrell is the best thing about this film, and when you say it's bad. Well, at least he's not putting his terrible American accent. International audience warning: stay at home and watch snatch and lock stack. You have a good time. Entry is outside-outside
