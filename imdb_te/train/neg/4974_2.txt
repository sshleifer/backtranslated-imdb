<br /> <br /> Anybody with access requires e-mail Mel Gibson, and tell him that he needs Beowulf's loyal product. The epic poem, which is the foundation for all modern Western literature, usually has something to do. <br /> <br /> Beowulf's recent (2000's) versions are surprising for two things. First, why is the story so interesting? Secondly, why are the filmmakers cutting off the money for this garbage? <br /> The reason for this is that the version with Lambert (Beowulf 2000) is even worse. br> <br /> If worse, some will see it and get a wrong idea about the poem. In the film, Peter Jackson can get a fairly misleading industry for literary exchange. I really mean, there is a lot of Roman Forum model for the hero. <br /> <br /> And horns on the helmets, please? Leave me alone. This is insulting. <br />
