There is nothing special about the story of corrupt unions on one side and the other "main lawyer". The perfect but unimaginative lighting and photography comes from the fagged out noir wheel. The story was drawn up by Warner Bros. Drawer in the lead role with George Strip. Performances are routine, directional flat, and set dressing perfect. (This poster has a poster, "Post No Bills.") A Portrait Storyteller We Introduce To The Story And Some Characters When Most Unions Work Honestly And Honestly To Improve The Cause Of Their Members, Some are corrupting. But I do not know much about the unions or how they work, although I think they are a fair game after a "waterfront" win a few years ago. Here they are just a peek to hang the story. The real ring leader is a disabled lawyer who runs three or four thugs. The district attorney (or whatever) finds Dana Andrews doing "boomerang" as a wrong guy (Dick Forgian), who has spent almost the rest of the film, the innocence of the foreman. <br /> <br /> If you are a child, He has shown some of the demonstrations that show elsewhere, but here he speaks silently and on the floor. Elisha Cook, Jr., can not afford a good rummy or good drinking. Beverly Garland is ok but she holds herself in a nightclub for her weakness in the direction. The remaining cast is enough for a TV series. <br /> <br /> No one has helped anyone through this work. When a "b girl" was transported through the group of the Philippines Union, she advised her that only someone had to learn a few words of Spanish. "I know only one word," she says, "yes." The audience did not believe in the Spanish language "si" means "yes". The plot is clumsy and there are holes in it. Keith visits a witness in his flat at a night club. He enters the door and moves a gun in his pistol with a pistol, but he sings heavily and kicked him. Then the police ordered the call. <br /> <br /> The scene in the evening night at the club has forgotten about the police, they never forget, or they do not expect anyone. <br /> <br /> It is not a shame, and some people may enjoy it, but such items are better off somewhere.
