This is a ghost story. This is a cannibalistic story. It's a revenge story. A very poor movie with a lot of violence. I think every slasher image you have ever seen is cheap underneath. This is a typical discrete area, with majestic camps, going into the wilderness. Of course, there are some beautiful scenes. It's just dull. Bad Editing and Total Works. They think they're talking in the dustbin. I do not really know how to appoint the seeds and the rules of mental seed. It is also a macro-out scene where one man eats a piece of meat is actually what's left of his wife's. One friend once asked me to show this kind of inappropriate and unhealthy violence. I fear that's another step in our desensitized evolution. Three here are morbidity, tongue in the cheek, just sad waste of time. Very blood; Small plot.
