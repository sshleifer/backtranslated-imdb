Believable muddled, putting off and ultimately ridiculous ("Horses, Oh My God, Horses!") Thriller. It's sometimes creepy, but it's one of the worst scripts written for horror movie. In the last 10 minutes everyone needs to "plan" how to plan "clarity". Blonde shows by Leeds are exceptionally exceptional by Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie more complicated. 0 in 4 stars.
