This image is bad. I'm not only 'bad'; "Oh script bad", or; "Acting in that scene is very bad" ... someone should be wrongly convicted of stealing this grinding pile that is rarely in the unscrupulous masses. If I can refer to it, I do not respect it with the explanation of it (plot ??). In another case of the film I was 40, an image was my spleen. I mean, after all, nobody would go out to make a bad image intentionally, are they? Yes good. Apparently they will ... and guilty man writer / director onlum lummel. But it's the worst blockbars actually rented this for their customers! Give advice. This garbage belongs to it. Postpone on the shelf, collecting dust.
