I saw them back in 2002 (I was the first Saberat - actually one of the most entertaining size-ups in my opinion), and I've seen the original films of the Size-Fi Channel. Their quality varies. Some of them are average but good (Sabertotho, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are quite bad and are really terrible after that. Raptor Planet is next. <br /> <br /> The Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to the 2004 sip-fi channel original Raptor Island, is really a watchful movie of the film with the horror acting and the lazy script writing. The effects of bringing dinosaurs to life (along with a mix of dolls and animatronics, from the Raptor Planet CGI and stock footage) I saw in a low budget movie. Gore's effects are also unreliable. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Right folks, dinosaurs aliens. Dinosaurs in the outer space. What's next, sharks in space?! The remaining plots are linear. The human cast is choosing and eating. By now, we've come to imagine this in many dinosaur films and novels that were released, but the first killer dinosaur film I've ever seen is all the boring dinosaurs. <br /> There are some chuckles though. A person becomes a big raptor after a carnotour (who brought life through stock footage from the original) seconds. In addition, a bit of trivia, from which the first film was shot at Steven Bour and his own death rod. <br /> <br /> Raptor Island is not a good movie to begin with, but it is a wonderful piece of art in comparison with its sequel. <br /> When I say, trust me, this is a very bad movie ever. Make it shine near vague.
