There are a lot of really great horror movies built in the seventies - but this film is definitely not one of them! It's a shame that the child who works sometimes works from a good idea that takes in a couple of successful horror themes. We have a revenge baby idea that worked well in classic movies like The Bad Seed, and then we have a central zombie theme that is the backbone of many successful horror movies. Plot is the main thing: the young woman blames the mass of the people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and takes revenge on the dead (as you do). Except for the fact that it is boring, all is well and good! Most of the film does not happen, and some nice gore does not eventually take off; One end is not enough to support it by sitting on the other side. The films are shot in the budget because the locations are cheap and all the actors are worse. I can not tell you about the whole movie because it is not so big. Child is a tedious seventy horror movie and I definitely do not recommend it.
