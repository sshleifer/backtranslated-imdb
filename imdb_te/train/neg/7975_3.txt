When I was sitting in front of watching this movie, "Oh, Alfred Hitchcock or Brian Depalma could do this work!" Chances are, you will most. It begins with intrigue. The British Park Ranger dweller in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful, laughing black woman (Lisa Jane), who met some time ago in a park. Then, one day she disappears. The police did not find any documentation she had ever existed, and Firath maintained her own search. So far everything is fine. As he left, he turns his friend (Billy Jen) and LA's malicious drugs, nightclubs, and her previous life to make her film debut, after which she is a history of mental instability. At that time, the life of the Firth is in danger, and the film falls apart. None of Lisa Jane's past characters are distant. The picture moves slowly, and there are very few actions. There is no subplot about drug money, but it is just a throwaway. No chases, no cliffhanging scenes, and no suspense. Boring characters have quite a bit blows and a lot of chat. One of the most valuable things is Lisa Jane and Billy Jane's brother and sister, but they are not always in the scene together. By the end of the film, you will be broken between what you have been and what you're thinking of trying to stay awake.
