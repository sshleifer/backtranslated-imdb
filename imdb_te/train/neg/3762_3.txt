I came out of this blockbuster, one of those panels you can get 5 movies for 20 bucks. I said I got my money's worth on this money. I imagined terrible conversation, garbage monsters and moving cameras. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> As you say to me, two are not bad. Or recently I saw very low budget movies recently I lost the angle. Acting is apparently terrible, but most of it is at least high school level level. <br /> <br /> CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second most terrible part. One of the first things I thought (and another reviewer who agreed with me) was a man in a monkey suit. <br /> <br /> I can ask why I think CG is the second worst part. This is because the film's very worst piece sound effects. They are loud, hurt and stable. I'm in camping, I know no insects will sound in the woods overnight, and while they loud, they are not like cockfony in the film. This is a bad thing, usually when the "background" sounds are drowning in the dialogue of the movie, but I've missed out of what I've caught the conversation of this film. <br /> This action is rare and boring. As the letters are corresponding, the tension does not exist. Speaking of the characters, they are all cookie cutter and bland. Only a little engaging byplay is ... actually, I cared nothing. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, cinematography is good for you or both of them than you normally would like to see in this movie. However, this is still a "home movie" quality that you have incorporated into packet changes and prayers. <br /> <br /> If you take a kick from me and a shoe from the shoestring budget genres, think about one in the dollar bin and think about it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
