Serum said about a crazy doctor who found a serum that would cure all diseases through the power of the brain. Instead of creating some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad document brought some jails out and there were some problems. With many scenes you can take many steps to get familiar with the characters. Insane doctor neuron car gets hurt and mad doc attempts to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. It's a Class C movie with no acting but some problems are directed and some continuity errors. There are no more zombie actions in this regard and effects, but there is nothing special. You can move fast through the slopes and open a few scenes scenes. Look for some nudity and bad language.
