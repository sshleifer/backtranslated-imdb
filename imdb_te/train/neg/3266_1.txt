When Ben (Red Fox) worked with his own brother, his wife, Beatrice (Pearl Bailey), went to his son, Norman (Michael Warren) to screw his story - to learn that Norman has a secret lover: a hooker (Tommy Dobson), unfortunately by complaining to him Ben did not take well, including Ben's endeavor to be a watcher There are a number of problems. <br /> In fact, written by Ron Clark and Sam Bacchik, Namman, for the theater. Absolute disaster on the New York stage. In fact, as a community theater production in the 1970s, I have actually seen the play - and no one is undoubtedly blaming the existence of anything else, the cast is very widely proved to be the most entertaining in such a drop-death method. The cast of the film did not do the same. <br /> This is a worse motion picture. Red Fox, one of the most delighted comics of the 20th century, is a worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is far from competing with Phexus as Michael Warren (later influential in the television series Hill Street Blues) <br /> In fact, a guest from Dennis Duggan, Tommy Dobson and Varied Flowers, had no spark - and it was only sinful compared to the remaining sunglasses. <br /> <br /> It is bad, it looks bad. According to the films, this was the first large screen effort to be shot on video tape, which was then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - I believe, it shows. <br /> <br /> The film had a misfortune in the 1970s for Painted Skyline, which saw through Windows in Norman and Gharson's apartments. <br /> <br /> Some movies are very funny, you are not one of them. I can sit my reaction to this picture with two words: miss it. Do not buy it, do not rent, do not touch the 10 feet pole. Slowly slow down and walk like hell. <br /> Gary F.
