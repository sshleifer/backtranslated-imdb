I have to admit that I do not have a very new age mumbo jumbo. When people become "Exchange Energy", I'm always kidding and helping to solve the problem of global warming.

Plots holes and most of them I find absolutely acceptable and fun. If this is the "Celestine Prophecy" case I will not burn this movie, but unfortunately it is not. Each actor is bored from his head and he does not realize what he really is. <br /> <br /> "Direction is also enthusiastic and you can expect another person from what he asks" what dreams can come from? "But hay, I paid a lot for my job And the attitude of the New York Taxi Driver: "This is your money and a friend .."
