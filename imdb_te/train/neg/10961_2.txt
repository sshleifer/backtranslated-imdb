Although the film is "real" for the Lewis book (the script is mainly verbatim, for words), it is impossible to capture the magnificence of this epic story. Mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) * are drawn, and in the previous review, the green-screen flying sequence is very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed at death when I saw human beavers with their huge stiff suits and buck teeth; <br /> <br /> When I was in Wolf's "Howl" - gray mess suit, a man was strongly silent, slightly Lucy Pevensy's ... I was very angry, disappointed and watching the daytime hours movie. The actress, who plays the role of White Witch, seems to be hoping that she'd be more at home on stage, at the stage where a growing voice, spread weapons and Shakespeare are something more than welcome. <br /> The sets are held in places or outer places, and the sets experience claustrophobia. The house, it can cost the BBC $ 100 for building a set, and it is very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together. The White Witch's castle is a runway, with stereophon idols and bad lighting in the decomposed rural English castle. When the penseness circulates in the wild - in fact, any scene in the forest - they seem to be just circular. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks good in the movie is Aslan, but you have probably boosted the overall budget to build the BBC's mechanical cat structure. It starts to speak when it still stands out, but once it starts moving, you can not help the poor people in the back of the lion's suit. <br /> <br /> If you are a hardcore Narnia fan, you may want to see this version, Lewis preserves every word ever written - Lewis is not exactly the hero, while the conversation is on the screen and has a chunky and embarrassing feeling. "Oh, just another thing, Deers, and then we will be ready," the child cries at once and cries and "No, Mrs Beaver, PLEASE!" In the scene where the kids are at Beavers' and ready to flee from wolves. Sighs and moans - the scene of comic relief, so it is not clear (they are not surprised by whether the sewing machine should be packaged), and the disappearance of the play. In fact, the film directed the Fox Pass and filmed the entire film. <br /> I see New Narnia (Disney 2005). With the updated effects, amazing time, and a beautiful and scene-stolen white witch (who plays his role with all the mysterious evil forces of a strained politician, captures all of a shrieking banshee) captures all of Lewis's original focus (I think) Narnia's greatness without removing the bit Rieu phenomenon. Lucie Beaver's (and original size), and Brighty BBC Edmund Divine, Desperate-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Unsafe-and-Atting-In-Inferiority-Complex Edmund New Disney Version Front. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not recommend any film unless you have a waste of time by doing fun with campie movies.
