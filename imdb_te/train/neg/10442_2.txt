Next to all the internet buzz, this movie is a terrifying god. I thought this film should be far worse than anything. Instead filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror film, and they were completely lost. Samuel Jackson has some good parts, and a couple good lines. In addition, it's a little bit of Gore and some poorly animated snakes. Internet joking is miles better than all the original film. The film has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. This piece of hyped trash does not waste your time or money. If you're looking for something funny and fun, then go to snakes on the blog.
