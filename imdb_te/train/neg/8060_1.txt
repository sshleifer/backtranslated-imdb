What a bad, bad image! I tried watching fast without forwarding ... it failed. About 30 minutes later I stopped the movie, and went on online to see how the disaster could be. (Just 84 minutes, Whew!) It's a confusing, boring image. I do not think I got off by someone falling too low with a fluorescent bulb! One funny thing is that I saw the film's killer cut version. That box was boldly "more blood!" "More Sex!" "More Than the Theater Release!" Boo! If the film is awful all those arguments, how slow is the "i-killer cut"? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the Dead World's The World of the Living Dead Series!
