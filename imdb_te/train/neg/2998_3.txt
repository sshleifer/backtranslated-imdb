Die-Hard Judy is for Garland fans only. She has two (2) numbers that are very good - she is an old cleaning woman (you've seen all the pics), and at the very end is one where the number with a pretty good number makes. There are scenes where the lines are funny. But, basically, the script is very bad and the film was planted which is not worse than the fear at the scene. But the image rent is worth 2.50 - just prepare to advance faster.
