When Hey! First it was in 1996, I saw it. This is one of my favorite shows. Then I got tired of waiting for new episodes and then stopped looking at it so that the same episodes started showing up over and over again. I was surprised when I heard about Ernard! This is a feature film that has not gained much popularity among some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons, such as the SPBbob Square Squares. Whatever it is, it's not good to do anything, I've seen the film anyway. I'm going to the theater, I do not expect much. I thought it was a dumb movie version of the children's cartoon, like the Russes movie. I guess I guess. It's a dumb and kidding movie. There are some good episodes out there and there, but for the most part, the film is a stinker. Just for kids.
