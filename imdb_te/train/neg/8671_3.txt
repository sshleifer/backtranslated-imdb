I saw this film on March 21 this year. Do not despair. Better than "Tridev". Plat Hackned. Tell him about his father, his wife and his younger brother. The movie opens when he saves the bride. Anyway. Azhagar Jhurahad makes a plot to kill his younger brother. He sends some people out and makes a plan. They come to a school where they are friends of friends. Kill his baby. His father throws him out of the house. He then returns to Akash. Sunny has acted well, and Chunky is suffering greatly, and Naseeruddin gets wasted. Divya did well, Sonam was ruined, Jyotsnah was wasted but looked pretty. The film is very beautiful. His role was to kill him. The girl is beautiful but hurt. His kid is good.All good.Keron is adequate.Arrish and Gulshan did good. Cinematography is in India and Kenya. The script is weak but there are some good dialogues. It also drags the same. The film is beautiful. The song's song "Sat Sunur" is a good song. Do not forget other songs. Rating -3 / 10
