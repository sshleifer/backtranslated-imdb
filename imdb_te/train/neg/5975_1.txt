Never thought of watching this film, one day I saw joke how bad I was. My ancestors have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> For starters I would like to ask film politics. It is hiding in the town behind the women's mask. But the only way women can make bigger is to use their sexuality rather than their sexuality or their skills. These women are not more who are Worse. Do not allow a little less attractive girls to succeed? It's not the only right-wing message of the film, with hundreds of shots with American flags and heavy jewelry. The single most powerful thing in America is the lack of capitalism and the spiritual, moral or artistic value of the film. <br /> <br /> The manager of the bar does not allow drug bar in his bar, and then she goes to the gorgeous garage of her drugs. Her own neck and then her staff and customers' necks. <br /> A person familiar with drugs is more dangerous than heroin and is more dangerous than illegal drugs. Finally, the main character's scenes are sexually interested in audiences (when she is without clothes or with her boyfriend) her dad ever participating? As she is a phone to her father, let's see her cloth with the camera as she washed her legs with her legs. Her 'auction' as her dad is just her 'auction' as her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is disrespectful and apparently disrespectful to the immoral, fascistic, women. But what about Jerry Bickimirmer?
