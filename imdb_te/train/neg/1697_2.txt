I have a fan of David Lynch and he has everything in the DVD except the Hotel Room & 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. So, when I learned about this, I immediately caught it ... and ... what is this? It is a bunch of black and white cartoons that are crisp and crudely drawn to the foul thing and unfunny. Perhaps I do not know what's good, but it's just a worst group that people are trying to get on with people named David Lynch to make some bucks. I do not care about the foul language, but let me clarify that having my neighbors needs to adjust the sound. All of this is the most frustrating release in all and may just be left out in the deluxe box set out of curiosity. I highly recommend this does not cost your money. 10 to 2.
