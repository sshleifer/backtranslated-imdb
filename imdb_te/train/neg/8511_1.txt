I can not find my life, follow, find or understand the story. It is also incomprehensible when the plot is growing. I'm going to guess and never say a prediction story / plot is a problem. Producers can not distinguish many details, the novel, or any novel, having time and place to create a different idea, about a serial killer and the police's killer's depiction of the killer. There were a lot of things in the limits of the film they were forbidden. They are really bad because they are a solid cast, a contingent around the contents of the surrounding and a cinematographer who knows how wonderful cinematography is. In fact, a well-made film can be enjoyed and relaxed for a couple of hours.
