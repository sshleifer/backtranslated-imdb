I will keep a review of this program as little as possible. Skip. Low budget, not funny, lousy script. The writing is not too bad acting, but still bad. Everything you need to know, but I continue to write more than I need. <br /> <br /> It is a film with three sections, each of which is ridiculous of some other kind of film. The same movie with the same idea is the most ridiculous movie "Cinema Movie," with George C. Scott. Very vague, but worth looking for. <br /> <br /> MM in the 1930s Paraded films, and it was elegant, delicate and dry. <br /> <br /> This film is not made. It was ridiculously filmed in the late 70s and early 80's, all three of the films, I was just as loud as I ever heard. First, I guess, "Kramer vs. Kramer," is a parody. Peter Rigert is best with his Dirt poor script. Secondly, parody, of course, I do not know what ... a Daniel's steel novel? I mean, you can watch this story on Lifetime TV, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember the 70s, I was there. It's a soap-opera type simulator about a sleeping young man to come to power. <br /> <br /> In the third section, "Munichipalians," it is close to the funniest movies. I have identified "The New Centuries" and some of the "Dirty Harry" items, about two of them when they were created. Yes, nice and current. Richard Widmark plays an ideal young rookie (over-the-top wimpy) played by Richard Widmark, who drinks whiskey while sitting in a police car, he booze in a police car! irreverent!) Note that this was the first film after "Animal House", which added the name "National Lampoon". Wow. In the five years since the classic film, the dung goes to this file and is not surprising. For a long time, I slowly slide into the worst world to sell and start the American comedy, which is the most cutting-edge and original voices in the American comedy (which is the original magazine in its first 10 years, and it's low-budget "comedy" Brand name only. Another reason why capitalism (and cocaine) occurs is very painful. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is a serious time. Do not waste your 90 minutes. I need my back. On the positive side, Fred Willard is it!
