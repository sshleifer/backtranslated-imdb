Looking at the romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about a lovely hippie (Keene Lennz) and a romantic relationship between a Los Angeles real estate agent (William Holden, surprisingly friendly in this high-fiction arrangement) in his Golden Years. The script is not a bit but a few thoughtful passages; Still, this illustration is now a middle-aged clich√©, the film is a lot of inspiration. It may have a better job with different leaders: Holden and Lennes are not very well matched (her stature is so small as he builds her), their closest scenes are less confusing than just inconvenience. Dated, vague-romantic, and largely unmemorable. ** from **
