Almost every detail of the hypnosis story of a horrific brutal and callous "hero" that destroyed a nasty king - this sword - is worthless. Acting is terrible since it leads to supporting roles. The glowing glowing director, directed by the director, is looking at the blood of the blood around the blood of the whole blood; He was not redeemed by any kind of justice in his struggle, because he was as bad as he was. <br /> <br /> In this film, a movie has a scene called "Dies". <br /> <br /> The film is ladies Leeds, Barbie Benton Lana Clarkson, the nude of the film. A 20-something male, I do not pretend that the male flesh on the screen does not attract me. <br /> <br /> The treatment of their characters is very insulting and sex scenes are not very common and happy because I can not enjoy this aspect of this character. <br /> <br /> Most cheesy movies in this era have at least been redeemed by a lightweight, tongue-cheek feel (the sequel is good), but DEATHSTALKER seems to be taken as a completely heroic fantasy. There is no chance! <br /> <br /> ****
