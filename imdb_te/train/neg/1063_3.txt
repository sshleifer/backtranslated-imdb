The idea was good. It's great to bring in so many stars in a movie. But ... many stories are too small and are in no sense. There is no connection between the scenes. There are some 3-4 wonderful stories ... but they are over 18. "All the unborn babies" read me - a movie I like the most. Compared with that, "Paris GTAM" does not have a witty short story, it develops - starts and ends. And there is no way for children to meet. I did not find Paris enough as an item to combine 18 small sketches together. Perhaps it's interesting for people who know Paris. Otherwise, I would not recommend ...
