Cybill Richards directs another full moon / surrender romantic cinema work. This time, Jackville Lowell (wearing silver clothes) will be punished for destroying all evidence of sexual activity. But she does not stop seeing tapes, she likes them. Sexual scenes are well filmed and are set to excellent soundtrack (for at least this kind of image). Actors are more alarmingly and primarily looking to average. Jacqueline Lowell is her exceptionally attractive self and she is among the secrets to reveal her chest and to look at the sex files crumbling down a bit below. She also fits a little lesbian activity. Lowell is more deserving than this type of fare to be honest. Here she is very naked, but in fact she plays a 'drama' in her silver attire. Fully rubbish cinematic and soundtrack with Lowell is the only true rimmoning features. Median for the Sargers output and they have a new budget for them.
