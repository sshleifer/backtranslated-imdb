The movie is a part of the "demons" rump-off of "ghosts" and is the only thing worth watching the movie. The performance is terrible and accelerates the action scenes, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> If you think this film is good, you can not see the real horror movie, skip it and get a copy of the movie monsters.
