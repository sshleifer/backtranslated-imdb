If you are between 10 and 14 years (excluding R rating), there are very few things you might like here. One or two lines from Kenyon Thompson, David Koichner (we see him more) and Sam Jackson's jokes and Juliana Maguel's good to be able to consider her surroundings, but this is a sin. Poor plots. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. Special effects are tedious. Until the whole situation is a strange and awful joke, the embedded conditions are equally terrible. If we consider the parts of action, there are some unbelievable action scenes in some of the films that make you stronger and you are a few who groan. This is the second type of film. It's a little bit left. <br /> I'm no pleasure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I read and thought about the hype. I have no expectations, but somewhat concerned. Still, as the train wreck, just can not get away. And without any expectations, I was let down. Bad. Even 'very bad, it's fine'. <br /> <br /> Not at all, CGI is in the same company on the battlefield. Earth, Little Man and Gigli. It shows me how the 7.2 is now fully diagnosed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone,
