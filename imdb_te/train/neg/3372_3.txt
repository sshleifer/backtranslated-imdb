The light shadow, director of a great musical, Richard Attenborough, completely misses a piece of music, "opens", and makes the thrill mask of the play. The show speaks of dancers' audit for a job in the B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work on this demand and always-reward work. Attenborough will give us a fresh face as a group of "Gypsies" lifestyle performances, promising the gleeter mix of the characters created on stage rather than trying to get their "big break" in the show business, along with new couples. The film has an advantage over the play and it has an early sequence showing the size of initial audition and showing the true level of capture up to 16/17 in the line (how do you calculate, line in the image). Anyone caught by the local civilian light opera production of the game has a much richer experience than watching this poor feeling.
