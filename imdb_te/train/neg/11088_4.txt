<br /> <br /> The story relies on realistic events, which actually restricts the work that no one can do, and there is no real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is believable in the lead role but he is sleeping through it and does not have any acting muscles for actor or assistant actors. <br /> <br /> The story just drops a small flat, never heard of the title role, but it does not have this emotional effect other than such films of injustice, you are more educated about him and his outside motivations <br /> < br> Who is the carter who reveals the worshiper's worship, but it's feasible. <br /> <br /> It is okay cinema but instantly memorable.
