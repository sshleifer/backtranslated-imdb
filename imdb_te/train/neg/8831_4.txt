Many people have heard about the film and I want to take it forward. Apart from being very slow, I do not mind worth waiting for a long time, but it is not. As many have said that there are so many inequalities, the film is not very real. 4 men react to shock, swimming and horror, to catch up with the fish, they catch fish. If they are kind of men who are happily fishing, then they just reported the body and they only discovered after their fishing trip .... Why tie a tree body on the ground, go fishing and then tell everyone that you have found the body 2 days earlier? Knowing that the behavior of the main characters is not as unequal is to watch the movie. The rest of the urban areas, well you'd think might show some curiosity about killing at least one woman! The body is nothing but naked except nakars ... which scenario leads to that? Why is she still punishing why she is raping? If she is raped with her clothes, then why remove them from the knickers bar? If she was sexually assaulted, why would she have to catch all of her clothes? I can not really think of any realistic scenario that can lead to other than killing someone to steal their clothes so your sieve sale can fill the stall! Oh it's watchful but just just and only, despite poor script, acting is strong.
