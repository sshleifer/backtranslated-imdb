Wow! I saw this trailer and said 'me, this is not for me'. During the trailer I saw the faces of my husband and our friend and knew it was a 'boy movie'. I mean, hello! <br /> After that, I started watching, it was not so bad. I'm watching. I finally saw it. What a wonderful picture. If anything, this is a chic-flick. These girls have the attitude. It's really a feel-good movie, and a bit of a love story. <br /> <br /> Mainly, the story of a small urban girl, which became bigger in the city after it went through the big city c ** p. There are some of these, it is almost a new urban myth. But it can think of your life, and what you have achieved. Well, me anyway. I know a lot of work in a bar case, I know it, but most people know me. Trailers for this do not believe - aiming to bring it in.
