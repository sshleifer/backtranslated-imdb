In the days prior to Toxic Avenger, low-camp kings in the Troma films tried to take a high (ok, somewhat lower) road that directly produces ready-made jams. <br /> <br /> I see the results here to persuade them to give up all the performances and move on to self-consciousness. <br /> <br /> Another movie for the masochists in the press is the university. As it wanders through two different actors and countless nonsense subtleties, it really becomes painful to see. <br /> <br /> After learning that a dangerous psychologist has escaped from a local hospital, action goes to a Catholic university (I do not recall the name, but let's call it the title, saint publish). Students argue with slackers, together with countless and selves, and one who spend their time. Meanwhile, the new professor, Julie Parker, was completely ineffective at her job. Children avoid relationships, disbelief, unwanted pregnancies, plight of priests, and how to work without doing anything; A creepy boyfriend, strict administration in the St. Pipe, unmarried mothers, and her students' gaps, expressions. Which of these is not a hole or is solved in any meaningful way. Oh, and every time, a POV shot will come and kill one of the girls, but it will not wait for your breath. There was a red herring killer, and an anticyclonic confrontation with a real killer, which returned to shelter and roll credits. <br /> <br /> Slow speed and many inner subdivisions assisted nearly mounting audience with the disappointing, choppy editing, coffee-sound quality, and the lack of any conceptual dialogue. And the most unacceptable thing about this film is the killer's stabilization of women - the men are just deserving of the film. I paid good money to see someone jerk with lunkhead Lothario who was fooling around with a pregnant girlfriend, or his girlfriend roommate, or creepy priests. There is no justice.
