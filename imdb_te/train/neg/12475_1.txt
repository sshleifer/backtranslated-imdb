I do not come out of a movie theater except in this movie. It's not, but I'm with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An unpleasant plot, clay rods, violence without any point. I did not care when good people died; I did not care if bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic liver pudding is stuck on the thick and there is no reasonability. If you spend an eternity in hell, fine entertainment.
