In theory, the movies should be fun. This excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film making; Most movies, especially genres, are not just telling the story or the message, they want to share their target audience somewhat. In my opinion a bad image is not a film with low production values ​​or low budget, this is a bad film that is boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborne" or "Asylum Diamond", this is not just a bad movie, because it's not just boring and tiresome. Although it is a very good sphere, it is only slightly less developed and moderate performance improves. The film may be fine or classic B-movie in another hands, but here it is just a bad effort in the making of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stacy), a young psychiatrist, who had his dream job at St Andrew Mental Hospital; But the old shelter looks secret. Following the rumors of some of the patients' mysterious death and steadfast rhetoric, James decides to find out what is going on; The bishop believes that he is going mad for his patients only to find the incredible experience of his employer Dr McCarth (Bruce Payne). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In an attempt to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way and makes the film filled with every click of the genre. However, all the great movies are filled with clichés; But in "Hellburn" each one is ruined and became a cheap jump scare to keep things moving as a result of a boring and predictable storyline. <br /> <br /> Most of the performance is mediocre, the big exception: Bruce Payne gives the best linear performance, the film does not see good performance. Matt Stacy is very weak in the lead role and the rest of the cast makes unforgettable appearances. <br /> If there are all these errors, write a thing about "Hellborn"; It has a good visual look for the budget and is equivalent to the modern day big budget Hollywood "horror" productions. Also, makeup and prosthetics are very nicely done and the models for the main antagonist are very good. <br /> <br /> "The rest of the special effects are awful and old, with a huge contrast with make-up & prosthetics. <br /> <br />" Hellborn "is a terrible consequence of its serious defects Hardcore Horror or B-Movie Fans may be interested in its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience
