This is probably one of the worst pictures I've ever seen, everything about it is weak and absurd. Acting has been abused, the costumes are also rising and the story does not exist. This "poverty line" sword and adventure film "Beastmaster" and "Canon" is intended to capture some of the achievements of happiness, but it does not give us any reason to follow. The main character is soft and dull, he can not even fight with a knife and the knife is from the 16th century. All action sequences are slow and unrealistic, and do not specify the terrifying dating music while riding a castle and horse. Do not even bother with this trash.
