Earlier today I complained about many modern films. I encountered a lot of interesting things: "Development of character in new films is not very useful, it's not good or interesting." In the film (s), many topics, sometimes with general special effects and plat-hain hollywood trash like War of the Worlds, but over-the-top, unpleasant attempts to reintroduce social commentary and "art" into the film This can cause movies such as a disappointing fight and Dog Days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do with my life. I closed the movie 45 minutes, which was 30 minutes longer than I actually had. I did not like any characters and found nothing substantial beyond the thin veil of accurate Paschimism. In an effort to say anything about community spots, the film is a lighter, self-diagnostic, common, and exploitative in a very serious sense. In fact, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same topic, but are actually very good movies about depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Repeatable) that have characters of great emotional depth, personality. Dog Days have more people than an eighth graphter's bizarre for society, and people actually choose to ignore any real intelligence and instead choose to be a dull, awful, and disappointing and unrealistic effort in the work of "art". It is not the role of unknown or intelligent observation in the drowsiness of society, it's just boring and nothing is valuable.
