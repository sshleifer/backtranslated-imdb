Many things are clear when watching this film: 1) Acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Cruson, while the parent-child controversy boundaries were soap opera-ish. The other two boys: An overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I'm-a babe-non-I-really-sensual-blonde blonde DreamBot; 2) The whole movie is disappointing and frustrating; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are upsetting (starring Tom Hanks); 4) Initially the love of the romantic heroes was an odd choice ("We are all special friends"); 5) Unreal lines and side plots did not make good through terrible acting; And 5) It's a bad image. Suppose you are discouraged - and maybe distorted.
