Honestly, I was frustrated with "expiration date." Super intelligent title and interesting mantle, but I do not think it's delivered. What about it? The main character's desire to reconnect with his native origins? Or he needed to overcome his fears of death. However, he did not set up his life for fear - his life seemed fine, but now he is worried that doomsday is approaching. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not have the necessities of a combined elaborate story. They simply run their character in parallel to the main character. Moreover, acting as a "curse" is more coincidental. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why is he thinking of staying in his apartment on his birthday? That's my criticism, but I love Seattle's shots, cinematography is beautiful, acting is not that unusual.
