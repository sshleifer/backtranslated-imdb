I ordered too high expectations in this very rare and overdraft film eB. I paid 50 dollars for this film. As an eternal fan of horror, from cheesy 80 slasers to European zombie movies, I said I was a great man! I can not tell you how wrong it is. First of all, I actually felt pretty much gorier than it was. I heard about this film, I was scared to see it. The killings are boring. Acting ... forget, no acting! The story, if we do not care, is very bad. It seems they tried to get your attention to some weird sexual scenes and nude girls, but unfortunately in this case it does not help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere, and the worst thing about this film. It's not exactly the same as A to B. Do not make any effort to get your hands on it, even if it's very fun and fun to watch your friends and beer. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching the Necro files!
