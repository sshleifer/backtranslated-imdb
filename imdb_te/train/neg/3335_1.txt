The Cannon Movie Tale is very bad, and there is a positive proof that a five minute story is not a full-length film. Poor Sid is a fruitful emperor, stupid to look, it's hard to see him. As a sly tailor, Robert Morse charm does not have an ounce. His unscrupulous nephew (Jason Carter) is not "terrible" and "slow" in the plot down. The direction is not practical, and the supporting roles are very low. Lisette Anthony is the daughter of the Emperor's daughter, but her voice is clearly a function of small players, for some reason. And the image crawls at a snails speed. Hans Christian Andersen took a little bit of turn in his grave. It's honest, at least in this movie story, it's no surprise that the video went directly to Oblivion.
