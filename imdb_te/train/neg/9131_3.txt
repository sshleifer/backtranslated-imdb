<br /> <br /> Some time ago, I saw six films in a row ... Boris Karloff, and 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both directed (and I use the loose word) Jess Franco, are damned. <br /> <br /> At the time, I've dropped out of this, in some ways, it's pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> I saw it very well. Never again. What do you know about the worst picture? S ***'s really well made piece. And that's what it feeds into the kitchen. This is a very beautiful picture. <br /> <br /> And, obviously, one of the worst works in film history, good product design, sets, costumes, music, photography, compilation, good actors ... !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the film is fraudulent ... it can be wrong for a good image. And then they started singing "Foo Happy Birthday" ... and it goes downhill. Burt Kwouk (his owner, "your face is familiar") accidentally fu's niche Vitte is close to funny, they have to throw out the fire, to torment, to burst and remove one of his ears. It's like someone decided to do a "campie" movie - it's ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, IT ... FUNNY ... That's not it. <br /> <br /> It is obvious in the very first minute that it has been investigated in the Phu Manchu series to get the most "right". With a different script - really funny one, or a dead serioous one, they might have - would have - had a classic in their hands. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco is a movie made to forget the horrors of aggression ... not comparable with the likes and artifacts. <br /> <br /> The total number of classic 30's characters in the late '70s has been revived in horror films worldwide. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, Dock Savage. I'm not sure, this might be the worst. It should not move rapidly on the entire scenes in CD Caesar (the cousin of FBI chief Al Capone - is I looking at my intention?). It's not just the ideas in the movie are not funny ... they often make any senses. We shut down when they see "audition" police officers as king and queen and "audition" dance-hall routines such as songs, dance and unicycle riding. How much do the authors of the matter have to take this matter to understand how many drugs are these? <br /> As I mentioned, the shame is ... and Peter Sellers (starring both Fu and Nailland Smith), Burt Quack (Chris Lee Foo film in his time), Helen Mirren (surprisingly a police woman falling in love with the villain and Last half an hour near dense close!). Did I have a "right" Fu Man movie or fans should adhere to Carloof to be almost the same person?
