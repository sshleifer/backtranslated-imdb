Hello, did anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: Fans! This film is very unpredictably bad, and I can not stop laughing when it looks. I must see, it's sad in a good way. Every clich√© invented so far for a horror movie can be found here. I was scared that it was very difficult to get a copy of this film, but it should be in the Top 10 of the worst films ever made.
