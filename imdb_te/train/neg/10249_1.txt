What can I say about this movie than "never seen it"? I waited to wait and some people (or anything) did happen and did not get it. Look great at two people walking when setting a record of the most filler screen in a movie. What are they doing? Can they solve a mystery? Do they collect evidence? Perhaps, it's just hard to say. In the end, after the radio signals became too decoded (on some PET monitor) and after the man gave some lectures, the plot was finally revealed and threw as quickly as possible. Some aliens would like to regain their own world utopias and they want to blow up the ground (I do not want to share wealth). My guess they finished filming and saw their 35-minute work or art (crap!) And they decided to let the editing crew be able to change an 88-minute feature film. Look at your own danger, it's too bad, because it's not even funny, it's just bad.
