It's a bad movie, there seems to be only 5 people in HK, who do not use a gun and it treats me as the image of Jackie Chan. They used to refer only to their guns. When they finally use their guns, they will kill each other, no funny movie. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the film also goes to the story and goes there and bored. But if you want to see a bloody picture, I think it's just a kind of film,
