This is a bad image. I laughed once or twice, and the story sucks! Probably there is a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. <br /> <br /> By the whole movie, I'm waking up when I'm sleeping and ending. <br /> No one is human, everyone is stupid and laughable. Rob Schneider does not have to pay to see me as an animal. It's fun, but the bottom line: You do not have to struggle with a lot of difficulties and stupid movies. <br /> <br /> When I end it, I'm surprised, picture. Initially we thought it was better; But it will be worse. Stupid, until the end. I walked out of the theater and will forever reminisce the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the author and co-producer The Simpsons TV writer, but it's the Simpsons film sucks !!!)
