Generally there is no problem with gratitude in movies, but it really bothers me. The criterion they made is the same. For the whole movie. (And, as someone said, cancer) it's boring, roughing and pretentious. If i are you <br /> <br /> I think many people who love my life will notice. I love the Drink-Man Woman, and that is all that the Taiwanese people would have to lead their lives into a load. But I have to do with them. I never met the promoters like 'actors' in the film and I worked on the construction site. So go figure. William H. Maki told me that he had killed me. Once. <br /> <br /> Avoid, unless you enjoy the tadium.
