Johnny Rivers' last song about this film is only great. Unfortunately, it is all that I can say about this Western film. 8 more lines to write to my comments, but there are more than 8 lines in this Western. I'm not sure if the film is a tribute to Hope Along or a spoof. The hero and villain in this movie are very plastic. Not realistic. Many of the supporting actors in the film seemed to be authentic, but shooting scenes were joking. A previous commentator thought this film was great, and the comments took a short shot at President Bush. It's not democratic or republican Western. It's a commercially sold movie. I wondered if I made any money. Sometimes I wanted to look at the film by college filmmakers. If it's the case, it's a great movie.
