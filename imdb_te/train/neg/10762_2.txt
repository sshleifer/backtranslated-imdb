It inspired me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake I did. This film is tedious, astounding, and boring. The conversation between the young priest and his uncle was particularly poorly written and distributed; I scratched in every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper performs some lesser performances and has his general confusion; His character is clearly not a stretch for him. And although the film is set in Puerto Rico, it feels like a lot of Hollywood movie; All the main characters are Caucasian and many fake-Irish tunes speak English. Odd. However, if you see it on your local video store's shelf, keep walking.
