Jack Frost is not a warm-hearted family film about the father who comes back from dead in the form of snow man. It is about a ruthless killer named Jack Frost, sprayed with some acid fluid, and a killer ice man. I have been holding a copy of the film, so I'll sit down and laugh at it. A killer snow man? Haha, it sounds like a perfect comedy / horror movie! <br /> <br /> When Jack Frost is about to kill a truck carrying a truck to jail, he can hang in a chair at midnight. But it's a snowy night and it gets stuck with a government tanker carrying a new DNN fluid. Jack escapes to kill a killer snowman with acid and morphs. He will soon return to Snowmont, a small town with a sheriff caught. Here he is ready to kill again, now as a snowman with snowy forces. He is compressed in water and can shoot ice cycles as spears and killer fangs. The only question is, who can stop frost? The film is under the typical B-movie line. Movies start with cheesy but soon after being shot by Jack Acid, it quickly drops down the cheese line and goes flat. A performance is terrible! We can not work here, we have a full cast of casting cast, but there is a nonsense character or some extra bucks. Scott MacDonald, who played the role of Jack, is only a good actor. He appeared with Young Richard Kyle Frankenstein. His performance of sin decreases to just three minutes and we see him all his new snow man form and his brilliant fracture voice. Plus his wisecracks are anything but funny. <br /> <br /> Plots are awful! There are many murderers throughout history. A killer with a hockey mask, a killer with a racer glove, a chain moron, a quick saint Bernard, but now we are in a hollow killer ice man? Oh come on! And the characters are terrible so as to introduce. For one I really wanted to kill Jack Sheriff's son, I mean giving their father oats Antifreeze among those so they can not freeze? All the characters are dumb and meaning and deaths are cartoony. <br /> <br /> A woman in the stomach with Christmas lamps and her head smashed into a decorative box and died in a girl's shower (where is the carrot in the scene?) <br /> <br /> This terrible film has special effects. The first big special effect we have is to combine Jack's DNA with ice and the kids are terrible. I mean the look of a 60's art, PU's fashion looks! Jack looks as fake as well. He looks like a man covered with a rubber ice man. All the blood and gore cheesy and the film does not have greatness, but instead bends to a low level. <br /> <br /> Jack Frost is one of the most deadly stories ever made. I thought it was a riot. It does not try to be funny and it really tries to be scary. Jack Frost gets 10 to 4, which at least made me laugh out of it's awful. Do not worry with this trash. Jack Frost = D +
