Could Martin Scorsese remade this film? And can he just remake it, can it completely destroy it? Robert DeNiro (the character played by him, and most of it) plays the role of Hollywood (and Mr. Scorsese) as a fraudulent attitude and inspiring the writer's view that the best way to make a character insane is to have a crucifix tattoo on his back. However, this film is awful. <br /> <br />
