I saw this film in 1979 with a friend in a dollar theater (after ticket was sold for $ 1). This is the only film I have ever run (with my friend, idiot "laser bra 2000" sketch is on the screen). Clearly, the image of my and my friend reaction is a simple one. It does not detect the film i am alert (aged 18 or so), but it is foolish and intuitive alongside an unexpected joke that does not make Ed Wood's film worth watching. The real reason why NBB's directorial refusal to understand Mike's "vision" is that it is not surprising that the movie is "not allowing 10 worst films of all time" This is definitely mine, you have been warned.
