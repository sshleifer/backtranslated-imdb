Universal Solzer: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, that honor must go to a movie that attempts to do some sort of ad or attempt to achieve some artistic designs, but it turns out to be curious or objectionable. However, the film I have not seen so far has been very little and has been successful since the universal solzer: The Return. <br /> <br /> The film is a science fiction / action tresty. Acting was so bad in the film I saw. The plot is terrible and predictable. Special effects are curious. In short, anyone who is connected to the film remotely must be ashamed. US: The Return Wan dime fare is seen as sensational motion picture artworks. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Trust me when I say it's not one of them. I'm not sure what to say here. I suspect that many people are thinking that this film is not already seen, but in this case: no.
