In the early credits 30 seconds, I have this feeling that this is going to be a bad movie, but I do not know how bad it is. The actor who plays bad nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide to make the volume down, make our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD, for this film to survive. But it did not help. By the way we turned it off. Now, there are a few films that Bates can save, even though I've lived through some very bad pictures of mystery science theater 3000 and the assistant of "Senggule". They believed that the people who had a lot of sadness gave me a great deal of fun. I guess they all were hypnotized into death, then hypnotized themselves into rotting themselves. "Bit moon from outer space."
