It's always like Dracula's serials on the side of Dracula, like the Dracula films, which disappoints me at the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to be a vampire or not, I would like to see something in the first film that fights against his master minion. The priest or D. It is much more interesting (since you can almost imagine how the story goes) than winning the game (we need some surprising plot!).
