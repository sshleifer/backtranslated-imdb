As other reviewers have said, the film will die in the last 1/2 hour. But before that, she faces imaginative and predictable performance by Kate Coppas who has not found every scene in her character and ruins. Canary is fine as Finnerborn, but with the impulsive feel used to influence the scenes that completely replace the truth. And the end is just bizarre. Motion picture producers know clearly when they have this chaos as they have a sweet potato and pumpkin on a pumpkin feast. With each small jump, the orchestra, it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of the main league's bad image it's one to see, otherwise it will skip.
