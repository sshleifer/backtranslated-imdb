Unfortunately I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the movie theater to see this depth picture. <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnical Off View: While most of it happens in American films, the writer feels himself expert. After learning about 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing the names of cuneiform and other foods can not understand a culture. For example, shaving is a sign of clean life in Asia but everyone is trying to stop the girl to stop that. The Lebanese people are Christian (ok they've got) and their cultural forms and beliefs and practices are different from other Arab countries. The main difference between East and Western culture is that we can not make ethanocentric. Hence their first question about our life is not judging all the people. <br /> <br /> A girl sex revolution: Numerous people have nothing to do with this. <br /> <br /> 10 girls show me that they are on their sexual awakening rather than say that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers encouraged the film in black humor mode. Please see Dr. Stranjalove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor reflects the truth and focuses the audience on the funny parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film?
