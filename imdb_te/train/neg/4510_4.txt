I love a Geisha Memories so I read the book twice; One of the best books I read last year. I was confident that I was waiting for the film and reading the book would be able to ruin the joy of the film. I did not expect this movie to be bad. Some of the best part of the book was dropped out of the film and the characters Hatsummo (Le Gong) were worse, which was even worse. If I read the book, this film is a bit confusing and different. The plot's outline of the film "Nitata Seyrey reveals how she overcame her fishing ...". Forget the movie and read the book.
