In the past 20 years, the majority of UK British paintings are poverty and our youth can not survive the prospects of good life while living in the streets of British towns. The British film industry is engaged in the idea of ​​'broken Britain'. Trains spotting, Brighton from England, Kidlutt, Football Factory, Case and From London. <br /> <br /> Bullet Boy is just another British film included in the list. The main character expresses a desire to go straight, he takes firearms and hangs with dead beats struggling with nothing to the gang members. He wanted me to go straight because I had nothing to stop doing an education or commerce. In fact, if we had a straight course, we would have sucked fresh air and had a role that changed his life. Instead he spent his time trying to murder his friend. At the end of the film, another young man was sad because I was not sympathetic because in the beginning I liked the whole family and their desire for success. I believe that I am a great opportunity to show the world those who are ready to win the winners (like Happiness Pursuit). <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film is that I want to try and paint its true realistic picture of how life for black teens living in Britain's labor groups but do we already have enough movies in the UK enough? <br /> <br /> Does this talented producers and writers give some time to the British young people to show a blessing to them and show them a better life? <br /> <br /> I would like to make bullet boy producers a success with film shock factors (such as Kidluthead, Football Factory), and at the same time the film offers a long list of British films that are effectively dull and discouraging. There is no happiness for this film or others I mentioned.
