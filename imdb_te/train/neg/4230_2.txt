Well, I love B movies ... I know B films should be represented. But it's just awful. I'm amazed I got a good overall score. The only ransom features of this film (mostly) are marginal publish effects. <br /> <br /> The scarcity in the film is getting better, but the slightest influences (such as the "anal" probe ... are great! Shot in the camcorder C'mon - at least one <br /> <br /> Acting - sucks! But it is not the way to the Troma or the Full Moon. <br /> <br /> The story - contrived! What you get from movies like this is too loose! <br /> Set <br /> <br /> My 16 - year - old brother makes our home more elaborate sets for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dabbing and dialog - sucks! Terrible voice acting (I can not even call acting) And every other word is "S **" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> Good classic and B rated horror / splatter there flicks and they are not that difficult to track down. Make it suitable!
