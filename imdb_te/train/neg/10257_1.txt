Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, MacDonald Carey, Lev Ayers - solid b-film actors made the film a great deal. But this reduction of the film did not use them any purpose, no one of their characters ever met on the screen (Christopher Lee prefers to play himself in several scenes). <br /> <br /> In this film the aliens will change at a hat drop inspired. First, they change their mainstream by releasing a crucial part of their ship by handing over their ship and killing most of their friends and leaving their wife. Then, somewhere, this "peaceful" race decides to destroy the planet because it can cause many "diseases" (although the main character and his wife provide a place in their community). Most of the film is spent watching or watching the drive or walking or sitting at the desk doing nothing or walking around. <br /> <br /> If you like Chris Lee or the seventies are like low-budget science fiction, they want to eventually be taken with the planet to the end, in death for boring us boring. I'd give this one a miss. Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth comes in a narrow range of waste celluloid.
