What a stinkeroo turned out to be this !!! At one time, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - not great as a performer, but it was very pretty and pleasant (especially in films such as The Marc of Zorro and "Blood and Sand"), I saw this monster, her golden memories memories deteriorate quickly . This story is unbelievable and fantastic, acting second-rate, unsupported cast. I can not show anyone more immature compared to the tab hunter, Donald Gray was the most boring celebrity of their choice. Add to it, a terrific photograph (and I suggest only color!) In this regard, which should be strong when it shows.
