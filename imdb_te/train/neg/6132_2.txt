As a kid, my friends and I believed that all the nuts were very violent, bloody picture. I do not know that I started the rumor. It was probably born from a disappointing 10-year-old who did not allow a reason or other to see it. A few years after the release of Zimkata, it became a continuous Late Night Cable film, and as a result, I was able to make the lost time. I have to watch these horrific scenes in a dozen times, and I can always find it from the screen time of 1-2 seconds. However, the film must have a few things from a forced connection to gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, hard dialogue and reckless hard story lines. Visually all about the film is bad, the sound is actually quite entertaining. Initially a punch or kick was very small and very low volumes! The canned Kung Fu sounds are cheeky, but slow and pitch-down music, and nearly 5 minutes slow motion scene are really strange. The chaos by the shameless, bloodless villagers city is really irritating, and all but the camera look into and the wires are bad enough and the extra waves to make this rail-wreck a little fun. Does it Lead to Traditional-Traditional Position? Where is MST3K when we need it?
