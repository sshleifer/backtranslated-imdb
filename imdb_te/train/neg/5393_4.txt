I can appreciate what I'm doing to bring up a Shakespearean fan and bring Ken Braunagh Shakespeare to new generation viewers. However, the film's overall intent is less of the funniest musical scenes. Alicia is equivalent to a lovely endurance that sees all the siliconstones dialogue (Duis Keine Reeves Nothing in Nothing) and other poor performers.
