Vampire cyborgs protect the world and utilize human blood as fuel, but the power of the rebels Andrea (Chris Cristoforzon) and warrior Woman (Kathy Long) will be replaced by Daniels (in this ridiculous movie Cyborgs) through this horrific film For all the questions that are unanswered, who is the hardest, he wanted to play singer Chris Christopherson as a cyborg warrior. No, do not get me wrong, I could not see Christopheran as a surveillance or something like a cyborg. Fantastically a suspicion is written for Dolphe Lundgren, but Lundgren must have the knowledge that he can not do it. But despite the horrific casting, Kristofferson is something that's really enjoyable about the film. He gives the show the most untimely Kathy Lang. (And Christophson is playing a robot), even if it is misleading, Cristopher's will provide a few moments of interest. Lance Henricssen is slum and Gary Daniels wasted, but mainly the Knights blocking will fail. The hell thought you were standing back scary and thought it was also a good idea on paper. (It's a film that struggles with a backpack robots triangular Christopher) The sequel, fortunately this still ends all of what ends up physically yet while the nightmares at the proposal of the event probability. br> <br /> * Out of the 4 (Bad)
