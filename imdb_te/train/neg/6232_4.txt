"Raw Force" is an ultra-smiley and distorted version of the Love Boat, with a lot of excess kung fu fights, gentleman's monks, white slave trade, powerful zombies and secular acting performances. The film is not included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 Movie Box Set". It's got everything looking for a mixture in the utterly irrelevant and seemingly developed script, exploiting the exploiters! Product values ​​are very weak and technological elements are curious, but the amount of unwanted violence and gender is rarely explained. The film opens in a tropical sunny area known as Warriors Island, where a group of monks escaped the exclusion of the Kung Fu warriors. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy Hitler look-alike businessman because women's meat supplies them with the powers needed to increase their zombie army. Passengers on passenger passengers, including three martial arts warriors, a female cap and a kind of fragile but soft women attack the goons of the Hitler Guy as they plan a trip to Warrior's Island. Their lifeboat shakes the island anyway, and the monks survive to survive a combat test with them. Okay, how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess? "Raw Force" is not over yet, because even in a completely leftover kami show with the piranhas, wild boar orgies, another pesky main character Cameron Mitchell and 70's Duchess Camille Keaton ("I spit on your grave"). There are loads of badly gored gor, including axial and decapitation, harmony jokes, and bad taste romance. The worst value of this film is literally leaving you speechless. The background of the evil monks is naturally untold, and their questionable hobbies can not be punished. Instead of "The End", the film will remain "a continuation". This sequel has not come unless it's unclear IMDb.
