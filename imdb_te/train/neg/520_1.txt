When we calculated the use of F Word, 22 minutes in the first 10 minutes or 22 times in the film is a good man to be a 12-year-old guy who's really bad about a woman and a knight about the horse, naughty, well, we turn it off. Reliance on the inappropriate pornography and potty humor is a sure sign of the lost Hollywood film, unexpected and producing no-talented writers. <br /> We gave it a second chance. No dice. <br /> <br /> The main character is a cool bike. <br /> I did not recommend it to anyone except perhaps really immature adolescent, or frat guys.
