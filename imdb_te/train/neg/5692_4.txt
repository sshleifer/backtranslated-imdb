In an interesting premise cutting off the action film: a young mafia killer (Chandler) will show his employer as a good person to serve as he goes to California, Beluschi to take some lessons with a very popular killer. The first and most important task: to kill a young girl (Lee) is completely bizarre. But is she easily targeted? This is based on the main idea, but the result is just bad. In the end even the weird twist is not saved image. Chandler's good performance. I give this one 4 (four).
