I'd honestly wish for the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who watches the film is Helen Keller, telling me that I should be better. <br /> <br /> When the zombies come to the end and they have eyes there painting some raccoon <br /> <br /> They talked like ordinary people <br /> <br /> Car driven a car. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo woman asked for "zombies" and said "zombie" (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> Can I claim a Â½ hour in my life?
