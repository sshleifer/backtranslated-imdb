Stupid and just plain picture is when he becomes a victim when he realizes that Santa is not true (window). He grows up and some (Brandon Muggert) turns. A Christmas he suffers and sets out to kill naughty - dressed up as Santa. <br /> <br /> Boring and just plain bad killer Santa image. If you're looking for gore, it's not here. Some murders have been shown and they do not have too many fake effects. Most of the film is talking to Brandon Maggart and slowly going crazy. The script is smooth, acting is terrible and it ends with slowing down on TV. Seriously, I had to watch again to rewind the tape and make sure I'm not illusory! <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas flick rental "Black Christmas" (the original 70s version --- not terrible remake). Avoid this with all the costs.
