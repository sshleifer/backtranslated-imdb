Omega code is a sample of cinematographic volatility. The slightest (non-valuable) of good acting, mainly by two protagonists and Rostenberg, has not only been seen and no rows. Otherwise acting is decisive. The plot is weak and is only partly based on questionable biblical explanation. The year is not the best.
