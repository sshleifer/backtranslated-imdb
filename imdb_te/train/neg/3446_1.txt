I thought this film would be good on the paper, but I realized that the film was totally scary! This theme does not understand, and I counted the best part of the 5000 cut scenes, each of which was more boring and ridiculous. I watched no noise on this late night pitch black just add to it the scarness but the truth was the only thing I was scared of what was music, what they call tragic music, they mean opera i serious! This film is not good about this kind of film. There is no need to look at your own risk of being honest with illness, but the film is full of worse and happy !!
