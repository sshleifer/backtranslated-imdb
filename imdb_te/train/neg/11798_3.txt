I watched Phat Beach in the cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. Fat man is the best character, as he has a nice guy. The remaining characters are just different variations of young people and young blacks. Because they almost like the year attitudes and illusions like a documentary because I want to watch these low budget movies for a while. The fat beach is also funny because the low-budget kids are the perfect home-girls. Most low-budget films have "local babe" quality, and there are local strippers and underwear models for JC Pennies by telling children in the film. Some of them were hanging out of their bikinis from cellulot, which was funny to see what "young people" became popular in what was most widely used in a high mileage scheng. There are a few cuties too. This low-budget worst movies appeal. You'll see a lot of dogs, and some real cuties! I checked some of them at IMDb and seven years later, Phat Beach was their sole credit. Very bad. It's interesting if anytime you can make a book "Anyone Where Now Is" on any scene that has been seen in the history of movies. What happened ?? Perhaps one or two young people in every single film are probably involved in each movie, and years later, when you watch the movie on TV, what happened to "X?" However, the film is mostly blows, but there are some funny moments.
