Robert Dinero plays an unbelievable illiterate character at any time. This film is very waste of talent, it's really frustrating. The script is unbelievable. The dialogue is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of her, and not a funny one. The film moves at a snail pace, taken in a manner that is bad advice and is preachy in an unsustainable way. It plugs in every cliche in the book. <br /> <br /> This new IMDB rule requires ten lines for each review equally annoying. When a movie is not worth it, other readers do not need ten lines of text to inform that it is time and the waste of the tape. Avoid this picture.
