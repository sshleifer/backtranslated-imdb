In the first 3 seasons, Fairly Odd parents are tough candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's delicious like Pepto-Bismolm. And unfortunately the Pepto-Bismolm you need after watching episodes recently, and all the sweets are replaced as insulting and laughing. Cosmo, once one of the more enthusiastic Nick roles, has gone into an irrelevant unfunny cretin to even know the cast of the family guy. Timmy Bart Simpson has become a selfish pride Jerkwad that is happy to beat the snot of cheerful (and beating a lot of beating, and given Timmy's snottiness). And the poor Wanda ... a true brave man who became the victim of her husband and shoulders, now she is named "naked" about the well-being of others. Plus Cosmo's stupidity is painful for all but he does not punish it, nor does he learn any lessons. This is a very good summary of Butch Hartmann's attitude towards children: they are raw, obscene and not too bright. This crummy toon was canceled along with Goddard of Butch Hartmann's Darling, Danny Phantom. Butch is deserving of a cosmo.
