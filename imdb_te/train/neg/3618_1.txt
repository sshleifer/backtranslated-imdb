Clich√©-Riden story about the upcoming divorce - or is it? - In the eyes of a 6-year-old child. <br /> <br /> When you can not create a real sign of a weak storyteller - satisfactory situation - just finish the story. <br /> <br /> The good, but wasted first by child actor Anthony de Marco - the rest of the cast is fine and unforgettable. Why not see indie movies? This is ninety minutes of my life I will never come back again.
