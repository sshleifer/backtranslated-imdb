!!!!! Spoilers of course !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screenplay workshop on preventing clips in horror movies: Female hero - Bad things for drug traffickers - Harein Villain eats out - Hollywood inspection villain does not notice the loss of consciousness - so we look back at the villain creep behind the heroine - unfortunately Anyone can check out a picture of the class instead of using it for the studio seems to have sent a list of the cliche. Dear loved ones here is the only shift where the clocks here are regular. In fact there are many clues and no one can actually see everything in the name of the cripp, or how long he's going to kill him in the underground. I believe that it is the result of some human experiments and that night he decided to take revenge on mankind, but it is very unclear because it is meaningless. The producers always wanted to make a film in horror movies that wiped out the Oscars that year. Similarly, I am suspicious if it has an eye on the DVD market rather than a lot of product cost and cinematic distribution and I say that it's a bit better than the 1972 death line that has a murdered manhunt in London underground. It comes along to increase its ugly head just another clich√© when you feel that all the cliches have been used up in this movie
