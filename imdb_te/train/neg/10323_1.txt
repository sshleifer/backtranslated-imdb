I was excited to see a sitcom that hopefully represented Indian Candidates but I found this presentation was not funny at all. Producers and casting are probably happy to regain both bad and good food because they are talking about when they are concerned! I'm ready for some generalizations because there are stereotypes for the same reason, which is usually true. But really there is nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. "The boat's latest" father, who does not understand his daughter. Radical Feminist Muslim daughter (a terrible actress on the way), and a young modern Indian man attempts to run his mosque politically correctly (he is a pretty good actor and I see him better). <Br <br /> <br /> This is very contrived and dialog does not flow well. <br /> <br /> I once again enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, who she always does. A treat and a natural at all, she does not have the same acting abilities as her daughter acting too much on the show!
