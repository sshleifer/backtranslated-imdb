American films about war and Nazi are not just good. They can not be idiot and follow the agenda. All Nazis are bad, crazy, very proud, and Americans are still modest and capable and intelligent and human. Laugh, stop this bullshit. The main character said, "Through this trial, we have to commit an aggressive war." The peaceful country with its world's America # 1 $ 420 billion "defense" budget (China # 2 with just $ 51b)? It just spent it on this without any ... ROI? Why not play a peaceful country role in America? I like to act with the agenda - they dismiss art to hell and try to persuade us to believe something. Record companies have a label on Hollywood movies, as they have a "parental advice" label. We need to label "bullish advice", "promotional advice" or "politically correct advice" on certain images. This is one of them.
