The story of a thousand times with the usual drama in the middle of the imagination, some character fainting, a stereotypical violinist horror music of the 70s at contemporary, is a couple of pretty rape sex scenes that I can not help with chuckling myself. /> <br /> I usually say Defoe, and acting is not all bad, "Plot" develops at a reasonable speed and keeps you up to date. It's all very predictable, I felt like I was looking at making a new film instead of a TV drama. <br /> <br /> I had a review review here before I saw that the film would have a style of directors, but it was written by the person involved in it. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too many clock, and if I can turn the clock back then I went to see it in the movie. I look forward to bargain handles in your video store, it will take a long time.
