<br /> <br /> Do not try to glorify any part of the film. <br /> <br /> It is directly worse. Initially you might think that you are in a visually magnificent portrait ... And then you've been hit with a bigger story that you have failed to do! These fights are just battlefields, acting hang on the edge of the edge, and the music is not worth describing. The story created for the movie is just as good. The characters make decisions and they are weak as dealing with circumstances and did nothing but I was disappointed. I think that the only reason about this film is to act as a bit of fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
