Despite the great future-designing touches, the brilliant Asimov premiere, and Will Smith's relentless cool performance, the film did not receive expectations. Clocks are thick and fast; (Waking up from a recurring nightmare, Maverick Cop his badge was abruptly canceled by the lieutenant, the more scattering the list - you can see a mile). The film is also theatrical - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; What a global catastrophe is supposed to be a sure CGI never leaves Chicago. Robots are good in Closeup, but the 'group' scenes appear to be a bad Disney - CGI will be back again and again. If you can destroy the robots by cutting them, why do they do 'nanites'? You know that this is a Duff movie when it comes to stupid questions that start to climax before the climax. It may be great, but its parts are much smaller than that, because of the imaginable plot that came from any action film in the last forty years.
