This film is one to allow IMDB 0/10 vote. Acting is awful, here are some of the acclaimed here, the role of Karpathy! The script looks like it was written shortly. In a scene when the buck asked the term "don 7" in the computer graphic, the backgammon told him that "Daniel 7, * Chapter * 24". He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers escaped the slip. Perhaps the worst episode is that the eschatological position of the film is Biblically unsound. Although many Christians endorse the description of the final-time events, such commentary * is incorrect in my opinion *. To understand these shortcomings, Jim McQueen and "The Blessed Hope, A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture" by George E. Read: "Literally bring Christians up".
