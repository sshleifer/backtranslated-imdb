The movie "Joshua" is very upset and clear. It really shocked me to think there are people who really enjoy watching. Without giving this story, it's about a little boy's reaction to his newborn baby, and it's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the film, the viewer can not imagine the most unsettled child behavior. Insulting the injury, the ending of the film is nothing but the absolute exclusion of the absolute vicious nature of the evil, which erased a whole group of little boy. There is no liberation, no justice, and a large group that is not smart enough to see what's going on around them. Frankly, I was not enjoying watching this movie. It is not too undisturbed. The film is also very well for those who can enjoy horror movies. Although the film actually plays well, the story is also disturbing watching a 90-minute wait in a dentist's waiting room in anticipation of a very painful dental procedure.
