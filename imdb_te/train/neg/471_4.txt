An old "misfit-the-the-war-arm" is a half-hearted, trying to be two surrealists (overseas subtitles) and obscene (farthest bags), but ends with a variety of humor, most successfully followed. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
