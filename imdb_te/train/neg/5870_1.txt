I do not like this movie! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone is saying that Clemence Posey is dramatic, which is totally wrong in my opinion. She is not like Natasha: another character, another character ... Worse, she is a very novice actress and hence she could not play this role! Her heroine is totally hideous! She is really disgusting to watch the game! In my mind, it is better to give this role to a Russian actress, because she is much easier to understand the Russian spirit for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov did not cling for 2 weeks and he seemed to be an anesthetic man who did not defeat his lost battle ... (Think God, some of the plays in this movie, its play is superb! I think Aliceo Bonnie coped with his work very well! I was pleasantly surprised He is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important to play, in addition, I play our Russian actors play Looked like, really exciting to see them)) The only thing that I liked this work is the most beautiful views and stunning dresses! My advice is to read this book and understand the true meaning, Leo Tolstoy will write this masterpiece and realize the whole idea of ​​the book ...
