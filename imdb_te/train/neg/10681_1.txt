Unfortunately, I have a lot of people in my "A" list and a good "B" list actors agree to make this movie, but they see it, and it looks at me and sucks me. I have never heard of this movie, but on the DVD cover is Cuba Gooding Jr. and how bad was James Woods in the background? In a word too! This movie starts. There are few turns and turns, then just represents an egg. The end was very weak, the author was called away and his 4 year old son was hacked to sit on the type writer. The so-called "poor game" is contradictory to the film. These "A" list of movie makers are in a hurry to the "b" list. I hope Cuba will be gudging JR, and James Woods can not make this habit.
