An Italian film starring Hum, David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much to be honest, but actually took less than I had expected. This movie is the worst thing I've ever seen because I watched worse things than this but the plot is times too many times but the only thing that saves these is confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes. Apart from that you are going to love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. I want to see "Trolls 3" by the same director, not worse than that.
