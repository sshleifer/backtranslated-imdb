In this unforgettable triple, 40-ish Norma Shearer portrayed the role of a mindless, infant sociologist in a controversy surrounded by a controversy between George Saunders and Robert Taylor. The film's failure is hopelessly portraying in a talkie script or director George Cockor, which generally shows interest in the movie as a comatose state. Most likely, however, Shearer was mistaken for her, and she wanted to play "young" parts. Unfortunately, this "her cardboard lover" makes a bizarre commemorative of the elderly woman's pride.
