Have you ever sat by a movie, it's a big "wtf!" Like it. <br /> Welcome to Ducky. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to watch another video directly for Video Action Creator or look good. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick stars and quickly hunted on these concerts, what is the point where the story looks pretty darn and action action and action action action? Robert Patrick hits a new low in an action sequence that is particularly firing a machine gun standing in a moving school bus hood. Co-stars with the surrounding Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Highlands (TV's Night Heat Fame).
