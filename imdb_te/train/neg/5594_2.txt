The question you want to ask when you see this picture is "What's the point?" <br /> <br /> The movie is not just a mess that tells you that there is nothing to be confusing (not using the walks) and the existence of the entire mess. <br /> <br /> I've made a lot of laughs about this movie, which is "Victorian Story Written", which means a script for the part of the story. There were no conversations in the whole Victorian section, and there were only one girl and the shots of the opposite. To make a piece of the script that is scripted as a camera on the left at the train station. <br /> <br /> It's time for the story. It starts with the guy who's never got out of it. Oh preventing, who do you want? These newspapers come to his home and pray pragmatically to tell this story about these dead girls. So he begins the story in Victorian times. (Guy and girl starts to play pretty music there are a field) (stare girl at girl) (stares the girl at girl) (the girl stares at the girl) cut back the image. <br /> <br /> The rest of the page is an awkward conversation about a group of models that wants to buy an apartment. So this real estate agent shows them one and I say that the conversation is awkward, if it is a dancer it will be an expedition during MACARENA. No characters in this image. The designs are very irritating, the Victorian people do not speak, and the person telling the story is the personality of a sack of onions. So finally all the girls are killed. And by murder off, I mean the drug offscreen. ooh. Did you show a death And by death I mean holding her face until they have to put blood makeup? <br /> <br /> The story also tells me that the story is bound to this story. It says because he saw it. But how? There is no one in that apartment! The door was closed without any way, the windows were paired with a rotten fire to work, how did Hell see him? Oh plot holes. We love you. Thus, the film ends with the news, "I think you're wasting our time", even though the film begs him in his first interview. Whatever. This film is stupid, meaningless, and makes no sense with plots holes. I have gone to and about this film, but I do not need to see it. I try to spend most of my time with me. Something like that. The "Threshold of Hell" is purged along with two dumb patterns. From 10
