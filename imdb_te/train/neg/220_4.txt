"The Crush" is a romantic chic film for the first two-thirds of a fun enough 40-something friends, which seeks a Brit "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the turn of the trophy young hunk. Its role is not a mistake. (Which is worth seeing more of our total physical meat and Kenny Dowry). <br /> <br /> They play "Sabrina" (no movie that I do not like) or Douglas / Zeta <br /> <br /> A former pat, Brit Dramas, comedians, and Target-language Anna Chancellor around Andie Mac Dowell Familiar family members such as <br /> <br /> 'It is not until the credits eventually realized what I really did wrong. The author / director is here with the first-timer Scott John McCay, the man, and I thought he really wanted to script about three gay people about what he really got in relation to their loved ones (the characters were a school principal, a cop and A doctor), it was a good and interesting film. The title of the work "The Sad Fox Cakes Club", which is parallel with homosexuals "Broken Hearts Club", is more evident. <br /> (4/6/2002)
