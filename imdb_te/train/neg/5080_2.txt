It should not be confusing with The Wizard's review, The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is the late eighty film, which is about the ability to play video games for the silent boy and walk during the whole opening credits. The unwanted update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard had a 100-Strauss add-on and some kid in it. <br /> Let me tell you outside the bridge: There really is no reason to see this movie. It is a 100-minute Nintendo Commercial designed to invest in Powerglove, The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. 3. As the film seems to have been written over a weekend, I use the term "design" as low as possible, and Nintendo's non-participating crack team directed a person with lesser sense of style than my grandmother. <br /> <br If the writer and director sit and actually play some games together, they learn to go to the vocational school to learn how to paint the whole worst images and install car stereos instead. Hope this is a glowing experience for you. It's definitely not me. In fact, I think I might have missed some brains in this movie watching and writing about it. The next time you are at the video store and you'll see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz, sit on the shelf in a pretty short row and miss all of them and play Duck Hunt.
