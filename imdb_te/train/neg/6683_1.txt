I'm happy to understand the style of the film in the IMDb. I have a suspicion that I wanted to be comedy, but I'm not sure because it wants a dark and serious play. The slightest venture even within the scope of humor is great for a comedy - until it's ridiculous "twist", it ensures that the whole picture is virtually the whole film. It's hard to describe how unpleasant haziness really is. Have you thought of what they would do for the film? The value you're actually looking at is how terrible you look at the screen with a slack-and-a-necked disbelief.
