I've read the book twice and this picture is not perfect. I can allow this slide, which is after all the movies. But I have serious problems with the setting of this film. No film was found to be based on the film and the book that was based on the actual events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I felt this film based on this film. First, the "small" town is the third largest city in the state. With a population of approximately 50,000. The Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Scenario for this image is wrong. The Grand Island Plateau lies in the river valley. It is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but made me mad to see my hometown as bad. This is a real event. Large sections of the city were wiped out. In the book they talk about riding on bike on the Parker Park from Mormon Island. I would like you to ride a 15-mile ride every way you could. To anyone who wants to know what really happened go to http://www.theindependent.com/twisters/
