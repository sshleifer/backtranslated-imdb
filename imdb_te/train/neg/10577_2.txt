Some filmmakers who have participated in the series have made some great films but they did not show much skill with this series. Especially writing. Well, the first season is somewhat fine, but these new episodes are just creating a stink. I am a huge fan of horror and in my opinion these parts are the whole rubbish. There is nothing new or honest about that. Some of them are visually creative. This is just a fictional Hollywood trash, uninteresting, childish, poorly produced and in some cases, funnier. The only good thing that offers this series as stories from Crypt is great nudity! The series was hard hit after the other. I sometimes have a feeling that I have hired a group of eighth-graders to write episodes. Maybe they are.
