This is a good idea for the movie but unfortunately it does not turn into a great movie. What begins as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his Fluffee Serpents controlled into a bizarre recipe with the bizarre combination of genres and plot, with liberal loans from Bookie Knights, Thlema and Louise, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and finally Interesting "dash" of 400 blows thrown. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, finally, this slick, well-produced image does not add up to anything too. However, the actors do the job of doing the job and have some good laughs in the scenes behind gay porn.
