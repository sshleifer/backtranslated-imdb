I mean, I wanted to listen to this dialog in the movie, but it is very bad and I can not really believe it. <br /> <br /> I am very laughing at how bad writing and acting in human history are, I have a heart attack and die there in the theater. I'm talking about the scene, "Hero" just saw his brother crash and his brothers exploded from the car just below the feet (bottom). <br /> <br /> "Heyman" is so tragic that the imaginary "fit" is anticipated and people are trying to catch him for running in a fiery car. <br /> <br /> He said "I'm very sad" his breakthrough and his uncontrolled charge / emotional break - he said it was right? Am i crazy
