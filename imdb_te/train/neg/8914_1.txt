The film (a fake-intellectual product for movie viewers of the past) has stopped me from watching the film for twenty minutes, because I was at $ 3.99, so close to the tears, the blockbuster was wasted. Jonah Pusula's performance and her awesome interpretation of Slavic accent is terrible to set up one to hit each other's teeth. I know that she is two hours longer than two hours. Both Bruyier and Nietzsche played a role not to show certain talents. When we talk about talent, Breuer's Supercilus assistant left the local acting team. She clearly did not learn his craft. In fact, she is really awful. All public sequences were performed on their Sunday's best-performing walks. It is more satisfying than stopping this film. Do not take this terrible movie. Sorry you have spent your money.
