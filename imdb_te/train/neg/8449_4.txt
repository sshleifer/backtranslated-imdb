What the innocent story, murder blackmail, child sex allegations, homosexuals and the Catholic Church ..... the perfect trip. Most UK based TV plays, sitcom coms etc are responsive gay, its really now getting tiresome. Everyone agrees that homosexuals have other minority groups in society, but we do not want our voice (I'll send this one) at each show. Apart from the above, the play went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime, the priest had a pedophile and there were gay people running about every couple, oh yes just gay couple completely black one black couple. Even when he read the script, he was amazed at the ce ecclestone.
