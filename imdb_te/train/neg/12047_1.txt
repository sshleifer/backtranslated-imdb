It is a great excitement for me to go to the earlier screening of this movie. After all, this was one of the oldest and most complicated stories known to mankind, and I was one of the first legendary stories that I read (even before Tolkien). I must say that it is a huge dispatinist. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the subject into a long soap opera. The items that are reliable to the plot are scattered in such a chaotic manner, and the audience laugh at the crazy script of lip service to the war in this fight. This was disappointing to "Fabio on the Beach" in Pitt's pursuit to see a complex character like Achilles (which virtually matrix-like powers in the virtual rhyme, bizarre hypocrisy and a peculiar mixture for male luminaries). It became the most complex and original warrior ever built by Hollywood, with a good script and more effort. Actors are really good, trying to do the best of the funniest script. It's actually a great deal of excitement (with the Peter O'Toole Show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean curiosity). Compare it with LOTR or gladiator and do not even have a candle. There are tens of thousands of women in the film about a long war and siege motion with enough scenes in the film. I do not recommend to pay someone to see this story like a dude like one of the characters (at least part of that).
