The man, even plan 9 is better than this film from outer space. The film does not have enough plot for half an hour, but they expanded it for more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in exaggerated combat scenarios, but the Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this pardon.
