I want to see this movie in the theater. It was actually sold. <br /> I really went to see Solaris, in fact it's the worst film released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Viktor Rosa (John Leganija) is a strict, street wide street pharmacist, who shoots a kid and decides to clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sursard). Jack appears to be going very well with his girlfriend Trish (Denis Richards) to the town. This film was too late, so they could not have this exposure in the preview, which may have an interesting twist. <br /> In fact, the film is not an interesting topic; Everything is given away in the preview. If you even see a preview, you have seen the whole movie, so you may want to really struggle to fill the gaps. Go to website and download the preview, save yourself $ 3.99. <br /> <br /> Unlike the terrain of soundtrack, there is no single surprise or twist in the whole movie. Twice. Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefaan duets are the only songs released, and have less skill and musical ability (as I do the same with the mind-shaking of the space-sized particles). <br /> <br /> This act is not the best, the script is the best against humanity and Denis Richards has a good 67% stereo and 33% ziploc bag. You know that things were bad when John Leujizamo (he was in the pest!) With his acting capabilities coming up with the rest of the cast.
