This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I can not yet say it's serious or just a satire. One can think of one of those movies used by every superstition. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is actually pretty cool. But it sucks. I saw it 10 years ago, but it still hurts and hangs in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film is really stupid. By looking at this film I want to do the job. But in the end I'm in the middle of some people, the moment * of surveillance * is confusing. If you can not do anything, and you like point and laugh, then it may be worth your time. Additionally, if you are forced to keep the date with the person you do not really like, you should watch this movie together and they will leave you alone after seeing it. It's a fair price to pay, I guess.
