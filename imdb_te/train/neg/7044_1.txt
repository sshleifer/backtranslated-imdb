How gorgeous and talented Tina Lewis was sad to make this terrible necessity for a film. Tina is still fit and attractive, but for some reason really frightening. I can understand her fears. This 3rd rate stinker fear that something will be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of Adam West. Again, with Tina, Adam looks good and great in his age. His performance here is slow, but the script is so bad, it's too hard to hear the dialog. <br /> <br /> The film breaks out of the classic branded biker movie The Wild One's; The drug biker gang is out of control in a small hawk-town. The bikers here look like a thin group and I think so far to my sister. Acting hard and woody, and story-plot is as old as sand. Hellellers is hell to watch!
