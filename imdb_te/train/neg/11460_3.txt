Orkos is a very entertaining piece that attempts to show how good it is, but in the meantime (and ignorant of them) viewers are considered stupid with a very ridiculous picture. Richard Harris plays the quint. I'm sorry, it's wrong, Captain Nolan plays a fisherman who catches sharks for a creature, but is attracted by a big catch and tries to catch a killer whale. A female killer whale summoning (do not ask) it starts a colleague (do not ask) a devastation (do not ask) and Captain Nolan (do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan finds they have something in common (do not ask). Here are the folks making a pretty fantastic movie. I started to tell you that while pretty much haunting and end credits (with whale sounds and nothing else too) and the end credits (with the most godly song) is pretty fun.
