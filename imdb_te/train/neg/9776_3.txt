I do not know much about the film structure, but good movies have to tell a story ... Your characters must start and finish their journey. They were in Brooklyn's final departure, but it was not in any satisfactory way, and I did not understand any ending, a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Last trip to Brooklyn, Brooklyn set a brutal labor strike in 1952 sets the threads of many stories in motion. Many indescribable characters who have ever walked on the film screen. But the final exit for Brooklyn failed to bring these stories to any end ... it did not end some of them, or burst into some hideous stratosphere for the "artistic" finish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you ' He's gone out of his memory .. His friends, enemies and lovers are nothing .... <br /> <br /> Stupid, clueless, and secretly gay striking leader in another thread, Labor refused, his gay boyfriend, and neighbors Stomped through the thugs, found by thugs, the ending of the beating to the Brooklyn streets And is very similar to the Nazi death camps street scenes ... and the scenery pulling and then and ... and the camera's labor leader, and he was crucified ... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And that's also him .... the brain eraser .. ... gone <br /> <br /> The bottom line .... The reviewers first told me about this film in 1989. This film is a discouraging piece of mud. Carincakapote, physical, emotional and sexual cruelty to NC-17 rating, which is a huge amount of young people also ... let's really deserved.
