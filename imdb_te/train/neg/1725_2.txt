- The image opens with a meteorite crash into a lake. Without knowing the locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor shower is heated to the lake and converted into a large incubator. <br /> <br /> You hatch the egg that releases a dinosaur to frighten the community. I do not see stop-motion clay dinosaurs, it's about the film that makes me suffer. Acting is worse. The conversation is totally ridiculous. Comic relief is comic. Logic does not exist. The similarity between the "scientists" and real scientists in the film is completely coincidental. I can go for an eternity of the bad stuffs of this film, but you get the idea. I think this disaster is very safe to call "MST3K Worthy".
