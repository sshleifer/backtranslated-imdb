Words of "Swedish" and "Action Movie" do not mix. Every effort made in the genre is more evident. <br /> <br /> Los Brunel (Peace Queen) is working at a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day, foreign offenders threaten to hurt his family if he does not tell them. <br /> They want this secret device. Do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This is an uphill loop for the movie. And in the Swedish action movies are simply "downs", there are no "ups". So I showed some quality in this film. To start positive comments, I can specify that this film is technically well. The footage of flying airplanes and helicopters well shot and look very good. Acting is very diverse. The Queen of the Peace was a great performer when Maria Bonnie was strong and unrealistic (I continued to use her in Swedish plans, although she had the skills of the wooden plank). <br /> <br /> Stephan Sack comes to the ground for researching the "cool" special forces person. <br /> What are the action scenes? Sequences of flying planes and helicopters are as good as above. But there are not many steps to talk aside. And it's a common problem with Swedish action films. There is not enough action to take place. Perhaps this might be a budget problem, perhaps it is a cinematic culture. I do not know, but it adversely affects the experience. <br /> <br /> Most obviously, the story and acting are not enough to rely on the film. <br /> <br /> For this attempt, I am rating 4/10.
