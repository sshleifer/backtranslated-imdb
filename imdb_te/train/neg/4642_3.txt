I saw "Rachel's Attic", I thought I would be happy for a visceral and ride. However, that is not the case. Whiskey, yes, but enjoyable? It's a big, fat, whic! In fact, the only reason I gave "3," is that Gunner Hansen appears as one of the guilty characters (always so brief). They have ever made Mr. Hansen in this work ... work, I never know. The idea of ​​the story is interesting, but poorly executed. The footprint and acting is mediocre in this direction. The only thing that's worse is the special effects. Okay !!! I saw good effects in a grade school game. Give it, Mr. W, it's time for the change of career ... I hear they're hiring Mel's diner! There are very few well-made movies from Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
