Interesting acting; Not just enough, not bad. This is rather lame, special effects or lines are the same culprit for this failure. Standing alone they are not terribly bad, but together with a tragic move. <br /> <br /> The film was a tremendous failure, but it totally failed. <br /> <br /> Many of the accusations of this disaster are placed in special effects. Do not believe it, they are very cool. Appleby is not the best option for this attempt. She may have her own identity as little as she chooses her fans' identity. An experienced actress has never done as Appleby. Scfi puts some really good original movies, it's just too bad that has failed very dramatically.
