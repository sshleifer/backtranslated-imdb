I'm excited to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a huge David Borenz fan. I've got, though, a 1-1 / 2 hour nap. The campus was delighted: Borassaz Lance Valentine, a business owner known as "Mr. Fix It", asks for his help to bring back their boys. <br /> Film editing, script and acting. I have a pleasurable experience with his other film roles (except for that "Crow" film), which was disappointing. At times his character is interesting and others are flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera players. <br /> My advice: Look at your own risk.
