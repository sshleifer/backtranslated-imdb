AKA: The Somunds in the Sun <br /> <br /> I do not know what I saw. Three men are aimless and drink, grousing about everything and everyone in their path. <br /> <br /> I've read the reviews as "fantastic", "beautiful," here and " <br /> <br /> I agree that these people are the most innocuous proto-humans ever to have ever run. <br /> This is not a film, it goes all over and loses the audience every one. It's not for my life to see anyone who has seen this trash, there's nothing deep in it, it's rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's rated from a zero / 10.
