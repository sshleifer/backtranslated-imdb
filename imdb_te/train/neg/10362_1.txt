Disney? What happened? I really want this film to be built in the 60s. And I may have really dealt with cheap special effects to save the budget for a more perfect simulation ..... I may be glad that anyone can read the books, but ... What, though, with the red ice and the interaction with the volcanic revolt? Where is the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that I had a European version of this film. I realized it. I can imagine that this can be a real storyline rather than a poor simulation. This image must be X'd.
