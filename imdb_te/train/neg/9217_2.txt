Yes, the film is reminiscent of the short film Hollywood starring only a few youngsters in Hollywood. It's not a movie to show all his talent here and the only thing that's a bit more entertaining about the film is that he sees monsters and runs a guy. Yes, the movie is about a group of people using their imaginations and about the game's misdeeds that tries to come up with interesting scenes. Typically, a particular kind of game about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons is retitled here specifically as mazes and monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that they should not have any fun without intellect, drugs, unprotected sex, and other weak children like all the popular children were going to harass other weak children. No, these bad people are really playing a game where the brain, the number to use the number one! No, they can really think of themselves if they have the brain and some groups there are not thoughts. Yes, I think this film is totally stupid and wasting time. Granted, it could be a film against addiction, but there are very few people who have been killed by taking Dungeons and Dragons to its entire existence than say drinking driving arguments like a month.
