What really got me about this film (i.e., I was physically ill for the movie), it was paid by anyone. There is absolutely no intention of the existence of this film. It's not scary, it does not feel provoked, it's not fun, it's not good. It is a sleep pill that is made of cyanide. The DVD case compares to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and some other good films, making the filmmaker's disappointment clear. No film ever made. It's too far away. Arguments for a "very surprising ending you will never forget" are a ton of unstable horse rings. Please do not waste your time watching the worst piece because it makes it soft. The person who wrote the film must be wiped out of the Writer's Guild subscription list and never let the film ever again. Because if the image is considered valuable, he probably will not be in the future. Zero stars. Anyone who is unlucky enough to see this can be put on the soul. I'm going to go now to vomit.
