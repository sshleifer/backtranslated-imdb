<br /> <br /> As always, I'm really looking forward to a new TV / movie on my favorite topic - a good change from a * wonderfully * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. <br /> <br /> I waited for Pearl Harbor and Enemy in Hollywood - but not of Hollywood I have heard that Ian Kershah enjoyed his books, and once again I'm excited about 'The Rise of Evil'. <br /> <br /> To quote some people responsible for this trash: "Kershah is an academic piece of the book," he said. <br /> <br /> Very dry. <br /> Events? Are they totally nuts? <br /> You can not tell Hitler's life without the "incident" - yes Kershaw's two volume Hitler biographies are long and detailed, but they should be. <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - he was a bad man, he was a Jew, and if you missed in this case, we can see the truth in every scene in this movie Emphasized. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to try and explain the mood, why did Hitler adopt his views and strategy. No need to say - unlike the most remarkable 'Nazis - A Warning from History' - the Munich Communist is an absolutely crucial factor in understanding the Nazi era - its opinions on the subject, and its own relation to the Jewish community with Bossvivism - almost all the leaders growing Jews. <br /> <br /> But there is not much to be done to do - filmmakers go there, so we have always learned that. We certainly can not find the fascinating fact that Kershaw mentioned, which Hitler briefly became Socialist / Communist after WW1. <br /> <br /> However, he also knows that he is a public speaker and that he is an enchanting person in more private situations. He is polite and sympathetic and thought many of the Guardian readers accept certain opinions such as eternity, alcohol and smoking.He is also well-known for animals, so cook <br /> <br /> When we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never saw how he won it (the actions of courage are not in the script, no need). He has no idea that Sasson, Owen, Brook, Rymerk and many others are tired of his experiences, again, Bolshevik link is very important for anyone who knows about this matter, why he loves a lot of war? Despite the huge evidence, why was it always a good idea? Why did not he care about his dead relatives? <br /> <br /> In this film, there is nothing to say. Days, this film is a classic example of presenting 'current history' and story or avoiding the awkward facts that fit with the 'present' - your viewers believe in an inch of a very low ordinary denominator so you can always have a lot of mute fools around the world Stay away (sin is correct (B) Know and rum up their voice. <br /> How do we create history with the past in the past and look how good and worse it will improve our current colors. This trash is a great opportunity, and again lost. They spent millions of people, and the locations and the big landscapes were impressive, but we do not know anything and do not understand this dark period in human history. <br /> WT
