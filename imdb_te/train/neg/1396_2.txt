The film is likely to be a really interesting film through the secret public mind experiments and the secret understanding of citizenship and the shadowy shadow dolls. But for me, it failed. I do not quite speculate on the most confusing plot line, but if you're looking for a detailed description, the user will give a good description of the "reactant popstars" comment. <br /> Work for me. I found it slow, it was ok but for the fact that it seemed to go somewhere. There are many things in the dark that really get a handle on the film-the filmmakers are intent on stimulating the idea and for that reason remains unclear. <br /> <br /> The two buildings that are frequently mentioned by other customers often refer to the longest scenes ... I see that they have a point "action" give the viewer time to get another drink without any missing. And I suspect many viewers are likely to welcome the board to have several drinks to get through this.
