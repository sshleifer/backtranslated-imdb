It is considered a slazer flick compared to the classic classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" (the lowest) budget movie. I thought the first "Silent Night Part 2" (half of the film was more than half of the film). "Christmas Evil" attempts to get a mental relationship by calling the main character a madman (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He has not got the true meaning of Christmas and at work he is fed up with people who can not stand up to how such fictional toys make up for such lack of quality and love. Dressed as Santa, he finally goes to a killing spree. The strongest term is that only 3 people die without a real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For an exception: Jeffrey Demon has it. He played Tom Hanks, one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile". He is still obliged to accept his role in these days. He is the only person who really can really work, his main character is better than the main character. (Who's not bad, but if you overshadow a little support character, you're not great either.) And what about that novelty? (You have to see it, believe it). "Christmas Evil" is obviously boring, nothing has happened and artwork is just misleading. It's not a slasher. You wanna see the real Christmas slasher, check all the time great: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
