If you take the time back ... it's OK. It moves at a good speed but it must be in the background of a long period of time to remove the film. <br /> Acting is right. <br /> <br /> William R. Moss plays a good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, wife, has a weak piece and has not developed the reasons to go back to her work. <br /> <br /> The ending is sort of crazy. Many of these sitter movies are parts that are interesting ... but the whole leaves you wondering why you spent time.
