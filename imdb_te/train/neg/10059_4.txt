I look forward to a documentary focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. I see the fact that his great grandfather had lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And this happened and continued. If Mick McLeley succeeded Dukes for the family, I suspect Mr. McLevely is facing any problems with the death toll due to tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where the tobacco business was started. I guess more than McVee's continuous focus on his family. I learned little about tobacco history in the NC economy and I learned a lot through tobacco strict rules for the state economy. There are a number of references to "Bright Leaves" - if Gary Cooper is acting as a great grandfather of Mr. McLevely? Will the audience gain insight into the role of tobacco by displaying the old film clips of the fiction film in the North Carolina economy? I did not.
