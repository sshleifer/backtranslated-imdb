Bernard Rap has passed away last year and is a journalist who has so much culture. The film was one of his biggest wishes (he was a vast global dictionary of films) and he took the camera for at least one of his career. But he was strongly criticized for the films he left: "Tear Part" (1996), despite Terence Stamp's sensational performance, was a very parody of the characters, "Unfair De Gutte" (2000) Bernard Gerdio gave a paradoxical performance, "Pass C Grave" (2003) Another divider and "You Petit Ji Sans Consangukence" is the underpinning of its ancestors. <br /> <br /> The initial idea allows a twirling, spiritual comedy to be predicted. The couple who are invited by their friends, Yvan Atal and Sandrin Kiblerin, move completely in an awkward building. To play with their guests, they pretend to be one with each other. And things do not plan because the division's statement does not surprise them. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush scenery and the promise he had at his disposal, rap's neglected direction did not perform the life of the game. Unexpected consequences. The plot follows the most well-known duties and a well-dressed pattern with characters that have really masked about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic influences often fall flat. Bad editing with this bad habit is very low, and suddenly cut off several scenes from rap. The honest input of actors is also debatable in venture. They are bored and read their texts, especially Sandrine Kairlin. <br /> It's unfortunate to say it. Bernard Rapp's movies "You Petit Jean Sans Conscens" never bear witness to the witness and never have his intentions.
