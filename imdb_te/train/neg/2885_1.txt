Against the guidelines, I have seen many many pictures, and it's still much worse, the reason why I did all the money to Slaughterhouse landscapes, a B & W 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys I did a good job might be. I just registered to comment, I had to tell anyone, the movie rental did not fit. But this is my 2 cents worth, I suggest loans from some poor sap to rent and see it yourself. Tell me exactly that I can not waste money on it. Now with this comment I will leave you. I hope you did not do it in your rental when you paid for your money .. =)
