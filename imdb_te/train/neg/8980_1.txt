I will never forget the night when I saw this film. We're in a submarine on the petrol in the North Atlantic, an evening scheduled film. We left after the second reel. They did not even try to show up in the middle night show. Instead of selecting for republishing ...... this is what I really have to say but my comment has this stupid rule that must have ten lines. I will continue to round up until I get my ten lines of BS so I do not have to pod to comment with random words. I found a list of George Goble in credits but I remember him in the movie. Terrific horrible songs and songs are even worse.
