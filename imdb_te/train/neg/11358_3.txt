I was surprised when I saw this trailer on TV. In May 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and it was shown in a 4-D attraction (as you know, the attraction of seats). I've taken the reform version I've recreated to add the abbreviated version (15 minutes) and motion effects. It's a beautiful picture ... but it is there. It's about education and the first mission but a CGI spaces seemed a bit ... well ... unassuming. I am not a big fan of the movie but I would recommend this film for any parent to let their children know in a fun way about Movawalk. I will say, the role actors are well-chosen and the characters are very beautiful. So all in all, I will say, if you want to bring young kids ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
