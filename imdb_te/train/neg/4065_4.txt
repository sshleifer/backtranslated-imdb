... by Eric Stanz's similarly thought-out criticism. <br /> <br /> In particular, the talented director is not a good movie and if I have nothing more to do than what's going to happen, I'll sit for the closing credits. <br /> <br /> A rape escapes from prison and calls out his old flame. After she was captured (although she was willing) and threatened her in sex, she (she was ready to do another event) revealed that she had been kidnapped by three boys in the past. He decides to kill her (huh?), But instead loses and dies. <br /> <br /> In the evening, the author sucks: It is loaded with ten percent words, it is much more. <br /> Acting Success: What Minute, What's Acting? <br /> <br /> Shooting Sux: The home video is not adequate, but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a disgrace. <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... <br /> <br /> There is a charm for the subject yet. Back in the 70s this kind of movies came to theaters with actual budgets and added talent to pair them, while this day and age. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this kind of violent, sexually exploitative garbage (some of us do not lie), you can see all these days. <br /> <br /> Some brief hardcore shots in the sex scene, <br /> <br /> This may not be good. <br /> <br /> It's not good, it's not good, it's not remembered, but Joey D'amato's messy people do not have movies like this. <br />
