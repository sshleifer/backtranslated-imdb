The Russian version of Space Race, which was shown on Russia's first channel on April 10, 2006, was named Bitva za Kosmos (space for space). Bad translation might have destroyed some details but I doubt this case. Actually the number of default errors that can not be listed in the first episode (first missile development). U.S. of this image Half of them also have multiple errors and exceptions. The audience did not mention any V-2 / A-4 launches from the US, and three different Jupiter C rockets were launched with a single serial number 'UE' onboard. Apollo 1 starts to the moon. Everyone in the Russian sense is ridiculous. Coral√©v scares the NKVD, glusco abuser and traitor, the machine drunk. No motivation, no life. Uniform and decorations are awful. Gagarin is waiting for a progressive song (I think this is included for the Russian version).
