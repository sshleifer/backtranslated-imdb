This film is awesome! (Not much Leaf Garrett's masterpiece is as good as a langshot) but still amazing !! I saw Ashley Freakin compared to Mary-Kate in the film. I wonder why. Who swith places like that and almost thought it would get away. Father has a jerk though and Mom Helmut Head is a little too chummy. I'll give you a 4. Let's check out the Launchshot of anyone who likes this movie.
