In a word: excruciating. I advised you to read a few articles about the philosophical meanings of the film, but by saturating the film's 115 minutes, slowly its bloated symbolic and lava-flow oppression, it's good to report my reactions to the film. After all, who goes to look at a picture of a syllabus in hand? This film is very tedious. Actor Claude Lauddu from the end of the film sucks the same anguish and annoying mask as practically unrecognizable from the film's eternal, frustrating voice-ohm. The two viewers both worked better than the audience, and they mainly say the same thing: the priest of the Ambrose is a wretched man. The story about a persecuted priest who seeks to help a troubled great family, the family comes across a group of unpleasant weirds, and the priest himself, a nosy pest, does nothing towards making unpleasant interesting or sympathetic family letters. Let's have some ice cream, last over, because last 30 minutes is a sign of some breath-taking message and a man's sorrow is equal to others, but there is no pain and the subtle variation in the Robert Bresson script. Interestingly, Bresson fan Paul Schruder has seen the character and settings of Scruder's character and settings in his own scripts and movies, especially the "Taxi Rush", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
