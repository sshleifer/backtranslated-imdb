What is hell of de-movie? Bad acting, bad special effects, and worst words / storylines I came across. The only cool thing here is the freeway, which has a nice como with a freaked-out cap. However, the rest of the picture is awful and boring. It's not too bad, you can laugh about it. Plain trash. And anyone who likes to compare to the Evil Dead series can match the Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, well, at least in the Tomb Raider Angelina Jolie)! 10 to 1
