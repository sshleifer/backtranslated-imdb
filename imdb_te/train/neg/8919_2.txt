I first saw it when it was chosen as reference from my TIVO system. I like Danny Elfman and I think it's interesting. On top of that, I was a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it opened the look and feel of his 30th cartoon. In both of these, I thought I would have my interest. I made a mistake. In a few minutes, I have a forward forwarded button. I thought I was in it for about 15 minutes. <br /> After that, I have read a few reviews here and found that I did not give enough. I recorded it again. <br /> <br /> I did not get back 75 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think this is because I'm hard to reach a 10-line comment. How many times are there to say that this is waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film seems to be making high levels of gambling and gambling in the world. , And jokes puke. Characters are flat. The parody of "swinging the alphabet", especially through the tube, A - E, does not know where and where to go "F", the obvious "dysplasia". The tour does not work for the first time through the intestines to the estimate landing, only the following. <br /> <br /> Throughout the board, you expect from the "Out-South Park" Stone and Parker, who are not able to recognize the whole picture of you and who is not funny. It's fun if you're too much. Otherwise, it is not.
