The film is very disappointingly bad and I can not believe it at any time. Directing, editing, production, and script appear to have been made by junior high school students who are not familiar with all the movies. There is no story stream that creates any sense. The big emotional movements and the climax (like the first one between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the role of the character (as much as it initially suggests) come from where they come from, and they are not more beautiful and more efficient. The characters have made it harder to have any relationship with us. Acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible masterpiece cancels relatively convincing shows. This film is a particularly bad T.V. Plays as a Western / epic and tries to tell a sad story (true) story. I saved this film in the case of many Australians about this issue. All is well, but the movie is not good because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon. No one is saying good thing about this matter. Pearl Harbor tells Americans a very important historical event, but it's going to save the film and it's still bad because it's not good. Though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look, there is a failure around.
