I feel pretty safe to say that it is always the worst movie, I know from the second on the TV when I see the trailer 1 This is a piece of **** and it is best to avoid it, but when some friends see this thing I caught something up, I walked into the movie but the cheapest to keep awake in the film I hoped it would be a couple of vvula. In today's worst jokes there are people who are acting like the weird looking baby and a horny gangsta and the hilarious race jokes as we often see people who are called "jokes" in this movie. The film is clear and the story is not only impossible to believe, but speculative and dull. The characters are very annoying and heavy. I never want to see this **** movie again, I'd rather take the bullet to step than reveal this piece of brick pieces again. If anyone I see says they liked I would physically punch them to the face
