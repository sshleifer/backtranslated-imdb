This thing is pretty dating today. Received from the book by Ronna Jaffis for TV; We travel and stumble through the existence of a fantasy. Four college students play a live version of the board game mazes and dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, dive into the deepest fantasy world. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crouchon and Chris Makeepes will release the game's four games. The supporting cast includes the leading actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> Today, it is the worst and the worse. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks among his "Blossom Buddies" salad days and his big splash with SPLASH on the silver screen. The viewer will get much happiness at the youngest age.
