This series may be better if they just made a simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head Instead of Code Name: Tree. The diamond character needs a person who can perform a romantic role that has proven to McChry, a love hi series. Roy Thinds, the original Diamond Head, is really in the role. The machine is not really good as a bad guy. She did not change her mind that France was Neuen's character, the too-sink, her luckless victim or the hard and ready-to-fight woman. When she played the role of Diamond Head Girlfriend, she eventually earned her payment. After seeing the episode or both, I ended up without knowing what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot of hatred, but Diamond Head gives us nothing like that. Unfortunately, in the 1970s the spy genre was in the 1960s.
