Blood Drug Dr Tom Drake (Norman Bartolt) begins with Dean Estate of the now deceased Christopher Dean (John Caradine), when he arrives when he arrives with Gregory (Jeff Marrow) & his wife Laura (Merry Anders), Victoria (Faith Domargue), Johnny (Richard Davallows) plus Leslie (Brook Mills) and her Faula Charles Eisenberg (John Smith). Drake is tape recording of father's wishes eventually after his death, the value of the estate is divided equally among his four children with 136 million dollars, and if any dies then the money will be split evenly between the rest & all the Fragile Servants Elga (Ivy Betan), Igor (Buck Cartier) & Francis (John Russell), who is the foremost, dies Amandi was in the pocket. Well, not anyone who is satisfied with a quarterly share of $ 136 million (it still has a return of nearly $ 35 million which does not sound too bad for me) Anyone decides that they want it all & not long before turning in heads. <br /> <br /> Roy Monson was co-written and directed by Blood Legacy, and disappointed me on both accounts. The original title legacy of Blood for the Starters is a hidden horror film directed by Andy Millynn in '78 I always wanted to see, which were two images gradually mixed with the stories & I checked in the screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited and on as I said it was the film of Milligan I'm sitting on the director's list and it's really looking to see it & John Caradine's voice is not the Milligan film I would like to see then, my heart drowned. Then, of course, the simple yet undeniably straight forward is that it's the worst overall piece that is literally painful to watch at the blood legacy times. Monson & Eric Norden script is slow, boring & very predictable. The disgusting nature of a servant who asks his sister (?) The unpleasant of the character, the stupid brotherhood of sisters & sisters is not the harder but harder than ever to hold any tension or mystery Hoodunit story, but then you can expect an awful twist in the first 10 minutes is. It's boring to see, it is poorly displayed & think about it is just a function. Please save me that this is really bad. <br /> <br /> Director Monson I never say that he does not work with the budget that exists or that he does not direct traffic. The whole movie looks ugly, it's poorly taken and the atmosphere or scare. Blood & Gore is soft, a head, a tiger head, a person scene, a killer by someone was killed by someone's face by piranha. There are question marks on this scene, so the victim is correct. Piranha's crib is right, right. The victim is placed in the piranha tank on the right side of the head. The victims of the pilgrims should face the victims. <br /> <br /> Technically blood legacy is horrible, it looks awful, the sound is clearly shot live & it is difficult to take into consideration & terrible conversation is perhaps a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> Blood Legacy is a terrifying film, if it is not really a single positive thing or I can not think of it there. Love yourself & do not worry about this, there are good pictures.
