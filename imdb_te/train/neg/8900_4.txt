I liked the first film, but this is an example of a sequel to the left of the drawing board. The simple idea in the first film, then not great, then at least is very interesting. The sequel seeks to build on the idea and characters from the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous. If you do not see any of these movies, get the first movie and forget about the sequels, removing the original from the original.
