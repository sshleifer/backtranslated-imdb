The hell out of me are big bugs, they say they take Duke's orders. But she is talking to him German. <br /> <br /> 2 Beroei gives more feeling that the comedy actor is not a mild detective. <br /> <br /> While playing the comedy in the film, the character is not fit for him. <br /> For most stereotypes / speculative matters. <br /> If you do not notice that, I think it's a good movie to watch TV at any time. But I do not suggest renting it.
