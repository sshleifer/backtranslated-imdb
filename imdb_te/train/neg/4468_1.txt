If you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), stay away from Legend, simply and simpler. <br /> This is still a very disappointing TR game. It's great, it's great, but it's totally absent and I've given it up. <br /> It's easy. TR Anything before any PC game. You control Lara using the keyboard. Controls are standard in 6 Tomb Raider games. In AOD they are 'nonsensical', but still the same general control scenes. In the Legend they changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally unrestrained. <br /> I've seen comments from people who say 'use mouse'. No, why am i Others say 'use a gameplay'. No, why am i Others say, 'But for years the 3rd person is standard for controlling' Well, I do not care, it's not standard for any other TR game, so why is confusing. Oh, I know that they do not care less about their genuine, loyal fans because they want to make money in new children who have not heard about the series until the movies come and earn more money. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fans is to stay away from this game and complain to Eidos if you buy it. I mainly saw the mass of other posts on the Eidos Discussion Forum, what they say is worse, maybe they can hear it.
