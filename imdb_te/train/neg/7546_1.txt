I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work in this film. I could not believe other reviews and felt bad at least once ... but trust me, it was. <br /> I did not see the old movie. But why do they want to remake this film? The basic idea of ​​a good horror film is that it must have a very clever script or have a lot more graphic. This film does not come down to them and is just dumb. I've been looking at something that I would be interested in at some point, but it never did. <br /> <br /> The horror movie is not a huge number for fans and cage fans. Perhaps it might be for you to perform on television.
