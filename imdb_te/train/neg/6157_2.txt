Oops, this is definitely one of the nightly sleeps, I surf the channels and rocked this stinker of the film. For some of the cast members, I hoped for a better film. I was almost ashamed to see Oscar winner F. Murray to reduce such a terrible piece of Abraham. I hope the money is valuable. Students talk about fencing as they talk about survival in battle or talking about a terrible accident. I mean, I fenced it, it was a fun sport, but I never did that. The only reason I've seen this whole movie is because the drop down under the remote sofa and I was too lazy to get back to it.
