My husband and I were amazed by entertainment - a violent personal life solves crime for a strong-famed southern woman LAPD. The first season must watch TV for us. Unfortunately, in the second season, the stories of her personal life have become very unpleasant and inalienable for the strong role that we have stopped watching. <br /> <br /> The fact that my husband and I are suffering from the episode that I'm trying to hide from her is the fact that her mother was cut off. But when the deal breaker hides her pregnancy from her wife, she tells her boss. Why is a strong, middle-aged woman doing such things? The answer is not her. In addition, my husband and I choose a bad guy with accurate accuracy. It is a white man or woman who is introduced in a murder scene or in a guest role in an ideal family. The authors of the script can not do something originally? As I said, we are no longer viewers. We prefer demonstrations that betray characters and insult our intelligence.
