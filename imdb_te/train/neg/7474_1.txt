Although I was a fan of this genre, this program did not do that for me. The main point of my disappointment is that there is no single scene that does not dominate the main character. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that I should leave my criticism because I am a film critic, but in the IMDB state guidelines you have to be 10 lines of commentary. It reminds me of Hudson Hack as the main character is in every scene, and I hope that the program's authors can use some different variations to stay in touch with viewers. I do not doubt the cast and crew's talent, after seeing things like "wire", I hoped for great stuff from the cop drama.
