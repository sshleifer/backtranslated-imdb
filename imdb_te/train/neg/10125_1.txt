<br /> You can not describe just how bad these words are. <br /> <br /> Robert Lorry is a pretty good actor in 40 years - but he is phoneing it here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said in a scene that he and Batman were going home from the car and that his horn was so tight that it was doubling from the camera camera range! Duncan himself seems to be a motorcycle hood than a boy's miracle - in fact he waits to leave a man in his thirties to wear a big cape. Dynamic pair does not put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that Bruce Wayne's car they're driving - in fact actually serials many characters across it - looks like rolled off a lot of honest al-used car below the sticker price which is driving the Batmobile. <br /> The acting is wood - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrific and the script they follow. "The Utility Belt of Batman is made of thin fabric without any clear pouches to capture its gadgets - In a scene Batman has hit the full size, producers do not see again when the scene begins. <br /> (I'm not making it up)), Batman substitutes counterfit radiotherapy as an alternate, which will break into flames for the second time, which will be broadcasted to some hoods, which he can detect - because it is not so flammable. A cardboard Batman packed up - because the boxes pushed the boxes to cope with the thickness of six ounces, and was able to cope with it - and soon the whole area was flooding the ground. <br /> In another scene, Batman halted the passenger motorway somewhere And carry his car - the man left, the police must be limited because the Batman car, he's going to buy another one! Yes, you guessed, the car looked a little in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ - She was forced to notice Batmobile outside of Bruce's house - or maybe Batman and Robin are clearly in the densely populated suburban neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Everything about this serial is bad - and the youngest of all viewers would like to drink on the screen. If you're looking for a bad movie - if you can not get a good mark - Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman TV series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman serial.
