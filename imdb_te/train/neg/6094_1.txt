I'm in agreement with writing this review for a lot of reasons: <br /> It's undoubtedly, the list of the worst films of all time - which it deserves to be 3) I There was a lot lucky - I paid five pounds. I have seen in stores for 15 pounds. Do not pay for this movie! You are very angry 4) There are so many movies in the style of the hilarious, which can not give a fair rating (according to my opinion) and give it a higher rating than criminals. Plot Summary: A non-friend joins a trunk that promises to the world - the magic ability that looks like everyone else. Our hero cunningly turns into a young girl and joins their gang - swing, sitting sitting down. <br /> He kills them one by one until the police keep track of it. <br /> Why is it bad? The performance is very bad before. Someone is compared to a school product. <br /> <br /> I bought a number of previously banned images from the DVD company Vipco and I was not disappointed. D. Okay, acting is very bad but the movie does not deliver in the sense of each other. What is the point to make this film when there is no gore! OK, no gore. What can a movie like this offer Breats? <br /> <br /> The film may have a specific charm in its distinctive breath but the potential buyer / wacher is a good one, only one in ten.
