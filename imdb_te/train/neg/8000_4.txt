Critics and some viewers claim that it is a sarcasm, has many political and social messages, and the names refer to other names. I can not understand such things (I do not want to do it anymore) because I'm not interested in it, I'm interested in the film. The film also said that the film was again brilliant and dramatically powerful. In the second sense, we could not see anything in the monitored movies except in the office. Yes, the scene says a little about humanity, but it's good for the movie. This film is entertaining (mild) and exciting in a few moments or scenes, but more than that. Visual effects for this film's biggest flaw. I could not quite mix it because I imagined a surprising monster that it was not one of the old Gogiara films, it happened in 2006, but it is not. If you do not believe that there is a monster, you do not care. If you agree with me about this, I highly recommend you a very real cloverfield. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least as expected, is hard work. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's a thriller or play rather than play, but it does not mean it's dramatically powerful. I do not like to compare the host with other monster movies, but I mean the host does not do something that does not make other monster movies. By the way, some people want to become a film because their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I love Asian cinema too, but this is true.
