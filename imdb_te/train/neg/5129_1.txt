The message of the film is "Personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofah is considered "Ugly Duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not all ugly (actually she is more attractive than a model that looks like Uma Thurman). <br /> <br /> Now, is the film "Ugly Duckling" really unattractive? Will Hollywood break with this hypocrisy? <br /> In my opinion, this film is just ridiculous to send a message. <br /> <br />
