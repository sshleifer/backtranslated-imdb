Simon Peg, a weird brilliant idiot Brit Sidney Young who works as a leading journalist in the US comedy. After a very lucky break, he is driven by the credibility of Jeff Bridges in New York in the highly respected Sharks Magazine. This is Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Kirsten Dunst, who works well with peg for lovely love interest, but they do not fit the screen with their hobbies. <br /> <br /> When trying to make Sidney decide he should forget his journalistic principles to get some emotional challenges in the magazine. Of course he was eventually attracted by glitches and glamor of celebrities young actor Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of Dead, Hot Fuzz and Shawn, who are emptying, feel that Pegg has never experienced him ever since he has experienced similar experiences in the film, and Run Fat Boy Run, one of the UK's best comedies, is wasted in the US. /> <br /> All this is an unforgettable comedy. Please come back to Simone, forgive and forget.
