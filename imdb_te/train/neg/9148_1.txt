I was looking at the bottom of the index 100 because I had never seen the end of the unexpected because of Plan 9 or the Roller Ball Remake was wrong. <br /> This is the number one I've ever seen in many countless movies I've seen. Bad Direction, Bad Characters, Horrible Acting, Horrible Story No One But Sam has always been a reason to say anything positive about this movie. Sam is a terrifying actor but his direction is very bad, he can break Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Director is unlikely to give me at least 1 star, but the stars that it deserves to be shy.
