The picture is not good for the book, the book is good. Where was it shot? *** This is my first visit to your site ... No answer to my question found. So now I'm like a dummy, but I've submitted my comments yet. And yes, why was British Columbia taken off *** or its South Carolina coastline? (This question exists) The book's fabric needs this space and is part of my disappointment with the image of its change. Oh, I read at least ten lines. My other major problem with the picture is here. Kim Bissenzar is very good in all the things I've shot from the book. I book, book and film; Not so good. I found the character more sympathetic in the book. The book also triggered the ancient and oldest images of Monastries. The film "Castle" is quite visually impressed, which distorted the feel of the story and seemed uneven with the characters.
