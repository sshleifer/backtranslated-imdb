Have I ever seen or heard about this junk-movie? It was my thin with a bloody teen kill, a laughing theme and an irresistible 80's cheese-climate surrounding it. Because nobody really is interested, the staff and students of a high-profile Catholic University are weakening with an unknown mental illness. Julie Parker, a recently-recruited mentor, participates in all the people who have been together with him as dead or strangely behaving. This film is funnier! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and each character does not mean equals to others. For example, a girl was murdered and her body poured in a container. Then, and without reason, the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murder girl never mentioned or never missed. She is not even her boyfriend! Acting is bad and does not have nudity to enjoy. The killer's revelation is very funny because the makers are really convinced that the original twist is ... it's not the boys! "Publish University" is easily one of the worst horror-turkeys ever.
