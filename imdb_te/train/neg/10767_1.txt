This most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but never seen the worst day light ever. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and it shows the boy. All of us have done everything as a group of overdose dope fiends and morons. It does not mean what the soul means to be Canadian, and this is supposed to cause funding for this bunk. In reality the British character is normal. The rest of the sitcom stereotype's crop - you're the "norm !!" Can you say Cinematography is pretty up to murky indoor photographs from postcard images. Actors always seem to be fidgetting. Are they bored as a viewer, or is it the director's cinema cinema? Avoid this confusion and check some of Bruce McDonald's films. The real Canadian boy cinematically say anything original. You will not be forced to run his movies after 10 minutes.
