When the direction of Mercury is indicated that it is not directly in the ground, it turns the fire away. <br /> It's Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. He is able to keep his mind in the business of hand and on the runaway son, Corin Nemek. <br /> <br /> Here is a villain, Peter Boyle, Peter Boyle, who is a CEO of a multi-national organization, Admiral Charlton Heston, Matthewson's father and grandfather of Nemec, who takes care of the personal attention of family troubles. This crisis is trying to control the world food supply. He never thought of the idea of ​​survival. <br /> <br /> The Solar Crisis 2001, A Space Odyssey, and Voyage the Bottom of the Sea is a bad combination. Boyle appears to be taking his cue from Jenny Hackman as Superman in Lex Luthor, who finds himself in a turkey and loses it accordingly. </ P> <p> The remaining cast is weak, true blue and dull. Perhaps the desert rat Jack Fleance, Nemak finds and cares for him. <br /> <br /> Here the film is directed by Hollywood Premier Allen Smithi. The actor received four stars for cast and timed out for Thanksgiving dolls.
