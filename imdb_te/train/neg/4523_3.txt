When the film was released, it was one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx sticks. It does, but it makes a mesmerizing sort of way. Actors silly, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgad as Egyptians? There is not enough makeup in Cairo, at least this film is not taken. But it's rather fun to see them try. Performances run mates from over-the-top from mommy (sorry, clear observation). Leslie-Anne Down's character seems to have found Egypt on her map, much less of its archaeological wealth. It is at least some really bad writing, at least one of the curses that every visitor of the film visits on. It is my opinion that the source of their basis from some subtle things, such as cursed films or Egyptopathy, morphed into the source of silence and comprehension. It does not disappoint, and the combination is a double whammy proof. This plot is a driving source for dramatic tension: is Dumbre and less believable? The answer, in general, is YES. Position shots are beautiful and set design is generally very good, and it is only fixed reminders that some are not a low-budget product. The fact that many famous faces are serving in such a random launcher. Cheap, no; Cheesy, yes.
