The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" had a campy charm: it begins with the text from the Bible (Samuel Jackson writes for victims of the victims in "Pulp Fiction"), two karate school teachers in New York argue about the eternal question of humanity (who is better? Chiba or Bruce Lee?), Then Chibba will play himself; He immediately halts an airplane hijacking and breaks two bottles with his arm. Unfortunately, no entertainment value, deliberately or unexpectedly, is immediately crushed by a tumultuous story, lack of long-term action, and poor quality of current action. <br /> <br /> This is why an inexpensive image to see "Bodyguard" is here: 1) You do not know what is going to happen. <br /> <br /> There are no struggles. <br /> <br /> Juddy Lee is brilliant, her face is brilliant, and I give 10th to the Bodyguard for the film 87 minutes It's up to 5 hours.
