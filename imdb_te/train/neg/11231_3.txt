I love low budget independent films and there are high hopes for this one. But this film is stable. Never ignore the productivity value of its budget, but the pace is worse. However, these folks have achieved very little, but the film has failed at a very basic level. It's tasty. Editing glacier and pacing stalls. It should be 65 minutes. The great thing about Dr. Jekel is that Mr Hyde is almost insufficient. He has a very dramatic likelihood. Instead we suffer from dithering the Baltimore-Brits stammer by endless and tiresome exposition. <br /> <br /> Production is a collective effort for everyone, but a tired punch requires a kick and Funky should be given a fresh low budget technology. Voice. Instead it is just a pseudonym.
