If the Todd Sheets comes out and the film is intended to fill the zombie genre, I'll change my rating to eight. Each scene, line, and every acting nuance will try to imagine a parody movie. I probably could not rewrite the alphabet soup out of the saddle, the letters left, and still have a good script. I thought about the two scenes in particular. Spoiler warning! When Mike's father and other father walked, I would make a staircase jam filled with zombies. Although this is small step down and they are brush against flailing the dead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former turns around the ocean, "God you're a horn bastard", and only one shoots. Another is in the Military Complex. The girl prevents a zombie with a machete and is immediately around. The camera moves around for about forty seconds around him. She almost runs from a crowded audience and collaborates with other humans. Spoiler warning! We need to see these scenes. However, I enjoy this movie almost joking because it is very funny. Kudos to drive tad sheets to make most people in his image and do anything but it is really something to do.
