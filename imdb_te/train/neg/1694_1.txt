The film is scary in commercials, but the original film may cause vomit. It is lower than the lower average (less than that) and no plot. I mean every house is afraid you can feel and feel, a dead Japanese woman might intimidate you poop out, but what? Make a view to appeal to viewers and do not show images of horrified people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "Samara (ring) terrible angry"? I do not start with a dead child. That's not scary! What is that? He's a cat and he has a big freaking deal, that's it mimic! Save some lives that just have the potential to harm the poor zombies and grudge through the grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
