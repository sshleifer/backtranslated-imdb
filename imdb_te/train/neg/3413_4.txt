1st watched 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Carne Comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. The film is based on credits, based on the earlier Italian film, but rewritten by two well-known American romantic comedians. But this did not compare with Charles Shire & Nancy Meyers by their other attempts. The story is about a couple of Americans passing down and out down who hopes to make a fortune in the gift money after seeing a statement in the paper for Duchsund reunited by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stunned the story. After attempting to return it, they see a hand-sticking hand from a garage door in a lady who believes that they are attached to the rest of the body of the woman who wants to give herself. They are freaking out and telling the truth that they can make it like runaways from the scene that comes in contact with the police and killing them. The other characters in the film meet in the train before and Monte Carlo hanging around the gambling resort. Other actors include character stars John Candy, James Balloons, Cybill Shepard, George Hamilton and others. After learning about the death of the police, they start questioning the main characters and in fact, their spy need to work to identify what really happened. There are a few funny moments provided by the balloon / shepherd couple who have been mentioned above, but the role of the preceding character may come out of the medieval state of the film. This is not a horrible movie, it's not good. There are plenty of average movies and another one for this file. Try it out, maybe you'll like it, maybe you're not.
