I had to admit that I was a great fan of this event, so I saw this movie and how frustrated I was. First, I think the plot is awful, Arnold fathers or even more interesting to see what's more interesting, but I think it's interesting, but it's a man who wants to destroy Arnold's house between many places. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the plot is not so bad , But the actions of Arnold and his friends to stop this maniac, friends of the spy ; Many people have already tried and died, but Arnold, Gerald and hell, because they make the bus drive (for the sake of God), and all the more worse, they make super moves in the bus <br /> Honestly, my mother, my Sister, after seeing this movie, I was very disappointed, 'It's the worst way to complete a good cartoon. I say "Hey Arnold!" I've enjoyed it, which is one of my favorite cartoons in Nickelodeon, but after this trick of the movie, I'm "Hey Arnold!" I'm not sure how much I'm going to see. <br /> <br /> "Oh, and please, if you compare all of your future films from good cartoons, do not make more movies, Honestly, I thought this is the worst way to end this show, the worstly changed performance of the movie.
