The film is portrayed by Sir Christopher Strong (played by Parliament Member - Colin Clive) and Amelia Ehar Hart, played by Catherine Hepburn. Until they meet, he is a very devoted husband, but when he encounters an odd or attractive Hepburn, he "can not help himself" and they fall in love. You say, because they are far away from the place and talk about how painful they are in their incomplete love. Frankly, this is a terrible dating and practically impossible picture to watch. Part of the problem is very common in pre-code days, glamor of adultery. Plus, even if you accept this morbid suspicion, the full sympathy of the dialog will make it sound like a 19th-century romance novel ... and it's really bad. This time it makes a big waste of time (after all, Clive's wife is a good woman and nobody has done any harm) who love adhesive and characters. The interesting feature of the film is that Hepburn dressed in a moth costume in an opening scene! You're looking to believe it - and she's like Bugaloos (a subtle, but fit reference).
