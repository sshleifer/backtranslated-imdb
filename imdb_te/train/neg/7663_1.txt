An intellectual, Christian slater (usually great) like the Tara Reed Constantine and Stephen Dorf as the Dollar Store ... well this Stephen Darf for the Sake Christ !!!! I personally just want to thank those wonderful casting directors for hard work and effort. You're guys. This film shows my humble opinion of people when it goes, but it follows directly with your previous choices, a film about the most brilliant pulse-physicist in history, finding a cat to cure all the known diseases of the man and play by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I know that you guys love it. Even if you owe me $ 7.50 seriously.
