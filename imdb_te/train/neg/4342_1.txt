This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They have a pretty good storyline to go, but in chaos it's messed up. First of all cast all the fault, where the van peeble (btw the worst actor) and puff daddy come from ??? It looks like it came from Carlito Hood, and some are used to hang with real idiots. The film "Carlito's Way" does not do any justice. If I saw this worst for the first time, as I gave the Pacino version ever, the sequel "Carlito's Way" first came. And anyway, Pacino reads this story, thinks it's worse and sequel. Carlito's Way: Power to Rice - 1 to 10. Carlito's Way - 10 out of 9.
