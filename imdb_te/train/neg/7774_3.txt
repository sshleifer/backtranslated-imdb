For a good half hour, I remember thinking: "Hey, this is the best accomplishment of Bill Ribbane!" Early sequences weather, soon there are some scary moments and our director also refers to his own brutal stinker "Giant Spider Invasion" in a fun way. Unilaterally stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", three old and most boring millionaires were filled with a discrete building that won nine of the defeats in a discrete game of $ 1,000,000. Obviously, participants quickly and indirectly disappear, and the grievous boneheads take a long time before the old murderers realize the monks, or they have another murderer. The movie begins and ends with an odd storyteller telling a lot of intellectual stuff that is not relevant to the plot, but the first ten minutes of that worship Bimbo (Shelley, I believe she is known to be some nice T &) is really hilarious. After the first half hour, naturally occurring is mandatory and turns a textbook "Cold" turns the retained plot, the lack of ever dumbest dialogues and enthusiasm in the absence of a rebebane-product. Bloody murder scenes are not in any budget but our multi-talented director (?) Attempts to replace disco dance girls and an endless footage of an amateur rock band. The film also has four or five different climax and some of them have a bit of satisfaction. Perhaps it was an inspiration for LOTR: King Return? Avoid this picture, you will live longer and happily.
