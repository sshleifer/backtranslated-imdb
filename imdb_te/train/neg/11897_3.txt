In harmony with William Muststig's "Maniac", Tom Sawini's amazing effects and spinel's persuasive performance, "Maniac" never became a cult hit. The "Vigilant" is directed badly, which refers to everything for you, imaginable at every turn and the casual performances of all the actors. This film gave me judgment from the concept of "Deja Vu", Lustig has seen so many times "Death Wish" before doing this! (* 1/2)
