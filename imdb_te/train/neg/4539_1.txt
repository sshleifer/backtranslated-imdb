For a while I have never seen a horror like this film. The film is boring, long and awful plot. Special effects suck like hell - it was like watching a movie in 1999. It's an hour and a half in my time waste. Mathew Settle's performance is very bad. I saw him playing Lt.Speirs in the band of brothers, he was not bad. Not actually bad. But in this film, his performance is not sufficiently convincing, it is very bad and there is no chemistry between the rest of the members. Moreover, his eyes are empty as he does not feel. It was a surprise to me because he was good at the band of brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is not even difficult to see. It's big big waste of time. If you do not kill an hour or two, do anything else to watch this movie. Trust me, you regret it!
