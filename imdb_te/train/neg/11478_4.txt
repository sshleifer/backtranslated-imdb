I am surprised that the critics have given IMDb a high rating of this TV movie. It has been a harmless, sweet, uncomplicated clich√© of a movie with two big names (one of whom did a good job) from the past, but this film reeks low budget work and we can see any day of the week less cable channels. I like good love, as well as anyone, but my wife, as I see - and before we've rated the rating - we say that their faith, their comfort level or their cultural priorities are challenging (and that's an example from her), but it's an amusing hour. More than this one, in fact, look at a long line of another woefully inadequate holiday movies look at Family Stone looking forward to this schl.
