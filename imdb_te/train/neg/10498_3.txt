I caught this at a test screening. All I can say: what is ... hell? The film is smooth when reading Mickey Mouse script for "Scarface". It is foolish to make a bit less sense; <br /> <br /> In this story crocodile hunter Steve Irwin attempts to "save" a crocodile. A CIA probe. After the CIA comes back after Irwin's investigation, Irvine makes them guilty of hunters and sets out to "stop" them. <br /> It's all about stories; The rest are the Australian culture ("Didda That That?" And "Krici!") And the strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin fights with a fast RV and knife and fights with a CIA agent. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's sword fights an individual on an RV. Be your guide for this funniest bad image.
