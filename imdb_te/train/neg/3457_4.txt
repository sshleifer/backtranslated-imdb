The film is made from my home town. <br /> <br /> The story is set to complete a group of filmmakers to relax, not having completed 20 years after a film - terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> The storyline is weak and you must remember that this is comedy and you have to hold a little tight in the cheek, but it does not have an original womb. It is good to recieve brief information about them, and it does not matter, but it is good to see Kyley's accent and the kid who went to school in the role I played, but it does not redeem the movie. Due to this (it's sort of 80 movies <br /> The actors seemed to be acting too much, some of these children (especially two mainstream chicks - played as "Director" and "Producer" ) They were trying to act. It's not always good. Moreover, the shots have a hard feel about them. Maybe lit up? <br /> The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors, and some scenes. I did like the movie, but it was not so great. It lasted for 90 minutes, but was less. It would have been better if they tightened the script. They have been killed by many characters - but not actually destroyed them. It may be better if they kill fewer people and are concentrated in scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Now I know that it is funny and funny stuff. Or they are funny and they are not funny. <br /> <br /> "
