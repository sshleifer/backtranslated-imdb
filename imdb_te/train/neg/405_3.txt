If you are surprised by the special effects, it is worth watching this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> The story is not worth the story. It is like doing a brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to start with. It's not original, it's not very special. So do not go for the story. <br /> As mentioned, the end came slightly sleek, invisible (and occasionally half-invisible) melting the purity of man's great FX treatment. <br /> If you ignore "standard" pyrotechnics, it is a view to see (or not). <br /> <br /> For all, it is a good FX image.
