Debbie Reynolds runs through this simple thriller featuring thumbs-tamps, tangos and, yes, this simple fictional '30th atmosphere. Try to start their lives by running a dance dance school for totes in Hollywood, where both Ladies and their sons have been killed. Problems, one of them suffer from nerves. Can you imagine this thing 10 years ago when Robert Aldrich directed Bettie Davis and Jon Crawford? Nahh, Bette Johann has not allowed many screen tights to make her a stupe, and can not imagine Bette Davis in the other role, just hit her heart. It is a perfectly tricky piece by Hungry Farrell (the idea of ​​a good "shock" by preparing a group of rabbits band-mass). The honest fun in an entire teepid package is not an ounce. **** from * 1/2
