This applies to review not as a warning to potential audiences. It is a typical ghost story about an actress who haunted a studio during a WWII period drama filming. There is no fear, no suspense, no wonder. A shocking moment that looks a bit too silly in astonishing way. The visual style is very flat and dull, although there is some good editing once. The story does not always come together, and the movies are really just a total fall. 4/10.
