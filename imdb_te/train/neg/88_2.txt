I have watched this movie too. Its good family image; However, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team gains a good job, the film is much better. There are so many scenarios. I hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But if I do one, I'm asking them to take good care of editing. This story is located throughout the place and not a center. Other films in this series are very good because of the unfortunate thing. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; They have two great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the audience always enjoy a good love story.
