Today I've rented the VHS "they all laughed". I do not have any information about this film, but I liked the list suggestions in its cover, it is too old and too much used VHS It's less and I risk it And decided to buy. I searched for IMDb, and the user rating of 6.0 is an excellent reference. I've seen "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow four stars! So I decided that I did not waste much time and did not see it immediately. In fact, I finished watching "They laughed all" and I found a very boring overlayed image. The characters are well developed, and I have spent several minutes trying to understand their characters in the story. The plot is thought to be funny (they are private eyes falling in love with the women they are chasing), but I did not laughed out the whole story. In a huge city like New York, it's coincidentally ridiculous. An attractive and very seductive man, Ben Ghazara, is very ridiculous because she has fallen for her, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney. Eventually, most attractions have the presence of Dorothy Stratten's Playboy Center Fold and Playmate, which killed her husband after her release, and her life is "Star 80" and "Death of a" Centerfold: The Dorothy Straten Story "; Sexy Cotton Hansen is a fantastic future , Ms. Keith Richards in the future, the most wonderful, the fifth two months Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60s and has been known as "The King" by his fans, although I do not like him, (Manly Dorothy Stratten). <br /> <br /> The title (Brazil): "Muuto Riso e Uyita alegriya "(" laughs laughs and lots of Happiness ")
