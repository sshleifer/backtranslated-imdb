Tim Robbins has been cast as a garage mechanic in the 1950s New Jersey, and he falls in love with a perticact blonde who has become a niece of Albert Einstein! Although he is on the screen more time, Robins transforms into his inner function and in the background of his extreme personality (he can not even forget the movie!). Lumpy Romantic comedy with a gimmick, Walter Matt plays Einstein (he can do with a cartoonily imagined role). Otherwise, it directed rather thicker by sugar and sunny, Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart but intellect or brains. Meg Ryan is her typical friendly self and her sister and her older brother are chemistry affectionate between her and Robins. ** from **
