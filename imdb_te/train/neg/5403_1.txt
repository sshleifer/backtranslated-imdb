<br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula to repeat any creature. In their laboratory (running a warehouse in L.A.), they created T-Rex. <br /> In fact T-Rex (a rubber puppet) starts loose and wiping. Cast. <br /> <br /> A person has a fantastic ability to get back 2 or 3 feet away without notice, and then fasten their head. <br /> <br /> A member of a cast member escapes in a police car and aims through the city driving the rest of the picture. She has the best psychological ability to operate the radio. <br /> <br /> T-Rex has been destroyed throughout the city, where there are gun battles and buildings (cardboard mock-ups), but not a police car, or army, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> This activity should be common in Los Angeles.
