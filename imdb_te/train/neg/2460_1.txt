I really wanted to like this film, but I never gave it a chance. It is meant to be a spinal pump with a hip hop theme, but it has failed miserably. It's written and acted with high school kids for some school project, and it seems to be a joke. There is a delicate and more ridiculous, it never feels like a documentary. <br /> <br /> It recommends people who love "humor" in the vein of "Big Mommas House" or "Norbit"; words like "but" People who think that they are suddenly funny is to be away and other people should not get away and waste their time.
