The film was really enjoyed by Gregory Girl many years ago. This is obscured. This teacher's teacher and his friend were 14-15 years old girls spread out in very small garments. Previous commentators seem to think that this does not matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children in school, the last thing you want to think is that every younger mentor will be angry after his students. We are surprised that by the sensor. Apart from that the film is just wasting time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair tried very hard to recreate his school pictures, from a little incomplete and from the wall. Why is it so wonderful that anyone would like to have a serious sexual desire after him in this show. This film has failed me to count all the counts. Dreadful. Please do not look at your time. Life is very small
