As others have said, it was a fantastic hammer-style film and it seems to me how most of the actors are ordered to play ... but the screenplay is very strong, at times of extreme pace and the most dull soliloquis (poor Timothy Dalton gets heavier than most of them) self-important. Although he is a weak performance from Dalton, Dr. Rock finally silently tries to see what he has done, nailing quietly. The well-liked actor Patrick Stewart looks pretty. Freddie Frances may be a great cinematographer, but he is a secular director.
