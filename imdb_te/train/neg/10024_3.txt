The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially Hollywood inspired) need to know - does not just sell 'style'. I do not expect Tulsi if you understand the style. Secondly, if you're selling a style hello bent, it does not have a good story. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> But it is not soft. For example, Saif, Kareena and Akshay - Three stories are in different places in the story. But this setup is not used properly. A good mix and match of their commentary. There are scenes from the seventies. <br /> <br /> Motion picture is awful. I'm sleeping through this movie with the glorious merchant. Vishal-Sekhar has brought good scoring but this is not the film. Why is Sufi song (Dil Harah) in Tashan? Why is not the cold hinglish song (Dil Dance Marie) in English crazy Anil Kapoor? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the savior of this film. But he is in his stereotypes. Is this picture missing?
