I give the original Soviet version of this film not giving this 3 score. The American-International (studio, which specializes in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s) purchased the film and completely destroyed it - a two minute plus film slicing as a 64-minute film! Additionally, there is a lot of new stuff (like "monsters") in 64 minutes - so this film is almost unparalleled. The original drama about the Soviet invasion is the original film - I'm not really sure first! For insight into the original image, read Steven Nielt's review - it's very useful. <br /> <br /> In this way, I bought an American-International and a third "new" film that is ready to put just about anything on the screen provided by a buck rather than a third Soviet science film - to make a standard practice, It is the first place that does not cost them a lot more than a buck !! This American film is the first attempt to launch two opposing world powers (not US and Soviet). Try the tricky "bad guys" but fail and "good guys" idiot a hell of astronauts and then head to Mars. Unfortunately, temporarily they are temporarily alone on the Moon's moon, where they see some monsters (attached to the US-International), which are REAAALLY cheesy and have a similarity to some parts of a woman's anatomy. Then, they were rescued - going back to land leaders. <br /> <br /> The downtrophic film is said to have been shot - the most striking piece of art (for the time) grade-c film. Because of this, the Soviets really have a reason to hate America! I am surprised that I did not refuse to sell more movies for the film because of the terrible thing I did with this film! It's worth a look for a laugh, but there are really bad moments that make you laugh. So, the film is a worst - bad image is not bad enough to make sure to look for buffs and too dopey should be taken seriously. I really like to see this movie in its original form - it should be some movie.
