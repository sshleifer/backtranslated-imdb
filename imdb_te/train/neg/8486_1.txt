I feel that there is something original or interesting about this film. As a fan of science fiction as the next person, and even more than a monkey, I also enjoyed the old films in the comedy campus. (Eg, my radiant review of the changed states [1980]. <br /> <br /> Why do not I explain the monkey to take the basic idea back to the second one? <br /> Now, its flashing reviews are baseless <br /> <br /> The San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> The San Francisco Bay of the Guardian <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Held camera, a movie with a cheesy plot and effects that would be stupid, I know, I show this to journalists, Ada said about the concert.)
