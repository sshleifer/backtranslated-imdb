I'm not really sure how to start with one of the worst films that I've seen so long. Very clear and very clear agreeing with 1 day to anyone who has also visited London from setting ... London is not. Without a problem, Snippet's character was unable to run to the country. Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America, no grandmother in the earth agreed ... he is murderer! How well do you end up with that film, unfortunately that's not much better. We have British cops driving the incredible range of cars, Eighties Vauxhall Belmont, which I chased the taxi after the allotted, but before the first few scenes prison van escort I'm sure the modern Subaru Impreza. Killing the SO19 or Met's gun They are happy to be shot in the streets that are happy with their pistols along with CID along with sniping. Children are walking around, but does the police take a clear shot to shoot him? No it is not, I live there. We have a very frightening journey from central London to the airport (say Heathrow for arguments) within 5 minutes. We are also a young girl who is posher than the horrific American accents, Queen, but lives in Elephant & Castle. He was caught behind a few stairs when the British police did not find a snippet of helicopters and a large number of snipers. The train station is clearly not on the clay of the UK and the effects of the combat scene sound are terrible. The plot is very poor, boring and written and was shot several times a thousand times. But there are a few well-known actors in the film, what they are thinking and please do not let you watch this movie! This is a picture that you do not know what you want, and if you focus on dramatic topics after an allocation, then you need a strong sturdy plot with rigid scenery and setup, the viewer has time to take part in it and appreciate it and you'll notice if you make a mistake. If you want all Action Action movie (that is not) then it can be turned to continuity and scenery.
