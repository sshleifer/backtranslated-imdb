Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high ratings, this is an awful movie. Being scary enough, it is responsible for warning you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film was set in the end of the Raj during India's struggle for independence. What falls on the funniest platform fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and the characters that they behave are not convinced me that there are characters in that era. <br /> For instance, the Hindu housewife of the local villager deals with his married Englishman master, and the discovery of this affair is probably totally social gossip and insult. ? Possibility, but possibly. However, is the teenage Hindu housewife involved in hot outdoor sex at an open public scene of any time, as the half-naked Britney Spears in the Indian conservative society of that era? <br /> <br /> With such poor performances, such themes provoked me to leave an hour in the film, so the second half of the film. I hope there is more intelligence than I have seen in the first half.
