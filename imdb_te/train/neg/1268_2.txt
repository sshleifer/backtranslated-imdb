Oh what a blame movie! In Los Angeles, from the POO of Hollywood filmmakers Poo, the film seeks as a deep social commentary on contemporary American Aung. <br /> Stereotyped with wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds, cross paths in their everyday and heart lives. The plot is confusing. To keep going, like many acting structured movies: shooting through shooting, an abandoned baby, a lawyer, a gang of frightening thugs, a man flying at night in the night sky, kid at summer camp. <br /> All these events, in contrast to the characters in their life experiences, are constantly helping social "insights" presented through dialogue. One character tells another: "When we sit on the edge of the edge (Grand Canyon), we know what people are joking, the rocks laugh at me, I can tell myself and my sorrows. The Gulf is, and there is a rare abysmal between individuals and individuals. 't have ... this big hole is like opening in the ground, big ... Grand Canyon, and what is the pouring rage ... Rage is an eruption, and creates rage violence ... <br /> From side source From the appalling, lovely characters alongside terribly unnatural and forced conversations, the story's speed is slowly slow. Acting is enthusiastic and sensible. <br /> <br /> In this movie the tone is smug and self-satisfied, which is the script's contempt for audiences. <br /> <br /> This is a project project approved by Hollywood suits. They think their film will be a wandering clamor for us innocent, vague movie gears, eager to learn about the true meaning of American social change.
