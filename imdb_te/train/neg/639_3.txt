The clue of the shell-shocked soldier home from war is dull treatment here. With the acting, spectacular casting capabilities of their high talent, the reader can not redeem the 'Return of the Soldier' ​​from its hard-coled inability to move the emotional joke. Glenda Jackson is the best move by another reviewer when on screen; But Jackson's crackling is a good cinematic power that can not get the chestnuts of the film from its cold, never warm hot oven. Despite an unmistakable Middlesex voice, An-Marrt alleges that sex-kitten does not have a reputation for her reputation and her frequent performance, she is the real and most depth of capabilities wasted here. Hawking score, sludge-on sacririn emotion of many poor TV documentaries, odds with the script's emotional rumenium, correction, and directional overbaked formalism; With its scoring and grinding script and direction, 'The Return of the Soldier' ​​has all the right bits but fails to work together.
