I encountered renting movies based on IMDB reviews. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is definitely a Hasty, and we play his character with our Vu heart rate. On the other hand, the makeup of our wool (facial hair) I can not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager for Halloween, who finished with a $ 4.95 stick on the chin. <br /> <br /> The "dead" of the room is pretty good although there are special effects. POV shots from the fourth view looked more like Sam Raimi's trademark shots in the recent "Evil Dead" trilogy, the tree tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster film. The fireworks hi-hum and the final fight is dull to get you. (Of course, it reminded me of the "Lost in Space" episode, in which Robinsons were caught in a sandstorm ... <br /> The plot is not original and is said to be numerous in times of European fairy tales. No suspense and plot breaks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <p> <p> I have returned this film to Netflix, and then I am sitting. Write this review. The first thing I did was checking the product date. Yep, which says 1987 ... I thought it was not 1967. And pretty much it: Product values ​​and FX 1960s are typical. <br /> <br /> This theme is very old because Hollywood is actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> <br />
