I do not want to go on a song here, but ... the "worst" I've ever seen. Worse than Avengers. Ineffective direction, confusing writing and awful acting are only constant items. Very less video was filmed, it appears as a high school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a mic in the camera, but no one is worried about this thing. The plot is out of the way in the strange direction without the foundation or later, this technology is incompatible with technology, and editing is a tough knife. Being funny is not bad too. It's just bad. BTW, packaging is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> The Lion Gate owes me $ 4.00.
