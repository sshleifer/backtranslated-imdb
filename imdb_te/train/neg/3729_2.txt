I first saw this movie at age 7. I do not need to say that I'm scared from the mind. It's not scary but content because. Cam ... I'm 7. Anyway, cinematography is pretty wrong and acting cheesy. It is very painful, I only 7 and I remember it. One thing that still haunts me is that the chorus ends with a "horrible song" You're Back! "" We're all ready ". I do not suggest seeing it. I'm probably just for nostalgic reason. Moreover, the remake is great. However, the best part of the film is that everyone should be "dissapears"; The empty cars are crashing, the lanmomers are running their own ... are pretty fun.
