<br /> <br /> I have seen this picture for Nick Stall's record in the film. br> <br /> The film is funnier. The letters are INSANE, they are SO CLICK and STEREOTYPED. This film has some of the worst conversations I have ever heard. <br/> <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film, but the scenery: "Warm heart, cool gun" kills the bad girl in Nick install. (Well, actually they are all bad.) But his performance in the scene is amazing. Look at his face, which is my American Psycho (a good picture). The view is worth watching but the rest of the image is not worth seeing, do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
