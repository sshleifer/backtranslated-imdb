<br /> <br /> The night in a moonlight, in a remote research laboratory, is about a major medical breakthrough, but never read or you know the horrible fate of "Rodentz". Must have deadly results. A chemical compound created to "hunt and destroy" dangerous cancer cells has emerged from the hazardous waste disposal system in the basement of the building. Now, mice participating in the pottery mask are not mice, they become transition species. The new enzyme is now a leading bio-researcher to "new and highly destructive" formulation to reproduce for the length of time required to neutralize malignant cancer tumors. Three different levels of the new mixture are operated to three different mice and the rest are sunk in the wrong "waste disaster", resulting from scary side effects ... The worst image of the year. Everything about it is "low budget!", From the horror acting shakes up to some of the worst things I've ever seen. Clutch morons and law in the characters, stupid, predictable routes: walking for dark blue walks down, tripping and falling "rats" can meet with them, in a small room, etc. <br /> While some movies are made cheap, Really takes up the cake. Every possible corner, cutting everything from the back of previous shots, filming the "lab" hallway from different angles to make it look bigger (remember me - why are these two freakin 'only two boys working in a huge building? <br /> <br /> This is an exclusive influence on the workshop on children's workshop and special effects. The mice created by computer-generated rats are duplicates and are standing in every scene so they can see that they have created the computer in movie buffs, and that giant rat suit - oh my god !!!!!!!! seriously, we are a horrible beany baby To be confident that it is a monster? Just ptful ........ On the better side, some gore is exclusively focused on the budget <br /> <br /> All of the actors suck, no one who is involved in the product or they know what they are doing.I reviewed the time with the review, take my advice and trash it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/>] About DVD: The transfer sucks are still there to ask questions and commentaries, even if the film is made. It is very unpleasant stupid that three of these sub-human early slums should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I do not want to waste your reader's time or mine anymore, so I'm starting to remember more about this film than myself ... DVD rating: 1/10.
