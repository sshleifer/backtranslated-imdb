Good looks good. The season 1 of John Carpenter is good in "Masters of Horror", which is completely opposite. <br /> <br /> He proved to be a terrific owner with "cigarette burns" but "pro life" is probably the worst I have seen from him. <br /> <br /> While it's tight atmosphere and tension and it's running time less than one hour, it is welcome to overstays. <br /> <br /> The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and not attractive and the resolution is not incomprehensible. <br /> In fact, the DVDs were purchased (one of them was me); How does the carpenter picture describe? He is really proud about it and he talks about it for a long time as his best work and he praises the script. And to comment on the commentary, he made it to the last cut where he notices a clear screw, he just does not feel he needs to correct the flaw and he says it just let it out there. I fear the old master completely lost his touch. <br /> <br /> I have left a positive note and said that the effects of life are amazing. Technically, the film will produce top-notch, efficient lighting schemes and effects.
