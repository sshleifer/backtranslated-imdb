"Motion Picture", "Movie", or "Film" will begin by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere in order to use the "movie" in this case, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit tough. <br /> Directed by: curiosity. <br /> Acting: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: Words are very useless. <br /> <br /> "The family home films that are more than retrievable quests come closer to earning that difference, not just 10 car pile <br /> <br /> In this review we will skip the plot because there are so many holes to cover at once, let's say that the rest of the movie is going to be worse. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> This apparently deadly episode, rather than the plot, needs effects ... or rather disturbing. No, there are no flash bars, and some sound effects exist in the "stock" gun sounds, or they are created by the mouth (yes, you read that). The sound of the "shh" sound for elevator doors Ranirmata really had the courage, I guess he thought it was the sound of the future more and more of them. It will be set in 2031, after all. <br /> <br /> The sound quality is not bad, is horrible (he used the microphone. Video camera, and it shows), using stock gun sounds is almost worse than using any noises. Sound effects are from the soundtrack, like a drunken yoke in the flock of sheep, and they are just clumsy. This film: The bad man enters the searching office for his food. A woman begins to run in fear. He raises his gun (an eugene), and it shakes. We clearly hear a sound that is not a uzi. Woman runs away from the camera and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes in her back (she's like a paintball hit), and she gets flat on her face. <br /> <br /> In a different order, almost - but not many - it makes a funny movie to see, takes place on a staircase. The evil guy is a good man and he chases the woman who protects down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You may want to duck; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think Alan Deherrera is locked up for the train ruins, but he has followed all the way to compile and release it. . If there is any justice, there is no ritual in the name of it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see this lump of industrial waste - and I strongly advise - all the scenes are almost blanketed from Bladener and AM radio doubles as a watch-to-talk. Do not show much attention in the plot. <br /> 10 stars in 0. It's generous.
