When I got this film from my job, I saw very low expectations along with three other similar films. Now the movie is not bad. You will get what you pay. It is a story of love story, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Not exactly a Hollywood blockbuster, but for less thrills it is not bad. I can never see this movie. In short, it may take some time for a movie that you can see very late on the local television station, or you will see it on Sunday afternoon at a local television station you're trying to take a little longer. Despite bad acting, clich√© lines and sub-part camera work. I'm going to stop shooting and never pops in my DVD player. This story is made several times in many movies. This is a different, no good, no worse. <br /> Your average image.
