I can not really sit by the whole thing. <br /> <br /> There is a brief outline of the story: the film begins with Jojo and sits on the other chic seaside, bathing on the bathing-beaver-shore sea shore. "Hunk" appears to have a day-to-day gym in his life. Anyway, everyone knows him, and every chic in the film wants him. Oh ho! Here comes competition! The stereotypical "hot chick" that drives an ugly pink car and her best friends. We recognize that JoJo's mother soon got a lifetime job in Australia, which meant that JoJo had to leave his best friend back and depart (oh no, I'd cry). A huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with dirty water. Anyway, without the obvious reason, the little chick comes into the pool, and the face comes to face, yes, you guess, a mermaid! The "story" really is this name. <br /> This is a movie with a lot of acting, which makes the 80s look like the pinnacle of Oscar-worthy shows. This movie has all the cliche ... good friends, everyone who wants "hunk", "hot" bad girl and her rebel friends, scary old man ... you name it, it's there. I've taken a lot of people by seeing this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes as a sacrifice. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do that, I'm not in vain.
