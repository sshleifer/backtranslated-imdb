There are three comments about the film I found to be disappointed in a low shelf in the blockbuster. For the first time, cinematic producers are curious to look at the methods that do not work well enough. As Kubrick has done with "Lolita", some have originally earned the original author to write the original work. It does not happen here; Craft-throwing is dead long. Some people use the premises of the original point of the launch point to go in a completely new, unrelated direction (most recently comes here to meet "Tristram Sandy"). You can dumb - the image of "Slaughterhouse Five" is an example of my mind. Or you can try to make it into the cinematic vignettes by taking the format of the original. It's about Woody Allen's "Everything You Want to Know About Sex", and the film is controversial. After examination, this is the only thing that can work with scholars like "Psychopathia Sexualis". Potential losses are the fact that all the original works are uncertain or destroyed. So here it is. <br /> <br /> Point two cinematic style. Some people call it "tribute" to Murnu, Pubst, Karl Dreier, etc., but I think it will blend more than that. It is self-sufficient to be too heavy and long lasting. It is ultimately annoying. <br /> <br /> Point three is probably less intellectual observation. How did the film make the film about the immorality of the wild and the irritability of the victims? I can not attract the attention of the film, and it will be visible to anyone who does not automatically draw to the images of sexually transmitted. I would like to be completely incomplete and do not understand the movie, but the nature of the subject matter, the open copy of the movie styles, and the stubborn refusal to make audiences at an emotional level (frightened by the allegations). <br /> <br /> This is a vague exercise from the beginning of the film and I say, it really does not work.
