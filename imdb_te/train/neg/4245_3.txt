I can not honestly hope! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's great idea; Intended for armor! ... I'm sorry, but about big heads or about their legs without having to cry too much. Or where the invisible tanks have saved them? <br /> <br /> If this image is good enough, then it will really lead to boring lynching to shoot out after 20 minutes. <br /> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> br /> 3/10 for better editing.
