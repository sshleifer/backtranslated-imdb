I have seen virtually no redemptions in this film. What I saw is that Quentin Tarantino's inspired inspired invasion. There are some attractive ladies in this movie and maybe it's a good quality. Overall, however, this film is surreal and ridiculous. Slowly motion and other cinematic gimmicks, a hand-drawn film, I also seem to be clumsy and dizzying. Overall the music is so terrible and repetitive. Also reminded me of the American military's psychological war against various soldiers. <br /> <br /> Various sound pictures created by this film have not been fixed in their content and "resolutions" of their placement and unfiltration. The disappointing movie (real _ film____, not the word I reserve for the true word) left me with a bad feeling. <br /> <br /> The film is unobtrusive, but many people who try and spin this romantic comedy do not believe in the content, form and resolution of this type. <br /> <br /> The IMDb and other ratings sources suggested that the resource should be avoided as unattainable positive aspects.
