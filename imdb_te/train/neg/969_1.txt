I'm rooting for the film as a remake of the 1970s children's TV series "Escape Into Night", which is absolutely odd, lovely and unhappy even though it is at times chaotic and reasonable. Acting in "Paperhouse" is wood, unexpectedly a joke. Overdubs did not add a tan, I saw a batch. The cast is discouraging, which leads to warmth, chemistry or unreliable relationships. As with most poor movies, there are some good assisted actions that help these people to be good, they are not comforting, comforting and guaranteed. <br /> <br /> "It's been a lot of unexpected choice" to come here all night. " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
