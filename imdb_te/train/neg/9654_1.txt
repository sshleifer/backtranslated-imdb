The picture is bad. Just awful. Not bad movies from Bollywood. <br /> <br /> These are the problems that they have to do. <br /> <br /> This problem seems to be mainly directed by directors. The two good actors who have proven to be able to make a great performance in the film ... but they are less directed. <br /> <br /> In the first half of this film there is a lot of ridiculous moves and very bad editing. <br /> <br /> After meeting his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, he meets with Om Puri. (He walked 30 years ago), his friendship with Om Puri Salman! What a waste of garbage Seriously. Not to mention Baaad soundtrack. <br /> <br /> What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Dev Gun is a complete scoundrel to play the role of a rockstar. Ajay shines when his character is shown on his dark side. So Salman becomes drug addict. <br /> It can only be seen by the last half an hour.
