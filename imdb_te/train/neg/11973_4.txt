This is one of the worst French films ever seen in over 100 French movies I've ever seen. Terrible screenplay and much more mediocre / unofficial acting. <br /> <br /> One of the crucial weaknesses in the film is that these two characters do not attract people. I do not care what the audience is going to do. <br /> <br /> I am amazed how the jury prize won in the movie Cinema, and I love all the movies I gave in Konse, but this is not. A major disappointment for me.
