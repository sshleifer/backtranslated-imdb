I'm looking at this movie with the hope of finding a beautiful and interesting story, the story story is not as good. <br /> <br /> Shahrukh Khan is still there. He did not fit this film to be "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that the film is based on the novel "Madame Bower" of the Flebert novel. I can not match it with Indian mentality. </ p> Good time, wasting our time and our mood can not get worse. <br /> <br /> I can not understand that it will ever gain such a "high" vote at a 6.8 / 10 average. <br /> So, in that! You will waste your time unless you want a "dark picture" with "strange and anonymous story".
