<br /> <br /> It is not usually hard to comment on this image: no one can see it, but this happens. <br /> <br /> It is popular in P2P shared networks like Caja, so this Saad product is exposed for it. <br /> What was it then? Well, actually it's not comedy; Instead, it is intended as a horror movie - "intended" to be the key word here too. The script is completely incompatible and uncomplicated mess and special effects, especially if they are enthusiastic and just for my acting, it's my graduating play at primary school. I realized that this is a very low budget movie, Definitely reduce one's expectations. <br /> Although I am a big fan of horror genre, these films are rarely seen for interesting scripts and top-notch performances. <br /> <br /> B-movies often have some redemption features, such as no junk-like funds. Fear has the laughable performances that laugh only in the hammock. If you could find that humor - and I dozing off after that, for the first 20 minutes or so - then the only thing that the movie is going to be going on. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it does not say anything, that is: the victims use drugs and / or take part in serious crimes. <br /> <br /> I would rate this 1 out of 1, but if I did 0, Or maybe I can not do this: It deserves a 1 to spell the names of the correct names in the titles.
