I do not know where to start. The film was one of the cheap Saturday morning children, and they were re-created in the early eighties in the early eighties. Sorting like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It's really hating bad digital extensions and "secret agencies" and villains. <br /> <br /> Acting is not so funny and it is very bad. The direction is terrible and is now very short of continuity. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous scenes in this film is the explosive device in many villains and an agent car. For some reason, though the device is apparently referred to as a "remote detonation", the bad guys decide to drive her when she rides her motorcycles. This hunt continues. While bad guys are doing ridiculously and completely pointless bike stunts. Stand on bikes and do as much as possible vehicles. At one time, a crash occurred and one of the attackers was thrown out of his bike, but we threw the bike (apparently cgi) the agent car, but the rider disappeared. Then, after a few seconds rider and bike return ... apparently unscathed by crash. While the car has an explosive device at this time, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while they blow the car and then blow up the car. It was made clear with cgi. Sound is messy <br /> When I say cgi, the Lord of the Rings does not speak about the type cgi. <br /> <br /> I'm talking cheaper power rangers type CG that we can do good things in Power Rangers. For the money, someone is in favor or because they've blocked it ... maybe last.
