I go to a lot of movies, often carrying my 5 year old son, and I'm so glad I did not bring this one. There are many suggestions on the sex and thinning immersion scene, however, it is not the primary reason I do not bring him. Trailers lead you to believe it's a light humor; However, there are almost all the funny moments previews. I'm waiting for something interesting, funny, or serious; However, I'm sleeping in the plot-less story. I understand that dogs can be a great company, the whole story is focused on a poorly behaved dog that lacks awareness of training the owners. A man is banned if a person makes too much damage and turbulence. Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, I saw their talents in vain. The best way to do this movie is, the couple gets an unruly dog, the couple comes in love with the dog, the dog dies, the couple are sad. End.
