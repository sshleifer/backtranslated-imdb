This is a film's horrendous disaster. From beginning to end, it is filled with bad acting and outrageous direction and editing. It is impossible to see or hear Christopher's parts because the only riddle parts of the film are some numbers by Streisand. The main problem for the film is that we can not see Christopher's character when we are struggling in his role or stripes. The first decline and the second increase can be seen. Final Stream Number - is one of the greatest finals in the film, directed and directed correctly. The single frame frame of her face for a period of song is a terrible mistake. Although the band, audience and theater scenes are shown, this number may be dynamic and interesting. The film was directed and edited by the opening of a NYU movie school. The worst thing is that it can be a wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only ransom part of this film, and it is totally damaged by technically misleading technical decisions.
