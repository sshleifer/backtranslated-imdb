I'm happy if the level is negative. Sushmita Sen is good looking, and Nisha Kothari has a brighter future but the producer and director make any sense in this story. Everything is distracting when choosing angles, lighting, and trying to remember what the story is. Oh, songs and dances first, if you do not rip your ears off your head. The film was taken twice at 1.25 hours, and was pretty good as "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer did not go that way, "towns" finally wanted to find their spine and help. Editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - Naming any element of the film - Bad - perhaps the food from the caterer is good. Indian (Bollywood) films I have never seen have ever seen in 6 years.
