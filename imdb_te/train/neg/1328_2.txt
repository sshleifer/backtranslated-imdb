It's really stupid in the 80th genre: Action Comedy. As expected, rush hour is similar but there is no acting and smiles and chemistry between the main characters of the film. I enjoyed Jay Leno as a stand-up and talk show host, but he's just not working. He is terrified when he tries to do the hard work - his trademark manages to run his manager to tear his face out of his face, when his one-liners say, it's not so funny. And the rushing of Him (again) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have the concept of Pat Morita-at least by today's standards-not the most politically correct view of Japanese. Do not start me about the story. I give it to 10 to 2.
