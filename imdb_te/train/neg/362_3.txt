Madonna should not be confused with the film "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing", a crazy, campy, off-the-wall comedy up and a variety of upcoming artists about the man who wants to start "The Next Big Thing" magazine. This low budget indie "Chuck and Buck" looks like a wonder. "Thing" earned some awful reviews, securing only one edge award to date, in secular performance, poor sets and costumes. This is a pass.
