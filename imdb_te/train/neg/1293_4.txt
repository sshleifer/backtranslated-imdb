I'm probably one of the few viewers who do not recommend this film. Ang Lee's work was considered to be a more spectacular sight (each frame corresponds to a print), and I was disappointed with the cinematic speed of the film. It's a long time. This story is in the Civil War Age in Missouri and a young man (Roel) joining the Ferral forces of the Bushwalkers, the rebellious Confederate sympathizers organized by Giraffe, fight with the Jihakurs and their union colleagues. He and his close friend, joined by Jack Bull Chiles, played by Schiett Ulrich, Chile's father was shot dead and his house was burned by Jaichackers. The story follows their interactions with royalty and Chies' adventurous adventures and other victims of the war, including a former slave of the Bushwalkers (played by Daniel Holt Jeffery Wright), and a war widow by Juve. It seemed that every time this story was developed as an interesting topic, it could lead to some other subblaters and things did not develop. For example, the former slave holt caused a participation in a conflicting society in the group of rodents, which was briefly demonstrated by some issues related to ownership and protocol, and the film was later deleted. A young villain / bully bushwalker hates Rodell and directs much anger and violence to him, but never knows why. Some characters do not appear on the surface; The film is a lot of people embracing, as well as making huge sums in history. <br /> <br /> Historical details are excellent. I liked watching housing, furniture, textiles, and even though I ducked a bit with the dialogue, I thought the main actors were doing the amazing work of the men. Unless you really enjoy history or a big Ang Lee fan, you will pass in this case.
