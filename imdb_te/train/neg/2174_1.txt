It's hard to believe that people really like killing this! I think I can enjoy the children, but I can not sit it by the kid's parents' kind. The imaginable storyline, Borusi Boloshi, and the worst kid actor of all time. I was responsible for the kid, but she was really sad to see. I just got embarrassed to her, and she knows it. I had to change the sound when she sang the Star Spangard banner - then I came here and they found it as they won the star search. I always wanted Jim Ballusi to be ashamed to trade on the name of his amazing, unfortunately missed brother, and why this trick is. Zero stars.
