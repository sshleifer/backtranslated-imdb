I can not recognize Al Pacino. I see him in Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'm one of the greatest actors of the past thirty years. <br /> <br /> In the past two days, the revolution has come down. In these hours. Here is a news flash: Want to speak to prisoners? <br /> <br /> Previously, they would force them to see them ... they would agree. <br /> <br /> I can not rebuild this plot because there is no compact plot, but it happens during the American Revolution. Pacino thinks he will play an illiterate farmer, but will eventually do it. <br /> <br /> "Al Smith," instead of "Al Smicino", if it plays in the film, it will ruin their career. It's terrible but Pacino's demotivated performance and clear fake voice made it even worse.Donald Sutherland's character is ridiculous.I can not really explain it.Natasha Kinski is a major character but it's 5 lines in the movie. One of the most ridiculous campuses in the Al Pacino and Kinski is continuously moving across the battlefield in the battlefield. Starbucks is like the whole northeast. <br /> <br /> "I can see here, 100 miles away from another battlefield , Funny ... you'll see in a few months. <br /> <br /> I want to give this star to IMDb for a negative score here.
