<br /> <br /> When I came home, I thought it was a bit of a leopard, cinematic experience better than cinema drama, so I can talk a lot about films. <br /> However, art images are better than King Kong. <br /> <br /> This is a great excuse for some of my people, because it is almost the same in the style you can play in the play. <br /> <br /> This film is great. </ P> <p> This is based on a high drama. In this movie, the play cat is about whether the cat is falling from the roof. So, deep and meaningful conversation, then? Great acting? <br /> <br /> To be fairly simple: Although some scenery is interesting: Communist Flats, City Vistas (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams are still in service.
