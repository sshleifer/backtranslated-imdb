The film is highly capable, unfortunately, as a weak / fearless hero, out of scandal and lack of content / substance. The obvious obvious disadvantages are not knowing how Sean Connery, who played a rare person, did not know his own Arab name. It may seem a little flaw but indicates that it does not attempt to keep in mind the details. The quality of acting is simultaneously lower than average. <br /> <br /> The film's solo saving grace is at the very end of the story twist; And a French song (I do not recall the title). Overall, Sean Connery is a pretty bad movie out there that is clearly miscast.
