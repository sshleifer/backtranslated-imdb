If Heather Graham rely on her life, she could not find a woman convincing her. Who are the producers of this film? ABSOLUTE WORST, I can remember as long as I saw a very involuntary image. The film is very bad, pressed to sign IMDb and make sure the rating of this "movie" is falling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. And I'm at this point, instead of being all about the need for a curiosity for the upcoming story of this film, maybe it's mentally more flexible to focus on the plot on a character with instability it could have been. I know it's the first time I have a gay sex, the next morning I grew up in the middle of the street with enthusiasm in the street ... honestly b * tch, get a hold ... < <br /> <br /> <br /> What a joke! And note that there are many many errors and appallingly stupid things to this lure image, but I'm still sick of thinking about it anymore. Bottom line, if you're a smart person you hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it ... that's easy.
