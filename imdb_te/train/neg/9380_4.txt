The dead woman is said to be back in the past two weeks in her life. Like Wagbund, the film wanders without meaning and instead understands. Mona, lazy, sullen, and narrative title character, does not like and makes her a little bit more interesting. Although Mona is trying to explain why this decisive lifestyle is decided, her motives are not clear. Episodic nature of the film with some random characters becomes tiresome shortly after, which feels more time than its running time. It is also difficult to believe that attractive young men do not pay much attention to homeless women.
