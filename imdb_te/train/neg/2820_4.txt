I do not know much about Tobey Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but he is not bothered. As another commentator mentioned, there is not really enough horror or romance to bring fans into the genre. The plot is incomplete, sad scenes are grateful and most of the acting is very early. England has done his best job with a weak substance, and Joe Trialing has a very large bottom, but it is not enough to take this film. It's a tape-over. Grade: F
