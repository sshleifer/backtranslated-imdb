I like animated shows. I enjoy the nice Nick Charger, including Hay and Arnold. But the movement of a TV program to the big screen is not easy and it is not just big enough. It's like a long episode of the show, and it's not quite as good. Judging by the behavior of the children we have with us, it did not score well with them.
