This is probably the best horror film since Ed Wood was dead. <br /> I'm ending, because I'm not sure what happened. I will try my best. There are a few types of same-sex vampires, but they give birth to bodies, so any role or role that you want to think about is a gay vampire. <br /> Sound confusing? This is not as confusing as you might expect, since no characters are enabled. No plot, no character development, and showing random people, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never heard from again. * Despite the enemies of vampires, a mental hospital has a dream-intersecting combination, so nothing has happened and this is the hallmark of all the main character. <br /> Up? Both of the main girls take their shirts briefly. Special effects are just mind-doubt (I especially like the slow and awkward fight scenes). Everyone has a really crazy Canadian accent, which helps to normal level of happiness. <br /> Rental price is well worth it. We laughed until we cried.
