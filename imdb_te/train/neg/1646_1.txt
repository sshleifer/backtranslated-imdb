I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this is a lot more. Performance is not great, but it is not a real problem. This is about the matter that I will sink in my stomach pit in a 20-minute film. These characters are empty. They are almost in depth and how little they are to the brutality they show in mutual friendship. It is pleasing to explore the darker sides of the set of letters, but you can either say those characters are real people or they are just cardboard cutouts. These letters were cardboard and the image they gave was just so ugly.
