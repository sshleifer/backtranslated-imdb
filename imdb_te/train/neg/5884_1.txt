I am a big cinema fan. I love all kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie I have ever seen. This follows a very close book. It should not be done in a movie. <br /> <br /> The authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not aggressive, they are mentally ill. What matters is not funny, they are upset; <br /> <br /> The film has the feel of Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hate, running with Scissors, and is less funny. <br /> I'm never going back to those hours. I wanted to wash my brain after watching it.
