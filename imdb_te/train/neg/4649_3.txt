Jal Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, with Wilfred Hyde White 1957 (yes, this is the correct date) produced by J. Arthur Rank; It should be a smash comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a funny movie: People look at a little crocodile watching. The music is thrown out, in a very absurd and unforgettable. Jenny Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what is she doing in this film? Diana's Doors are also here, oh-brave shots for using the previews. Her acting level is not bad, but someone in the film is offered to one. Well, this film should do something next to the groan. People in e-Bay are now sold on VHS. Spare yourself and spare time waste. A comedy without laughter. Music without a memorable song or dance.
