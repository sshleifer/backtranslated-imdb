In my commentary there is nothing in the political feelings of the film. In fact, they are equal to mine. The film is getting rid of the story, intention or any kind of dialogue and the fact that it is lacking. Perhaps some Neil says that referring to song lyrics, even if some people fail to induce anyone outside the audience, is not the creation of the characters that are motivated by the writer or the director's creation. Neil Young's iconic legacy is a crazy story. The most childish scene, where the devil dances his way into a bar, is where one unsuccessful hero drops a tonic, then the young song who does not know what the mouth is worn by his mouth on the mouth dance mouth. Is this two dream of a scheme where they are looking for the West Coast ??? Forgive Neil, Stick with Music and Steven Stiles Making Movie.
