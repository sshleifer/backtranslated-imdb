I am a college student now and I am in the present English language. At that time, I was a high school student - I want to say a junior year but it may be senior and hard to remember. My experience of quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, the interest in quantum mechanics led me to read on many aspects of the theoretical aspects of the field led me as well as find what I can find in any article. <br /> <br /> This film is just terrible. It has made an appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age teacher who wants to specifically relate to everyone. My mother was such a guy and she tried to watch her friends and buy a copy of the film since seeing this film. I have pointed out various flaws and issues that I see with movies logic and science - and they are too - and I have removed my arguments because "Oh, so a higher school student knows more than all the people with PhDs." Getting a PhD A person is right, in fact, no need for intelligence. My basic understanding of physics left behind the fact that half the film is sufficient enough to debunk. <br /> <br /> "If you think that the movie is doing a good job of ignoring the movie, you care to do that <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
