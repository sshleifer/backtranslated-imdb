Well, I hate Hollywood, I loved the movie, so this thriller should be seen in theaters. And, I'm in the hope that Vanilla Sky is good. I hoped they would keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would do it their own. It was a little bit of both, and it was absorbed. <br /> It looks good. I love the radiohead. I'm still there. But finally we are listening to good vibrations by the Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of suck between. They have one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why they have the GV blare during the climax. It's more annoying or worse than blatant. Especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = Basic. <br /> He did a bang-up job at the club scene. That's cool. Otherwise the film is a big ball of pride. The audience will get this movie. It reads the subtitles, but not the rest. It's as simple as that. All of the motivations had to be scrapped. I did not realize Diaz's inspiration (did they do before the chicken soup before?) And some of the others. I hate Kurt Russell. Stay in. Tom Cruise (notably in this kind of film [ie, Eyes Wide Shut]). And elevator. I understand. <br /> Anyway they tried to improve the original with a crappy American rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good image print and glossy processing and it helped if the cave had scrapped it. <br /> <br /> The main disappointment is 2/10.
