In rare cases only the x-files episode fails to produce any enthusiasm or does not appear in the episode, which is just totally frustrating. Both the detective and his former partner die in unexplained situations. There is a little girl present there when the deaths are dead. Mulder has returned to her as a cop who has murdered her colleagues and created a theory that she has returned to her. Now for the bizarre bit.The little girl feels only a connection and a random person who is just a reborn choice. I think these writers will make a little lazy writing and this episode - Cheat in files history There is the one!
