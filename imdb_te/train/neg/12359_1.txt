I thought this was a really awful movie - I really found myself saying twice on my TV. One of the gay men's leaders has a false propaganda; He is perfect for any chemistry between those who like to kiss a dog and Richard Ruccolo. The film has their long and violent style, highlighting each breakdown and makeup, but no developments have been developed between any details. <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg are shining like their characters, but it does not make a movie that does not rent. Save your money.
