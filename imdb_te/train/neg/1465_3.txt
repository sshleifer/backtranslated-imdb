First, I want to tell you that I am a historian based on historic facts based on historical events based on historical events. But this is not the case here. The film certainly is more than annoying the fact that the movie is not entertaining and all but true facts. In his youth he was not anti-Semitic in Hitler, he worked for the Jews before the world war. It was during World War I and later he made his opinion about the Jews. His upbringing in the film was inadequate, and Hitler was not a child in childhood. He has more or less general upbringing. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlle is a great actor but he really is not fit in the role of Hitler. Hitler was impossible and unstable, where he had a film transformation. At a young age, he was a fascinating person who "cheated" people through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The truth is the film about Hitler's life based on historical facts and allegations. I'm really hating a false finger as an example to Hitler and others and telling the wrong stories to really be a bad movie. It's really good to tell the story to find out what everyone else does! This film should have done some research before them. This is when they do not know what really happened. <br /> <br /> Hitler also did not appear in the Revolutionary Manch in Manch, whose shoulder was pulled out of its socket. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a better documentary than this.
