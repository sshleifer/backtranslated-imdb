We have STARZ free weekend and I switch on to the station to see what happens. This film hauling II: performance is terrible but eye candy is great. Cybill Dawning and Marsha Brown as the previously mentioned eye candy. <br /> <br /> If my friends are surprised why I do not want to go to horror films, why do they know this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "Brown Sugar" Mick certainly has great taste in women.
