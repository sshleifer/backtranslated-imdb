It's interesting to see how geek buzz is accurate in words, and in the corporate world it's still quite simple. If they win such innocent things, the Justice Department will hold a large corporations. The real corporate world is very subtle and interesting, every bit is bad. I seriously suspect that I would kill anyone directly on the person. Even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they have nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons. The film must be developed by some garage geeks, I think and the studios do not know the difference. They only wanted to invest in Microsoft Antitrust News.
