Gordon Hone should inform anyone of his career in the teen-age village that ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst releases ever released, which is an unequal disaster in which two leaders have a frantic description of their trademarks as bad writing and bad direction. <br /> <br /> I hope John Clice has paid so much for his name on this disaster. He is in trouble when he is in trouble and he fails to recognize that only two actors and his remaining mistakes are drowning in the rest of the cast.
