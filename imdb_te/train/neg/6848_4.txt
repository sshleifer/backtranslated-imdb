I would say I was disappointed by this "horror" movie. I was scared once when I saw it. It's not too curious .... I imagined the half way through the cinema ... so why did not you? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a trolley scary movie. .. I will stop copying it from other movies (eg trade mark: long hair). Please give some originality. <br /> You do not recommend this movie.
