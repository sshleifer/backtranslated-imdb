If you ever want to see the image that will hold the style on the material, it's for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful to watch, but there's valuable little material, except it's you turning on with mocky, dramatic manipulation and love yarns. It is one of the most famous 'chick flicks'. <br /> <br /> In the sixth minute of the screen time, After 40 minutes of hanging around, all of a sudden we have a full-blown drama, in six minutes: this fastest conversion to say, jarring Five years later, when Ulysses (like wandering superhero Ulysses; get it?), She returns to Penelope (Watling), Ciara (Edward Fernandez), an illusionist wealthy man (Who does not hed that dough?) Who puts the inexplicable pet crocodiles. <br /> <br /> Martina, with great anger, raises questions about her deprivation  ు అతను సుమత్రా ద్వీపానికి ఆమెను తీసుకెళ్తానని చెపుతాడు మరియు ఆమె ప్రతిదీ అర్థం చేసుకోవాలి. 'T ఆమె సుమత్రా ద్వీపానికి తీసుకువెళ్ళండి. ఈ లిపి స్క్రిప్టులో ఎక్కడో చనిపోతుంది. అతను ఎక్కడ ఉన్నాడో అతను వివరించలేదు మరియు ఎందుకు ఐదు సంవత్సరాలు తన భార్య మరియు పిల్లలను నిర్లక్ష్యం చేశాడు. He can not release himself as a respectable figure and at least half of the film does not fill the holes in the storyline. Director Biggs Luna wants to fill the stories in the story. He is with spiritual sources (fish, reptiles, sea) provided by surprising cinematography and neglected dialogue. It does not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jardi Mollah is a good actor, but I can not afford to buy his ulilis any kind of hero. (Which is supposed to be the original Ulysses). Damp romance, he spouts approximately 2,000 times in a short stamp of identical poetry from Virgil and excites each and every time explosion martina. This guy is hired to restore old weddings. I'm sure Virgil is impressive. He did not let it until I understood it. <br /> <br /> The poetry is 'important' in the film, and it is the well-known 'siren song' of the Ullins (ie sailors singing for the handsome angels) who, if they answer the call of the siren, who are sad). If this is what Bigas is up to Luna, you can see the problem - he is offering a soft art snatch and a handful of marks in an attempt to pick up. <br /> Waltling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor, but she is very journalist or even romantic depth for us. This is a more visible oil-like 1960s-style hair, and one of the sophisticated 21st century 'beards' (you know you will increase four days) for a rent on her face (as a vacant). He is supposed to be the kind of person (I think) dreary, but his eyes suggest that the script may be more suffering from a freak script. <br /> <br /> But if you do not despair, the film looks good. Do not think too much about connecting the dots in red herring or hearing you on the way of conversation. You lose the image (especially in the first 40 minutes) without fast forwarding and you really do not miss.
