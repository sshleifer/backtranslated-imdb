I am a Christian. I have always been suspicious of the movies made by Christians. When the film is made up of the film they know "know-notes". I admire TBN for the current effort of God and Jesus in the positive and honest way on the screen. Nevertheless, they have been working on it. This performance is terrible, and if one of them is familiar with the Bible, it does not understand what the movie is trying to get across. The film is not terrified, but people who have made some facts. However, in this "criticism", these facts are very deep for the quadrilateral and deep reinforcement. In short, the omega code is the perfect worst picture I've seen so far, and I do not recommend anyone, except comic relief from grind every day.
