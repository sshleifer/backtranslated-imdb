I can not believe how lonely I am. There is no scene in the movie, there are no scenes in the rest of the film. The film was pulled out of some huge stars but they were wasted with my mind. I would like to take some acting lessons a few years before I was screened in Carrie Reeves the Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very lazy & lazy. Fortunately I got this movie for a very low price, because obviously it's not for any good reasons to remember. I will write nothing about the story of the film, but you have to know that she is the most famous hoax in America because of her big thumb. I will give this film to 2/10. I got this film 4.0 / 10 before seeing this movie, why do I know now? Very frustrating image. Do not buy it even if you see it under $ 5.
