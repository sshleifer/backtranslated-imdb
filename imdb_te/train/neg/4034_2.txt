Oh dear. Good cast, but writing and directing is a bit of a work to write an art and wit and direct wit. You also have to get timing and moment correctly for doing good comedy. It's not all of that, I have some parts that are laughed out loud, but it's only a few times. The main focus for me is the fast free stream dialogue, the film is made annoying by some people. It may sound too much when reading the script on your head, but it's a different job for the camera and camera. And the hand of the hand at the camera's work gives power to some parts. The whole direction is fine but the script is not for me, but I sound good if you read the script in your head. Sorry.
