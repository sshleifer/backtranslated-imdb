Bush is to be congratulated for trying to convert into one of the greatest works of English fiction, and we need to make a sneak peek for this effort. The animation is poor, the characters seem humorous, the music is overwhelming, and the film is a staggering lightning by the first book and half of Tolkien's work. When I see the film for the first time my disappointment disappoints. Any attempt to change a book now is a book that fails in many ways, just because of the medium, but this story, with the source of the story, is just plain curiosity. Bosch is more capable.
