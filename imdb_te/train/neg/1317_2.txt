Anyone with the first "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection in the Kino video assembled a multi-cassette option of silent comics, removing the first installment with ONE TOO MANY (1916), which is a vibrant one-reel farmer in Florida, Oliver Hardy. The set is happy for all, this decision is unfortunate because many people are a very poor movie, discouraging the viewer from seeing more. Like any distinctive scent, these greed, misfortunes, and absurdity have the greed of impulsive hypocrisy when it comes to problems, but unlike the good ones, ONE is very abusive, unfunny and clear annoying. It is difficult to say at this point that there is undoubtedly a chaotic plot resulting in missing footage or useless film, but for any reason, too much warning is the role of the viewer character or what is going to happen. Years old "Babe" looks hardy, he has teamed up with him a decade later, Stan Laurel, Ani full of youthful energy. In the opening sequence, awakening with the hangover, Babe displays the most athletic backward roll on a bed. Trust me, this film gets funny. I read this before you see the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia". I suggest going back to the past and skipping good things.
