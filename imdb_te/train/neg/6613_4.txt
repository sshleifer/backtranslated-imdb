I can not believe that this film is a big fan of Sri Ram Gopal Varma. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Aag did not come to the real shale. This does not put a permanent impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Verma failed to create chemistry between the characters. There is no comrade between Hero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohan Lal is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not make this film. Ajay and Sushmita Sen are their best efforts but not use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - is inefficient and meaningless. Mohan Lal has done justice and acting has been proven about facial cues and body language. The rest of the cast did not expect. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma was able to work on the script, but controversially controversially, he made it into a chaos. But there is no fire.
