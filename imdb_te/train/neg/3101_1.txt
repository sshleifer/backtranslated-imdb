This is probably one of the biggest train wrecks of the 1984 hit "Gremlins". <br /> <br /> This is a "B" grade film, and all other inexpensive horror films on the same platform cover the plot entirely in plot, acting and manners. <br /> It's no coincidence that the random old security guard and young guardian security guard have any importance. Why? <br /> <br /> In the film a few minutes after he was 'safe', he put out his fantasy as a rock star in an inexpensive pub. <br /> It's just Scott's main course. The main character, Kevin, is struggling to prove himself more than the entire pussy. Perhaps he succeeds in the film, but he proves that he is not a bad actor for audiences. Kevin gets a job with an old security guard, and is guided by a studio canceled through his security changes (wait for it). Yes Why do you create a set when you use studio? Back image. Kevin's something is prohibited is safe and releases the Hobobins. The hoggoblins take people out of their brutal fantasies and kill them for some reason. They should come back before sunrise ... or what? <br /> <br /> Other characters Kevin's 'macho' army friend Nick, Nick's 'woman' duffin, which has more material than bitch-fashioned attitude and prostitution worthy clothes. Kevin's manipulation and 'resident' girlfriend Amy, the deepest desire in it is apparently in the form of a worst painted cher. Everything is very entertaining character KYLE. Any friends groups have been prepared. Kyle became a distraction that could not afford an hour without Kyle's self-excited. <br /> Leaders for hugoblins Exploration: Story Knee-upper creatures (aka hand puppets), which, for some reason, seeks to travel somewhere over the borders of local neighborhoods. Each of the characters have their own monstrous fantasy which has never had anything to do with millions of dollars in the end ... or the movie has a big budget. <br /> Warning SPOILERS AHEDD: Twist at the end of this movie "What?" Seeing the idea. Hobgoblins return safely through their own free will. Perhaps they were waiting for the sunrise to be destroyed or perhaps the story-writers came to the champ's chamber and decided to worry about the end. After returning safely, the old security guard describes explosives that are "learned in the army" and safe destruction, indicating the end of the evil huggedblins end and the roller coaster ride end; <br /> <br /> The foul play of the film is enough to send someone to tears. If you plan to see it, I will recommend some alcoholic beverages before you take a closer look at the picture.
