Sadly, more than the ups are ups. The plot is pretty good. I mean, nothing of the ordinary, but other than the other hero, there is a story. The other good thing is cast. It's not because I'm not saying acting is good, but every actor / actress is hot and attractive. <br /> The first 40 minutes or so of the film. The rest is very boring. Another down (or you may consider this if you want) is high nudity. All 4 girls were without a few minutes, and all the boys showed their baskets for a long time. <br /> <br /> If you have some swearing-ups, I'm against nudity, but not a horror movie, if some guy is very disappointed to take her swimsuit and run around naked. For a few minutes, or a girl to watch naked for no reason, or you're Debbie Roche's die hard hard, it's more than just a picture for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
