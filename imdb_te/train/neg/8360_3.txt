What do you like about this movie? <br /> It's colored! <br /> <br /> It has some amazing underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It is a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /> 10 to 3! <br /> <br /> Speed ​​up music sometimes! Especially about shark or baddies move! <br /> Sometimes it's slow! It's time for sympathy to get to the audience! <br /> <br /> The dust moves to someone else! This is very similar to if in a "spagetti Western"! <br /> Italians can not produce quality structures! TV films are in sequence with the title "Octopus", which featured on the SBS TV in Australia about the Mafia-type conflicts in the 1990s. And they are amazing! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "20 years have passed since the end of the end, he was buried. <br /> <br /> yellow, then blue, yellow dust originating fastest shark rejar పదునైన కాటు ఉంది! <br /> <br /> అన్నిటిలోనూ బార్-రూమ్ ఘర్షణలో లేదా తాజా సముద్రపు బ్లడ్డీ కూల్చివేతతో నిరంతరంగా ఆకలితో ఉన్న సొరచేపను గమనించినప్పుడు, హీరో యొక్క సహచరుడు తన గ్లాసెస్ ద్వారా చూస్తే, అతను కూడా ప్లాట్లు లేదా ఎవరి <br /> <br /> At least if the music fails to awaken our mind, the voice of the buddies There is a bad sound, we like to get another dark deed. <br /> <br /> 'We think it's totally imaginable And, when!
