- The filmmaker is shooting in an old, supposedly horrific horror film where seven years of death falls dead. One of the staff found an enchanting booklet and used some of the scenes in their film to be appropriate. Characters in the book are better than the script they are using. But when reading the book, suddenly the cemetery comes to life. Now cast and crew are suffering a real danger. <br /> The IMDb runs 90 minutes of time. In the first 60 minutes, nothing will happen. Spent a lot of time in the film. Are we afraid of the horror film that they are shooting? We already know that their image is "not real". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Many of these "actors" have a problem of making a primary school drama. The score is terrible. It is a 70th television series that remembers too much and provides the atmosphere. There is no one to talk about the weather over a few seconds at the end of the film. Character logic is all but non existent. In a movie, the characters act in a certain way. Here, I remember a scene that the character did not choose as the most unattractive place available to them. In the end, I have the first 60 minutes of the movie I already mentioned. Do you want to be boring? <br /> <br /> I do not underestimate the seven Whites of the House in the context of the film (probably due to the accident). My two favorites are beginning and ending. The opening title sequence provides the deaths of seven previous owners and may be the theme of the film. And, the closing sequences on heavy stairs such as zombie menace are somewhat more efficient (no ringing endorsement). Overall, these movements are not enough to make a good image.
