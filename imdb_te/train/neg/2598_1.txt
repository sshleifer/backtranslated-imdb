In a bad image, there is usually some ransom feature, something you can say yes it is terrible, but that presentation, or that part of the script, or special effect, it's all just terrible. The acting was very ridiculous, the script was terrible, with Tiffany's hints filled with many different breakfasts, and special effects were even better. It's a bad movie and Drew Barrymore's greetings have been deleted from history. If you want it, see: a) Tough self-suffering. B) Look at how bad the movie is. A movie that uses this click is that "Ninety minutes of my life will never come back again."
