I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a big disappointment. Because the storyline is potentially powerful, it is exciting to see Rosario Dawson in the smallest scenes and a fan of fans of the 70-year-old rape / vengeance (I'm not spoiled) to tell the curiosity to check this movie. My end: Let's stick to the classic! Yes, the storyline is probable, but dialogues are flat, the actors are astounding. Dawson is also empty. Some say this is the right description of the college world in the United States, the emptiness of the characters is useful for one purpose and for all jazz but it makes the whole film uncertain. Dawson loves the scene of rape: not serious intensity! I'm not expecting any "inappropriate" style, but still not compassionate for her? I did not. Not for a minute, she is so lame all the way ;-) And I read the impressive photography. Well, it's really good but what's not sensational. I want to admit that screening is not good at all, but here I missed something but at the end of the film, I feel like watching Argentina again 'Inferno'. LOL. More seriously, the first scene in the club was beautifully filmed and all but I had a bitter sensation looking at the more and boring version of the scene in the dirty bar near the American Canadian border in Linch's 'Twin Peaks - Fire Walk My' ... raw red and blue light, heavy Bass music, simple lascivious / decadent atmosphere ... No, I could not get into this movie. Very bad.
