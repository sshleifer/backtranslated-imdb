The poetry may be correct when viewed by dentists. This is a disappointing, really terrible film they are suffering, but it also produces a non-audience type. You always wanted to watch a full movie with children, barfaging babies, unhealthy babies, prolonged, long-meaning gestures, deceased wife and a related husband: it's here for you. Boring, exaggerate, which shouts one of those examples: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes it is. With some beautiful songs, there is a small scene from Nabucco. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelet.
