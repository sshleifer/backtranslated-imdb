This unpleasant movie is very little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gives better performance than this script or his other action films are allowed. <br /> <br /> The film has occasional snippets at the dialogue, which suggests that the film can provide some insight into the weird subculture. Motivations are either murky or simple. Most of the acting is sub-par. The script creates unnecessary confusion. The director's unwanted fascination that focuses on Gore is distracted. <br /> <br /> Who can not imagine audiences for this film?
