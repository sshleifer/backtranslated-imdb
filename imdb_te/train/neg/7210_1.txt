Once again, Disney will fully confirm the background of her child, which completely neglects her background. In addition, the original gadget cartoons are the only names. While the penny is not in his book, the Brain has dropped from the character to a fancy Prop, Dr. Claw has a show off more than a nasty villain, but there are more than - lighter errors letters. Horror stories start from the first minutes of the film - a security guard called John Brown does not help him identify as a classic inspector gadget. At the outset we saw Disney's blatant effort transforming each story into a love between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda only to make this image Disney-friendly. The "Claw" that appears in this film and classic Doctor Claw is actually almost diagonally opposite and you will see that it is not anywhere near the original storyline. Instead of doing a good storyline - but as you might have imagined, Disney also failed to do that. The crazy acting gadget for the silliness sake and lusting after the whole movie Brenda. To add insult to injury, Disney introduced a new "Gadget" gadget - it does not appear, work or old gadget is not a mobile, it is just a canonical "comic relief" figure. Disney made it clear that the gadget cartoons were comedy, so they made the film a comedy, but they all took the clever runs (such as program paper explosions in the face of the chief) and changed the gadget to a moron, GadgetMobile a brilliant-ass, and "claw" Displays Disney thinks that the "child's image" does not "fully absorb brain use." The gadget should aim for a child of 10-12 years ... 10-12 months old kids like this film. Whatever this movie is, it's not a real reporter gadget, not repeat. Since I love the old gadget, I hate it.
