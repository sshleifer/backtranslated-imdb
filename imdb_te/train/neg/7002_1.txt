I saw this film and the other one. Trimurti is my name and I find that this is one of the worse ones first. I also do not know why they made another film stupid and understandably sorry to say I have them all. I'm sitting on a number of times and it will stop in the movie for 5 minutes. I love Terence Hill films and I like Bud Spencer but this film has put me down the wall. If there was a different storyline or at least one storyline and more comedy it would have been the price of 5 dollars that bought all the movies. But I will make mistakes I will save you money and do not trust me any of this movie or anything that I like in this film.
