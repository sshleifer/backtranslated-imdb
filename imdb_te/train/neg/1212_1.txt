Overall, the film is terrible and never made. One of the problems in the film is that there is no connection to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is going to attack you, "Oh my god, no!" But in this case, you do not care because there is no link to know about this character. In the trailer, the film is great but there is no further suspense. Maybe there is some mystery but there is not. "That's all the toolbox she has." As said of the DVD's back, you carefully plan this picture, and make it smarter, but it is not, the end, the awful, the most straightforward and the meaning is quite a lot. Acting average or lower than average, maybe less. In my opinion an hour in my life was ruined. "Special effects" and sets are average, so far nothing special. There is not much blood or bloodthirsty violence, so much blood is not shown. It's been promoted to give you a great deal of awesome sound and really, not really worth it, I do not recommend anyone with some battles and boring stories, unless they are easily satisfied.
