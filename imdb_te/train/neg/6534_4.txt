This sci-fi adventure is not the best and does not mean any worst. I agree that it's a bad science fiction joke. Strange pink ointment and extraordinary special effects make it a favorite of late, late, late-show viewers. Space explorers on the planet fight off monsters and other strange creatures like the strange giant Amoeba. <br /> The cast includes Les Tremane, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohar and Jack Kruschen. Get Comfy and have fun. If you want a moment does not feel bad. I added to the list of cult classics that I did not miss.
