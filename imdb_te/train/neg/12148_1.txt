Honestly, this image in the name of God gave a 8.1 rating ?? I guess people who have actually made or played in the film have voted. Otherwise this film sucks! This movie is not an amateur, or maybe a student, more than an image. I am telling the movie and I have seen horrible pictures, but literally nothing has been redeemed. The story and the acting I've seen so far is the worst. The use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, and there is evidence that everywhere have a bad name. I'm for bad language in all of the movies, but F-Bomb has fallen on every third word and we feel we are the winner for most of F-Bomb's use at anytime. The film is not an original image using inexpensive video cameras. <br /> <br /> I would like to get these awards for the amateur films shown in public access stations across the country, but this does not belong on DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that this free movie rental coupon is a terrible waste. It's worth a return time. Unfortunately, the time has passed, but it's not too late for you. If you hire this movie, consider this warning.
