The only good thing about this unfunny dirt is that I do not have to pay for it. I found free in college. <br /> <br /> Style acting and poor jokes are to be closed by Volkswagen Beatles (which will go out of its way) with a stunning, yet astonishing set design. I do not know what Michaels Meyers is doing in this film, but I have never seen anything desperate. This is not just a blatant attempt to invest in Grinch's previous success (it has its rivals, but I enjoy it). It's not difficult to sit through this failure, what good projects have you approved to go through the funds? <br /> <br /> Do you want to follow the funny suit? Go with Grinch.
