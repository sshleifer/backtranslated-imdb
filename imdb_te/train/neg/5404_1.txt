Would you ever kill an hour or two and unfortunately look at a movie and unfortunately do it abuse? Well, rent out movies for a weekend I see box art for this and see T-Rex. <br /> <br /> When I learned that the dinosaurs in the package are T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I'm in mood for a bad movie because of this. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret principles, companies are more concerned about their luck and shareholders and a big, poorly animated, soak-puppet T-Rex. It is clear from the movie that it's in the movie is clearly distinct scenes. Rex did not say he was never satisfied with hunger. He was hungry because he was not really stupid because he had a voice (when he read it from his mouth it was great ... a toy or something). Now, I'd be watching very bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how good a blockbuster movie is. This is a hilarious one. No scenes, no errors, you smile, because I can not think this is a thriller or comedy. <br /> <br /> If I blame the film's budget ... yes, but acting did not help. OK, Tony Todd looks really good, some of the female characters ... when you say "tears" do not come out? Meh, I'm going to be angry with this movie, I know what I'm doing and you're looking for a bad image to see with friends, here's what I recommend: look at this movie, then immediately Jurassic Park and return to the Lost World again. You could write Mr. Spielberg the next day.
