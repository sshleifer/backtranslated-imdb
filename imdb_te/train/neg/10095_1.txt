Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is spending 30 seconds to see if you can not afford any Stars Award is very likely to have immediate professional help. <br /> <br /> This film ... well ... I guess pretty much kind of at a grim romance / laughter image with romance or original horrible bits (acting, story, story, sets, dialogue and sound) . I mistakenly thought about it zombies. <br /> If it looks like it's really scary; You'll come over someone you fear and you will not be able to explain it and they will go away thinking that you're a freak to watch videos of amateur torture videos or something that you have done. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, It will never be (heartless) it will never be.
