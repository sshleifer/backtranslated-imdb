The star-filled British / Spanish co-production is great and you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, a DVD, and all terribly cut, so it looks great so that buildings have conversations with each other. Director Robert Parish seems to be appealing with the widescreen process, as he neglected the screen on both sides. Initially another consumer opinion was that we had massively killed the entire inhabitants of a church. That's not what copies I have. There are some spontaneous cuts fired by their rifles, a Mexican officer shot, Shaw and Landau, and that's it. Why did not Shaw find that he was a priest, he could not find out what happened to Don Carlos (Savalas), but suspected that he had returned to his home in Kozhik, his departure was totalitarian. Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) The 1960s hit battle of New Orleans has a fantastic flashback sequence featuring a bowler hat and a bad suit in the classic Old Music Music Hall tradition where Johnny Horton does not sing, but some lyrics I have never heard before. On the plus side, this place is great, well-known by Ecker-style steps, good show by Robert Shaw-chewing, and great shows by Steve's, Laundau, Letter, and Telly Savalas. I really did not like this movie, but I certainly did not see it. I'll find a wide screen version and take my decision.
