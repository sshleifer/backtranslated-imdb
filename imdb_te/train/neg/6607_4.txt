Some people are making it, but it is not very bad when compared to the original remorse. In my opinion, Amitabh is great as a villain Baban Singh - try not to match the original gabber as they clearly do not go for the same effect. Unlike some general action scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. The character development is weak and the development of the story is baseless, many loopholes, and I do not know if I read the DVD case. Nisha Kothari, especially the new person Prasat Raj, was the worst performer in the film. Nisha was sad from her opening the lips first. For Prasad Raj - Who is this person? Where is he and why is he in the movie studio for anything other than serve drinks ?. His performance is zero and he has the same tone, dialogue delivery and strong expression in every scene, whether it is action, comedy or the scene when anyone is alive. Ajay Devgan on average, his expressions are more than what I would say to his colleague's fault. Overall, the RGVS is a very valuable looking of Aag-ibid's performance, and a very unique Urmila Matondkar is a special show.
