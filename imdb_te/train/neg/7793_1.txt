This is one of the worst films ever made. I'm a huge zombie movie fan and generally bad acting, with the cue "special effects" moody story and having a good weather / story / suspension or any kind of conversation you may have in second movies. This one is basically no worse as it is any positive aspect and third or fourth rate. Some of my friends and I made a short film on a week's holidays and did a pretty good job (although no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This film is not funny, it is not funny. Really bad and recurring special effects, normal people (except for a whitish extra skin), fake blood (I like realism, realism combination and zombie movies are debatable, but Gour presented is just plain crazy). Camera Feedings scenes are a long time, it gets boring and you wonder but help, why zombies use the WEAPONS (!) To kill their food. I do not get dubbing details (others do it). <br /> I've had at least a bit of interest in Germany and since the original version, but I'll waste my time with this film. <br /> Get away from it.
