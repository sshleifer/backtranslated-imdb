I found this to be a good time, but no historical value. Cleopatra's character reminds me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> The twist of facts ... funny! She gave birth when she was eating people !! O please ... pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this) do not bother to go from one room to another because of that! They tried to make a saint look for God! <br /> <br /> She tried to justify murdering her own sister. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is her greatest politician. Her decisions did nothing but her feelings and morals. She just did everything for two reasons: strength and self-care! She was born in a family that was praised for her survival, and she did very well. <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was very powerful to kill, many considered homosexuality. So, he is the end of her ...
