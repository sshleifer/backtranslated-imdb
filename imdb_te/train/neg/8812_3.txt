Unfortunately, the reality is boring. This film, I thought I would never end it, if all the characters in the first five minutes were dramatic. Where is the blade when you need him? While COMBAT is as dismal as shock, like a dream and nightmare as BOISE MOI, Diaz Creations is not nearly as entertaining as any of the above mentioned Bleak movies. Unfearing cannibalists Jeffrey Dalmers' hearts are running a little faster, it's not as interesting as revenue. Really, I have found out about as interesting as late night infomercials, and as a trip to the Dentist is exciting. If you have strong masochistic features, you can not tolerate it, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that people at Brain Damage did not do this because they had the quality of Dead Creatures.
