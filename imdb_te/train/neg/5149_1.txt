This film is about a male rape victim / comic book writer from New York and decides to move away from a dirty big city glamor and finds refuge in a wide trailer on a dirt. Urban people are mentally ill and she is trying to invite crazy in her trailer. He has the ability to do the right thing to keep her in a dangerous situation after a dangerous situation. DB Sweeney's performance is the best. He is one of those little-looking young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately the career is not kind and mother nature is in the right turn. I agree well to the previous commentator that acting is "true". Actually it is not acting. The two main characters are really repentant, weaker and do not make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no other, it laughs it to laugh. True crime scene? The vicious wooden panel in the trailer - enough to kill ME. Finally, she was an artist / writer, so he could not find a double-width trailer and love to the god other than the sun-yellow Chevy Chevette!
