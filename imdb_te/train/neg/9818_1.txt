This film emphasizes many questions in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tillley work on all these limited films based on this ridiculous larynx voice and her limited assurance facial expressions? Second ... What is the cause of these dangerous and deeply repulsive images on earth? And thirdly ... there are enough people who decide to make ruins like this, given that the studio, distributors, or somewhere - it's actually done and. You really need to look too much to duplicate another movie this way too ... And this is not even a horror film - it's perfect for movie genre, which can be seen as legitimate. The movie begins with illness, violence and abuse. I'm not really supporting censorship (I do not believe it) ... but I can not really see how to draw anything positive from watching a movie like this.
