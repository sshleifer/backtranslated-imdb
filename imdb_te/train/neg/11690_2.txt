It is the waist that sings such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. What's more difficult to get rid of thieves than all the unanswered questions in other comments? If the bank strikes workers, before the thieves are entering the banks from footage angles of footage, the hostages have 4 pirates in the victims. Where does the suspense talk about each body? It is very clear the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they went out on the front door ... It has been seen many times. Some Spice Lee has spent the film with good music and artwork. This image is not worth it. Fast!
