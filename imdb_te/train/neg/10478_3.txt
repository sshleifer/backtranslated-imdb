I thought this film was heartfelt as another poor effort of the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a bit fun, but when they change their role in society (men usually do what men and men do usually do) Boring and not funny at all. Many things allow explanation and the end of the film is unexpected. I did not like Roberto Angel to play his role and play a minor role. <br /> I do not recommend this movie. <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
