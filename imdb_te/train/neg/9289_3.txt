<br /> <br /> In the original, you have a chance to find out what happened to Tachch in the original film and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first film, a man hiding in gold is telling Twitch that he is transferred to another jail where the wrestling champions look at the bramdo and hang around. <br /> Then something happens and someone shoots and kills and the film becomes harder in another jail. <br /> If acting is equal to you, it's really painful (really annoying)) rap music, and poorly revised fight scenes. On the plus side, the Hispanic block starring in every jail / action / thriller previously made, and he closes the door in it. <br /> It's not very different. <br /> If you're an original Fan, this is a Ish-Ish thing. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you are warned.
