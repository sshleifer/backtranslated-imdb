The last film released here is the recent move to bring Asian films into America. As a big fan of Asian films from all genres, I've neted the net and got it into the US market, so I decided to check it out and rent it in the local video store. br >> Trust me ... Action scenes are very frustrating, tiring tiger and iron monkey completely erase the water from the film. Jet lights are sleeping in the fight scenes. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better with a jockey chan image <br /> <br /> Moreover ... you dipped in Wenger for a martial arts girl parental death but evil! In the middle of a good hourly conversation of the film, with a silent silence, a tangent plot is not separated, there is nothing very good with the premise that we are exposed to. With her relationship with her and boyfriend, and with his conspiracy team, none of the producers / directors ever devoted time and devoted some part of the film to the problem. <br /> <br /> They cut the entire bell and developed a story by another story and focused on the martial arts theme. <br /> I'm talking, Iron Monkey's choreographer, action sequence in Princess Blade. I was totally disgusted to paint the murderers' physical silence because of the sudden use of moves and rapid camera changes. I did not buy it. <br /> <br /> I warned you not to waste your time / money with this movie. The premise is intruding, the trailer also searches you, but the film is not in favor of the people (probably not in Japan but in the States) and is the worst film that has been brought into the states from Asia. Industry.
