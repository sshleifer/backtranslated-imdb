Bollywood is the first in the Gujarati theater. Both follow their strengths and fan. Director Vipul Shah is to look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati theater while doing Bollywood production. Athan Anhnen (from a Gujarati drama) was originally composed of a special story, but it was not a Hindi film. Now he has been in favor of another Gujarati play and it is named Vakth - race against time. Overall, emotions are alien. The plot is not for the development of Hindi films. For example, it plays a role between father and son. Best of the Gujarati Theater - It should not come into the Hindi film. The comedy track is also good for the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - shout about nothing - excluding Shefali Chhaya Shah who is excellent.
