Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I think I should say something. I'm searching for 'sprayer fest' as someone who makes it 'blood and guts / gore'. Although I do not really regard filmmakers, the relatives of the victims have some respect. - They are nameless, unnecessary and meaningless. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say I have seen this movie and the specifics of the Dahmer story know very little, I think people do not need to cover the events of Dummer's story .. IE is his history, what happened when he caught, later, etc. But what's important is you! But you will learn all this, we live in America There are ways in which a picture is shown by horror elements, some of what he did (including reading about user comments on this site) I learned more!), This film is empty A moment in time with very little material, the film is very good when there is a film about Dil DÃ¤mmer, slowly slow, lack of a dammer, stringent filming of homosexuality and no end to any attempt at the end. I do not recommend anyone to waste time watching. A perfect 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
