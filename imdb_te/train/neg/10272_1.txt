When I read the DVD case, I thought it was really interesting ... so ... my mother fell on the pictures in the "4 for 20 dollars" section of the block buster. And when we come home and popped in the movie ... Twenty minutes, we're going to put each other in "Let these sucks put something else." I agree, a few lines from friends at the cafe made us smile. But, get some good actors. Acting is good and the picture goes a painfully slow and does not seem to be really interesting, at one point in a movie, I can get some laughs at how they gut it and how they make (or below) their paths. But I'll take much more. Crying scenes appear as if the actors have the foul smile of laughter, not the delivery for their lines ... amateur does not come close to acting. <br /> Anyone who came here said that the film was good and they had some really good drugs while watching the movie. This is the most meaningful thing I've had to be unsatisfied with watching. Do not look or buy this movie !!!!!
