<br /> <br /> <br /> The high school geek who is murdered is animated with a scarecrow that takes revenge on all. <br /> <br /> This film really blew me up. It has a great looking monster, has some good low-budget effects, some atmosphere, but the small circuit performs bad things. I am speeding in half an hour and step through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this image. The first cast is about thirty, and yet they want to be in high school. You do not believe anything from getting the result. Scarecrow, not much beyond looking great. He says stupid moves in a more leaner and more manner designed to be more scary funny. Is not this comedy or horror movie? This is much more than a linear conversation dialogue. Each click will send more than the heart horror film. <br /> <br /> This film is not for a very narrow audience and fans of horror fans to ridicule it. If you choose it in a bargain bin under five bucks, you're paying a lot. <br /> <br /> Get rid of.
