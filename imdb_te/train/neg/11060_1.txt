It may have a soft, lovely look in one's life in America's most brutal serial killers, but unfortunately it does not come close. Dreadful editing, direction, bad acting, you name it. The film literally stretched to about 10 minutes plot 100. Bruce Davidson is the only father, but it's almost insufficient to protect this stinker. 10 to 1.
