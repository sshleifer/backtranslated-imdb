The. Damaged. Image. Ever. <br /> <br /> After seeing this hypothetical homosexuality, I suspect that I have rounded a blind half of a brain damaged neo-Nazi and made him the worst gesture in some fraudulent attempts to attack gay culture. <br /> <br /> When I paused the movie like a shock, distrust and a turmoil, I had to stop the movie and call a friend, terrible writing and acting and supernatural and stupid plot, its poorly built movie. <br /> <br /> After seriously reviewing some positive reviews, the film is here, and I suspect the author has half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this movie is a joke rather than a watch, a liar or a significant one.
