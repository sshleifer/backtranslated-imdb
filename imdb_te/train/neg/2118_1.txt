What can I say about seven pounds ... I saw from Seattle to Tokyo on the plane and the plane was long and the boring cinematic never helped. Smith's character Ben Thomas is finally completely unlikable with his ransom. The movie's two hours plus running time wastes more time with random trash, as the storyline as possible slowly. Although the role of Rosario Dawson in film protection is too small for the film, there is not much. I can not hear anyone in the film, I do not mean why I refused everything I wanted to do. Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish in the proof that he is killing you with a jellyfish and the worst way to die.
