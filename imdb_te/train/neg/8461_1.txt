I know that Willem Dapto will insult me ​​with such a shock in this wealth. Hell: I'm disappointed that I'm donating money that I'm going to send to Ethiopia. I never saw it as such a curiosity and boring film ... who paid for it? They are pulling some tax scandal or madness. A 5-year-old plot is shy, and I have had more cancer than an hour facing difficulties. Everyone involved should be locked up for a year in a third world prison's sodomy wing. Avoid all costs. If possible I would give minus 10 ... unbelievable.
