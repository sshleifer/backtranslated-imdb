I see this movie. . . If the following comments are "proof of my development as a true, artistic filmmaker", then . <br /> <br /> . I thought (I'm still looking at it right now) this movie. . . It's too overrated, too, to put it a little bit. <br /> <br /> The guy who goes beyond the very limited resources really looks like a really, really bad student film. . . <br /> I wanted to go in different ways that I did not see in the film. . . Well. . . I can not get it (Remember, I feel completely idiot it's not - not the filmmaker - does not get this "imaginative intellectual piece"). . . The reviews are very good, so I rented it on a mirror. . <br /> Sheesh. . .
