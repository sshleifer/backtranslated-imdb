I watched this last night on the tube. This actor first attracted my attention. The first scenes were caring. Some humorous develop some good character. I felt that the final third of the film was different. I would have stopped watching if not for the opening episode of the film. <br /> Unfortunately, I think I have never happened. I do not particularly like that of the character of many of the character's speak of speaking. <br /> Do I recommend No, I'm not. Although other critics have claimed the accent most (60's jive), it did not pay much attention. The end has changed me altogether.
