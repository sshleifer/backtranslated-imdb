I am happy that watching the film is a very angry one if I'm doing socks or wasting 2 hours in my life. Acting is terrible, the plot is even worse. There are some scenes that my husband and I are serious that are laughing out loud. I highly recommend this film to people who wish to make MST3K's own version.
