At least the theater seats were comfortable and I over-popped the popcorn with a low level dialogue. This is definitely not the image of the girls. No blokes that it likes, we are sure to stay away from the ladies. Mute story, medium dialogue and overall cheaper looking movie. I have seen many movies that have seen many movies but the new winner in the bad category. If you look at it, one thing you will expect is the end. So you can eventually make the theater faster.
