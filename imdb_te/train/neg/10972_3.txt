This is not a movie spot or spotting Guy Ritchie. This is a large volleyball. It wants to be a very exciting, nervous-laughable, urban-life rich film, but it's a camera jerky, mess. The real characters are much simpler to imitate something, than to create a true story. Initially, I could not care less about the letters or what they did. Only, there is no substance they are doing. The dialogue between characters is meant to be hip, revealing, instead it comes out silver, and another is a scene speculative. I know that the audience is very fond of this movie, so I can be wrong.
