I have seen it at the Venice Film Festival and can not make much decision about it. We never let close close to any of the characters we care about about them. Perhaps it's in the "bubble" of ours, but these people are not worried about me or are surprised by their different luck. With just over a hour running, the characters grew well. Time is dedicated to factory equipment shots (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels) for quite a long time; And the little-creepy-looking baby dolls with astonishing living eyes are somewhat more interesting than most of the characters who have played for a creature. An interesting experiment, but somehow it came together.
