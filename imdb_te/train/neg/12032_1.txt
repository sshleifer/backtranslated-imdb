This film is terrifying. I have a very hard time watching this all the way. I did not get the point of the film. What is the point of this film? Soundtrack is bad, acting is good, and the story is not very bad. The two main characters in the film are very boring and their dialogue is unconscious. No cast members have chemistry. I do not really know this thing, but I suspect that many actors are the first timers. The film can be reduced to about half an hour without losing the plot. There are a number of useless scenes in this film. I have a hay root canal during two hours. I want two hours back! If you want to watch a good, funny picture of a family friendly and mammalian group, see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
