Someone told me that this is one of the best adult films to date. After seeing this film, I am the person who said this to me. It's just terrible. Without long explanations of different scenes, it takes my word, sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Early in the typical street costume, Jenna highlighted the film (she looks good) but it is deeply deep from there.
