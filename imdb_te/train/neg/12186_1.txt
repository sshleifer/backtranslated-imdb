The remake of the film in 1962 is good in this book and has good performances by some good actors - though Shakespeare's death towards the end of the formulaic of Scorsese plot turns out to me and the trouble with me. <br /> <br /> Deno is a magnificent actor He was devoted to giving him work, yet focused on his talent He directed to the needs and the past five minutes /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo role in the feed <br, Robert Mitch, this may be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte works better than Lorenzo Oil but is not like "Weeds". <br /> <br /> Zoo Don Baker has some great songs, and Juliet Lewis once again proves that he is crossing a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The first sight behind the back of the chick in the jail, the sight of the chicken baseball bats, the terrible dread of Sam Bowden's full-fledged chicken and the unharmed unnerving prescence of the hen. <br /> Worst? "Cleaning woman - but not really!" Part. Bare handle to the underside of the car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Is there speed bumps in the US?) "He is dead - but not really!" <br /> <br /> I can see the original original again, but I have searched for a remake of the four years I've seen.
