.... and after seeing this heap of rubbish you will not be surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a horrible film by any standards but when you point out that I am one of the worst films titled Stephen King titled credits. <br /> "My God, what's up here?" <br /> "I do not know, but they are absolutely hate cats" <br /> <br /> Hundreds of cats come out of a house that is dead and sliced. The boy is right, someone hates cats and he wants to be a policeman. Oh wait a minute, he knows he's going to look at a bad movie, making a oh so clear observation he starts with a police and a movie. <br /> <br /> Sleepwalkers believe that bad reason is too careless and confusing. Finally we find that the virgin's blood is needed for survival of the title's monsters. Are not they looking for a virgin in the Mid West Bible belt than an American coastal town? At least we have learned about the intentions of the monsters - this is the only thing we have learned. Whether they know how to change the shape or the cars that are found stolen from the tissue, can make these characters disappear. The monster's mother kills many cops with her bare hands or blows them out of the hands of the gun gun (!), But if her monster is immune from police force fire, then why do people need to change shape or disappear? Death of organisms that die as a result of mass killing of domestic cats is equally ill. If they kill a child, why not kill all the cats around the garden? There is a whole crowd of moggies sitting around but never thought about killing them with monsters. I guess that product could be brought to an end. <br /> <br /> Leading film directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and Stephen King are also treated for several scenes. I was casting a struggling unknown actor script because they had reason to do this because they got to phone up his horror buddies to fill in Stephen King, so they decided what this bad guy was not going to look like in a movie. <br /> <br /> It is unbelievable that the film is not a deadly line. The worst line - "That cat saved my life"
