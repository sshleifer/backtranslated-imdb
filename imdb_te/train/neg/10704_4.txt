This ski resort meets Cliffhanger when the terrorists are besieged, a cop, Jack (crackersack) to stop it. <br /> <br /> A B-Action film from other films is pretty good with beautiful action, ridiculous plot (always on these films) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith Cop and Nastazza Kinski and Christopher Plummer terrorists. This is not for you if you do not like stupid B-Action movies.
