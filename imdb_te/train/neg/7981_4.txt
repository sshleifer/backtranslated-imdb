Rookie suffers a lot. Jerry Levi's Blush is a cinematic, long nonsense script and random musical songs with enough slipstick. When Noon and Livitt left when no one knew. The story takes a full hour and then the characters will be defeated after entering the main story. Japanese sailors then start playing with classic racist satirical images. The humorous episodes of this film are an insult when Neonan and Lewitt stupid, stereotyped Japanese boys play. But, it's pretty tired after moving back and forth between the two sets. Then it ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> Naked Julie Newmar also can not save the movie in this film. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the cinema. The story tries to set up funny conditions and try to make a failure. Stick to Martin & Louise. At least Dino has a charm and Jerry has that animated face.
