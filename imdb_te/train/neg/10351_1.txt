The film's storyline is less than the film. All of the attractive points in the book are not in the movie. They ended up making a cheesy "middle" Disney movie "love" story between Meg and Calvin. It's too bad to lose Hillary Duff's role or be one of the favorites. There is nothing to insult the book's intelligence and spirituality. I can not believe that I can get away with such a cheap, basic version of Disney. If you've read the book anytime, I agree that it's made easy for a "Lord of the Rings" image. The film has never used a Time In Time title. It's done poorly.
