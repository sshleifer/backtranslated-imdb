When many people said it was a "worst thing I've ever seen", they say that they do not really like any movie. However, I remember remembering about 700 movies, and I personally feel insulted and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and just as I rat the sincerity of this film enrolling with IMDb. In the theaters I went to see it (and me and my two relatives there were 3 in 5), and 15 years later I was unable to remember many things, but my attitude is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> "Oh, where are you going? Fat leave at the altar losing, Sky weekend Takes me home to meet the family, who meets the blonde bombs, who takes interest, they are all cannibals and he runs the main course, curiosity at a dramatic escape, runs with their kicks butts and brother's girlfriend, It's been a while, and they seemed to be almost impossible to look at, as they were 15 years ago, with some special effects, some of them, which seemed to be FUNNY, and it's a COMEDY. (He will eat whole cannibals in the pastry, they are And Jerry nilabettukunnappudu style may be.) I'm sure there's a lot more, but there is no intention for me to see it again for a refresher.
