I'm looking forward to watching Dreamgirls for a while ... its reviews, nominations and media attention all over. And I say, the picture is fine in the first trimester! It really portrayed the black music scene. Nevertheless, when wearing the film, I and my family were frustrated with our comedy. Singing is just another one coming later. <br /> Furthermore, I have another musical number, which also broke with RENT. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that any of the characters have not developed any role. What happened to them? Eddie Murphy's role Although a drug dies in a high dose, I know I should be sad, but I can not feel any emotion for that role. <br /> Lastly, though the conflict is not just considerable enough to care for the viewer, it goes along with the lack of character development. A picture of a copy-cat based on Ray, Chicago, and rental (which includes fantastic films in Ray and Chicago in my opinion) reminded me of this film. Overall, I think the film is best suited to the person who does not care for the whole story, enjoying entertaining and entertaining singing hours for two hours.
