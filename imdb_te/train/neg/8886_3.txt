Not quite impressed. It is difficult to spoil the film because there is no improvement in the platform. Everything is evident in the first ten minutes, drying it out from dry. This acting was also very poor, reminding me of the old black and white Maoist era that occasionally featured on Chinese television during daytime. Although Yuen is hard to tell the role of a woman, this story is like a wooden toy that requires only her running round. It reminds me of Star Gong Li's being somehow better known as a good performer in the West for all the time having an anger on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Juanzhuujiang movie 'Blue Kite' is a very good movie. But in the late 40th century Spreadtime a Small Town was not set up. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Blue Kite, if the film was set during the rebellion, the plot is not related to it, the ruins of the town are no more than a lovely background. Tian Zhuangzhuang is just trying to ride the popularity of Chinese movies in the West and appeal to a foreign audience not to tell the difference between 'beautiful' 'deep' or 'hypnotic' and an image that is just tedious <br /> <br /> If any image is sufficient to match the overtrade, This is the same. I did not find any reason to stop worrying about the Chinese film industry.
