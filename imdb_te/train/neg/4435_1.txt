The gods, I have not seen this movie for a long time. Perhaps 'The New Guy' or not from various Freddie Prentice Jr. films. Yes, it's astonishingly terrible. Empty and woodworking of Mira Sorvino is inspired by Freddie. Film performance is awkward (unlike drama, the concept of detention does not work well in the film). Actors do not know what they are doing, especially Sorvino. Her voice is horrific and she does not have sex appeal, so she is painful to see other 'sequencing' characters and 'dropped' for it. And there are occasional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to discontinue the DVD player, which had a self-consequence pain to complete.
