The film is terrible waste of time. Though it's just an hour and a half, it's somewhere close to 4. I've never seen a movie move slowly and therefore without a benefit. It is also a "horror" movie, which takes a lot of time during the day. <br /> <br /> In many countries we need to know why such a horror film was released. It is not in demand. <br /> <br /> She has lost many times in the film, her half time as she is British and half time American because supermodel Nicole should be committed to petty modeling.
