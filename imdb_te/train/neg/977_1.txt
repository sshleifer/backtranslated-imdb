"Fever Pitch" is not a bad image; It's a terrible picture. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers and critics have expressed belief that Hollywood has praised the heavens for the movie which is funny with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing funny in this film because I get good reviews of this horrible romance (I have used this word for fun). Gunj and Babalu Mandel also think their script is fun. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually understands well for the film. He adopted the British film "Fever Pitch", starring Colin Firth and Ruth Jimmel in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "A Boy A Boy" (2002) and in 2000 when "High Fidelity" came to the United States for a film, authors D.V. Devinscis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not quit because they put a summary of Hornby's wit and humor. <br /> Why does the American version of "Fever Pitch" get worse? The British version is not a masterpiece, but it's lovely, funny, unexpected and gave us the likes, both the respect and the understandable characters. <br /> <br /> But all the fun in Ganj and Mandel Hornby's work have been removed. In the story of American, they removed Hornby's work as good and unique and changed it with a traditional motion. <br /> <br /> They changed the funny story as a foolish romantic comedy, once veering from the outrageous principle. Lindsay (Drew Barrymore) has three friends, each of whom has a special task. One's overweight, second cynical and prestigious, and the third is a romantic. <br /> <p> High fidelity is good not only a popular person and woman but encourages supporting roles. In this "Fever Pitch", six supporting friends are not particularly funny or say nothing. They are so important, they are not even decorative. The only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it. Winds like a Lindsey's Pals in the poor Ion Sky. The lovely ski Lloyd Dabler has been aggressive and should have wished to take her away. Think of it and Cusack will make a fantastic Ben. <br /> <br /> There is only one secluded moment in the film that is not alone. Every plot turn is predictable, every slum joke is telegraph. Ganj and Mandel workers to laugh. The first 45 minutes are slowly slow and you are surprised if these chaps realize that they are writing comedy. The plot of the plot can be marked by your watch. This is almost the same if it is written with some scribble guru principle on Gunz and Mandel wall. When they came to a particular page, they saw the formula and said, "OK, that the Guru is now said." <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelli can not help any more. They do not have any idea how to introduce their story and characters (they are entrusted to V.O.'s storyless hero, another man behind Ben in the Fenway Park). Thanks to some very clunky writing, we have to see Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny opening sessions. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes it much better than beautiful and beautiful. She is good as Goldie Honey in all her ancestors. But she will not save this extraordinarily awful picture of her softness. She is hard to draw some energy and humor in this story. In a 30-minute film, Lindsay Ben said, "You're funny." The script is only in the script. Fallon's Ben can never be remotely funny. Fallon is not witty or funny; <br /> <br /> Fallen is no good at "Saturday Night Live". He is a very funny person in that show. Remember a kite sketch about a radio DJ made of all the voices? Fallon's harmony, Tina Fay, one thing or two about the comedy because "Weekend Update" occasionally worked. <br /> <br /> The actors who think they're fun and rarely behave are actually funny. Fallon is true. He just feels hysterically funny when he just raises a stew. His stuttering, he did not work on a small screen without his knowledge; <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the Fallen, his role in the film also requires some dramatic movements. If you think his comedy is bad, wait for the load of his dramatic content. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second before Ben's school - are sad to see. Scenes seek an actor with a photograph of dramatic ability, but Fallon does not have the knowledge or the ability to work with them. <br /> <br /> Ben does not have any personality or depth. Often, he comes across as an egg. And that's not a lovable at all. Lindsay makes the minds of what makes him beautiful about him. Compare Fallon's performance to the British version of the Forrans, and how terrible the flat, unfunny and forceful Ben is of Ben and I understand how wrong he is to this character. <br /> <br /> "Highly Fidelity" is rarely seen in the "Fever Pitch" as an American "Fever Pitch" performs exquisitely. It's just good writers, more competent directors and, more precisely, strong, ridiculous, intelligent person. Make yourself heavier: Avoid this rotten image; Rent the British version of 1997 and read the book in the Hornby instead.
