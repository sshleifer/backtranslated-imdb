So the man named George is sitting at home on his birthday when two women. George's wife takes care of their son at the hospital, so the wife gets in George Bubble Bath and loves two girls. It's not great for a scene because it does not really show anything. The next morning the birthday boy wakes up, the girls are at home. They make him a good breakfast but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and he tries to move them but the girls are at home when he comes home. The girls have enough with the old gorge and want to cook them anymore. They both become major mental illnesses and use George in their little silly game. The girls liked what I wanted and confused George's house. George is not really great for his two guests. When George says he is a married man, he does not really understand it. George Family Guy is like a Tom Talker. I have two girls for the whole time.
