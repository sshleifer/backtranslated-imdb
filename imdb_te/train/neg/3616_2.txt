If you just look at this film cover, it's nice. Not. The film made me sleep. It is slow, the poor use of low violence and suspense. Feeder material and plot under acting, which was cool for another movie, where it was performed less. They also kill the character that they only love in the whole movie! The only thing that's fine is because the plot twist at the end. In addition, you may want to save you from this movie trash.
