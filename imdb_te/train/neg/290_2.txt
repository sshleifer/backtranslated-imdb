Killer Tomatoes films have this kind of humor - you love it or hate it. I personally like it, but the concept in this fourth movie is gone. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even the actors are not funny. <br /> <br /> Now, after the plot, which is meant to laugh, it's annoying. They can not really do the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
