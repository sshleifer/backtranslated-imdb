While I was home and bored, I found it on the shelf. How can people give this one a 10? It's not a feel-good redemption film (I think) because it does not work at that level. Weak plots, bad conversations, terrible acting; There is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is good, but nothing has worked, and Bridget Fonda and especially Jeetan Schreck are awful. Story progress (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. The authors want the plot to go to a particular path, wanting to do it without actually writing the bits needed to make it. It's just an hour and a half, but your life will never return you for 90 minutes.
