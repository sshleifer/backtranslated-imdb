Good Earth is not a great image by any means, this is a simple way. Perhaps it was different in the 1930s, but I wanted to see the life of the peasants. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Louis Rayner and Paul Muni are an excellent job acting, but the picture is too long. I told the first film that the film ended. The short-lived farmer would be exactly like his own father in the little Wang Lung (Muni). Both fall in love with their wives, as if their death is in bed. The film goes from the full generation to another generation. There are no good characters or funny moments in the film, which discourages the continuity of being a farmer during the crisis.
