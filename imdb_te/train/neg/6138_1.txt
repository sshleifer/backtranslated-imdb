The film is from God, from feeling to death. Should the US set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? It is the way to obtain access to their mantle, the US ends, the cross country race, where the leader of the winner can ask anything, is to win the obstacle course. And who better to win this race called "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast is the right choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was an operative. For our hero lucky, there's gimmicky equipment in lucky spots such as the pomegranate knife in the middle of a square between the silly town (for no reason). Perfect. <br /> <br /> But horribly, in the hobbly premise, the embarrassing fumes of porn scenes, the most dreaded Ninjas apparently, it seems to have a flag to refer to the racial path, and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero will tell the US government wishes. And less and behold, all the hard work is worth it, because the US gets its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! Is this your timestamp? <br /> <br /> But still, such a bad movie is very fun to see. <br /> <br /> Whenever I have ever been to meet Kurt Thomas (Gymnast-Star) in truth, maybe I have painted Ninjas with machine guns, leave him in the face after a double strike with 2 1/2 turns on both sides.
