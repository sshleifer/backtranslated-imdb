Well we can not have an image that we made about the inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community in the UK, the last example I can remember is the way back to Babylon way less in the 1980s. When I hear I have high expectations about the bullet boy, a film advertised as the British version of La Hain! La hine is not it! <br /> <br /> The use of dialogue and environment is that the film has been delayed by other British films, but the film ends repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The film is intelligible in black in blacksmith issues in London, but the filmmakers are now using the plot against the characters that are equally damaging to journalists. Soul Dibb has a great opportunity to create a fun and exciting two films, but unfortunately missed out and a young black male in London is the only future of violence and tragedy
