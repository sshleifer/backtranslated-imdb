I've seen four other Japanese horror images and they are not very impressive. However, I realized that the path was right guidance. <br /> Not here. It is about the detective who tries to build similar murders. When he asks a suspect, the suspect is strange because they see a ghost. <br /> The ghost begins to follow the episode. It never explained and would take up to a large part of the film. <br /> Is it bad enough? Oh no. This story changes the perspective of different characters that are not very familiar. It's like I've seen in other films shown in a different perspective. It's not the case here. <br /> <br /> Also, what's happening on the screen is quick to allow. For example, some scenes with a little instrumental score have been built and it will be cut to another scene. I know this is a dramatic effect. This is not exactly here. It's just bad editing. <br /> Finally, there is a "ghost" that screams scary or unexpectedly funny. It's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie. <br /> You need to be afraid of everything. Then one of them, the movie ended. At that time, a wave of chaos wiped out on the audience as we all felt like we wasted our time. Someone made a mock clap and laughed. It's better than the whole movie. Keep it easy.
