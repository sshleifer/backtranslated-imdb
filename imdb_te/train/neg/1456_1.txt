Simply put, it's simplistic and a dimensional image. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that it does not try to be deep or difficult to do with Hitler's character. Besides, when we see Hitler's perspective on the background of bad music from the first minutes of the film, we see him as a supervisor of the cartoon and watch the TV show from the right on Saturday morning. Hitler is bad, but the film wants to make it a reality if anyone wants to convince Hitler that he is bad. In the end, he is boring and confusing, playing the same nasty role (how to tell him to play a paltry, fascist role in the film motion, or as a time man for the year). The film has a great opportunity to bring in someone who has taken some of the most awful acts of the 20th century and try to light it in his mind. Instead, it was basically "Hey Hitler was bad! The film of great satire was still attacked by the character to be very sympathetic.
