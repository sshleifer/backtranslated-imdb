I know that the film is actually 90% bagas, which is the biggest steam pile you know what is growing and growing from Wichita Kansas. Some are from the names of the victims, and nothing is more appropriate. It seems to have been made with the father's handmade cam, which is the footage I believe believes that it comes from slaughter house, stock footage and another movie. I enjoyed watching the bad images of fun, but bad acting, poorly made or unavailable sets and a very dull and short ending. This is a struggle to see it by ending. I would recommend that you do not want to waste your money in this film or you're sorry. Crunch
