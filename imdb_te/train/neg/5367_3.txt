I saw this spin-off every episode. I thought it was a good effort considering the expectations of a success that was the first season Gray's Anatomy. I'm watching. The play of chemistry and the anatomy of Gray's predecessor in the second season is not so important. Relationships are obvious and acting is very early. This work does not contain intelligence and comic instructions found in GA. There are shows but there is no formula and fiction, unfortunately not PP. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.
