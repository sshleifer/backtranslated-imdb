I was disappointed in this 1970 film based on this Bernard Malu story. <br /> <br /> It is primarily for living discrimination based on liberation, racial discrimination and distrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel was sent out to help a struggling tailor and his critical wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mozel) only believes in the angel (belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Cominska) will regain it. <br /> When he believes in it, it improves the funny, but in the end he has doubts and hesitates funny accordingly. <br /> <br /> "The street on main street" directs this picture. Kamenska will be reduced to several bed scenes in this film and her speech gives her the kind of disappointment she really faced. Ruthie, who was obedient to her by marrying the Jewish religion, called their daughter. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the Angel Girl Friend is facing Belfast in their apartment, but everything is all about <br /> <br /> We do not know why Befontef was dead and why he died. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie leaves the theater in depression and desperation.
