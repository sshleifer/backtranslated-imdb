John Huston's Wise Blood is a more horrific film of Fleury O'Connor's book than I expected. This is a musical score suited to the episode of Rockford Files, and it's totally horrific acting performances (and not yours, "Oh, with that intention, you're not getting it!"). I initially saw it without illness and in fact, guessing a pleasant experience. But lilting from the fraudulent fraudulent southern draw of the Southern characters, their confidence in the funny way, is not misleading. On the right, there is no sense of the characters, but O'Connor's book shinted and failed at every echoed space. Actors who portray the "South" police may be eating hot dogs, citing Godfather from NYC Street stands. Nou Beety's cheerful and dead On Hoover Shoots actress Ned Betty acting, featuring Christ, the Church of Christ without Christ, watches dollar signals and business opportunities. O'Konnor's powerful book "Faith" jibes as the unmoved lifeless commander is well-known for the creepy and religious underworld. The insulting joke of Mr. Houston's intentions of the author, if they understand me and understand many fans, may be as bold as I say. I have a lot to love to be a fan of her and her work, even though I realize that I'm not sure what the author is saying. If I saw Wise Blood, Mr. Hasston made clear, I would throw it in the trash. For the sake of flannery and mine I have forgiven you, John Huston. Forgetting .... take some time.
