"My Beautiful Laundry", "Bend Like Beckham" and (lower) "East East East" I have many expectations. British Asians have their own home-made histories on the big screen, as well as excellent TV and radio sequences (good looks good, etc.). This one comes flat. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a terribly distinctive BBC effort, strong regional tunes, sarcastic over-acting characters, "those days" soundtrack, and <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie I am kringing at several points. The writing is speculative. Every possible click is dragged and streamed. In fact, I felt that I could not use any cross-cultural / cross-generational devices. The characters are thin and cliche: the unusual but conformist minister; Good meaning but ultimately a racist elderly woman; Weighing over, striking aunt; pushy Indian parents; Neighbors of the working class; 'Intelligent' deep grandmother; Motorbike ride thug. The script is weak and has every opportunity to attract audiences with public racist conversations from the two bicameral racist white characters triggered by the audience. And why was it set in the 70s (not required for a 70's soundtrack) is mystery. <br /> <br /> In addition to these things, good acting may have been a dilemma. Instead, the usual "BBC Comedy" suspects were outside Hum. <br /> <br /> "Like Beckham" This is with an actual unknown cast, rather than a very good comedy (actually and intense acting, actually). <br /> <br /> In summary, a lazy clicked script, a fictional story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
