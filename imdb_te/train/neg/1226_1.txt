How did my strength fall? Kim Basinger is a great actress but she is definitely in pursuit when she gets this role. This film is especially wrong for a reason: errors in logic. It looks like one of those movies that could have been passable with all its plot holes if it came out in its 80s and 90s but in 2008 just looks real stupid. <br /> <br /> The story details della (Kim Basinger) is being harassed by buying from gifts in a mall. A gang of gangs killing policemen who came to her aid. Since then she has been pursued by the abandoned shouting streets and removes one of her tools' complete toolbox. <br /> <br /> Many things are wrong with this picture. I have overtaken logic at every turn of this film and, except Kim Basinger, made this performance bad for TV. Hell, this fake thriller is bad for TV. She is wrong with these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African Americans combine to hit the Caucasian woman, you just love America?). The way she killed the Spanish guy made me laugh. The sex scene with the main hoodlum is on the left, which shakes your head without being shy. I would recommend only to lovers of bad movies and to somebody else. Kim Basinger fans in particular do not have this picture for anyone else. Do you respect an actress in this film? Not at all. You are alerted.
