<br /> <br /> This film was initially disappointing from real life experiences. I am currently assigned to Iraq as an infantry person on my second tour. There is nothing for the real life events of this film. From the very beginning there are some name: bomb, EOD Elements from Solo without any escorts, VOD's EOD staff Sergeant sacked, sleeves round the whole time in ACU, where I am 2 dollar copy copy, sniper view. However, this list will continue, however, there are no reasons for a mistake in 2 minutes to get more things wrong; <br /> <br /> This film does not come to people and critics to see and experience discrimination or military. <br /> <br /> People with military background or knowledge are disappointed with military fault.
