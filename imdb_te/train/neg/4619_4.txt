I loved the Western and Civil War stories. I also consider John Ford an excellent director. <br /> <br /> I have the same feelings for John Wayne & William Holden's acting ability. <br /> <br /> When I first arrived in 1959, I can not remember what I saw. <br /> <br /> As per my 4 ratings, I can say that this film does not like me. <br /> I try to say some of its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM_LoMG&feature=http: They mention Andersvilleville's awful conditions, Andersonville's film did not work at that time. <br /> <br /> John Ford directed 40 films and won 4 Oscars. He should be ill during this making. His simple style is not there. It is not in the South and East and in the Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually owns a stock company with players used in almost all films, only the time these little cowboy stars are featuring hoot Gibson & Ken Kurtis & Anna Lee of course. There are no other popular faces except 3 stars. (See below) Mr. Ford's stock company made the most of his paintings in their classics; <br /> Now we come to main actors John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke also needs to be ill, where he does not appear. This type of character is typically exactly his style, he just fits here. <br /> <br /> William Holden has done the best he can do, but he always looks good. <br /> <br /> This type of film requires an actress. Her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, the most beautiful person, but not really an actress, she still has roles in television. Please be grateful and tell me that she has a long career in the way she looks than her acting expertise. Ms. She is also very happy with Tennis in Casale as Towers Servant Tennis star Altehi Gibson. <br /> <br /> Some remaining military songs made by marching cavalry are not good, except for the remaining credits remaining from the general level of John Ford films. The action sequences are good but the end of the movie. <br/> * 4/4 * (from 4) 47 points (100 in) IMDb 4 (from 10)
