What is hell about it? I was surprised at the matrix. This is the most spectacular film ever made. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to do this movie. <br /> <br /> There are no plots and can not argue with you. Basically the movie is all talking and I'm not wrong, I do not have any problem with talkie pictures, but the Matrix Reloaded is all about the nonsense of Diskwell. Then there was a fight sequence, which WAY was too long, then a more nonsense drive, then a lot of combat scenes would be too long, and everything else would be built up to the biggest anti-climax. <br /> Also, Keanu Reeves is still giving a worst performance. I know he is not a good actor but this is beyond a joke. If you look at his pictures in order, he is among them, and when they go along, he is gradually worse. God is His Performance! Keanu Reeves: The only plank of timber to become an actor. <br /> <br /> The splendor of the first image came with this huge dissapointment. If you do not see the first picture, I'll see it, but do not break this time. <br /> <br />
