My dear lord, what a movie! First talk about "special effects". Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those impacts, but I'm really really thinking about the past trends in the past 60 years. So for some time I thought they could record this film a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release. <br /> I'm looking for movies, especially good news, good story. Second of the acting, the second of the effects, I do not even mind some minor irregularities. <br /> <br /> These bad actors make a bad image in movies such as incredulity, which is worse - what happened to me with Celestine's prophecy? <br /> <br /> Whenever I'm not in those spiritual subjects, I can see that it can be brought reliably - the film has failed to do so. This one though. If you really love cheesy movies you'll be the right one for you. <br /> "(See happy comments on one). Celestial prophecy is at least somewhat entertaining.
