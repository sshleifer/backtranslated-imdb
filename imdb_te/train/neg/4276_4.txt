This overrated, short-live series (just a couple of seasons) is experimental and unique when traveling to a trip driver strip bar. They are not sure what they mean by "lining" and "real" lynch and his silly little TV opus. What are their original values? Certainly, this is actually the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues". Sure. "Law and Order" puts TP realism on the left and right of the TP. <br /> <br /> TP fans are often said to cancel the show because many viewers are not smart enough, the imagination of the show's "intolerance", its alleged jungle ingenuity, or whatever. As a fan of the instrument, I must correct that misconception. Nothing rarely about TP; It's just crazy whodunit that goes around circularly, every corner wheels are spinning or (or just because) is not going anywhere. The peculiar expectation is always forced; The characters do not behave in a strange way, they behave in half the time of the iDOO OT. <br /> <br /> "I'm disappointed" -in a dream-scene clich, I think lynch. Do you want to be weird? "Eraserhead" weird - in fact, it goes beyond weird, which is basically abstract. Do you want a special TV show? See "The Prisoner". Do you want a fantastic cast? Felini and Leone movies offer that offer. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime play that looks like all young people are fashionable. The cast gives the TP a plastic look. <br /> In fact, one of the producers of TP said he was looking for "unique faces" for the Lynch series. Special faces? Like Laura Flynn Bails? Share Fell's? Like the "hanxx" of those empty-faced direct from men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong; There's nothing wrong with an attractive cast, especially the beauties like Fen (she's looking at her 1000 times attractive), but with a weird look with people you're lucky. And I did not always understand Lynch's misguided appeal to Kyle McLachlan (I should get a medal to correct his name). He is not objectionable, but looks very attractive and polished. His character's ridiculous "extravagance" is not of interest, one of the many attempts to force Lynch's instrument to try hard to keep his reputation - even though he has lost his edge entirely. Every Lynch Post - "Elephant Man" is very subtly compared to its first two films. The next attempts often have no reliance on Lynch's relatively small but affectionate fans in the eyes of the public, and any of the water's delicate consideration should not be considered by the explanations of the most difficult stories. In other words, linch is the intellectual-wannabe's darling. <br /> <br /> Lara Palmer was killed by his father ...? He was supposed to be devious or some unhappy. It's best to come with this "great mind" ... you've got B-movie horror films unfolding more realistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out my "TV & Movie: 150 Worst Cases of Napotism" list.
