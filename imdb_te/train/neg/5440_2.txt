I'm a huge Lin Petersen fan from her progressive role in the 1988 blockbuster film "Far North", and she loves each other in her "Francis" drama "Slow" (2004), Lynn, Or should be), plays a key role of "driver". <br /> <br /> Oh wait - another thing - amazing creativity of editing to remove obscenity for TV audiences - than Linn's spectacular performance. <br /> "You're a gun off son!", "You're a witch off son!", "shoot!", and "Well, you forget!" Unforgettable lines like <br /> <br /> O.K. <br /> <br /> PS: Do you know where I can get another Lin Peterson poster?
