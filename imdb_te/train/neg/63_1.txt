Ory Naano. It's the worst picture I've seen in a long time. All shows are fine, but there are no plots. Really! No Plots! Clowns talk about this quite a bit and it's your picture. Uga ... Robert Duvall's role is in old age and keeps the same individuals and more of the same prisoners. It earns him and the same responses. I feel that the film is a six and they all like it. Good performances with well-known and well-respected actors, but a realistic full work is a steamy tread. Well, maybe it's a bit fraudulent because the steam rising from the latest pile is something like that and it's not a movie. Sack
