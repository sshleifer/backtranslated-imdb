I saw this first 30 minutes and the whole worst strap I saw. The scenes I've seen are bad for Ed Wood. No, it's a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has always been a reputation as the worst director but it is not true; <br /> There is a German tone for the American police. "Police Station" has a desk in a warehouse "police station" hanging on the wall. <br /> <br /> This police pulls women up and uses them and leads them to the warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. He then takes a canned bag and comes out of the warehouse. Cop partner thinks his wife might be a bad cop who kills these women, but he is not sure what will happen - he is a moron! The dialogue is absolutely stupid, acting is awful, and I always act as roles in the stupidest manner seen on the screen. He is totally illegally kidnapped by the police and he takes them in a warehouse and reaches the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and the partner there, along with all that is not known! <br /> This movie is the whole hack of director. I stopped the film for 30 minutes because I can not take it anymore. It should be one of the WORST movies I started to watch and I will not waste time writing this review anymore. <br /> Completely valuable.
