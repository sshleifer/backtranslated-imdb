<br /> When I went to the theater I saw I did not know what the movie was about. I was pretty interested in the trailers in the last film. Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? Some good implications and honesty are not my idea, and every few minutes will slowly fulfill some chicks. I'm trying to keep myself away from spoilers (but) an atheist who has received a string of prayer beads from the priest who died, suddenly found it too odd to end up with the wounds of Christ (stigmata not supposed to be deeply religious ??) I mean, hang out with her losers, Defeat stuff makes, behaves like a typical rebellion and here, the mill Displaying the wounds of Jesus Christ is she ?? <br /> She is crucified, head thrown, screaming, blood everywhere, it has become rather tedious after seeing a dozen times. It's not just repulsive, scary or horrifying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> End: If you do not, it has not yet seen.
