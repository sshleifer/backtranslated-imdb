I am reading Modesty Blaze on both the comics and the books, and she is really a heroine. Although Quentin Tarantino is not a great fan of, he is thinking of making her a film a few years ago: Is not Modesty right to treat her good sound? Just a few months ago I heard about 'My Name Modesty' and checked the stars given here and the loved ones are often too difficult to dissolve the fans, if the heart does not succeed. So I decided to read any reviews and decided not to watch the movie, and I ended up watching it, and I was amazed, and sad and yes, I was pretty angry. I'm so excited by the time and frustration that I have spent my time since Maddie's Blaze-role has become a film that is neither audiences nor a fan. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is sub-par and informal about this film, although I have seen other actors in other movies beforehand. But screenplay and direction ... My God, why is this kind of garbage with a little more productive value than your average TV-film? I do not know the background of this film and actually I really want to know, but how does he name his name on a tough face on earth? He missed me a huge amount of money. <br /> <br /> I give the film 3 stars and the quality of the actors and technology is worse. The other seven stars missing are not good. Oh well, having some other goals than stealing money from hopefully modest fans at some point is that the modesty Blaise movie is a serious product. Although people like Tarantino are taking decisions about my breathing.
