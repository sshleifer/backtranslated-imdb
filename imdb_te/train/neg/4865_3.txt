I did not enjoy this movie. But I loved Babe, a pig in the city and spoiled by talking animal images in every other way. The animals did not like it. They all are irritating, especially Chris Rock's Guinea Pig, but then I dreamed what it was, Chris Rock. I believe a couple smiles once or twice at beautiful lines, but it is.
