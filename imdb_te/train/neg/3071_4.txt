I found the letters seemingly uninteresting and uninteresting. I do not need to read this book (fortunately), or it was a painful experience. I got tickets to the free preview but still not worth my time, or my friend. I think it's not worth telling this story. It is like saying that older people before the age of old (not old) were older. The lives of the main characters are painful to see, the stupid mistakes are no better than the next one. Nevertheless, I think actors are the best they can do with a slum story. I'm always a big fan of Ellen Berstein. Unfortunately I thought I would try this movie.
