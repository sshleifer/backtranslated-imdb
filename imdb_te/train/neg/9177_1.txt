The worst movie I've ever seen is the House of the Dead, I was sleeping between curiosity 'matrix' 360 camera angle attempts and cheesy acting. I do not think the director and the set manager have decided that it's raining, because one side of the boat is raining and the other is not. I would rate this movie from 10 to 1, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). As well as playing jumping into the game from the game is really annoying, it makes you wonder if they just make for the time to lose. I read and read it, it should not be seen. It's not worth the time.
