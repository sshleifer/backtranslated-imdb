I thought about it, I'd like that title. Checkout is not fully functional. I had the chance to see it twice, and for the second time I got a great laugh at the cost of the film. So I guess it's worth something for it. And it's worth the excruciating pain that brought me to my first view. Another critic has stated that the film will be hacked at every angle. An original idea did not go to the film (which gave me the following about the reality of the barrier campus). This film does not have anything, it is a combination of long lines. It's not exactly the next Clerks, it's definitely not original, and it's not exactly "good, clean fun." At the peculiarity of the film (which is very funny, in the second time an insulting way, after seeing the first time) is full of agony. I looked around the theater, with the exception of almost everyone, perhaps the elderly, that the film is completely bored or harassed. Especially during some emotional scenes, where Nick laughs at his mother, because the audience really kills. I heard anyone in the theater * the groan * I had never seen before. I do not care where you are going to watch this movie, either at a movie festival or an indie theater or somewhere. Make yourself a favor, skip this image with a vengeance. You're like me and can not prevent the opportunity to see what's really the worst movie ever made.
