<br /> I'm really really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline did not grow well, for example, morality was not clear. I thought Brenda Song worked well, but I thought Shin Koyamada had a difficult time in maintaining his role. I can see the necessity to keep in the Western aspects of the show, however, there are some parts where Chinese elements are also needed! For example the villain. His physical form is more like a robot in one of the Chinese culture. <br /> <br /> Others refer to it as 'Kid's Performance', so there is no need for such a high level. Standards. However, there are other Disney performances, such as the Munl Lawn, in terms of story development and performances. <br /> <br /> At the end, I think I would like to have a good research and a better plan on Disney movies. Good performance is not enough as it relies on a series of martial arts sequences.
