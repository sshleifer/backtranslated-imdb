A big big problem is Turkey, anti-Nazi music composition (!!), anti-sprint anti-sponge, pre-war Americans and Agatha Christie Hududinite: this is a horrible injustice. Burser Casting is the most exciting element of plot and dialogue, "Lady ..." along with a single digit I.Q. He tries to stuck to everything: he plays a romantic lead (his form and his age! He and Woody Allen Clues, a club for mirrorless aging comedy) and he is moving and funny and sharp and smart, and tries to dance and dance, and NONE Succeed in A lupo shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> Everybody in this movie says that Cherry Jones is pretty hot chick, Cumpsty is this imposing beautiful stallion !! Claire Bloom's male secretarial role is a sexy fine actress who is a chair and has two very popular women's hobbies! Mike Star's over-the-top acting is very ineffective, the sound cap deserves to rank among the 10 most unpleasant presentations ever in recent film history. The saddest note is to see Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa wasting completely miscast and messy. At least I hope two stars will pay bills back home (and then their agents are removed) with this flap. <br /> <br /> Does Sukua return to Germany after seeing what she does in Hollywood? <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make a bad movie a really bad movie, the director, this one study - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
