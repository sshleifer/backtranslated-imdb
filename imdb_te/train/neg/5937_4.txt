Sure, if you ask any mom who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she'd tell you that her son is the most wonderful kid in the whole world. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film are Biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, should I say more? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is not fake. <br /> <br /> If you do, put a movie on MTV video of some Biggies and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> Cute Angela Bassett played the role of Biggie's mother. <br /> <br /> The real person in life is like a dog. Big body small dick? Big mouth small sound? Big fat little eyes? Disclaimer: I am a colorful person. So keep your racist comment yourself.
