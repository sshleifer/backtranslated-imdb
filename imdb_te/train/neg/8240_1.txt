Do not waste your time watching this! If you do not read it for all the bad things you should not do a good movie. I can not normally review the movie, but it's a guy. I've wasted the precious time they can not afford. I'm compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this dirt. If it's a student project, I have to say it's not bad, but the first 15 minutes ... then it's annoying. Shouting, bad audio, bad video (a good camera man made it better). And yes, what is the effect of Blair-Witch? What budget? I was hoping I was going to get better, but it was not. Now how hell it deserves a 4? 2 Wasting my time is more affordable but 1! I said my peace.
