I saw "Paris GTAM" because I had gone with him because a friend really wanted to see it. I'm going, I'm different about the movie, but this is going to be through the production of production and wasting 2 hours in my life. The "stories" are almost completely unforgettable, most of them are awful. What does Jena Rowlands and Ben Gazzar do with Paris? The endless procession of American actors The French film has given a lot of French not-for-nothing concept. Clothes about Paris are endless. Yes, many of them played with Clives about Paris, but spending time with ridiculing French clichés, they promoted them directly and unfortunately. Yes, Paris is the city of love. <br /> <br /> The worst sections are: Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); One with Nick Nolt; mime one (worst?); One of the hair products; With Juliet Binoch (Willem Duffy as a cowboy in the center of Paris); Vampire one (when I think of Eliza Wood about Paris). Natalie Portman really looked like a Mentos commercial, and Stupid (the blind teenager should know that Portman was just playing a part when she was called to him). Turn it on and on. It is just too small. <br /> <br /> I do not like Coen Bros. It really plays with Parisien clichés but I did not find it funny. Just annoying. Although Gus Van Sant is an interesting one, it is very small (and is visually exhausted) it's just registered. <br /> <br /> There are only two "successful" divisions, and they leave the baby as a baby for a great woman at a kindergarten about a migrant nanny. There was nice sarcasm. And this section about the embodied African. It is the best episode in the whole movie, but there is nothing in Paris in this section. This story may have happened in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> In the last segment, Chubby is very interesting along with a middle-aged woman, but the underlying voice is bad. They wanted the French to celebrate its limited understanding, but this section was discouraging. <br /> <br /> The entire project is intentional and uninteresting. The French government encouraged almost everything to encourage tourism flow. Overall, only 10 to 15 minutes have interesting stuff, "Paris GTMM" is a wonderful movie experience.
