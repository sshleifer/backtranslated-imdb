When I was making a cartoon back in college, I was very impressed. It has the charm of "Get Smart". <br /> Obviously, when I saw this version, I showed a lot of interest. It was before I saw it. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The effects are reasonable and maybe I am concerned about the movie. When looking at a live-action version of gadgets in action! <br /> <br /> The original funny or fascinating or interesting story and treatment has been lost. <br /> <br /> The original is actually a rare cartoon with a very unpleasant attitude. Fun. The film became dark and it was very intense. If it's a great story, or if it went crazy to make it look like a "cartoon in the picture" it might be fun. <br /> This can not be considered as part of a "gadget legacy".
