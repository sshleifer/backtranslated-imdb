I have been subject to this film in class as a school in my school. It is nothing attractive and nothing new. The father actually tries to focus on the teen's father instead of showing him the problems she's going through. It is an interesting side but does not actually live up to its originality due to the fact that nothing in the film is original. We have the main sister who has a big sister who loves each other and has something in the house, at the mother of the most we expect and she is more troublesome and she leaves him in the dirt, then we have a dying father. Then on the side of the girls we have parents who want everything and she expect her to be perfect at all. It's interesting as I have said, but the good acting or the good work or the heroine from the whole cast. These things start with a little kid in school and study with a child, and they have to spend together, have sex relations, and we grow a little kid. Perhaps it's in the writing and acting has improved and I've gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chains than I did any actor in this film seriously and that was pretty bad looking movies as Leatherface has been the worst and fierce. The only teen pregnancy movie I have ever seen is Juno. To date, the humorous side of this extreme situation has proved to be more entertaining. As I mentioned, most of these paintings have focused on teen mother but in this regard the drama is not in the eyes of the play and the reality is that the film is not protected from mediocrity. I would like to make a film like this one with a good cast and a good writer, and another one.
