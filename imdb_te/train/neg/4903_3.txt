I am not a big fan of Taiwan film production against Korean, Hong Kong or China. The strong acting quality as shown in the film is not very difficult. I do not think I am grateful to the audience, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However, the film shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I'm lost in the middle of the plot where the plot goes. Acting did not make sure. The runner's performance tries to be her 'over-act', narrow and beautiful. Even though I have to agree, she has a pleasure. On the other hand, Isabella Leung plays a more positive role in a confused, sad, sad, and remarkable role. Overall, the film is disappointing.
