The film was much better with script retreat. I would like to be sympathetic in movies, but you think the house and city resident Jack Mason would question why a hunting pioneer would like to be a hunting guide. <br /> <br /> After arriving at the grounds, poor ice-t plays his role as the leads he's going to drive through the woods he has never seen before. <br /> <br /> Jack Mason's Thomas Burns Seattle <br /> <br /> I assume this film based on Richard Connay's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago, I showed this film to the 9th grade student class. I returned to the film, eliminating all the nonsense scenes and obscenity. This lasted for 43 minutes.
