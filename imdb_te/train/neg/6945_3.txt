Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) was killed by the child and was severely attacked by his wife's home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through post traumatic stress. Then Archer joins a man (Til Schweiger) and tie a chair. He said he was the man who killed his baby and attacked his wife and he could do what he liked. <br /> <br /> Film is interesting (and demonstrates true temperance towards blood and gore), but by the minute he gets stupid and is less likely to have the plot twists and turns. It's all too old and stupid one ends in a last twist and I'm shocked that someone will no longer think of using it. The talented actors like Eldard, Schwierger and Plummer have been involved in such trash. It earns three stars for acting but the stupid plot and really unbelievable turns can do this task.
