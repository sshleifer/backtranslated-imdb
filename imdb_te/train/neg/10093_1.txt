I believe this film is a blockbuster. It's too bad. I was totally deceived by box art. NOT FOOLED !! I guarantee you it is not worth your time. I do not know if the positive reviews for this film are joke or whatever. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The description outside of the box does not even match! Wudu is a girl stripper on her. People also suffer from writing a description for the film. Those positive reviews should be a joke, if anyone likes this picture, I will lose all faith in humanity. And I can not say that I do not start the story in comparison with the title or that the whole movie is in 2 positions or that the cops are not very close to real uniform. Who asked about the cops uniform? Uniforms have been spotted compared to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is a disgrace to the zombie genre and fans.
