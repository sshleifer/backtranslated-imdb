This is a badly remade remake of the good version of the so-called prequel Dangerous leagues. Most of the platform's plot is identical. I have made that book based on it, I love the first film, but I'm also embarrassed with the 3rd film. In the prequel, the two nicely ridiculous jokes between the two main characters are completely predictable and unrealistic, and ... I can not stress how bad the movie is. If you want to take my word for it, look at it, and you'll see my point. If you like the first one, I have read a review that you like the second one because it's just the same because it's the same movie! The plot is not good. They have taken many songs from the first film, which is hard to tell the movie you're looking for.
