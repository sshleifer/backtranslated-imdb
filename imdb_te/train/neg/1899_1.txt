I think the car is very good and I think it's going to be cool cars for the gas because I saw this. I am lied. This film is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to see KipRaren (Giovanni RBC) sitting outside Porsche dealer and looking for a right car. When it is confirmed that it is correct, the kip receives a brick from the trunk and shakes it in the window and breaks it up. When his friend comes to the keys he gets Porsche. They start the car and go to the night. They only send it to the warehouse following the police. So, all staff have dug up all the cars and their special ways. Then, we get a glimpse of Memphis Raons. He makes a little speech on the children's group on the go-kart track. He then faced by Atley Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells his metropolis that his brother Kip was sleeping deep. Memphis is one of the most brutal car hackers in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calletti (Christopher Eccleston). <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this image: <br /> <br /> 1.Store: In the first 48 Cage and Duval are watching for everything in a crew and plan. Hours of waste in past 12 films! <br /> <br /> The Cars: You can see 10 cars for 50 people in the film. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why not see them? <br /> Chase: Chase at the end of this movie is a joke. <br /> It's not the evening. The Dog: somewhere in the movie, dog burgers and three keys as well as swallows. It's impossible. The keys are opened. The keys were severely damaged by the dog's esophagus, stomach and big intestines. The guys suggest giving it dog laxatives to help him poop him. It does not work. The dog has many dysfunctional and hinge. It is mentioned in Jacques after Ryan Dunne has raised his rectangle in the toy car. Take lactiotis, a lot of dysentery, but no car. <br /> <br /> When chase: When Eleanore breaks down a few minutes, Nicholas Cage is desperately trying to launch the car. You see a police cruiser behind him looking to see his car. But when Nicholas Cage again launches the engine, the police officer stands on his head to the right, sees the car and immediately chases him. It's stupid. So, when he saw the engine start right, and saw the car, he knew that he was the car he was looking for. How does it know the right car? <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is boring. No action. There are very few cars. The film is stupid. I have never seen it but I plan. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 1 star from 1 star. Get fast and furious instead.
