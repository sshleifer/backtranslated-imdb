I'm a fan of Tony Scott films. I have a lot of hopes to be like 'Man on Fire' when the film arrives. To find out that this film is something else! Driving water from the story gap, and the choice of Mickey Rourke is not such a good idea. And the whole 'weapon is very grateful! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Keira Rajahatti, which tells that she never became a film star! <br /> <br /> I have directed Tony Scott but it takes the whole Friggin cake! Sorry, 10 out of 1!
