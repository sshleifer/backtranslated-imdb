Maiden Voyage it. I want to say straight away that I've seen these 5mins before I can no longer stand. As already mentioned in another comment, this film is not about the bad thing, it's just bad. The acting is awful, the SFX is poor, and the story is tough and stupid. <br /> <br /> "Bag guy guards" will also succeed and capture their weapons like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered by watching this film, you will still be disappointed as to what little your expectation is.
