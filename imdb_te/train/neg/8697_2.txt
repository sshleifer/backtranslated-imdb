Cornosaur 3: Primal species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halsten, Terry J. Vaughn, Billy Barrone. Why did you review this movie? The top secret military boys are another stupid dinosaur picture finding the deadly (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters that are running around killing people in paths. The original is adequate, the sequel is even worse. It comes in the middle somewhere, regardless of the previous CornosRair movies. Rating: 2 in 10. R rated for graphic violence and gore, grisly pictures, and obscenity.
