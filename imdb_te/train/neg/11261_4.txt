To begin with, I think you are losing more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but why or why not. Finally, when you find things out, it's a twisted SOO opera dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, unlawful sons ... the characters are very low and the actors (especially the young people) can not help that much confidence. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about "Frail Soul de Invento" is that the Debutant Pablo has good intentions in us, and he's portrayed a couple of scenes that are very intense ... okay, maybe next time ... <br /> * My rate: 4/10
