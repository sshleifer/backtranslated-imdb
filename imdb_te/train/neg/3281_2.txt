I suspected this film was bad. I'm a fan of Duke from the way. The DVD in the DVD consists of three years. I'm fine. Take the family to see it. I want to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes are good. But overall, the film has reduced the closed version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson is curious. I honestly say honestly that Daisy's outfits are revealing, Daisy's Jessica Simpson explanation is just awful. Sorelie Bucky and Denver pile are also rolling in their tombs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you have tried an older and real Dukes fan like me and my three kids you will be very disappointed.
