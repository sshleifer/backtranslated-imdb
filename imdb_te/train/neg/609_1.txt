It's a terrible picture. Do not be attracted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Two great actors, but it's just their worst character in history. Their great performance did not release the film's funniest storyline. The film is a nineties of US propaganda. There are very tragic scenes when the Colombian rebels are doing their cases for revolutions. Maria was very cheerful of Alonso, and her fake-love affair was no real nonsense with Woolen, but it was not just a curiosity emotional plug in a movie. I was disappointed by such images by destroying an actor like Christopher Walken's good name. I sit by it.
