You can say that I have no evidence of what this has painted but they have no budget. Bad acting, terrible cinematography, and lame story and some good special effects will do a good movie. WWF style cinemtography makes you cry ... Where's the tripod? Motion picture producers targeted most people, but their mark was severely lost.
