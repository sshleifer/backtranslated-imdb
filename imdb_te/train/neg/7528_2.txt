It is even worse than the original game of Death. A combination, under the involuntary storyline, leads to the bottom of a helicopter below him "Billy", killing him and leaving his younger brother Bobby Loew. So we're starting with some Bruce Lee clones, the movie kills one and follow us another thirty minutes in the story. The main reason to watch this Bobby fights with a lion less, which is very clearly a man with a lion dress. Zhang Lee Hwang is also a villain, usually pretty awesome, but his screen time is very low. They saw the original game of Death and Death as part of the Bruce Lee box set. No wonder they have joined Lee's full work. No one else will buy them.
