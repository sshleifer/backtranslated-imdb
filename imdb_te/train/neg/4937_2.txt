It's a joke about 30 minutes performance. Joke and cavemen are not well treated. HaHaHa !!! He can not dial the phone because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as humans. Oh Geez, those cavens are incomplete. There is no joke in this show. They can only run this joke for a long time and they already have GeoCo commercials. This program is a national T.V. <br /> <br /> This performance is trying to be funny, but it is not. Looking at this show, I'm thinking of trying to be like "Bachelor Gone Wild Show". That means they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. Crying Caveman is annoying. The caveman with glasses is very smart as a cave man (hahamma !!!). Three of them have personalities, but I can not understand why I care about them.
