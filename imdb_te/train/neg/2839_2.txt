This film is one of my favorites. It's not good at all, but laughter is very good. The conversation is very ridiculous and less (e.g., "magic, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We hope you help us with answers"). Any fight is more or less surreal. Make sure to look for Oakley White Guy and Brock who hide the main characters. He has only two lines, but the best in the film!
