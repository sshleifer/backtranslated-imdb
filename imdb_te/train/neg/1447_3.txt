Shirley Temple was named in three major films, and was named after her in 1934. Unfortunately, Studios had to experiment to see what people liked most about here. Those two things were singing and dancing. Another gained their minds from the small, interesting picture and depression that attracts people's attention. You will find other keys related to Shirley's hit films. <br /> <br /> Despite the star projections of Gary Cooper and Carroll Lombard, the film did not achieve any of the above, although Henry Hathaway was a good director. In addition, there are a lot of tachi parts here, which are just bored, and there are many arguments between a sad lambard and Cooper. To be the top of it, you feel normal-not too good, which the public wants. I learned after this film.
