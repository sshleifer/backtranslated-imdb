This is a case of some people thinking they are so clever that they have a story that fits time. Recognize the whole political conspiracy in the camera in a few years that led to Watergate and after a while? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have done many movies, the TV is 'very powerful', so the conspiracies that are touching the mind have been caught in the eyes of their own navel grapes. Conversation I found most by conspiracy of the others but Coppola is a true fascinating actor to watch Truth and Hackman for his main role. The conspiracy films are largely drowning in the pool of Nair Heroes. Many unanswered questions, many of the discomiums ... Bergman takes a while to build a film about such visual locations. <br /> <br /> The next man is a good example of its time: one political soup is an ideal role and a horrendous conspiracy to tighten his web around him. What part is also interesting and does not get any good overall. Of course, you can say that it is bad from the first sequences that jumped up against the 'Wacha' killings without any heroism. Many pictured in the movie are pictured by the viewer in the eyes of the viewers and portraying the perspectives of violence that surrounds violence.
