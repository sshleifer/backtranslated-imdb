Werewels of the Werewolf (1999) is a bad movie. The campus is real but the total implementation is just terrible. Instead of running in the production of filmmakers, I would like to take their time with this project. Some Blind Dude gets some new eyes, the bad thing is that they are the average old wolf. The evil things begin to happen as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. Can he find cure before getting to know his girlfriend? That weird little demon helps him and what is that lady with police? <br /> If you really want to know, see the Werewolf of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> The movie is not a bad idea. Before the film was filmed, filmmakers had spent much time in production.
