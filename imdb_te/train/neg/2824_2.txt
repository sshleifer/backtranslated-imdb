I'm a big Porsche fan, and the best actor in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, 80 years of drug abuse, is not understood from small letters / actors; It is not necessary to say that they are all very average. <br /> <br /> It's a cool picture of some of the weirdest clothes, Colorado backdrop, some good shots and fickle-minded plots - it's a downhill trip in the 80s. <br /> Everything is very short to watch life crappy movies because everything you love 80s, wasting your time watching, Corey Hymn, or like, old-life Porsche love (especially this looks great).
