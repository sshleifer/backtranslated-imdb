The film has good intentions and good stories. <br /> <br /> The director and hero of the film have failed miserably and feel like returning to Mr. Hartford's 8th grade Social Studies Class - Form in 67 years. Wicked, someone takes this story and takes a real cine from it - it's worth the story. <br /> <br /> Every time we have a scene, we have taken white footage to take action from black and history channel all of what we have left. <br /> <br /> Ozzy Davis is the brightest light in this dull festival. The other acting is pretty dull - it is well suited for the film and the captain has shown a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, many of these unfinished errors are associated with the film and the surprise or entertainment, but want to learn about the USS Mason, which is a watch value.
