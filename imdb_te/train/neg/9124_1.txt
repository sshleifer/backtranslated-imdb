This very worst picture is Peter Sellers (I think that larl goes "The Prisoner of the Flag") but it's certainly not too discouraged. Seyjars, especially Sons Makeup, Noyland Smith, looks like he is in chemotherapy. Fu Manchu, he rarely looks and spends most of the film (excluding those strangely embarrassing scenes that he shakes with currents) on the edging edge with the weight of all that makeup. Assisted players also get tired and run away, and the presence of Sid Caesar "chinks!" It is also dangerous without his constant references. (A bright spot: it's a big motion picture ascens to be one of the last to play a humiliating role ... or, for that matter, act as non-Asian star). The film is surprisingly cheap, with a blend of photography and dumb sets - at the end also the whiz-bang Elvis will find a cut rate. The only tall, thin, nervous person to get wet with only the wonderful Helen Mirren and his pants add any sparks of life to this sad affair. In all, this film is a strange reference to the death of a great joke, and his dying one also offers a very different documentation.
