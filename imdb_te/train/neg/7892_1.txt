It started with an interesting premise. I always like civil war elements and ancient mysteries. The more the film grew, and I realized that I was a B film better. In the latter part, it quickly became a C film, then D and then F, then "I wish this was not a rental that I could put in the microwave!" I can not say that acting on all occasions is awful, terrible. But writing, I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. Screenplay is written by a 10 year old. It's ironically desirable, dialogue is brown and easy to describe the 5-pound bag of rats interesting. I hate this movie and made it like my wife. I'm a Christian and I do not have a problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. The film made a great deal of disadvantage. Horror, horrible, worthless. If you like it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
