This 1970 hit movie is not very old, but apparently, it's not good when it's released. Nevertheless, it is probably very popular that a feralistic young love idea for audiences satisfied by the steady TV coverage of the Vietnam War. Oliver Barrett IV is a special Harvard hockey player, Oliver Barrett IV, who is proud of the controversial Vasser music student with Jenny Cavallier about her work background. His older school father naturally denies Jenny, and in a typical rebellious act, the young couple marry at celebrations in the hippie era. He has his dream job in New York, but she is unexpectedly ill and her terminal disease dies. The director has a layer of contemporary film-making techniques performed by Arthur Hiller, but none of them can hide the old-style, cliché-ridden story in its main theme. <br /> <br /> Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw have both played Oliver and Jenny with the film, but they are unexpected, compelling characters. O'Neill is at least as weak as his weakest objectionable approach, but in McGraw's behavior is wood and scratchy, it is hard for Oliver to see what she sees in Jenny beyond her satirical façade. Jenny's plainspoken baker's father makes Phil as good as Phil, two years before he finds John Mills ("The Godfather" beheaded horses in his bed), Ray Milland does seem like barrett paterfamilias like. The overly familiar Francis La Music has almost been ridiculous over the years. The quality of the print quality is good on the DVD, but not only by the extra commentator track than by Hilar. The most interesting bit of trivia is that writer Eric Segal (whose book is based on the film) seems to have been thought of as a mix between Oliver's two Harvard Roommates? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones have some part of the film, one of Oliver's roommates.
