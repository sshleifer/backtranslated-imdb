This is not done in Westerns. You knocked this nut in a buggy around the sun, with a chain on it and killing people for his own reasons. You've got a blizzard in a snowstorm and a man who kills his body parts. Then you got some woman in a home between wolves and wolves where you are not. What is the point of this film? Is not Bruce Dern good? It's the waste of the film.
