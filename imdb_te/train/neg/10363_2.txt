I grew up pouring over the horned stories of wrinkles in time chronicles. One day my dream is to sit in a title when a protagonist reads a big sofa in a child and thinks what a wonderful movie to do in this film. Sad enough that the screenwriter failed, changing letters, throwing in lame comedy, and destroying all the plots. I know this is a very difficult task to change the novel of a movie in a movie. But why are not you in the book? Why do you want to change what the characters think and take action? For those in you who do not read the book, pick it up, find the soft bed and your imagination in the forest.
