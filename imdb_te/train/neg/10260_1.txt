This movie is terrible! I rented it without knowing what I expected. I saw the first 5 minutes and saw the movie and knew it was a bomb. Acting is very bad and there are no plot. The monster is very fake. The mouth will not be moved.Also they have a zipper-playing physician to kill the monster. The usual evil does not waste your time. (10 to 1)
