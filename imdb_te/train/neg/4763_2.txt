The main reason to write this review is that I am a great "play" and a 1972 valuable movie, a terrific film experience. <br /> <br /> This new "version" is loaded with talent, and it can be done incorrectly. Kenneth Branagh correctes an ugly, clean, and a note set. He goes to continue film film from each ard, distracting, self-centered perspective. We see reflections of stainless steel actors, security monitors, their heads shots from 200 feet, eyes, chins, and top and close. The screenplay by Nobel laureate introduces the bizarre homosexual laughing by two parties .... I feel like how do I know when the character "turns"? The characters themselves are drawn, cross and foolish. The running time was cut by an hour, the real issue or the director was the best thing that made us. Actors effectively make their lines, but they say or reliably reliable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> . Why is it also made ??? The paid public has spent over $ 4 million worldwide! The proud piece of work that fails at every turn.
