If you ever read the movie when you have 20 or 30 minutes anytime, you suddenly learned the movie as you saw it before? It happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The cover of the video box, if you find the video, is a lot cheating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've been late for a decade to congratulate the good stuff of this decade or ... just nonsense is worthless. <br /> <br /> I have developed a connection to this film. <br /> Humm ... Plots. A place. Let's have a plot here somewhere. No, I can not find it. It's great about some high school seniors about how to do dopey acting and medication and speak decades earlier in the old language. One of the female students has a love for her teacher. The teacher is a caterpillar wolf (he is actually a snowstorm) so he can take the girl's progress. <br /> There is a rebellion around and a lot of strange dialogues and extensive dances. Our cat was booed by BooBoo, dancing high school kids. Her dazzling scenes with dancers gearered and moved on to her dance floor. It's nice that at least one species has found something interesting in this residual. 1/10
