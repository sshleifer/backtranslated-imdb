* Spoilers * Some people criticized the Bourgeois Killers' media outcry with violence. But the controversy ignores the real things in the film. Oliver Stone contradicted his serial killers as innocent and unholy killers of innocent people, which contradicted a morbid media fascination. Instead, he defends them. The film portrays every victim as the person who deserves the hurt. To get involved in stealthy stereotypes, Stone victims call bad cartoons - mute rednexes, broken-speaking English migrants, and lazy fat people. Homicide is a man who is also a man. They are friends with American-Indian using an old, hallucinjan - they are sophisticated, have they? Let's make him a wonderful character. Fat, Chinese clerk and "pits" uncool, so let's feel like it deserves to die. Instead of their false repentance, their devastation makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and surreal scenes are bound to appeal to more attractive people. Ridicule justice. Police and jail officials were portrayed as cruel, ugly and vocal compared to GQ killers. Again, it is not in the media reports in the movie but in "reality" in the movie. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just blossoming shows and visuals. The film does not say anything new or specific about violence violence. The proof that the film fails in its message is actually in real world reaction. Some of the youngsters who saw this film were inspired by their killings. The film's "message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with real life outcomes of horror. The intelligent message is no longer visible.
