Though it's not too bad (I'm very bad), it's still a very thick film. <br /> <br /> However, the main character of Seagel's "Coogan's Bluff", Clint Eastwood's hat is more than just a joke than Don Baker, a rare actor. <br /> <br /> However, Vendontino is a bad guy (great fun), Budget Vittorio Gasman. The rest of the cast is mostly a terrible act, especially by distributing the girl, and this is the main reason he sits through this steampail. Poor old Rosano Brajze, he's hard to believe as a sexiest leader (see "Mondo Kane" to see him run away from women). Here is the second level Ben Gazzarra, which he did not put aside. This is unfortunately all Joe Dan program. <br /> <br /> Gridon Clark can do good films ("without warning"), but here he falls on trips, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least Malta positions are nice, and Venantini is to try to save the day. 3/10.
