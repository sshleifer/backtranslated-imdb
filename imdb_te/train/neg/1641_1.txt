This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It may not be one of the realistic or spurious, or leads to the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Any recent memoir is portrayed as juvenile as a film. If a group of 14 or 15 year old high school students who have actually met or interacted with the original girl had written a film based on their false fantasies about being a big man. This film is boring, disturbingly mind-numbing, and sometimes dangerous and disgusting. For the most part, you have one or two moments laughing. In addition, it takes twice as long as its 85-minute interval.
