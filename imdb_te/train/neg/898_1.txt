Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and utterly rude, crude, cross and lyde. This is the only way to explain this terrible, trashy piece of really terrible. Eddie Murphy goes for the shock value, laughing at him and laughing to win. He is always fun, but loses much of the plot with pornographic language and obscene romantic jokes. <br /> Forget it! Except you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style. I do not think I would suffer with "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
