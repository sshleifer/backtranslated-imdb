It's at 1 in the morning and I have nothing else. <br /> <br /> We are back in time to Spanish settlements. A group made their way to an island. It will not take long for them to encounter a big horse, which will tie their horse. They will soon kill "the gods of the reptiles" so that they can be captured and captured by the locals. CG sux; It reminds me of the CG of the early console video games. Those who met were lame. The only positive thing I can say about this is hottie local running around a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it's just hard work.
