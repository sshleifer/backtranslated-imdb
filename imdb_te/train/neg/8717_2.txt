<br /> <br /> I saw this video on DVD with a group of friends on Friday night. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: terrorists are hijacking a convoy they think weapons are carrying weapons grade, but actually carrying a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy to make mistakes. A team of uncomfortable team of Army Special Forces to overcome prehistoric beasts. They are run by Colonel Rons, played by Scott Valentine; <br /> <br /> There are a lot of gore and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem with the target 'Fort smell' that seems to have been done. Their weapons in the general direction of the giant, garbage basket. <br /> <br /> <br /> The lights always look like luminous and when the velocipateral attacks (outside can be seen how bad the effects of the organism are). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie, like a Jussiac Park / Aliens Style Action Adventure, is worse than a dinosaur's stench, but ridiculous, tongue-cheek entertainment is a roaring success .
