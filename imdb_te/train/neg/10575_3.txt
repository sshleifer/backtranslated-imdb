Honestly, the feeling behind "Masters of Horror" is what happened to this. The big-time horror directors are now starting, and the industry is likely to have a horror film again. That is, as long as I see some episodes ... Oh boy, this is really bad TV. The directors seem to be paying very little budgets to direct their skits, but there are also guidelines for example in HD. It is bad for artistic reasons and for economic reasons to create a short story for a long time. I can not help but "Tales from Crypt" and M.o.H. Components do not really stand comparison. TFTC is good, MOH is bad; There are a few keys to explain to me: TFTC is less than 50 minutes of MOH (50 minutes per episode), I have allowed Denser screenplays, good ideas more frequent, part, plot or confusing or less boring. Real-actors (though not quite an actor in Mohan) are real-time directors of photography, and sometimes real-life cameras (Mohan HD cameras are depicted with the most misleading lens-pieces), TFTC "Cinematographic" by Tim J. Roth from Michael J. Fox Alan Sylvester, Dean Kane, high-end screen play writers, and each "teal" in its sense is its own true kind of small image compared to TFTC, "Masters of Horrors "Is a very lame way to TV horror, if it looks like any ugly TV serial, if not worse, cinematographic It's hard to see if your standards are lower than average, it's usually boring and even very fast in the first 10 minutes.The actors will never hear before the buttocks (except Fairfax Balck, Robert England, Angela Bettys and some), but there they are in their episodes Only famous actors. Initially MoH's director base is good, but it's worse and worse with every episode: What if the directors do not know the world now? Nothing! Will they bring back the surviving directors of Stan Winston, Dick Moss, William Lestig, Sam Raimi, Eric Red, Robert Harman, William Freeden, Jim Moore, Stuart Gordon, Russell Mulkah ... "Masters of Horror" Perhaps Tales from the Crypt can be recovered.
