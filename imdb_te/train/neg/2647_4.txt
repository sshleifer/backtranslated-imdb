I will tell you one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even though they are in a rude, intelligent, uninterrupted, strongly hurt music, it is still dark in their eyes. Yes, there is also a chemistry material among the famous duo when the paper is thin. The score is practically a survival of one throwaway, but only a couple depending on the impressive tunes. <br /> In fact, she has more chemistry compared to her own real-life husband Jean Raymond with Nelson. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Juniette and Nelson's next fan, but it's under the pile. <br /> <br /> Jeanette is in a "hep" number with his Bunny Burns - and appears to be empty only when Nelson faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> Like Broadway in 1938. This weak MGM product must have more intelligence and style than it is clear. Edward Everett Horton leaves no harm and no one of the supporting players can breathe life in this mess. <br /> Upgraded: Rodgers and Heart can cause pain to emphasize music. It can not be recommended for fans of MacDonald and Eddie. And while Jeanette's scenes are still brilliant with her glamorous beauty, the film is a jaw-dropping mistake.
