I'm excited for films that fill in the material gap in the world film. I am "Water Lilies," for a film that honestly teens lesbian love - sort of a female version of "Beautiful Thing" I feel like Deckon Chargers I like if I like this movie after watching the trailer. <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15-year-old young French women. Mary is narrow, revenge and beautiful. Florium is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; And Anne is loyal, frustrated and in terms of behavior. Sexual interaction between Mary and Florence is always in the picture, if not at the surface, it is just below. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, is not about the start of Lesbian Love in two teens; It works on sexual depression, suffering, depression, and teens cross-benefits - at least in both cases - a cheerful, mechanical gender. In the "Lord of the Flies" DVD, director Peter Brook says, "French hatred starts with, with the passion of sex," meaning the French are angels, and adolescents and adults are treated with a pervasive hatred . <br /> <br /> The film's collapse caused the filmmaker Celine Symma to put a weak dose of hatred. <br /> "Where is happiness?" I was asked when I saw this film. Yes, the first love is painful and frustrating, but it is a fresh, lifestyle-friendly way of enjoying and successful sex. These positive features do not appear from this movie; <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be the first of the first love of love. But Simmama is very much impressed with his own hatred and intellect and ruins. First, what about a naked girl naked? "Europa" as "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Perhaps The Little Thief; The Heart of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pare" and "Europa"; But in this case a short writer's intrusion - "Look, the audience, I can make a movie that shows me nude only a niche." <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the club where Florin and Mary dance. The next thing is not to manipulate Florian Mani; <br /> <br /> Flourish Mary's biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty is when he warns that he is "not normal". Mary understands, "Who cares about the simple?" Florian's request is a fraudulent, derivative and alternate question - the original, heartfelt question is not eligible for viewers, who play the role of Mary and the role of Mary. <br /> <br /> The two moments here are also incorrectly split into the viewer's nerves: 1) When the frank - from all the people - bathed in bathing suits, and turtle boots? 2) Which nationalist - will fall on an apple core thrown in the dust to get the taste of the beloved mouth? <br /> <br /> Three prominent actresses are promising and they will find good vehicles for their talent, be wonderful actors. Louis Blackcair (Anne) is a successful actress in the technique and has a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Hennel (Florian) can be a prominent woman or a bomb, or both. Pauline Akquard (Mary) has a severity and magnetism. In the future, she has been playing a mysterious delicate seductress with everything from an emotional disability librarian to a glorious politician riding the Merionic rise. <br /> <br /> In all, "water lilies" are very frustrating. Make an authentic film about a honest film producer fall in love with two young girls! No - there is no need for this middle-aged guy - but young lesbian girls have something they can look and have something to recognize. And yes, one thing in world cinema to fill the gap.
