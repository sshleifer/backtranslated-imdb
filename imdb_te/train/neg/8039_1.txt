This mindless film is part of the worst and boring as full house repetitions. There is no thinking about watching this bunch of mindless work for all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie. In an F-My opinion. I have a question, what are they thinking? 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad acting 5) bad direct and last but not least a bad script. I do not like to hate every movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. The film should be banned in a box, locked and sunk into the ocean. So please do something like this again please, please, please !!!!
