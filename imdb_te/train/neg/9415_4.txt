Massively rewritten and often confusing, the actual screen version of Man On Fire ran for at least ten years and is no longer the best way to do it. Producers with very much money on this and with less experience the producers get the attention and the type of film that Scott Gleen's bodyguard, who is going to go out of a limb to protect his 12-year-old is just to pay their drug dealer or their drug dealer. The kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pessy, Brooke Adams, Danny Iell, Jonathan Pryce - all of the best, the action is slow and shorter, and John Scott's spectacularly fine score (a part of Die Hard's final reel) is a positive impression. One remake remake (the original choice of the director of this version, designed by Tony Scott) is an improvement.
