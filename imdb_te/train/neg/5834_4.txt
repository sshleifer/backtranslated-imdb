I saw the pilot and 3 lbs and house, MD. I've found some similarities between. Like Lossy's character, Susie's character is bright but socially ineffective, but without the acrobatic intention of bringing Larry home. Meanwhile, Tussie's 'direct guy', a fitting doctor Seger, Fosfood, has not been developed as an interesting character as 'straight boys' rod and Wilson. <br /> <br /> When Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is the equivalent of Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron when someone covers at CBS and noticed the success of MD and his staff. Mimicry hoping that it will succeed, the same performance. <br /> <br /> Do not copy the programs like house, high level compound, suspense, and taxis and company. <br /> I do not know this program has been canceled until I read it. IMDb commented, but it does not surprise me.
