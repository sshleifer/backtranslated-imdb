I found it in my local library and made merciless to waste the public money on it because it is the only reason I see it, and despite the surprise and supremacy of the donkey, it did not take long for fast forward button my friend. In the terrible direction, in the pedestrian camera work, occasionally running from the evil acting, worrying effects and the disappearance I have seen in my life (such terrible crippled and mutilated) are long lasting. The best laughs were originally brought from "Making of ...", and these HDV chaos were poorly supported by their sophisticated efforts, especially if they were doing something special, the next week was forgotten. Wait! Except for the fact that Cave collaborated with "Friday the 13th" Hodder for some people as a bit of Tippy "Birds" Haydren! I never know how it happened, and to be honest, I really do not care. Look at your own risk, and do not say you have not warned. It is a film of its majestic, cloth garbage. It's just a few good-looking nude women having a 2 from me, and also, just gets just.
