Bermon is a tough cop. He is a large-time drug dealer (Henry Silva, who usually plays a great villain - see "Sharkis Machine"), but here he is clearly translated and he does not lose his usual appeal). He goes to the famous places of Paris and Marcellis, asking for some names, some people beat up, get names, go into more messy places, ask for more names, swing more and more, after the punch punch after the whole movie punch. It seems to have a wealth of other than the one created by the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, where 50 people are here, initially perform some good stunts; Besides, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episode, simple, shallow and unforgettable police movie. (* 1/2)
