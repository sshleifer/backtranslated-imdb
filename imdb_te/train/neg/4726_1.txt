<br /> <br /> I am very open to all kinds of tasks without torturing me. The wall paintings that are the main character are strongly self-destructive. This person has little background to object to me. Why is this person hating himself and the world? If the script deals with this further they may have managed to get some sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> When I had a great deal of pain to make this guy as dark and social as possible to make her task darker then she would end up in a good fight. Man! Do not waste your time.
