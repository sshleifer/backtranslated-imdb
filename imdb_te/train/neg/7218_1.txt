There is a scene at the start after the horses running the shootout. The red grab holds your eye as a white van trail is placed behind the bush. I thought I was bad, but it was. A white van in the west. Did they hold it? Oh well, and I paid the top dollar at the rental. This makes you want to grab your buddies and put them all 10 grandchildren and make it a better film. Talking is very slow, acting is very poor, but not taken seriously by the poor nature of the filming. There is a door at the sheriff that looks like a door today with the exquisite decoration. I told him to watch the movie, and move the cabin boy into the # 2 on the worst of all the time.
