They have been sold as a horror film, but it's a funny thriller, but I've found it pretty funny (comedy, I do not think so), I'm laughable and plotted because I laughed the whole movie. I do not blame the actors, they are not very good, but ok. I was in the Batman Beggings, and Rachel McAdams, that I was very good "crazy guy" She's a beauty, and a good actress, but let's try a little target here, mm mm ... mm mm in the direction ... it's actually a really boring image that does not have a lot of good suspense. <br /> <br / It's not good for the movie, it's a small movie, just 1 hour and 30 minutes (i like 10 minutes in water! And what's wrong with too much, and rotten tomatoes, more and more, good, rational and targeted criticism ID?
