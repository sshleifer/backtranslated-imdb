<br /> This is an opinion that disguises itself as a documentary. And it's just plain rubbish to title as "truth". The debate on global warming is very low and ecosystem-zombies begin to convey evidence that is contrary to their beloved doctrine. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a river of almost every link refifying information on the logic chain of gore sites. This is important for people to understand the dangerous economic impact of global warming prevention. People wake up. Though this theory is not reliable, anyone can find many reasons for the computer, a little time, and some general feeling. Do not read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you've found. Actually, there is no in-depth analysis. There are many alternative opportunities and negative evidence for the theory to have the most basic level of scientific reliability. In fact, it could be the single largest duplicate in human existence, which is very serious. It's time for people to talk against this kind of campaign, and people have to admit themselves and others to recognize the glittering conclusion that you are a protector and global warming hysteria is a big lie.
