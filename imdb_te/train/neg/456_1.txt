In the list of satirical figures: a southern preacher and "society", a flame singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dance chorus, and The Mills Brothers - make it worse. "Negro" performers, they often appear in movies to humorize themselves and their race. Even though "Negro Comedy" is accepted in its day, it's very dangerous, and I doubt it's funny. Even if I'm not ruined, I do not think I've laughed at the weakest moments at humor. An 11-year-old white boy, however, may not be able to understand some of it.
