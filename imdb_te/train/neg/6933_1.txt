For other Colombo films, it can only get a 1 (awful) rating. I can not understand what other reviewers have seen in this horrific train-crash of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another critic refers to Falk's directing satire because it played a role in his acting. In fact, the real reason is with studio officials, who are afraid of what they see with their money. They did not kill him.
