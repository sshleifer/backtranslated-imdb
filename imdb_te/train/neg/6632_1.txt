Who is our beloved Ram on earth? Who is the same person who made Sarkar, Satya, and Lord? I refused to believe that. If AAG is Ram's most ambitious project, he has jumped out of a high hill as he apparently climbed by giving some industry of great works to all times. This film is like a brick. I left the theater, but was forced to sit, and I could not get my car out of the parking lot before others left. <br /> <br /> Someone may not have a break. <br /> <br /> This film is not present at Shola. It does not come close to a mile. Sarkar is a classic work that I love the godfather more than Shadow. I read Rama's interview two days ago, in which the interview said that Ramu was sleeping for more than 4 hours a day, it did not work. <br /> <br /> The absence of his sleep in the film is now entirely acknowledged as a exception. <br /> <br /> There is no power in this show. Amitabh Bachchan is not even scary. Some posters and wallpapers that he saw earlier looked more terrifying. Rama's favorite Nisha Kothi has done a lot of work in Sarkar because she does not have many dialogues (in fact I can not remember). The film opened her mouth and made history. It seems that the new person who has played the Jai role has a brush look, but Jai does not perform the role. I'm gone ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big to manage now. <br /> <br /> I promise you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Horrible movie. Media and critics are going to cook the goose of Ramu. And again to remind all readers, I'm one of the fans, and I could not even save him for this work.
