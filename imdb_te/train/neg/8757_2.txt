As a film to assess the upcoming trends in British popular music, this is quite simple, it's ridiculous. Tommy quickly? Hanikambs? In this film, Spencer Davis is an animal of the group, featuring two animals by animal, and attempts to make their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20) in Beatles' Live Film. But in all, 1964 was an awkward display of circa British music. Oh, and Hermann's Hermits.
