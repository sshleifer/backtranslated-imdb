Another movie about a group of intelligent people with less than a road trip, a short cut to their original travel path or in this case, to visit the run-down side show attraction. As expected, all is not good, this is a group of lunatic, in-grown residents who escaped prison inmates from this particular side show years ago. Apparently a professional photographer is the father, the only place to stop and take pictures of these places is that it still lives. Many members of the family get out to see different attractions, just need to be afraid. <br /> </ p> <p> </ ref> </ ref> The film plays as expected, and the family is separated and killed. Some families are struggling to recover, but the film's worst scenes take place because they were severely executed. If you do not fully calculate the atmosphere and movie moods when playing a completely different soundtrack in special scenes, there is nothing remotely real here. Everybody I played (it's bad when you cast your cast in the cast of Camp Blood) is as bad as I've seen in a very short time. "Special effects are lousy and ending my tech punch I want. <br /> <br /> Even though I have been facing disadvantages, I have enjoyed the film somehow, it's definitely" pretty cool. "This is a ridiculous clich√© plot, horrible acting and Cheesy enjoyed entertaining even after having special effects. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, you countless Inimalanu can see, you see them, you bagundipurti cusarui difference is not in vain, this movie is very bad and my grade <br /> <br />: D
