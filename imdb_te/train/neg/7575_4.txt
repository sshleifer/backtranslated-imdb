A retired diplomat is doing well with Michael York, who will go to Russia to take revenge on the Russian blows that killed Russian prince. <br /> <br /> Diplomats meet unexpected strong and good Russian policemen who will help him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, I remembered the old acts, the legitimate US government. It is interesting to see the hero as Russian hero at this time. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's really a "B" action movie. Michael York gives the film some class. Alexander Nevsky, who plays Russian police, is "blah", although some chemical sciences with Michael Yarck are surprising. That's Face, Michael York is a good actor and should have a chemistry with anyone doing a scene. In the first 15 minutes of the disappointing, beautiful Adrian Paul is killed. Now, if Adrian Paul has a long time in the film, it is from an average average "B" action movie. What I can say about Adrian Paul is the good thing to see in the first 15 minute film. Villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He is very blonde and very villain in the film. <br /> <br /> If you do not have anything on TV to watch this movie. It's okay. It does not suck too bad. Action scenes are good. Acting may be good, the plot has changed very fast, but hey, you see how Russia looks today!
