Charlotte's worst beauty and lethal punches are much cooler than other movies. The story is very weak and Charlotte's character dies in such a fantasy, you wonder if you think about the ending for this film. I wish I could say that there is an alternative ending, but I'm afraid I did not do that. To the rest of the cst, well I'd say they just did not work well; The film should be put in a poor script. This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Chang Gai dies in an absurd way because she is the only person who stole the show in the entire movie. I gave the film 2/5
