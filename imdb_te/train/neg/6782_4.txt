One of Keaton's best efforts, Telmeldz - is a veiled attempt to take revenge on the family he married. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of randomness leads into a marriage with a big Irish woman, who (he along with her father and brothers) kills him until he thinks he is wealthy. <br /> <br /> This metro has at least two real laughs - the absence of his dinner using the Buster's clever calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family literally bring meat to his plate. Another family photo, the whole group slowly collapses on the floor, and the camera triplets lose its stability. <br /> <br /> There was a catalyst for the huge series of diamonds produced in yeast beer overflow. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is crisp and clear and is one of the player's piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but some laughing value.
