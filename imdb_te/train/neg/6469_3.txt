When I was young, I thought the first film was good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not be sequels, because the first film is fine, and it. Ariel and Eric are primarily married to a daughter who does not allow her to get out of the house because they are Ursula's sister (an octopus-legged villain), Morgana she is concerned. When the kid is taken out, she asks Ursula's sister to become her mum like a mum. This will take Ariel into the ocean to find her. The same good voice artists, it might just have a bit more idea of ​​the story. Not enough!
