Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most exciting comedies in the film today. With his hyperactive stand and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He is capable of producing normal comedies (All Ace Ventura), and transforms them into good comedy shows. Or, in the case of 'Lear Lear', make them the most joyous contemporary jokes. Carey also proved himself to solve the plays. He is also glorious in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show'. <br /> <br /> Then 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrie, and a premise working on it; Keri, complaining about God and stinks his life, enabled with the powers of God. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, even though a script is bad, Kare's improvement is sometimes the only unfair scene that makes it funny. The problem is that Cary's incredible incredible prospects are very low, since the funniest is based on unique simple effects, some of which are fun. Cary rarely improves because he works around special effects. The writers felt that these special effects and superpower sequences were funny because the rest of the film would not have anything else to work along with the whiny character that was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " She also has a gift for comedy, but is simplified with the script, which is only part of the bitter sweetheart. She does not have chemistry between the nagging, the rumor, and the two stars. <br /> <br /> 'Bruce Almighty' should act as a comedy. But there is no guts to overcome it's fun; Religion. Some small giggles (his internet jehve), but it became just a comedy super power comedy. It does not say that it's a tone from a crazy hand with heavy hand, and sometimes black comedy. The film has failed at almost every level. It's not to look completely devoid of laughter, but it's close. Any image that seems to be necessary to add scenes of a cat to laugh it has problems. <br /> <br /> Hey, if you find funny joke funny, go for it. <br /> <br />
