Really nice, nice intro and the main characters build but after 5 minutes, the charm loses. <br /> <br /> The character is the main character from American Pie and Lasser. <br /> <br /> Let it be sacred - Header's performance is very beautiful. Keaton, Daniels and Faris are their best but they do not have a useless story or script to get their teeth, but the film is justified by the length of the movie, without any piece or a clear logical hero. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid all the costs unless you really / really / hear and watch and do not have anything else. You think the producers have lost half of your life from just one hour.
