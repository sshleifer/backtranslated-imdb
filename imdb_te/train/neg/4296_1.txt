<br /> <br /> I'm going to say that I have ever seen the worst gay background ever, but I'm honestly asking the audience to "understand many" challenges for the first time, when the director begins with a "personal note" The audio track is very bad in most scenes, it's almost impossible to keep the conversation going, and it's from the DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, and generally bad acting make this "motion picture" unwanted. I made a bad end after a lot of attempts, and immediately I made a DVD, and I bought it foolishly. I'm sure there are many challenges facing the director for the first time. But do not try to make this embroidery a finished product. I'm looking for from the IMDb details that Richard Natal's first directing effort is not only, but also. It's a positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
