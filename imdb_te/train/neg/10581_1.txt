There is no original idea in this story. Themes have been removed from different sources; Some are The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring. It went from the ring to the same cyanating circle and as the name of the film. Soundtrack by Yard Carpenter has been lifted from Suspiria. Hopefully no one around will oppose this comment by spewing word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw that theater was playing Deep Red. A bullshit cap comes out with a tribute. This is the lower-off-barrel. Throwing in the pot and "disturbing" the image does not make a good horror film. Know that carpenter. He must die in the dark or get the time machine.
