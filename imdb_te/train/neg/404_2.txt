Shortly after watching the film, I questioned the role of each actor and the actress's quest for the psychological competition. Elizabeth Shui is a fond actress, why does she have such an overrated opportunity? Because of credit, I have to give credit. Some moments in this film were unpredictable and were replaced, but they did not find it difficult to find Kevin Bacon's character Sebastian Cain's dismal trembling. For anyone, man or woman can not recommend this movie, it has self-esteem for the account.
