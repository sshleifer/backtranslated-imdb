Usually, a dentist is treated by a husband-wife team and their 3 daughters disbelief. The premise is interesting, acting is good, and the music is very nice, sometimes without a sudden and direction. <br /> Problem plot. The husband dentist leaves his wife behind a dentist (she has a small role), then she goes back to give something and sees her with another man. The rest of his desire for the episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, his former patient) and his fears "to do something about himself." I will not let you end, but let the film go somewhere Everything is like a stutter. Character motifs do not appear: Why do she cheat? He was a dentist, looked good, good father. The film did not say. Who's working with her? Do not expect any answers on it. Why does he want marriage to continue? No one knows. What do all children want to serve vomiting? Where is this picture going on? This silent nonsense is not known if good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and comic relief by Denis Lyricy) are not entirely familiar with the American psyche or family. The root canal is more interesting. Avoid this.
