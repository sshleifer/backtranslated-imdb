Oh my God it is very bad! The story is weak - the better - and the animation is flat and lifeless - even childish. The film is very serious ... in fact they wanted to be funny. I saw in London Science Fiction Festival last week and laughing at every scene of the whole audience. I think my favorite is 'you are not studying medicine study medicine'! And I think they are trying to see how many times the character could be crammed into the unique line of Nicalo 'we will be together ... this is our duty.' <br /> What do I do with Apple? <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as a lesson for Americans: Animate, so please do not try You only trouble yourself.
