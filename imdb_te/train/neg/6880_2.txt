I've heard anyone make a documentary about being Puerto Rican. When I hear Rossi Perez, I wondered what it means to be Puerto Rico. As far as I know .... she is a nuirikon. Anyway, I sit with my popcorn to look eagerly. In 10 minutes I realized my primary panic was right. Rossi Perez has little knowledge of what is Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is the 1st hand, quite a very personal account on what it is like a Nuyorican..and all that is inevitable. She (like most Negrovians I know) drowned in water, had partial and sometimes controversial. (How are they? They live here.) Yes, they are all proud. They should be! But most people do not know the true culture, history and political background or the ins and outs of language. This was very clear when she participated in the Weeks issue. Regardless of this thing it takes on my personal .. At least I know what the hell of the fight is. She is a little bit aware of what she is about to be arrested and I do not really understand how she is embarrassed to accept it because it is a "Puerto Rico cause". For you in Puerto Rico without you, it's partial account of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take this gospel ... it's not true. Please check the source. Rossi is an actress; Not a historian. This movie may not have a base for other information and may not contain other information. Instead, one step towards finding more information, learning what is learning and reality. Not just this woman coming from the eyes.
