I do not go out of my way to write the comments often, but I warned anyone to see that they see comedy. It does not come close. The true transformation of the two blacks was one of the lowest contracts ever put on the screen (change in color / gender / reform) was adequately (and precisely, many times before) bad. It would be bad enough if the script changed all the white chicks needed. However, the Yayas brothers convert themselves into two separate white women. As you can imagine now they will fail completely. I have seen the Queen with Dragons Queen without makeup and I've seen the best special effects that Hollywood has made and the ones that make the best of both. Its terrible. Add a blend of basketball player to the building, such as a building, horrible conversation, and more plots of holes than the golf course, and the film is less personal. I like bad movies! Avoid like a plague.
