I admit that I did not give this film a lot chance. <br /> <br /> It's great for most of its cinematography. 70s early Manhattan scenery is as good as the main actress. It is very crisp in black and white, which almost makes the movie feel uncomfortable and fresh. Nevertheless, some of the other techniques that filmmakers can shoot at panic attacks. The confusing edition is the 60th most late, somewhere between surrealism and new waves. <P> <p> <p> <br /> <p> As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal their appearance. The film is considered an off-the-wall, nonsense comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. <br /> <br /> If you like Andy Warhol films, I would be glad to hear the telephone book. <br /> I've experienced some problems: at the end of the movie, than twelve minutes? - sit and be cruel. There is also a very clear animation sequence that is bulky and bulky that serves as the climax of the film. I laughed four or five times out loud, and I liked the end (minus the flat-out disgusting animation). And when the film changed color for the final phone-booth-at-night sequence, I admired the way I really looked. It ended up being one of those experiences I felt like I could have really liked if it was a little different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. It's unclear, common, and way of dialing, but none of these are the reasons to recommend on their own. I did not find it uniquely or creatively and weak.
