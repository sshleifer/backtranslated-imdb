I chose this video after reading the text in the box, the story is good, it reinforces the key! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his acting was, he walked and talked stupid all the time, which was not fake and convincing. It's not the end, almost all the characters are so ridiculous that it's only acceptable acting by Alan Boyes (David), but the guy initially committed suicide and you can not see him again, he did! Everything about this film screams low quality, I can not believe how a thing will be released! I've searched for many times to stop looking at myself, actually I saw it through half way, I decided to stop watching, I came to IMDB to check other ideas about it, and I decided to force the pain to handle it, so I came here to comment on it. <br /> <br /> Most painful acting and directing ... terrible film (me) High School Rock Band theme, occasionally playing guitar and singing parts, but it's not worth it. .
