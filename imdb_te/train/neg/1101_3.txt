Certainly the author of the script was able to do something more creative, see the coincidences in the first picture that are well connected by interacting with each other in the science show, and the Bill & Ted franchise is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Grim Reaper can cause a mix, what causes This movement is poorly understood as a whole plot and there is no spark for comedy or audience involvement.
