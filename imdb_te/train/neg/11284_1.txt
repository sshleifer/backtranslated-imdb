I normally try to build reasonably well-criticized criticisms of the movies, but I can not believe that this script got upstairs. <br /> <br /> This conversation is dreadful, acting is very dull, the tones are just awful, and direction and pacing is the best scrappy. <br /> <br /> Last time, I saw this film very bad. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau Island is worse than this worst.
