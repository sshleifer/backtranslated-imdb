Two years ago I saw this film. I could not sleep and nothing. So I pissed it. What really gets me does it makes no sense and why its upset. Richard is involved in the chicken wire and begins with Jarvis when he is unconscious with Richard's girl. Jarvis's girlfriend, Troubodor, played a stupid song in his guitar. The next morning, while talking to Richard girl Jarvis and Troupe, she later went back to Richard and sees him when he is still tied up. Then they perform some delightful music and the film will be completed. What am I doing? Did they break And what did she say to the 2 guys (Troube and Jarvis)? It's unclear and poor. I can not stand up and do not make sense. This is what I have seen since the 90s version of the worst film Los of the Laws.
