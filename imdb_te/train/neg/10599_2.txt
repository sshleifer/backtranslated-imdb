** Here Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Universal Soldier Program is now called Euenol. Soldiers are now strong and able to do more damage than before. But if the government is reduced, the project is deteriorating and the supercomputer in the midst of all is threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his safety. He controls and controls the Unisol and begins to run turbulence. The only person who can stop them is Deborhacks (Van Damme). <br /> One thing about this film. Fighting choreography. The story is bad, and immediately sink into all struggles. Whatever has happened, they fight where they go. Unfortunately for this film, it is not pleasant to see a fight, it can not be destroyed in one episode. Usually you're pretty sure to win the hero, but you still want to feel that some of the fights are between two equal fights. Not to destroy and not to lose. Then the fighting has become a tool to time. You wait until the last fight when Devarsax finds a way to defeat his matchless enemies tremendously. To minimize my impression, there are women who are wearing a disappointment of a bad image and how little we are in. Well, most of the characters are not really much, because most men (although at least one woman is in UniSol), but almost every woman needs at least once a bra is shown. Women get through this, but we pass by more strip club (more use less computer) more undressed women. <br /> <br /> These moments can not give anyone the story and try to please the adolescent audience. <br /> <br /> At the end, boring fights. More, less. Well, probably less ... <br /> <br /> <br /> 2/10
