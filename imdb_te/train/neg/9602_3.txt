Daniel has some problems with her attractive exterior. When she learns of a distant relative (she plays) who is a wolf, she starts to lose her mind. She goes a bit feral when she hits the men and their throat. She eventually finds a man who helps her own internal beast but when she breaks their joy she gets violent and furry revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Werewolf Woman' is not a very goofy movie but a good crowd image. There may be a pleasant time for bad acting / dubbing / translate and plain ant's product. But it's moving slowly but does it have enough nudity to stay awake?
