I always thought people were very dull about these old Andy Hardy films. One of them is not bad. Modern film critics generally do not like the good of the evil, and these very nice two-shoe films are rarely appreciated <br /> <br /> I can not save this film. You may still have the updated dialog, but still watch the story and laugh. Looking at this, your head asks you, "How can you get stupid?" This is what I mean, it's bland. <br /> <br /> The story is primarily trying to get out of the "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) jam because he has some stories from New York City that end up with Debutante. In the old days many social-conscious. If rich or beautiful people find you the best achievement of life, you can hear the word "social-climber". <br /> <br /> However, it was found to be the innocent and clean story and the series (you're half a dozen of these Andy Hardy films). Also, if you like to hear Judi Garland sing, this is your ticket, she sings a couple of songs here and Andy's heart croons her way to her croons. Oh man, I almost throw up writing about this!
