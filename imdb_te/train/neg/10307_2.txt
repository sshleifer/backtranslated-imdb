This is a gimmick that attempts to create this TV program to keep the "math" factor separate from millions of other police programs. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor for this flag is Rob Robot, although his career is undeservedly deteriorated after Northern Exposure if he enters the Army for this occupation. <br /> <br /> The dirty-ness of "math" is an episode featuring Lou Diamond Phillips in the show (which concludes that the show is the last refuge of the reason). To catch a fugitive, "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles". So, if he sees a suspect in places A, B and C, this long description gives us a "bubble theory" to calculate where we are. <br /> <br /> However, when you see the final product, he basically took three spots and chose a point. Right in the middle and said "okay, mathematics, here we are mostly to find the fugitive here." At any time, one other character "oh, that point is also the cabin that the guy uses." Is that math? It's not even connected- f ** k ** g-dots !!! This program reminds me of the mathematics I used to work in banking, each having a mathematical analysis that could "support" the points already accepted by a less complex analysis or basic common sense. <br /> <br /> It goes to show - when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait when they stick to the NUMB3RS team on the OSMA ... They use the Calculus, call an airplane in the middle of the mountains, and Osama Hit and the five children he uses as human shields ... Haj hey .... about the numbers . <br /> <br /> Completely funnier TV show.
