I love Dracula but the film is full of disappointment! Lee reminisces from other Dracuy films since I was younger, and he thought it was great, but the movie was very bad. I believe that my young man in my youth is Lee, Lee, the ultimate dracula, style, looks, attracting and under that vicious. Or this was a disappointment for me. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine Dracula going with a snobby English accent and body language? Do you have unrealistic options through a plot letters and what kind of boring and tension do you like? Then this is a picture for you! <br /> If not, do not see it! <br /> Sorry, but if you like this film then you should stay awake and stay alone. The empty space behind you. Your parents are at home or in a stranger's home alone. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie in the movie Dracula's history? The story of Dracula originated from Nosferatu today. It is not as attractive as the film, which refers to the mystery that vampire mythology is so lovely. <br /> <br /> It is still 70 years old. The scenery is like a cheap theater. I did not tell you everything I did in 70 years. I love the old movie as well as the new one.
