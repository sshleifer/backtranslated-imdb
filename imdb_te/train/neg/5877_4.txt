Using Williamson's accent is tough. He is rush to get through the lines, he speaks very quickly. While he is talking to himself, he works during the soliloquies as if he was talking to someone. All and his bald spot irritated me. He is too old for this role. When Williamson's other accounts were read, he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a life-moping-art or forced manner. You believe when actors hamlet announces the mad! Marian Faithful loses a striking beauty and Ophelia's character and gets a pass. The set is dark and foreboding but the real king in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines a great light in the sky does not see it as if the scenes are particularly painted.
