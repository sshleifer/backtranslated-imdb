I'm deep in the dark and soft part of their heart, everyone likes Jerry Springer. His program is undeniably and stupid, it also gives us the chance to see that it is very good, relatively speaking. If you look at the Trailer Park Livin, the dollar whiskey drink on the Springer show, the 'In vast lavin' people, it looks like a walk in your garbage day park. Jerry is doing public service, and we should be grateful. <br /> <br /> We can not be grateful for any worst movie "Ringmaster". What is life for people who work as guests in the "ringmaster" show, or they would like to think of us. The film follows an earlier Springer story: Love Triangles. A triangle Kony, her daughter Angel, and her husband Rusty. The other is Starlet, Wand and Dend. When two different groups meet in LA, their lives can be interrupted and overturned, all ending in an explosion episode on the Springer show. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman has "short quotes" if he has a serious fracture habit. <br /> <br /> "Ringmaster" is true at the show. It makes me so happy that I do not live on the squalor. But there is a problem for the film. It's called comedy, but it's not so funny. There are few things to laugh. Maybe some will see it and laugh continually. If you believe the blow jobs and are rape funny, then I guess you are one of those folks. Personally, I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the remaining breathing scary horror horror horror horror life. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jerry Springer Show is just a leap silver screen TV. What's funny in an hour (less when you count commercials) is not necessarily funny in a ninety-minute movie. The movies tell the story, and it's a trouble with "ringmaster". This story is a thriller. There are very narrow holes and continuity errors, which try to tell a cohesive story. And how much fun can you remove the story of the stereotypes in a stereotypical story, even if there is no such problem? Even the Hollywood principle can not do this better. "Ringmaster: Turns into the best part of Springer Show: Final Thought Somehow, the attractive and simplest aspect of the show is that the movements built around the film make it harder than the naked women. /> <br /> This is the worst offender in all of the sprinter himself Watching a bad actor that he could not even play himself playing himself Springer sad <br /> <br /> Previously journalist, this award was presented to everyone in the film, as it was valued in the film. Surprisingly, nobody went great in the film. Best of all, Molly Hogan came to work Nickelodeon Sitcom, apparently, Nickelodean's '9' <br /> <br /> Here are my final thoughts: We are here for a self-respecting person and a man earning money, meeting their resources and building their resources to create an image, how they hated themselves Showing how little viewers view their viewers. Do we accept people who make films that deal with the seriously brain-damaged lumps of goo? I can not say. Somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed world, each of us has a perfect image. We should keep looking for it. Next time, take care of yourself and your loved ones. And never see the "ringmaster".
