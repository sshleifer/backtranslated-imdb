Most people should not make it. It's speculative and cliche. The screen chemistry, created by the first "My Girl", is not appealing anywhere and the whole acting is next to and forced. Many of the writings are enviable, some "memorable" lines like "dirty barback rituals" are just shocking. "My Girl" provoked the real feelings of mourning and some genuine funny moments, "My Girl 2" tries to rebuild these emotions created by the audience, and falls badly. Maybe I'm so stupid, because the first thing is great, but very honestly insults the original quality with the help of this installment. Undoubtedly this "son of the mask" is one of the most deadly sequels of all time. In both cases, the old man's rings are real; "If it is not broken, do not fix it".
