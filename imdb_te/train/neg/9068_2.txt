In my opinion Oscar was nominated for "the worst script". There is no good story, reincarnation acting, very lousy humor. Every possible possible, please do not waste your time seeing this movie if you have a little self esteem. You can see that the actors can act, but after looking at it you make it crumble. <br /> <br /> I do not see this video
