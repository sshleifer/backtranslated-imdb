SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bow Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Allely Shirley, Patrick Manne, Dana Kimmel <br /> <br /> Fifteen years bad girl Melissa is a desert town and It was not long before she started to die around. Detective Friday 13th alumni Dana Kimmel put together evidence with the help of his daughter Nancy Drew's daughter. Local Native Americans were the main suspects because they were disturbing the early urban areas. These events lead to the expulsion of the murderer during the sixteenth birthday of Melissa. <br /> <br /> This average average slasher is not very memorable. It received a TV feel without scoring the title character's own wheat theme song. Lines like "Lines will change us coleslaw." Fit into the standard Eighties slasher screenplay. Melissa Melissa was called the bad name, and soon there was a friendship. It is clear that Melissa knows how to make Melissa. The movie is fifteen in the lead role and today the director is making it harder to include many of his unsatisfying scenes. Social commentary on Indians is not adequately developed to take seriously. I'm surprised at the very high rating this film gets. Sweet sixteen and Ed Hunt's bloody birthday was capable of respecting the birthday tradition to create a serious order of carnage at the time, but I could not release it. But the DVD on the DVD gives the bright side the release of ambivalent movies like this will hope others follow.
