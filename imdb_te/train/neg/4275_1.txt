Why do not many people understand why this presentation was praised. <br /> <br /> Now I see Season 2 Episode 1 which I saw season 1 episodes. <br /> <br /> Where is the proper entry into the Criminal Investigation? <br /> <br /> The agent Cooper in Season 1 throws the stones to the bottle. Can you imagine why he did it? When he referred to the supernatural ability given by Tibet Dream, he wanted to identify the murderer with this 'joke'. <br /> <br /> There are many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 is a 'funny' cooper on the ground floor, with a cup of milk (he put guns in his stomach.) This old man can not do anything but some mute comments. <br /> The scene is really boring and very long (3 minutes 30 seconds it looks like hell. <br /> <br />
