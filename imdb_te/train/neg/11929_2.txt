I saw "I" before seeing it. I really liked the "eye", which is one of the best films of recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I chose "chasing Bangkok" because it's the same director, and it's a popular round type here. But man, no disappointment ... "chasing Bangkok" There are three stories about love, vengeance, ghosts, etc. It is not scary and nothing ("eye"). <br /> <br /> I can not fill the 10 lines required for this comment. <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> My rate: 2/10
