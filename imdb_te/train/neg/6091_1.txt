I upside, entertaining bloodbath, bought a richly gratuitous in this movie exciting. None of them got me. This film is practically failing at every level, not least frightening or funny, it's just horrible film-making, no viewers have seen the audience. The worst thing about it is that there is little violence in terms of the promise that it will be crude, violent and cruel. Of course no blood is killed and there is no excitement. Acting, directing, and dialogue is totally unbearable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I once rarely sit through this whole trash; I want to see again and again. Waste of celluloid like this does not waste your time; It's probably the worst movie ever made. If I give minus stars, I will do.
