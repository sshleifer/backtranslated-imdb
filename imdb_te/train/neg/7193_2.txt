I could not do anything last weekend, and a friend tagged me with my friends to look up a picture. <br /> <br /> We decided to enter the film as we had only seen the inspector's gadget. <br /> The big mistake. This is a movie that will appeal to children only. Oh, I do not like movies that target young audiences. But this film is nothing to capture my attention. If you do not do anything at home, sleep. This is better than wasting hard-earned cash on this. If you are a kid, check the movie if you are a parent kid
