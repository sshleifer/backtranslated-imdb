There really are two sections of this film. <br /> <br /> Initially, 'The Simpsons' Troy McQueer is very soft and it's called the Cornball, and there is a ridiculous experiment in the film. Technically, a vague, inconsistent and incredible plot and just unpleasant characters begin with a title song that has been killed with no meaningless characters. br> <br /> <br /> What has happened earlier that violates Rooney's spontanea, particularly in the part and 'part of' the firm, and that Hackman has taken a seemingly unilateral decision to bring him along? In that case he would be totally overly and unnecessary, and in the end he was still there. <br /> <br /> The whole issue of the film is that the conspiracy is behind. The filmmakers do not have the courage to understand that a particular section of society may have the ability to create such a company and that instead of lack of explanation is enough to ensure that the audience is determined to make their own decisions. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film failed at all levels.
