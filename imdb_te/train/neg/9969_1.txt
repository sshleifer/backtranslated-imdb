I joined this site to comment on what people think about this absolute disaster of the film. I did not even draw for a second. The characters were of the same size. I threw every thing they thought about what they thought would be something to happen. I will wager (and hope) as everyone participating in teachers struggles. Here are some great actors, but you never know. It did not destroy Morgan Freeman's or Jude Hirsch's or Nick Nolte's or Laura Dern's career. No focus, no labor in love here, only a terrible attempt went wrong. BTW I do not think the author ever stepped into a real school.
