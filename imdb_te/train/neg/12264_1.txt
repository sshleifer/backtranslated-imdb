You write five different writers and write a different story with another story, and then you try to make a movie from it. It's action, it's adventure, it's science fiction, it's Western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this film definitely stroke. 4.5 giving it a higher high rating. I think it's written in movies, and I just write it.
