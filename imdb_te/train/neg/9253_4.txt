If I read his name on the DVD cover, I am suspicious of this guy and the old fashioned musician who has a close relationship with the French New Wave. In fact, if the film is back in the 50s and 60s, the new wave writers absolutely hated this kind of film - that's it ... so ... not true. And, it seems to be much less of his previous films. <br /> I'm not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Some critics have given this film. There are very good French musicals. The songs in the movie are not very interesting and the characters seem to be soft and eccentric. When I need to see another great man I'm struggling to earn a good selling price in a rich or designer outfit, I'm giddy. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is music, not every French musical is gold. Even though this film is being UMBRELLAS and Audrey Tautou of another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (CHERBOURG or "Haute Famous" (Eight Women), I can not see much reason to recommend anything other than a dull peculiarity.
