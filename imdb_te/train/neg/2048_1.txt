1 is pretty generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGYMANMAN, it really is not a campaign BOOGYMANMAN on DVD cover and we all know it! It killed me. But this film, it's something. For a long time directed by a man directed by many movies, it was filmed at a VHS camcorder at the age of 10! Story and acting are worse! David Hess, you are too far away from me. After playing one of the most horrific villains in the history of film, have you adopted this subject? This article and acting have been forgiven, if someone takes time to see the video as some professional. There are too many shots in the video that do not appear there, or at least not clear to remove your attention from this movie. I can not always say the worst movie, because I can not do it through the whole movie, but it's definitely close.
