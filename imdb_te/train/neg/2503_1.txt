There is no need for the New Jind movie making. The film is in New Zealand satellite TV (August 2006) and I am now ashamed to shoot me in New Zealand. A large number of actors make local soap stars. The ship's original life is one of the inter-island ferries between the two main islands, and the company's logo (dolphin) is still on the whole set of the ship's funnel. The ship wants to become a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has clear signs of corrosion and vivid signs of old age, which is still believed to be a luxury ship in its early voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow-covered peaks of New Zealand's South Island in the wake of God's wish! USA / Mexico must have a very cool time! The story is weak, acting is weak and New Zealand / America tones do not work. I think the New Zealand taxpayer will contribute to the production of this film and this is a waste of waste that is actually costing the product. I know high school students in New Zealand, who can do better with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck holding it with tagging and a taco company is trapped in the truck's door, perhaps making it look like an American. But remember that some tagging is above - you'd think those items have noticed that before you've attached them. I like to go but it does not bother me anymore.
