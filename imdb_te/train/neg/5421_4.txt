This is one of those things that I relate quite a bit more than most people in New York especially when I hate noise & those in big cities, how people sleep at all! I am surprised that these days people can stand up all the sounds. The film's basic plot makes it an interesting point. This is very bad about it. Although Tim Robbins was a teenager, he did not appear there, except for a few scenes (especially with the perfect supermodel looking Margarita Leveva). My biggest expectation casting agent for this film will see Margarita Leviya, an absolutely wonderful & talented actress to burn. She does not have much, but she is pretty supermodel. Even when they were trying to make her look more girl next door. It hurt me that it could have people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world, which has greater potential and talent than any talented beauty and achievement. The script would not be good because I did not pay much attention to this film, but I am happy to see some new talent. I expect producers & directors to think about Margarita when I want to be a pretty new actress to be in a big budget film. From a film Megan Fox is a star (Simon is not her hot, and her acting is far worse than what the "Talent" Disney Channel TV Show is for) I would recommend change her last name, so we can articulate it and sell it more. Here her career does, and if she has no justice, she can pop up some big summer film or two in the next couple of years.
