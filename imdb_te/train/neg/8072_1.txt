<br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is the worst theatrical release film ever. Nothing understands, there is some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who are not dead or not. The whole picture is just a group of random shots of things that just last. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You have to tie the film together but nothing came to you." - **** 1/2 stars .
