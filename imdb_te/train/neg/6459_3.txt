Such great actors such disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and terrific character, this movie is not funny, a subconscious message is "IT IS A DOM CRAP !!!", "IT Success So Badley !!", "Your TV Through Windows" and so on. It's just frustrating and dirty. There is something along with the feeling of humor along with fools. Room decorated way, colors. This can cause illness and cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about makeup in the film but I got angry from "free money". Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - perhaps Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brandows, but there is no viewer! It looks at the cost of an intelligence.
