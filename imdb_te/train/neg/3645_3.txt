A young man gets a bad hair day, goes over a hill, and falls into where he can not escape. Then, he meets MR. Atlas, his best friend from 2,000 years ago, and "mythical" Dude from Arnold Schwarzenegger Look and Sound-Alike. His great strength is that the boy is in danger and then adjusts to modern life. So what's the big deal? The lousiest idea for this "family" outing! Either way, this one should not really be all tried, really! Our fictional character and epilepsy are no more than the usual common stranger in the rest of the universe. No new or attractive to add to blasphemy, and before you know, there are some violent attempts that do not qualify as "family". Atlas has complained about his undershorts, but there is a gagging. Spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
