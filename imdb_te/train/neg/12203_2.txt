I think John Rambo is trying to keep his time in his life and to keep Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cool blooded killer. Whenever he dies on the screen. Vietnam is not a pleasant place and apparently I'm tired of making it tired of it's Hollywood. It's not the worst of Vietnam's movies, the honorable John Wayne goes to Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo is half a Viet Cong army which brings about 50 Most Mass Gun, plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch. It's worrying rambos cheesy speech at the end ... please !! Oh yeah I heard I made another one ...
