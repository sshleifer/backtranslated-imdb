I did not like the bouts of remakes, or steal "stealing" the modern juggler, but this film really repressed me. The original Prom Night, though not a good work on my humble expectation, still knows what it is ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when doing horror movies. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the audience's interest. Sorry folks, but it's not a white fist film! The threats are cheap, and terrible precedent. (A good example to frighten, now a cat is gone out of the cat, and there is no sooner), I think the other scenes of the horror film can be fulfilled so that the villain in the film is not anticipated now. Be a preferred hero or heroine. This movie is not one. The head detective is the most noticeable person. His calm attitude, but the killer has led to the escalating level of the film should have more pictures of the film. Common sense approach to occurring events. (If you're running out of a tough ax, you can not go in the opposite direction and sprint. No jogging, looking back three seconds, getting the killer's progress, and visiting each branch and the dead body on your way.) If you disappear friend, you can not look alone. If you suspect playing foul, you do not investigate yourself, tell someone. These clocks are tired and well overplayed. Usually in the horror genre, and most importantly in the film.
