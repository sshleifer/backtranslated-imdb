I love Falski movies, some are boring contrary, but I have found that they are helpless and inaccessible to many. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Structurally, it's like the most full of movies you've seen. Some things are happening, some of the things are going on and occasionally a scene may be related to another. Of course it's like consoles, sets, scripts, real actors (yes, Arnold Shargeners is not an actor), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and gore group. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
