For my first flavor of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people are a perfectly good game. <br /> "Do not we start with a good bit?" <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is too late. The rest of the actors needed to get together. <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why did you not die, Romeo? While the actor was entirely woody and unreasonable, he could not read any of his songs with any pleasure. He was completely in touch and looked face to face with Juliet, and he was absolutely grateful for his lines. Who deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost impossible, but does not give any depth to her role, and is totally close to drama. Merkutto was very creepy and did not complete the full role of his dialogue. Benvolio is unfeeling and relentless choppy with his lines. <br /> <br /> I've endured this half-baked product of Romeo and Juliet. Acting is stable and clothes are not distracting. I saw kindergarten puppet shows. I only want this movie to give you a rating of zero.
