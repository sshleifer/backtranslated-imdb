It was the smallest part of the 1971 "Night Gallery". Sue Leone (Lolita Motion Picture) and Joseph Companella played the role of baby sitter and vampire respectively in this episode. Vampires hire a baby sitter to see his child (when he leaves for the night for the blood). Baby Sitter did not take care of Vampire's appearance when she first looked at her and found that she did not have a reflection in the mirror, only two and two began to be together, secretly the library's collection of books in the library, and voiced strange sounds as she was going to talk with a baby boy. She did not think she was the first person to whom she was appointed. She walked out the door, looked vampire and came out of episode. I do not know what to make a brief peak that is only 5 minutes. They just expanded the same 5-minute pre-expanding expansion and crossed one. Total waste effort.
