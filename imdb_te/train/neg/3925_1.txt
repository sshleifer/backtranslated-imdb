When I was released in 1986, I saw this "hot" film. It has an X rating for a brief overview of oral sex, but premiered at major theaters (this is an "art" film). <br /> <br /> When I see a high school boy (Federico Pitzlis) a boring story (mascula detenters) with an older woman in love (understandable). Detmers is a pretty good body has been mentioned before but she also gave a good performance. Pitzalis is pretty poor (to put it a little bit). It's no wonder he's another movie. Still, despite the infamous sex scene (which is obvious but pretty short), this is a slowly moving and slowly moving story. Detmers good acting helped only a certain point. Most of all I was looking at my watch looking to wait patiently. If the sequence was not, the film had long been forgotten. Dull and slow. You can skip this.
