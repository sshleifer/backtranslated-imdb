I find them enjoying because the trash / bad movies are not usually bad. It's very bad, I'm not words to describe it - "bad" under it. At the beginning of the film there is a reference, tell what to do in the movie. Needless to say, beer's command and a dozen whole picture did not help me in the seat. Absolutely unthinkable and an insult to our intellect, it's enough for a kills. Obviously. <br /> If you are looking at this mirror, suppress it! If you're thinking of buying, dont think! If you are unlucky to have this dvd, dont play it, immediately throw it in the trash bin.
