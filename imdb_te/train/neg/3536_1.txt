I do not think that in this film I gave up the story first. Guy Ritchie is looking forward to seeing this, after loving two previous films (I do not count out the pulp - he's pussy is blind). <br /> The reviews are poor, again, I do not trust the press anyway. <br /> <br /> "To describe this movie, and because at one point I was close to standing and it was close to asking me if I did not get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie has fallen into the trap of his wife who is taking too much of it, good plots, laughs, dialogues and good movies characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The performances of two lead actors, Jason Statham and Ray Leotto are very good and this is really a self-serving story and editing <br /> <br /> A big big toe down from me.
