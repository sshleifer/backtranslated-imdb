First, the movie is not true to the realities. A few days back I saw the documentary and the movie was not like it. All Nash is a genius at first mathematician and what this picture should be cured and is not a story about the person who has not found love and so on. There are a lot of scenes - just over the years after his early university with a biking scene around the campus. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit into this part of the past, he did not seem to be a clever / personalized type, so he could not really play one. It focuses more on mathematics (the equivalent) and not the most dramatic person. ABM at this level is very much Hollywood-ish and too much surfaces too. I personally feel he is not mad or suspicious and the people of the carrier are more aware of us than "lesser people". 5/10
