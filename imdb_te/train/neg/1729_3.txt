... and how they were right from your mind! The Cotter Lake monster is one of the classic bad films made from the 70s, with no note, embarrassing script, failure direction, and tireless desires that shake the "horror" with scorching. The film introduces a polytonologist who finds a water dinosaur drawings under the Potter Lake ... A meteor shower comes from the sky and threatens the people around the lake of the cold variety of submarine diner. The whole thing Steve should take care of our local sheriff. A lot of the movie - the beast's dinner - not the blood pools left from what we imagine - spent a morale of two boys, Arnie and Mitch, who run a boat rental space. They looked at a trademark and told Menning Arnie, "You write the wrong bait and it's written B-A-T-E." Smiling is a bit rare here. We drink them together and imagine that the tree trunk dinosaurs. Laurel and Hardy Watch Out! Dinosaur looks fake, but this movie is fun in a bad way. And at least, the lake is beautiful.
