Rachel, Joe, Hanna, Tina, Bradley and John are the top form here. They are eligible for Oscar nominations for their performance. I'm a big fan of the TV show. Their music rocks and they're all so talented! I am also a great trail of SARCASM !!!!! <br /> <br /> You are not an S CLUB fan reading this !!!!! <br /> <br /> There are performances terribly weak, dialogue is terrible and jokes are not even executed correctly (I'm sorry for the director). Jokes are so unbelievably bad 8 small, passionately S club fans are not laughing. They thought they could do it better. And they are. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul should be thankful to his lucky stars he left when he did "fat, an ugly one who opened a mosh band". One of the worst films ever made. Beware of this picture! Do not go and go! You're not bad! You are crying! 0/10 RJT
