The first one really starts in a mute note: A 10 year old girl decides to play around in a moving vehicle, with her hands to be funny to cover her mother's eyes, and then this causes a horrific accident. Sorry, 10 year old is silent. The rest of the movie is not good. On this planet at age 10, the father moves to Genoa and Italy, where his father teaches at his local university, but here is the doctor: he does not speak Italian word! The little girl then mommy's "visions" (which she killed), and often the next night, had fears, which always always casts her father and coddling her. Then we found this family constantly lost and then found and then hug and then woke up all of these unhealthy, ignorant people just off the planet that I found cried and lost and then found (and of course more hugging and crying) I waited for some sort of natural disaster. I love the Indies, but an indie about the dumb people (and I really mean dumb) is just ridiculous and not understandable. Because the locale is interesting, these films are really shy of those duplicating characters that are in such crowded scenes.
