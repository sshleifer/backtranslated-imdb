The range of realistic Lensman novels is the standard of genre. It's pure adventure SF and Hollywood with some ingredient (here and there) I wonder why it's not vehement, because they love: huge explosions, super weapons, uber-heroics, hero girl, aliens (great CGI potential), in pure form Good vs. bad etc. etc. instead (and bear in mind I'm a Japan-o-phi Wall and anime lover I am), we get a picture of this terrible kiddies rips out the story-building Wars mixes (unlike occasionally removed the books), Thunder and mugalu passislu klats level the whole thing down. To see Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic patrol officer and the second stage Lensman is portrayed as a young child by Pitfle (etc). I can not understand that the producers did this because they have the rights to the story and make a lot of money (FAR!) Directly. That does not mean it.
