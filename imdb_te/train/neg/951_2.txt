*** Spoilers may have. <br /> <br /> In the Tokyo Time, live on the real-life wanna-actors have provided some bold experiments with film parts that they have powerful prescription anti-anxiety, anti-recession and anti-psychotic drugs (which is a classic size ward combo, translating patients into drilling joids ) During the filming of all, then the film is more of an interest. Or, if the filmmaking is another kind of experiment, all the actors are deprived of sleeping before and after filming, then TOKYO TIME can be more easily explained. <br /> <br /> However, the film is a lifeless, shaky actress. In the scene where the new husband talked with his sister, he found that he was struggling to keep his eyes open. In almost every scene he sees his body with each piece, sitting on his lines. <br /> <br /> Do not talk about actors, as these actresses are finished shooting any lines of dialogue. Everyone speaks with discouragement, monochrome voice. Laughing. Nothing. No power. No one has enough energy to crack a smile. The result: full and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And the direction is simple and unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Avoid all the costs of this expensive movie. The green theme on the same theme is good to see and charm and power. Or, for an exceptional Japanese romantic story, look at the long-term inspection that has everything in Tokyo Time Lives have plenty of everything.
