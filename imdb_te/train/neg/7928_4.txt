Actually, the movie is not horror or science fiction. With a very strong Evangelical theme, this film offers less content and suspense. Second-level actors do their best to read their boring roles. Sydney plays the role of Penny, her mother plays the role ... I can not spoil the movie, it is Christ or anti-Christ. <br /> <br /> Avoid watching this film unless the Christian religious theology is filled with apocalypse. This evening, the cybercafe had to air this movie.
