The story behind Lost Mississippi is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story is a bit dull and overdose of stock footage, as well as poorly exhausted special effects sink to the film's sub-paragraph level. /> <br /> This image begins with a missile that jumps to the ground. It is in panic because the Soviets deflect the object to hit the ground. Nevertheless, this seemingly unmanned craft has a steam train that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in orbit on the planet. In other words, with each passing it is the death of death - all of us can potentially kill !! So, the best scientists in the United States (with the very small and rarely identifiable Robert Loggia leadership) to protect and plan - and that's good to protect New York in its immediate flight! Unfortunately, they can not save Ottawa (I have never done it, so I can not say whether it's a big loss) but thanks to the good old American, they can ultimately destroy it as a messenger of destruction! <br /> As you see, the idea of ​​the story is not bad, not the original one. However, warplanes and radar scopes seem to have a lot of old clips getting older and padding. Overall, a fascinating but rarely inspired film genre may be fierce fans - all others, look at your own risk.
