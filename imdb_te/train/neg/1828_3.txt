I saw two nights ago on the 'jealous' DVD, in a friend's house. The film's maze is very promising, with Jack Black and Ben Stiller in the comedy of comedy, but it is totally unsuccessful. I saw five friends and did not laughed for the whole movie. Jokes (these are very few) are not funny anymore ... the story line is even worse, and they can never answer the question ... where SH * T go? In fact there is no answer. The film does not have any comedy value, while others say that Christopher Walken is not just J-Man watching. There are no characters, the plot is narrow, it's almost transparent - and funny in the funny movie?
