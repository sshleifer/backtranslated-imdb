After watching KHAKEE, I see another good movie but sadly the film is a joke and actually attempts to introduce Aryan after his father is Kesu producer. <br /> <br /> The RKS film says that during the lectures, there were meat in the films that were released at the time, I was surprised at the movies talking about the film. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a spice movie with loads of comedy, romance and action. <br /> <br /> Imagine the kidnapped children of the Dawood family, at which one of the funniest episodes, kidnapped by the family of children <br /> <br /> The ending character of the ending character is a blend of complete chaos <br /> <br /> Bachchan The music is boring until the day, except for the scenes except <br /> <br /> Music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh has done well for his role and he did well in his role, Thudu struggles with his face, but pulling a trigger and cigar hub dubbing is not exactly right. </ Br> <br /> Akshay has a few minutes and repeats his action and hams. <br /> <br /> The Aryan expression feels very difficult, but it is <br /> <br /> The bee is very good. <br /> The rest are okay
