My original review of this film was sh 2 t written just 2000 times. Although it was very accurate criticism, I thought my review was a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress. Her facial expression does not change once in the film, she does not show fear, happiness or disappointment. Her skills in the body language are so disturbed that her eyes fall down and darting right and left and she does not know jack. I guess an emotional chuff has a lot of botox. Without the expression of her face through the film, she survived by a romantic love affair with the lead actor, which seems to be coming out somewhere and falling in love in a few hours of interaction with each other, meeting them on a beach. <br /> <br /> The mainstream actor is better off than his hair, and he does not feel like he's actually in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that leads to bizarre performance is the directing, storyline and storytelling bugs. I saw the tampon ads with more formations than this film. <br /> <br /> I do not have any development in that role and I will tell you that they will never believe that they are real. <br /> <br /> This film is very advantageous, snakes on an airplane but I am also trying to make a serious action film very difficult. I have a brain tumor from watching this movie now and believe in thinking up all the different ways I could have used that budget and CG team to create something superior. If I buy this on DVD, I would cut the DVDs into pieces, then thaw it into hydrochloric acid for better measurement. Do not see this movie!
