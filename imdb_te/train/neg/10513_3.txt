The film wasted an hour in my hour for several hours. I usually like cheap horror monster-type movies, but this film is a disappointment. A major flaw in describing organisms When they entered the house, he explained to them the person he could rent. He did not really say anything other than those who killed his parents, and I did not say he did not tell me how he had escaped unless something went wrong ... no clue or reason why he was alive and she would feed animals after her death. It seems to have the opportunity to leave after "cross-incident".
