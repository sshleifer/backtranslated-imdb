If you're aged 6 or 7, you really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is appealing to TV when she's watching. As an adult, I can not stand !! I'm all for the sequel ... when they have a good story. But this is not the standard. Please forgive me what to do after the kid's painting, but when you sit every day when you love your children, why do you understand? <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again, so my daughter will see the film again the same day.
