I'm grateful for one thing and one thing - this woman is now miles away in a completely different continent! Yes !!! <br /> <br /> The program is engaged in Victoria Beckham's self-promotion and separation of herself and her family to the media under the brand 'brand f * cking Beckham.' <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I really used 'Posh and Becks', and I still admired David's talent, but he did not have any respect. It is clear that Beckham's untimely departure from Manchester United is in Victoria's hand, now what is your respect for his wife's hands? Real Madrid. He lives with the fact that he's selling his soul to the American Buck and ends up playing for a team that struggles to gain promotion from Division One in England (no offense America - but football and basketball you rule - football you do not have though he might have earned the squillions of pounds <br /> <br /> Anything else - I'm Dessus Rebecca Lose After the 'defeat', she topped her terribly red carpet performances - this was the year when she saw such over-the-top, totally wrong performance from 'Posh'. <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> "Why can not she just go quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of her career and keep her head down? How much self-importance did she feel she should have been covered by these huge fan fare? <br /> I accidentally saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he is a thin in grace and humility. <br /> Another thing in Victoria - you have complained that you are constantly pushes through the pops. A little hint - you stop buying them about yourself in your homage. <br /> <br /> Good luck America !!
