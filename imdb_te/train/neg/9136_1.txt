When the film began, I was surprised to see that it was portrayed using a low video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home image. DVD movies must have product values ​​more directly than this! Heck, home videos uploaded to YouTube have a large number of good product values! All too often, the film is seriously sticking the camera on a tripod and it looks like it's made by turning it - with no camera person! Some scenes similar to capeups and camera-work do not work, where they work and there are too many or poorly made upsets. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The couple are two gay men who want to get married. Almost a decade ago, their only option was to get married in Vermont - times have changed forever. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage can not be attributed to the film anyway - if any, gay marriage supporters can not help re-imagining the film and help solve the problem really seriously. According to the film, religious people take the bibles everybody and one-dimensional idiots who shoot and shoot those who have narrow-minded tendencies when the wives of homosexuals find their wives lying. I'm glad it gives me an honest opportunity on both sides of the issue! <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Nothing shows anything about the film and I'm also struggling to shoot this film. It is a more home film and does not even list the list in IMDb or does not include the list of the worst pictures of all time in the IMDB's list of the 100's. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible, the direction (if any) is terrible, the camera work is terrible and the plot is terrible. It's a home picture! I can not say anything in this regard anyhow, but I'm like Oscar's competitors compared to Ed Wood's movies and I'm sure Mr. Mood's ghost is laughing every time he sees this mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care if you are gay or straight - this film is not worth your time and I do not know how they managed to create DVDs. I think one of the stars burns them on his home computer during his free time! <br /> If a woman in this film has a real lawyer, is not it so important to read ?! <br /> Lastly, since gay marriage is such a serious and important subject, do we not have this film better than the problem solving? It unfortunately laughs.
