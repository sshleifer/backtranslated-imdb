Unrealistic "film", what are these people doing? French staircase stairs, mummy horses, romance (unrecognized, its image is full of fancy) & Benny Hill music & chase sequences, its sounds are silly & graceful by watching it even more. ** Spoiler ** It sleeps somewhat tediously ... Then a lamb makes a runner, prompting a woman dressed as she runs next, a rat "penis" attached to a bear / mouse manki suit, The "penis" is in charge & way too much screen time, ejaculating it for the most, anyway, in a nutshell, A bit like a bit rat / mouse tadger bit & thats about it, the rest is just padding. ** Expect a spikeer ** Shock & Guilty, so any propaganda I think is really good time to suppose waste, time, but can be seen to believe the "mainstream", its hard to imagine that someone is a good idea when they portray it.
