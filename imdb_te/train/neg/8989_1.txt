There are some good things about the film. Music and cinematography is good. Alex Wilson gives hot and great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production has produced the production value for the film. Johnny Vincent (Sean) and many others in the uncharted movie are very beautiful. Why is not Amy casting credits? Brandon Alexander Clitarissa Pink gives a great comedy show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is probably star, James Townsend. He can not work. He is also very scrawny, nice to look at all. His hands are like spaghetti. It's frustrating. They do not have any muscle tone. He does not need to make his own film and it has to cast himself. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not as reliable as the person who is homosexual. If they want to be the best of the film, they should act as a supremacist. Then again, he wants to use this movie as a vehicle to start a career in soft core romance, because he's just taken some acting lessons, is certainly not true acting. Plus, anyone obscene was blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about this film is probably the casting of Tan-Skin Latina as Dannon's mother. Sona Fisher does not look like an actress. In all, this film is soft core romance and is much better than something you can see in Skinemax. I also think Alex Wilson, perhaps the best thing about this film, is that it is intolerance and nothing to do with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing has been listed yet, so Alex Wilson is probably the name of the recyclable platform. Plus, I recently fell into him in West Hollywood and when I mentioned this film, he just turned around and walked away. I understand it. If I work in this film, I will be embarrassed and not related to it.
