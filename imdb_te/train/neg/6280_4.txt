Do you have a cool picture in your mind that you would always be in a movie: as a detective picked up by a broken fence cracked by some abandoned house? Or walking down the street in a street, looking cold and intense and very careful warning? Yes. Imagine that movie wire for the whole movie, you got a broken idea, and I'm using it as a visual example even though there are no detectives in the film. But, there's a serious looking woman here and she's pretty much covered with 99% screen time. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to complain to the woman, she is the perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I'm a very open mind person who can enjoy all the artistic expressions, really moody stuff. If I had shaped one of the scenes from this movie and hung it on the wall it would be really cold. Be honest here, acting is amazing. <br /> <br /> Some of the expressions on the actors are watching me. <br /> <br /> Now on the issue of this film. Outside of the mood is not here. The director mainly took a siege of an idea and walked it beyond what it was worth. I do not consider myself a spoiler as the invasion is "mirror". Let's face it, this singular idea came to work over all the bloody places and all the director. True, there are some turns and turn here and there. <br /> When did I take up the bones with this art? Because I enjoyed them for a long time. . I still believe we must confirm an art form in the media that wants to express artists. Cinematic music, or toy, or painting, or verse, and is definitely not just a cool movie in your mind. It's a good plus and character development. I will cheat the movie's Lynch style. It is irresponsible and cheap and medium waste. We gave cinema time for 2 hours for a good reason. <br /> <br /> It should be judged differently than the drawing of image frames such as a photograph or painting. <br /> <br /> The film is not a lynch style but thanks to goodness. It has a simple development and finally comes to an end. It does not develop much story or character. Apart from the characters with the common people, it is out of the surface, at least from other fantasy topics. It does not provide any explanation of the fantasy element or try to build a coherent world around it. Strange comes from nowhere and seems rather alone and accidental. Perhaps the patience may have been in the head of the directors, but from what I could see he did not work much on the screen. <br /> When did he ever do that? He seems to have done so much to improve mood and music. Music has often produced tension, which eventually becomes a tease. <br /> In the end, I thought: Okay, I know what you're trying to say here but the point you're trying to build up this tension is two hours. It is irrelevant that the characters and what kind of life they have. And we are given less about who the characters are. This situation we have just put up. It's frustrating but I do not have too many ingredients to work with the director and it shows.
