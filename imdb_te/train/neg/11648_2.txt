If I'm not already there, then there is another dull god God Clone from the director of IL Konsgiri (1973) who I see earlier this year. The marque-value name traveled during this time is tailored to the tail of Savalas and the first is from the back, instead of adhering to her flowers, wearing a barrette in the style of French artists! Without looking at a little Sicily, he does not have any tactics except the drum he knows. Antonio Sabato, then, makes an unlikely gangster - unlike a counter-leading person; His relationship with Savalas, which turns into a father with the eye of the eye, is also unbelievable (especially associated with romance with his niece's niece niece)! Moreover, for a gangster movie, there is a valuable little act to talk and none of it is memorable (although the last part of the clinic is well maintained); Furthermore, Francesco de Massi's score service is nothing but a different one. Incidentally, I start off by renting bargain-basement DVD credits, so that the cast - or the title of the film - is in the list forever!
