Blank check is one of the worst films in the nineties. The plot is not completely understood; Loneliness is its coronation. Do you really believe in the twelve year's performance that a single million dollar personal assistant can buy everything for a $ 300 grand of a movie in this film? Concept, the bargain-basement price is separated, only the most gullible viewers believe. Please respect your intellect and watch this awful, awful picture.
