I've seen many horror shows in the years like Nightstalker that DeGenez DeGeneres dealt with, so I'm looking forward to an angry spirit causing turbulence to add to the Halloween season taste. The man I was mistaken. The whole movie creates this sense of events that happen to be horrendous and creepy, but then offers some very simple story of vengeance and murder over some property damage. Very scary - no! <br /> <br /> It's about Hollywood scary movies, because it's harder and harder to be rarely available with the original and spooky. . What idiots pay for such a bogus film? Drawing back to the drawing board and be useful to you with millions of green colors.
