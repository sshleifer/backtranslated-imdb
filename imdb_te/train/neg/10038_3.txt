The image does not style, I mean the original style. Including everything from action, there are first shows in the movie, songs, dialog delivery etc. Yes, there are gob-ups in the original, starting with the car **** number and after a few seconds it starts hitting the number with MH ****. This is one of the most goofy-ups of the film :) Anything good in the film? Yes, for Kareena fans, if any, in Kareena Bikini. For Akshay Fans, his conversations and actions fights. That's it. There is nothing else. So do not blame the director or actors by seeing your own loss. The director is already mad and actors, I pity them.
