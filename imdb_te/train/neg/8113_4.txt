Papa and Big Foot **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; <br /> <br /> I used this baby to lap, but the episode contains three cartoons back-to-backs, namely many years later (many of the pirate yarn riders Theatrical screening), I can see how well they are! Popeye's role does not have the proper sympathy of Oliv Oyl, but the Bluto's criticism has failed to increase its interest?
