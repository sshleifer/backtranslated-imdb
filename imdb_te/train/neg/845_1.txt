It's pity because I can not vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I do not hesitate. In fact, I have gone to say that the movie is negative stars. <br /> <br /> I thought Michael Madsen had the movie like most of the others, it may be good ... no chance! This film was amazed! Predicting the length of the film 'The Bold and the Beautiful', Prelimus Instinct did not come to that well, and I thought I was nothing worse than 'The Bold and the Beautiful' in the past. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this to us? The worst part is, I have not forwarded a bit fast, I am hoping that it will eventually reveal that it is all sort of sick joke, when I thought it would be funny to see such a terrible bad movie <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Zero Stars, actress - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Make Up - Zero Stars, Cast - Zero Stars, Editing - Zero Stars, Trailer Half a star, graphic design - half a star, DVD menu - half a star. <br /> <br /> It is important that bad movies have been seen. So, that's why I saw this movie, and I'm happy to have a bad image in the bottom of my list.
