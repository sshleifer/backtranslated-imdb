The whole biker movie genre is made up of the most recent films made. A lot of blood in this fight, a generous amount of blood, bikers fighting with Indians, and a town at one time to tear down and destroy. Acting is beyond terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr. At one point he was in some of the major studio productions, and he just fell away. This film is really blows, but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the picture, you should feel a bit worse for watching!
