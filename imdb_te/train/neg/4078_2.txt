Jessica: The name is a ghost story that represents a ghost story. <br /> The brutal murder comes from the death of a woman. This is an attempt to pass this film like a plot. It really does not. The film features a series of scenes of a person dealing with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> From the early sequences, this film is a "straight-to-DVD" effort. Unlike gemstones such as Venkon 2, the film does not have direct or creative creativity and exactly the "straight-DVD" films give the bad name! There is little in this direction because of suspense, intimidation or tension. <br /> <br /> The play elements undoubtedly reflect and are more sophisticated than the soap opera. <br /> <br /> In most scenes there is a long period of time with long distances between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerated! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> I gave a rating for the film instead of 2 because some poorly combined with poorly interacted with poorly laughing. I emphasized the word "a little bit" in that sentence. It is not one of the "very bad-looking" films, such as Campbell Blood or The Nail Gun Massacre. If you want to be cheerful, look at those pictures. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the correct horror movie about the ghosts, hell house, marching, ringing, and (original Korean version), grudge, a missed call or phone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Forget about this movie. Do not leave a thought for it!
