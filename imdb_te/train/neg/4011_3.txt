For each line of television, over 100 ideas were created, 50 scripts were written, 15 pilots were made and one was just one product. <br /> <br /> From this selection process, we believe that the final product should be the creatine of the crop, and the reason is that we can refuse many ideas to give a single television series. <br /> So it goes with True Blood; All stars are in the arrangement and successive novels are transformed into an idea, screenplay, pilot and finally a range. Unfortunately, this is sometimes a long journey and shows that ratings are good for many turns and productive people who have finally become good and pure. <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has evolved into a silly storyline, worst acting, and silly subfolbs like anything in recent television history. . The international cast of relatively unknown actors struggles to find their voices and make them tripping on their fake southern tones. Allian is not a secret passion for Ryan (Jason Stock House), but it is often associated with the storyline, although freshly naked in each week. Tara's furious black woman fails to connect the character and you go secretly to another speech about white silverware as she attends a celebration for the glorious Dead of Confidredie and finds her hoping to go out secretly. <br /> <br /> Sam Sukey finds depressed love and suddenly we have to spend years together to work with her in the morning, afternoon and night and avoid such a relationship. <br /> <br /> Bill Vampire, with his moral high ground, quickly surrenders with the first chance to make love with Sookie and does not have a problem in making her a quick snack (although she is somewhat safe). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first six episodes, I tried not only to try but also to see how bad it was. Sometimes the vampires die for a reason. Maybe this presentation must.
