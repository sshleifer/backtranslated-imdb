This display stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to look good. It is usually education, funny and bright. <br /> Is it educated? No Doodlebops to sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> Is it funny? Say something like Doodlebops is not intended as a joke and smile at it. <br /> Is it brighter? It's very bright, it's painful. Very color, s everything is so bright, so good. But Doodlebop's world is not always wrong. Therefore, they are always happy. <br /> <br /> This program is also very cheesy. Each letter is overly exaggerated and very tame. <br /> <br /> For kids, it's fun, but you do not want your kids to look at the age of 2. They never knew they would grow up.
