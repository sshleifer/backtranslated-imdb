This is the last time I rented a video without checking it in IMDB Reviews. Lemini was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who wrote a really awful nightclub with Evan McGregor and visited such a garbage as the out-of-site with talented talented Jennifer Lopez. Terrence Stamp is a good actor and he is a shame that he participates in a bad movie. There is often a confusing compilation that seems to have a last minute decision to make the absence or story, filming and just plain common sense. This film does everything wrong. What are they thinking?
