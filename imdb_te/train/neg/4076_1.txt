This is a very good script and the final result is enough to star in this movie. The story was full of scripts because it was never considered a story, but the string of moving stories was loosely combined. There are a lot of story lines and loose ends. The kidnapped victim is her scene that her parents are not dead, and the scene she is looking for is since she was just bizarre. It is written as a hate speech therapy momentum from the shelter's head for runways providing her "missing poster" from age eight. In the real world, if he found out that the shelter head for the runways was kidnapped by a solution, under his roof, what would have been followed immediately to the police would have followed. It is not a law enforcement issue that is not a 12 minute division for Oprah. Everything from the end to the bottom is so small that I ended up with the first 90 minutes of pure gratuitous exploitation. Funny, this film is thought to be condemning. In the end it seems to have reached.
