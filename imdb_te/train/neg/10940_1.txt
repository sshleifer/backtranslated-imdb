At first, Lorenzo Lomas was never considered a talented actor, sometimes good, sometimes just plain lousy. Nevertheless, the film was called SnakeEater, the film industry sank. <br /> <br /> First, start with the plot. Vietnam's vet Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who thinks he is hard as a leather strap and then some moves the edge of the nails by 2 yards and laughs the pins on the floor) and that his family has been killed and his sister has been kidnapped. So he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. <br /> Now, acting. Being an actor, I deserve to say that some of the worst acting in the history of this art is just !!!!! Lama is fine. <br /> <br /> Jacks playing the Clangets / Deliverance denials should be lifted and burned for performances everywhere act as insulting actors, especially those who do not get their big breaks! <br /> Finally, action. Gun fights are very good, and the fist fight is troublesome. <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: CACA at all costs escapes this option! If IT is only available, you should not be anyone else! For your brain cell calculation, do not see this thing!
