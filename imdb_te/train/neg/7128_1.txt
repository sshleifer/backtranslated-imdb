I'm a dumbler for renting DVD REDLINE. The stupid film Chicago Pictures Palisades Media Group has not bought web ads on various automotive sites, including a mine with ALEXA rating of 16K. <br /> They have made me out of your contract and now I pay $ 16,000 and they have ruined my personal time (Palaisadays Media's Peter Ramport). Cinematic !!! It's sucks and the people behind it are Rio's artists. <br /> <br /> There is a cast of redline losses and poor actors <br /> <br /> This film is a joke
