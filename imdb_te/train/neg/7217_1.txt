I came by watching this DVD at home. We love Westerners, so my husband hired it. He started apologizing for me half way. Saddle, clothing, accents - everything off. He's the part that made me mad where he did not take the spirit of fat guy and shoot "collector" with his bow and arrow. His only need is "he only left 2 arrows." We have seen it somewhere, and, as someone said, it's a bad thing for any reason why it's misleading. I mean, the fact that the boy had been snatching the bad stone from the same month and day collector, what's that point? And why not everyone there was a tomb yard that died on 25 April but the collectors took their souls still walking around? If you want to make a film after a few beers, this could be your movie. However, if you want true Western, you hate this movie.
