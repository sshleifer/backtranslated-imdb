I'm not interested in movie movies, but it's a tearger with some zealous features. M.J. Fox Stuart is the perfect voice and the rest of the talent is ruined. Hugh Lorry may be a wonderfully funny, but it is not possible to do this film. It is sugar-sugared and does not appeal anyone to anyone more than 7 years old. Instead see Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
