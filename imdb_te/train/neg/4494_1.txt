*** SPOILERS *** *** Spoirs *** Continuation <br /> <br /> From here the whole movie will collapse. First we meet a rogue program with predictions that we'll get ghosts and vampires and wolf variants. The endless garbage, the two 'ghosts' talking to a realistic purpose does not have any real benefit, no role and some companions. <br /> They told me that they have vampires (straight from Blade 2), but I'm not very clear they're not very clear <br /> <br /> Oracle is a loud funny man who is funnier, very long and very worse. He has a simple point about the cause and effect, it does, it will continue to make it until it becomes made and stupid. His last line before the walk is comparable to the storm's "Do you know what happened to the poll?" <br /> <br /> The chocolate cake is such a lazy, curious cliché and Monica Bellucci that we do not have any other wife than we expect. <br /> <br /> We have another kung fu fight! Why? Neo, one of the allegations. He can not do anything. He has the ultimate power and what he uses for it. Kung Bloody Fu all the time. When he hovers 1000 bullets, he is still cut with a knife and lasts five punitive servicemen (vampires?). We want to see the breathing powers. I can not do anything because he's a ruthless, crazy most insane *** <br/> <br /> <br /> I did the same before without "Wow". That's not bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's not bad what we're going to do. All the cool shots from the scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So all is probably a good chase sequence now so we wanna take from us, guess what, a kung fu fight !!! Well, it's not Neo, but I think he explained to his closest friends about the matrix realism. At least taught them something. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's happening to you in the homeland, it's not true, you can not really harm anything as long as you realize that nothing is true." <br /> There you go. <br /> <br /> Okay, Chase is not bad. It's never boring and it does not look like 16 minutes. It is so low. <br /> <br /> The final climax for the movie is imaginable. There are three teams that have this comprehensive plan. They only then show it occasionally between Morpheus long, super preachy, advert. To make it even worse, they can clearly define what this plan requires 3 teams. You know primarily, but whoever does that, you do not just care when a crew will go and you do not know what you're going to do. <br /> <br /> However, I'll finish it, so you can get back to the matrix to set up the end of the quarter. It only happens. This raises the question, why do they first need to send 6 people? <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the middle of the Matrix is ​​equally slim. Ooohhh !!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths! Woooooo !!! It should take many ideas. Now they are in a corridor, so the fight is not in any degree and ended in a moment. <br /> <br /> After that, you should remember everything I told you about the architect. Mix them and double them, how terrible it is really the architect. <br /> <br /> "Choose a door and die all humanity (except 27 !!!) .and choose the other and all humanity dies !!! If he has a choice to save humanity and save Mississippus or save humanity and kill humanity is potnetial for internal violence and tension. <br /> <br /> Now, the most tragic thing about realistic matrix comes to life when Neo dies.It comes out to everyone that year stupid jar flies The end of the Matrix is ​​the pace he made to see Steven Hawking for him "Oracle I'm in love with myself, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! <br /> What do they do in Wachoski's sequel? Well, they are the good end of the original look made. How? <br /> <br /> I've worn my FA and r keys by doing the same thing (only exchangeable characters). Cliffhanger is not just a cliffhanger. This is a reminder. <br /> In general, the movie is just bad. I'm not really bad at all, but it is. In many ways it is bad. And it is not a film with enough budget to make things worse. This is not a very low schedule. It's not a film that has come out of it. This is not a film that is very influential from outside. This is exactly what Wachowski created to bring Warcher's fortune back to back. And that's what makes this awful. <br /> At least the royndic aluminum can say that it does not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Matrix Reloaded. What's the greatest film you've made so far? Perhaps not too much. <br /> Undoubtedly <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly
