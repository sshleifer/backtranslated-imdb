If you want to make such a film, the threat is real. Do not round your puss with a bunch of bonuses. There is no credibility here. The plot is dull and unbelievable. Acting is even worse. One of the worst actors in the history of Arthur Lake (Dogwood) I'm looking for, I've seen the main character. Oh well, at some point he has to face the music and fight mad. I do not care. Do you do These delicate offices include these long sequences (furniture made of cardboard or masite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place within five minutes. After that, it ended. No trouble.
