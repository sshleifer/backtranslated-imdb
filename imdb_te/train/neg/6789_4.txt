This film story hangs on an important topic: this murderer is also responsible, loving and attentive father. Being a father and a murderer is not impossible. But this person murders the young man without provocation or cause and emotion. This girl is one's daughter. I do not think one's father had thought so much about his own daughter and that someone else's daughter was so cold-blooded. Or, alternatively, a very cold-blooded and still worried and care for his own daughter. <br /> <br /> A believer thinks that a punishment murderer is asking for his victim's parents to ask for his daughter and to care for her daughter. <br /> <br /> The characters acted with actors by actors. I did make Scott Bucula's eye color discoloration seem more cool and menacing than usual. You can not see him.
