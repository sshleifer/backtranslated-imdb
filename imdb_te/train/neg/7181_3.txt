Now it's not wrong for me, I do not enjoy Christmas movies. I love its wonderful life and really enjoyed the versions of Christmas Carol with George C. Scott and Alistair Sim. But this particular image is awful. I'm singing a Christmas song I love life is especially painful. Abert Finny sang well in Annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie but it sounds like someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved us this film was watching the dance numbers together shutting off and the South Park Christmas CD.
