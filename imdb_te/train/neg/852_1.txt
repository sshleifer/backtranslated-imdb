This "simulation" of the wonderful King Book is a bad joke and nothing more. However, there are many Kubrick and Nicholson fans on this site, as a result, the film finds its way secret in the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is ridiculous as Torrance and Shelley Duvall. <br /> <br /> I do not read this book, I advise anyone to understand the characters in this story: stick to the TV series. <br /> <br /> Oh, and say that Kubrick has every right to destroy the story of the king ... A good writer should not be bound to review "artworks" such as "covering the eyes wide".
