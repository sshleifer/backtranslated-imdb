Seriously - avoid this film anyway. In my first "Sneak preview", I looked at it and paid the money back for it, but I just got out of the movie just 15 minutes later. Whether it's already a 2 minute discussion between my friends. For the first time I ever went out of the movie. <br /> It is one of those (and badly) dubbed films, even though it's shown in its original language. It relies on the oldest, simpler and cheaper jokes in the book. ("If you get into the war zone, what do we do?" - "You get out of the car and die" In fact, it is very ridiculous to read that it is a method of distribution in the movie) (A man eats "space cookies" Missing the wedding or the women in the army (all badly written and acted Adoptive) live through it) ( "Why do we have to keep only the trumpets! Guns!" - "This is the way, the way it should be") ... arg. <br /> <br /> In addition, you have done better in soft romantic movies on European Late Night TV. So is it dubious jokes (less distributed), less average acting, lack of pace, badly dubbed and edited? It did not work. <br /> <br /> I'm also bold to say that the film has proven that there are very few funny German soldiers. And if you like the simplicity, it's talking to something. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this film, Try to teach crocheting to shrimp, paint your toenails with a really irritating color, break your bicycle, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, change the religion and return - in fact, go through the "Last Christmas" Wham! Endless mode. Anything, but do not look at this awful picture.
