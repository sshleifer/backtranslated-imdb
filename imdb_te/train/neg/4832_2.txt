I saw a little bit of the 2008 film was interested to see how something won the Oscar for Best Picture and so went to see the Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, these two films gave me full guarantee of two hours, the film won awards for the screenplay reasons. <br /> <br /> You will always see the direction and visual style of the film weaker. <br /> <br /> It shows all the main features of Soap opera during the second rate in terms of "plot". <br /> <br /> "Plots" Beatle Bailey Comic strip Ideas and dialogue-painted films are "minimalist" and one or two soldiers turn right into the right shells - some are always the worst record ever. Honestly, the actors make the best of the situation, and the project is not bad enough. <br /> <br /> If they spend two hours in the film, they will not be for two hours. Return, and two hours you wasted the rest of your life.
