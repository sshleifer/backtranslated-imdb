This is awful. Andi Madowell is a terrible actress. So she makes a rocking horse to make her a good job. But four Weddings remember that turn, equally excruciating. Another feature film finished with England chocolate box huts and grass greens. I mean that school, how many hogwarts could be like that without schools? The Twee Police Station appears to have come from Hart Beat (a frustrating British series set in the 60s) .That was not enough to think that this film was just about comedy or women 's friendship. It's just like the former cemetery sex scenes and the stupidest of the most stupid in marriage if I might just work. But those scenes did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also see Molly again talking to Kate after her horrific behavior that it can not afford. Final Note - What is a good actress like Stanton in this rubbish pile? Anna Chancellor did not say. McDowell's campaign should adhere to wrinkle cream.
