This version moved a little slow to my taste and I suppose I had problems to get started with this play. But the first film, a distinctive TV movie version of a play, does not have a flair of the original film version with William Holden. Can not they employ more than twelve people? Why move the movie to 1966? So you could give a little sister a line about the Vietnam War protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about civil rights movement <br /> <br /> For casting, some hits are a few misses. Jay Sanders made his notes with his scenes with Josh Brolin, particularly his role. On the other hand, Brolin's notes miss a lot. He is unbelievable as a former BMOC joke but he does not have Williamland's raw sensuality. I always thought that all women in the town of Brolin seem to be a little like a gorilla to have a monkey (pin pardon). Gretchen Mole was lovely but she seemed so intelligent for that role. She did not mention innocence or ignorance that the character needed. This may be because she and she are about 5 years older than Brolley's characters. But again Holden was ten years old. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Bedellia's mother and Mary Stein Burnen did not forget that she would be playing Blake's Duobis or Catherine from "The Taming of the Shrew". <br /> <br /> Play Mr. Innes, I have always thought that choosing a taste for practicality in such a young age is always an introduction. "The Twilight Zone" Believes that the young couple Diana Hyland is chasing a bitter old Diana Highland where "Spurf of the Moment", chose to run with a guy similar to the young Diana Highland, Hal Carter.
