I saw this film in last year's media class and I have to say I really hate it. I'm at 10 (and at the age of 15) per year, so I have something to do with it. But for this year English, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, by George Orwell. <br /> <br /> Unlike the fact that the book is based on revolution, my opinion is a terrible book, and it is also that I hate it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984, I have never seen it, and I think George Orwell is one of the most upset people ever to live on this planet. I am sorry for everyone who loved his work, but unfortunately I did not. The themes in the movie are well shot, but the whole set of film and the events that took place are not my standards. It's only my opinion, and many people enjoyed the film very much.
