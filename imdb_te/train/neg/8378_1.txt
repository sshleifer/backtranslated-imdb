The film is the worst ever I've ever seen in my entire life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole "little man" garbage is just stupid. The whole picture is dubious and dumb. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is a terrible piece of a nonsense that has never been for theaters. Jokes are not funny and acting is horrific. I'll save your money by looking at this remarkable piece of remarkable. I had to wait to sit by the little man who wished me an hour and a half bleed my eyes. I'm so disgusted that something like this can be assumed! Who is writing this rubbish? These actors have no expertise, how do these people come to Hollywood? They're earning money on this waste!
