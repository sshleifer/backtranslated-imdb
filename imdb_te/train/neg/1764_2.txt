In many ways I agree with other reviewers' comments. I realized that the plot and the idea were very good. Many of the supporting actors are good. Ellen Pompei is a deadly issue with the film. I am undoubtedly, I've never seen a lesser "actor", and this guy is always in the movie or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, she will be at the Wal-Mart. This low level of talented person participates in the role and participates in the question ...... "Who knows her?" I have recreated this film with some talent. The author is wrong that I am not worth the time to see this film's failure.
