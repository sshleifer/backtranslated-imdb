I'm a big fan of older horror movies, and I'm in the middle of the age, my age is a film that I was associated with in the late 1920's and 1920s by many people. I'm not a big fan of modern horror movies, but one exception is Creepsco 1, I thought it was great. I can not remember the stories there, but really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hall Holbrook and even really great about the clean person. But all the stories are great. Why do I like them most? The characters have some good, different from the good and the bad, the horror bits stay close to face to face and the funny bits are really funny! This sequel is lacking in these items or they are not absolutely! I saw part of the film because the film was totally ruined and I stopped doing other things like IMDb.com, writing reviews on lol. George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamour top billing is something that tells you something ... 4 of 10. Also, Romero's skill is hard to find here, they say it's down to the PG standard. I know what's rated it but it looks like PG), and it's not good for a movie to do anything. This will be shown on the Encore cable channel by looking at your dying (yauk).
