Director Jonathan Lynn has previously made some unhealthy comics like 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. An inspired film of the 'Police Academy', more than its inspiration, portrayed Steve Martine in the role of the old Phil Silvers, constantly scrambling scams under his army. But Brico and his lazy bronze moves the brass life when an old enemy base comes to capture Billko. Nothing really happens. It's very dull. It's not too funny. Martin, Don Echroyd and Phil Hartman laugh at both endeavors, but they are better than this and they are very painful to work with thin material.
