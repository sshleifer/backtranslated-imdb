A young man kills a young girl without any reason. The man's brother is convicted of being a colleague, but soon escapes. After being escaped, a seemingly innocent murderer kills three victims and shortly he catches his girlfriend on the plot. If it does not fit correctly, the situation will be reduced rapidly. <br /> <br /> There are some good things in this movie and many bad ones. Its strong performance is the main actress Emily Hawk. She will make the film's nicest amount nude, she will be a good actress and a very strong character. I can not take this experience and can not somehow turn it into a career. <br /> <br /> Also, the filmmakers have been pulled out of a very bold and uninterrupted. Graphic nudity (male and female), coprophia, and serious illness do not get away from violence. I want my horror movies to hit the borders a little bit, and it completely ignores them, happily coming to Gomorrah. <br /> This is a lot more, but I have achieved what they were looking for. <br /> Now the negative aspects. The first and most recognizable, this film shows the low budget and image quality. I can forgive - the plot is good, the acting fine and the low quality picture in some scenes is actually the movie more disturbing (more realistic feeling). So, I will repay them for low grade devices. For the use of poor options in shots I will rebuke them. There is a huge amount of footage in the cemetery, with no reason for me (besides reading the movie). <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure why, and I frankly started off doing this time because I have a long time and meaning <br /> <br /> I will take the issue with the title. The idea of ​​the film is to deceive people with the idea of ​​the idea of ​​"I'm on your grave" classics. Now, the main character is the daughter of the woman in this role. And the themes are quite simple (men are a woman getting revenge). But the video customer customer does not have any solid connection that they want to get a sequel and the title is chosen. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plot does not have any meaning. Not quite a bit. A woman is initially killed without any reason. If a jailer gets time to kidnap him to torture people, for no reason (because they misuse his girlfriend). The same person goes from good to bad, without explanation. Similarly, the female leadership (hawk) mia becomes a normal person to someone with a cruel and cruel, and for many she understands (a neighbor for a sex <br /> <br /> Do not let this title fool you, or the film is astonishing Yes, some scenes are astonishing, but the majority of the film is Nice If you see this in the video store or in Netflix, simply keep browsing or rent it, we can sit and watch for hours.
