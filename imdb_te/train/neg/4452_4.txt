I just said I would be less susceptible to Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That means, Toby McGair is less likely to believe that I have built buildings more than I throw Eliza Wood into tough issues in Manchester. I do not want to write a spoiler, I'm not getting exclusively, but growing, professional, British men will move into scraps of death near every weekend, well ... funny. And this is not the film. The fight, the idea of ​​struggle, is very serious. Gravity of positism, respect for respect for the subject is frustrating because it does not establish or resolve conflict. An array of viewers can move eyes to Woods eyes to viewers as an array finds a person who is like a man, as if it has enough holes to run a Guy's truck. . As he pulls out other young men opposing the football tastes with blunt objects, he goes faster. Characters cartoon, especially the Americans in Harvard. The character development and plot are telegraphic for the viewer in the movie. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film has not reached its height until the end, and you have spent nearly two hours in your life and you have never returned. Choose "The Factory Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this inexpensive and disappointing dad. This is an empty melody, tired of old "Anchor in King Court," or with bulls of old age. They are simply pure, dark, and brilliant; There should be a way of violence.
