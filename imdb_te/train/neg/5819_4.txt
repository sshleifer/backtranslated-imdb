This is a Jewish workless family story. The parents divorced and the mother is back in the east at home. <br /> <br /> The father, Murray Aubarovitz, moves to California with his children and moves around Beverly Hills, where he gets the best education for his children. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film has various adventures of a complicated family of drug addicts in the richer neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> Karl Reiner and Rita Moreno have come down to the end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law in a row; They are also Tommy's parents. Before children, Reiner recalls Murray, who tells him that he has paid them all bills. <br /> <br /> The awkward family survives from their fancy daggers and wanders around Beverly Hills in their car. I guess film independence and some good old self-esteem propaganda.
