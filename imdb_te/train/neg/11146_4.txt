Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but I thought it was not so bad. I do not really feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask. The plot is okay, there is nothing clever or new, acting is pretty wrong, but the cast is pretty. Directing is idle, but the effects are terrible, especially thedolph effects, in a werewolf image, this is a big problem. There is a very good amount of nudity, which is a pretty good thing for me, but it's not all hot. All in all, it's a fairly flexible live video film, the worst picture I've ever seen and if you're bored with an art fan, check out some time. <br /> <br /> The horror geeks, Kane Hodder (some of them are Jason Voices) Bonus is actually a wolf.
