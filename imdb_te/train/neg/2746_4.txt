I was taking my daughters to this film and I did not think it would happen well. The kids, ages 6 and 10 set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it is not as bad as I think, but it's still far from the book. The film was exactly 10 years old and with a sense of humor. I found out what was happening at the age of 6 and I found solutions to his problems. I have finally explained that movies do not offer the best solutions to problems because they are more fun to see what happens if they make "crazy" or "stupid" options.
