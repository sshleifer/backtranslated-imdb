If there is a Zero rating, I will give it to this film. This time I tried to watch for the second time and I have not been able to continue till the end. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and they can be seen as actors or disguise as a campaigner! Acting is all around worse, the script is a blah, even when she threatens her with Nicole playing Kid shows zero emotion. The "southern" voice played by Amber's mother is ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - trust me in such discussions! None of her emotions appeared in any scene. The subject is very intense and deserves better treatment.
