Directors are very respectful for these films, but I know that the history of his production is not as important as other movie makers. Keeping in mind his great 30-day TV series but his MTV product "I bet you do" he also opts his intensity to any of the documents and also hopes to "surper me up" his rather disappointing product counting. Sadly this film suffered less for me none. With a "supersize me after" I'll ask exactly what's the point of all this. The main statement is clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the gameplay is already meaningful stuff and is already filled with repetitive stuff that is shown in this way or another front image, so it wears and ends with a very boring side.
