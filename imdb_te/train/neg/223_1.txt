Not a female image but a movie for the gang. One of the worst films a female director made about the woman. The director Andy McKay just does not know the woman. Peaks of bad taste, American Pee's humor style, crude story, no meaning, baseless story, rejected characters. Wicked fantasies came to life on screen. Not insulting and definitely not funny. I agreed to take part in three good actresses.
