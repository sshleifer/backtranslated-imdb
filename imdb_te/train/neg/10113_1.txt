I learned that the film was rented based on packaging off. The front of the DVD is cool and scary to the zombie. Then you come into the movie and it is a woman with raccoon masks. Zero special effects ... and fight scenes also you can see them miss 2 feet of punches. The funny thing is that Lommal is a little bit more active in the film and is worse than the rest of the movie's worst actors. The only thing I think is that Lommel is trying to make a "Cult classic" dub such a bad image of people ... However, I probably can not imagine anyone thinking of anything but making one of the worst movies ever. How bad is the real scary in this film. I got hired as I was in trouble and it was hard for me to never see another lommel movie!
