I really like this movie. In looking at it, all I think is, "This guy gives me creeps, I would have gotten a compulsory order". It also calls CODEPENDENCE in letter letters. Is not it true before making a movie? "Two long-standing, depressed, socially vulnerable individuals support their relationship and encourage them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I have seen in life, the last thing on earth in the potential companion is attractive to us, it's constant self-pity. <br /> The movie mood is clearly 80-ish; Breeding and slow. Do not make me wrong, the film is its moments, very few of them.
