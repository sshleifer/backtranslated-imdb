<br /> <br /> Gateway is mostly action movie. And there is no action !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. <br /> <br /> It's remake and I do not see the original, but Bascen and Baldwin have some good screens, chemistry. <br /> <br /> The gateway really quickly becomes confusing. The plot is a stir after another, and by setting up violence, Buzzen and Baldwin are in no particular danger to their great perspective. In fact, they are almost as good as the end of the film. Has begun. <br /> <br /> I do not think Buzzer's eye makeup moves once in the entire movie. <br /> It's not a movie I have not seen, certainly not an action movie purist because I can not really see this movie enjoying here just because there is not much. The escape is not terrible, and is unduly ruthless. <br /> <br /> Basen and Baldwin offer performances but do not necessarily avoid thousands of lives for their lives. Sometimes it is smaller and again old again after seeing the same thing. This is not a pleasure.
