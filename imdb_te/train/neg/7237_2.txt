Life is like a lot of movies like this. <br /> <br /> When David Schwimmer realized that I was suspected of playing the exact kind of person he was playing in, I knew it was not good. The guy does not play anything but a nerd or he never gave any other episodes. <br /> I would say it's difficult to like a film that completely deviates from the substantial talent of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Tony Coltel and Carol. Kane !!!
