I wanted to release a fan of Broadway play. I have been waiting for a few months to win awards. I'm with Eddie Murphy, Jamie Fox, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover's star power ... Could not this picture be less than 4 stars? Wrong! I was definitely disappointed with the final product. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's James Bronsmack Performance is Protected only when the film is hit, the film is only Eppy Murphy, Unka Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. The performance of multiple labs and Jennifer Hudson stimulates you to pay attention every time on her screen. Her performance "I'm Telling You" is the only time I felt fit to hype. You cringed like she was in the crowd and asked her any good man to be in her life. As many critics have said, she steals the film from most experienced actors and she has received praise for her performance. A great voice and jokes have a strong presence. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, have been cruising through their shows. Fox's acting skills for the film seemed to be his first "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles is in an extensive fashion photo shoot or video tapping, starring in his way through the film and Shimmy. <br /> <br /> The film is a very serious, 30 minute and 1 song (Beyonce 's "heartfelt" solo to Jamie Fox) <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
