<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> "666: Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen ("worst" than "Godsend") from the "omen" without the signal. The end "The Omen" ends. <br /> The acting, writing, and story are all hacked. If these movies make money, I'm sad to see that the ashram is facing. It's embarrassing.
