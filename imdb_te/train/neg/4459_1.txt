I'm saying product values ​​are very low, but this is horrifically portrayed. The girl's shot in her hair wash in Christ? Do we really need to sit there and do it for 5 minutes in the same spot? It's terrible, lighting is just plain bad. You can not see anything and when the characters speak, you can not hear what you're saying. Did I see the whole movie? Of course I'm not skipped by too much, and I do not hear anyone say I need to see the first amount to judge. The film was very low and it was just plain terrible through independent and low budget standards. It does not waste anything at all times, but it is not "funny" lines because it's hard and productive to produce.
