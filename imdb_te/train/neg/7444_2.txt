Unless you are poor Russian people or pigs, this film is a snorefest. Actually, I was sleeping forty minutes and had to face the desire to leave the theater. I wanted it. <br /> <br /> "Silent Hill" is also terrible. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" is also terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm still obscure about what should be scary in the film. This brought me trouble when I brought a group of Russian friends. Oh my God. <br /> Alas. Well, luckily for me (& maybe you too) this movie has already escaped my brain & I survived an hour ago. <br /> I'm going to be somewhere, there are no visuals going on now, no specials. Some deaths are dying. <br /> <br /> I saw this film completely sliced ​​version because I can not believe that I have seen such great reviews & horror or suspense and I have completely finished the entire entertainment value. <br / <br /> Yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up.
