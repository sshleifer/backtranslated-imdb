<br /> The biggest mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this picture at Target for $ 5, "Hey, Sandler I can make some laugh." I'm wrong, completely wrong. Three friends of my friends are sleeping and I am still suffering. The worst plot, the worst script, the worst picture I've ever seen. I want to hit my head on one wall per hour, then I stop, why do you know? It seemed good. After boiling over my head I closed that damn film in the microwave and saw it burn ... and felt better than anything I had ever done. It took the American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Bill Kill Bill. I hate the censor for spending the day in my life and really spending my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
