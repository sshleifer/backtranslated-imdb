Well, I love Ben Stiller, but I'm pretty much about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can work at least. Every film or sitcom I saw was very difficult to get her fake performance. It sounds like she's standing there reading her right off the script. The film has only one good thing about it and it is in Ben Stiller. This plot is used and it's ridiculous. How many movies are there with this theme? Are we "natural forces?" The story is not the only one, but the result is imaginable, it's boring. I know everything that happens before I do. It's a bore, but watching Stiller is always a pleasure!
