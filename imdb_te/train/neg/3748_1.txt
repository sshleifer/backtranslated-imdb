... but it's just not working and I'm surprised to see how many people feel better. What grounds? Here and there are some loose indications, but the whole thing is self-indulgent and not incredible. The lynch's movies are usually witty because they are inspiring and generating a confusion, which makes it a lot more fun. There is some visual sense, some subplots, letters, ideas etc. But this is dull and yes, it's pointless. Anything to explore is "shorter", either too far away, or earlier. This is just a Lynch DV exploration, and nothing should be considered something like that. 1/10
