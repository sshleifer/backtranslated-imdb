Honestly someone pg Write down the script, and then decided to include some blood, nudity and language during filming. It's a big break. The magic of children in films like "angels in the outfield" who defeat the "pacy" (pig) or bad tooth miracle believe. Parents end up believing their daughter about seeing the ghost and the ability to use this skill to suppress the ghost masterpiece. When I bought this film, I thought it was a B-movie response to the terrible dark waters; Maintain a better movie with 1/4 of money, but they will not do. They did a worse picture and probably lose the same ratio of lost money to fall into the dark.
