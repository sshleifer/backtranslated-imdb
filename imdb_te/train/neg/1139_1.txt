I did not see the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my town is the smallest and does not take it. However, I really want to say something about it. I am actually researching the title role Richard Maris Bacque University and they would like to point out that the person based on the main character is totally different !!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic licenses were granted, and true Dr. Buck completely strengthened abortions to cure insanity in women, and never lobbied to represent the film. I'm ridiculous of the film criticism of the film that writes to legitimate newspapers that have some historical basis! The friendship between Dr. BÃ¼cke and Walt Whitman is the only reality I can see. Please do not waste your time in a movie with such tiredness for the horror that real women have experienced in the hands of this doctor who has been glorified by the film industry.
