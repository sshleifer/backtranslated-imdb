This is the worst performance I have seen in years. T.V. due to its retardessness I believe that it should be removed. It was faint when I looked. (This is SOOOOO poor because I have never seen it) Foolish: When Mack says, he eats sugars, and in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world it's sugar !!! When Eddie shouts at Edison Monster in the episode "Eddie Monster", he falls twice in the second time when he breaks apart, and he falls apart without falling. No stupidity. I can not say also the term Foster's home. I also made a song with my band about how this performance is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
