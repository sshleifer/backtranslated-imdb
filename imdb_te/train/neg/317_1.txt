This was the worst movie I ever tried to see. In the first 15 minutes, there is nothing to keep my interest in the film. I was on vacation at that time, it was very fun, it's just a fun movie. <br /> If you are like Adam Sandler, this movie is not the same thing. It started with the bad premise and got worse. <br /> I saw a lot of movies, some of them did not care. But if you decide to waste your time in the film, do not say I did not warn you.
