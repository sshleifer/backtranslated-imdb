Awful. This thriller should be buried. What piece of garbage Terrible writing, the characters are less than reliable. Horrible Slack !! Some B-stars try on a fierce written POS and give it a little credit, but it is a failure. <br /> If I did not write ten lines about this film, it would give a word word review, it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Harrying end, retarded. Who is writing this rubbish. This story is very difficult to end, weaker, do not know what to do with this story, or they are out of money. The number of characters in this movie is very high. This is the good thing that casters go out because it's a career killer. It's good for anyone not seeing it. No one is as important as future investors. It ended up in a thousand ways, but I think it's cheated from my precious time. <br /> Do not get this trouble, return.
