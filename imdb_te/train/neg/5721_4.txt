I'm not a fan of the "Hostel" hit 2005 Gore Fest, and this lame ass knock-offs are either bad or worse - and "live feed" for me the first 30 minutes. There are a few good mortal scenes with the China Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot, leather booter, followed by a lot of sexy and inadequate settings ... This film kills me as the hardest hero to hit guns and daytime ... I call this movie mediocre , Sexy porno, which is double as a secret base in Mania Participating durbhasaladabadina iyetarlo mainly young people, I will be out of favor. If only the violence is long enough to be fully efficient enough, then my rating will be very different. Unfortunately, the most insidious one is in the scene, the rest of the film ended in daytime-type scenario. So, basically, it is almost stable during the first half of the film, with a low-budget "hostel" with unpleasant sexual use ... I'm not bothered about this overall.
