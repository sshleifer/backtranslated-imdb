This film is a self-determination. Watch this movie if you just want to listen to a spoken Gaelic or enjoy a pleasant soundtrack. Look for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be beautiful but not - it's just irritating. Character care and performance of the characters is difficult. The stories in the film are also innocent and evil. I look forward to a heartfelt family but it also did not appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. <br /> <br /> While the film is set in the present time, it has the look and feel of the cheap eastern film. European film made during the Cold War. Beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography is not enough to redeem. This is a real shame because the film is in trouble for Scotland.
