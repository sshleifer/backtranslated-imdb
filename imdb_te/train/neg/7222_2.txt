I had to watch this movie for some time, knowing about the comics of Mike Bilal. I thought it was a good way for the artist to expand the art and ideas of a wide audience of the child. I also thought it was a good movie I was recommending, I thought I was enjoying it ... I was wrong! The movie is a real torture to see. The idea has the probability ... But, the film leaves a lot of things to go, and basically everyone who sees the film has the impression that he can do well. I do not make a suggestion whether you watch this movie or not. If you've read these pages you've already seen or are likely to be going to see you - but very bad 102 minutes are made.
