Really one of the most horrific films I've ever been. I have never really taken the time to write one of these, but after watching this innocent to pick up the film I will be stressed and waste my time on the unpleasant soil to be honest. I was very angry with their complete coincidence and lack of meaning. (Eg when police shoot people with infectious diseases? Can hospitals fail to cure such individuals from time to time? He kills his wife on his bed and kills a gun while driving his bed in his dressing gown). Also, the characters - as we almost came to expect in such films - eg the blonde - I do not remember his frickin name and do not give toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and left her) and I wanted them all to meet the gorgeous ends! There is nothing to write home about the product scary confusing and cinematography.
