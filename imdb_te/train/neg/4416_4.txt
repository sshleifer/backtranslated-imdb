A dark shadow is near the end of the miniature movement that is less than the Catholic Church's beliefs and teachings. In the show, Dark Humor plays a medium where the question is most commonly asked, especially if "God is good, why would evil put in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is surprised in her role as an exaggerated version of the religious teacher condemning half the world for hiding the "company line" and burning it in hell. <br /> <br /> However, when Quartet "Update" is the nickname for the "fraudulent" teachings of their play parody, she invites her first students to celebrate her school's 25th anniversary. In the chaos of unsatisfied events, the story surrendered to the edge. <br /> <br /> In the end, they finally got out of the audience with a feeling of sickness in their hearts. See the play instead.
