Crater Lake monster is one of the most awful, enthusiastic movies I've ever seen - menos, poor acting, useful direction, and kindergarten-level product values ​​ranks right with Hands of Fate. The film wakes up after a silly-looking climation / stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a touch of a lake in Melbourne's Bumblebebom CA, and begins to dining on the local grass. In an unexpected climax, the creature, described as a local "bigger alligator with flipper", sinks a bulldozer twice and it becomes bored. Each character in Mohooy is a complete moron. A pointless subplate shows a turn to buy a $ 4.75 pipeline for a liquor shop; Instead of buying a bottle, the idiot cashier and another spectator shoot at a cap, chasing the lake, so that he can eat the monster. The unfortunate conclusions of the monster is nothing more than a piece of steroform. A fraudulent magician is a fraudulent British voice (he may feel more legitimate), two over-bumble red neck tenants, some cheesy "pre-historic cave art" in the Crayon, and the annoying banjo-pikin background mugs. In a painful scene, the fake magician and his daddy's wife / girlfriend / partner film do not know the stars that can be seen in the sky at night, although it is obviously a day, manage to paddle over an extra 4 minutes. Continuously moving forward, this hurts Movi, and hurts the evil. MooCow says fumigators call, 'cause this sticks really stinks on the cow! : = 8P
