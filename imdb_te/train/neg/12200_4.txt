Generally, any film with Sylvester Stallone usually kills the donkey. Rambo: First blood type II is no exception. Sylvester Stallone is only Rocky and First Blood in good films. This film is extreamly unrealistic, and boring. It's action, but it's not very good action. I am not enjoying watching, and I can never see it again. Wonder why it won the Razzie Award for the worst movie. I gave this 3/10, which has three reasons, because it has some good action, but not good.
