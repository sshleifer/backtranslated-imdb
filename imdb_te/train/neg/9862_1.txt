I can not believe when I put this DVD on my DVD player. Half of my life since I played D & D, I thought I had a good laugh. <br /> <br /> "I'm waking up with the worst I've ever encountered. <br /> <br /> Then I'm done, and the soft core gay clown begins. </ P> <p> Real D & D should not be able to use their game, but their name should be attached to them. expect?
