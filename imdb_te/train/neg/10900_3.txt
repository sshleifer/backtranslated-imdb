You know that it's been done within four days, you can not hold too much, and I think it is campie anyway. (Really is not campy, except Kevin Calisher and Huntley Ritter, if you do not take them seriously, the rest of the cast is halfway, Riley Smith is unusually bad.) The funniest story is actually paid attention, what kind of shock I was shocked; These ultra-low-budget horror films do not cater to the lowest sexual fiction stories and do not cure the story with the whole intention, but they use a lot of words like "technology" and "physicality" in the script throughout their point. (Even if some of the cast members explain why the story is important), no one cares about this stupid storyline, and what's interesting in the film is fables and soft-core homorotisms (all of which are not experimental). I have more happiness if there are some random murders without any reason. The film features TV-quality design and performance level. There are some "sexy" scenes that are alright - guys are twisting in bed in their boxers, feeling themselves; Or picked them down to tide down and making wine orgasmic faces - and some of them are so funny. And I liked the dagger at L. Ron Hubbard and liked the irony of a story about religious culture serious gay references, but still not any good. 3/10
