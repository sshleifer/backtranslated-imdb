As a true Elvis fan, the whole block of the film and the script is a disaster. The film starts with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and offers a view of the Grand Canyon scenery something spectacular. Elvis gets in the film and wastes big time in his talent, especially on remaining songs. I sit through this film twice, make sure it's wasteful !!! 10 out of 1 !!!
