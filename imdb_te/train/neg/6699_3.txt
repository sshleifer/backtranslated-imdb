"Algie, The Miner" is a bad and incompetent quiet comedy. Slapstick timing will be stalled. This is kind of humor with some scenes to make you wonder how they're supposed to be funny or not. However, the original quality of the film is irrelevant. This is one of the earliest examples of homosexuality because it is essential for movie buffs. Algeji's main character was a beginner, starring as the casual "Pancie" casual in many early films. The film has a gay attitude during the time. "Algie, the Miner" is pretty terrible, but it's lovely from the historical perspective. (3/10)
