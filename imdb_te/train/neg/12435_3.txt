Alex D. Linz replaced McKulley Kulkin in the lead role in the third film of Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies carry a missile navigation system computer chip and transport it illegally through a remote controlled toy car. The baggage is confusing, Mrs. Hess (Marion Seleses) gets the car. She gives her neighbors Alex (lynz) before the spies stop. Spies rent a house to loot each house in neighborhoods until they discover the car. Alone with a chicken pox home, Alex 911 every time he stolen, but spies always try to escape the police, but Alex is facing charges of sharp calls. The spies are ultimately refusing to pay attention to Alex, who does not know that he owns his entire home with the intentionally burning devices. Alone 3 home is not terrible, but probably should not, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 features some comic parts, but I do not like when the characters change in a movie series, to view the own risk.
