I enjoy quality crapness, and some of these outstanding ones are up there. Sig is out of this world, or at least our world is in advance, and the people chase a 6 foot smoke in rats, then people are laughing. I enjoyed some of this too, but acting was goddamn awful, and even the fate nude scene was not really out of any BAPS. If I see it once, time is totally ruined. I do not know who wasted much time, I saw this, or poor saps who dragged into making it tedious in the hope that they will start their acting careers. I can assure you, it's okay. However, in a bright note, I successfully managed to make Kevin Bacon's 6 degrees out of this film, so I think it's worth watching almost 91 minutes.
