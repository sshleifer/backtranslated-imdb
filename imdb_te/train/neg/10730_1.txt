The movie bar starts with 3 people who meet each other. As well. They are lying all the time and talking about their imaginary lives, for no reason. More correctly. From time to time, they also make you laugh. Interesting. First 30 minutes you really enjoy! But ... things have become worse ... nothing has happened ... for a long time ... And then, when something happens, all the old "women" you can see have touched each other! Not right. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be on top of the image, but it is everything except! There is no point in the film, it's boring and ill! <br /> <br /> Here is the Fès (Belgrade, Serbia) at the Fès (Belgrade, Serbia), which is very popular among researchers, before seeing people in front! I also saw (before looking): "Hey, this is a Russian movie even though it's an interesting movie"! But, God, no!
