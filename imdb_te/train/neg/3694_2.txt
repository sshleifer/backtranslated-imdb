Rajnikanth's reputation for the worst films has never been so far. The first episode takes place from a great comedy from Gundamani, but it is gradually worse and worse and completely untrue. Our hero also digs at the same name (Baba) saints. The first half uses Rajani to use ordinary dancers and style, and in the second sense, a beggar is taking him to the Himalayas through the portals, while Babaji (not the famous saints he dug before) have no special powers (except karma). Is it really interesting to start now? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting politicians and related magic. The usual predictable garbage with a happy execution. Oh and magic did not work on our hero, because he was just a veteran ... earth ... He was with him with energy sakra. <br /> <br /> Bad boys and ordinary political villains are strange, complete, and ultimately, the plot that never goes anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, a liner with Baba during open air shows. It's also fun to see others curse about this movie. AR Rahman is said to have composed tracks for his film through cell phone. <br /> <br /> Rajani is very popular in Japan. There are two characters in Japan (why are they called Caico? Why is not Samsung?) For that. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is utterly tragic. Japanese Rajani movies can be seen and stopped. The film is likely to have publicity in Rajinikanth's politics, but the results of the film have been killed in his political dreams. </ P>
