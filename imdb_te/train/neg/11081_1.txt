While the thought of escaping from Atlantis is totally awkward, this film is much smaller than I did when I read the film. Perhaps I have a lot of kids in technology: it is now officially official by 2002, officially five years ago - star wars like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, <br /> My beef, mainly, I can not say - I'm at the same age children (a young man), and if the character is available a middle-aged man does not put me in place Hours. But the film did not take me to a different mental ground. I'm not saying ACK! I will do the same! "This did not open the doors to my imagination. Without comparing high-budget movies or other TV movies, I found some of the features of the stand alone stand-alone: ​​the development of children in the development of the story was very fast to my taste, a stereotypical self-devoured youngster-a big-happy-family-let's-your-end-wear -And-again-feel again, or eventually make an image in the end May break down. Even the characters were able to develop themselves: one or other stereotypes are a simple set. The most selfish beauty of the time is the rebellious, mixing Mr. Athletics's Perfect Image, looks good and intelligence and brooding attitude, and finally the smart-aleck little brother who looks casual nowadays.

Do not get me wrong: All movies are worth watching for you, and an opinion is never going to be a lot of opinions, but I'm just a little more depth of the script and more (I can not believe I'm sure the escape from Atlantis is magical.
