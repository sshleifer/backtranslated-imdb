It's very sad to have Lucian Pinteli movies made. They are every time worse. Nicky and Flow (2003) is a daunting move in the camera. Many of the images produced annually in Romania are unfortunate, most likely to be sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). The film is a waste of time and money without the plot, acting or script. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
