I bought this movie and four other garbage horror flicks (including its sequel "Witchcraft XI") with a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks in my local Suncost. So basically, I paid the price below $ 2.50 for this film. I can not say right. I have a thing for worst horror movies, but this rubbish kind of worse makes it worse. The budget is not more than $ 1,000 (if they seem to have spent a total of $ 1.50). I know a low budget movie, but it does not need a completely unimpressive camera. The film "Blood Cult," is not very good, is made for a very low budget and still has a very good camera and acting. Acting in the film is defined as "effortless", especially from the muscular person with Texas accent. Everyone read their lines pretty much from the page. You can take that cautiously or literally. I'm not surprised when they display the script off-camera. I said before I had never seen a bad English actor. This film has very bad ones. Although English films are not always good, they always have at least one level of voice, because why the Englishman, or Englishman, volunteers to do things like a home-video-style slack flick. Did Merchant Ivory hold onto their casting calls? Generally, I think people are very hard for directors and actors. Some of the worst films in Hollywood are also directed, acting and cinematography. It's not true when you see a movie like "Glitter", and the scenes shot in the third scene (even if the third-grader script is written). I've seen better films shot better than "Witchcraft X" and it's no exaggeration. Gore is also less likely because filmmakers have money to buy some fake blood in party city. The film did not make a single effort in the production of the film - to sum up that amount. You will get a picture. Nudity is a good deal, although it does not save. However, I want to tell the girl with red-orange hair, wearing naked or a split-popping outfit across the film is really hot! <br /> My score: 1 (from 10)
