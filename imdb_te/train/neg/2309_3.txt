I have a high tolerance for weird, but obviously some way to go beyond the way of movies, weird - so far they make your brain hurt. It is such a film. It's not even impossible to understand or explain it and when I take medicines this film is better understood - it is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with some cute Japanese animations related to the cat. However, tones of blue, twisted and occasional undesirable things occur - I'm surprised that I'm losing something in translation. However, if this is so, we do not need to treat the images of a magic trick, dismembering with a brilliant, defecation, puking, lighting animals, etc. A woman. All this really seemed random and pretty awful. Unusual, and why I do not know, some see it as the intellectual's work. I can not get it.
