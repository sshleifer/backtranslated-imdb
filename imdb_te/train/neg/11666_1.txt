I believe that as long as I can, this film is wasting time. I did not find others doing the 'warm, emotionally satisfying' film. I found it boring, with music that was distracted from the movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a few more about this film, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Young teen finds a curious kid newborn talent, aging, angry mentor but father cartoon homophobia. Aging, embittered teacher will drink a lot and teach very little. The conflict arises. I do not think this is a spoiler, but I added a warning when I think this information is too high. <br /> <br /> Most likely, I am boring and progressive. Waste my time. Honestly, the image quality of the film seems to be on this website. I think it's really valuable to escape. But, as Dennis Miller says, "I'm wrong."
