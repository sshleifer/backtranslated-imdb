By searching for more and less images for this movie, I actually found myself at least expecting me to play in the morning on Sundance Channel one morning. I searched for Chuck Baris's short project for the last decade of the TV program and did not clue me. The picture is just terrible. Written portion of one week deal. In fact the theme of the film is looking at real performers as "too hot for the TV" or for some reason or denial. That part is still awful, but Camping Bad is enjoying it in its own way. Now I have long seen what I have wanted for a long time in my lifetime. Far away !! Do yourself a favor and see only the very good "Dangerous Mind Confessions" or old copies of the original show. The action of a girl who just laughs at PepsiCook was fun, but the audience who have seen Jay P. Morgan's flash are likely to have a probability. Congratulations, I'm happy that this was a huge success, because if it was a huge success, "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and my friends definitely took him on the Apocalypse. <br /> My grade: D
