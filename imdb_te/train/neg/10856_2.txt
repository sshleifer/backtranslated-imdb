Just look, I do not lie to you, but I just got a $ 3.99 friend for this film because it is Denny Filth, the lead singer of the famous Popular Death Metal Band's lead singer "Filth Hooda". <br /> <br /> But, beloved of God, I'm wrong. The film was badly bad, big time. Low budget movie (if hah, wait, ZERO BUDGET), this is clearly not the beautiful Howard Stern Orchestra music scores and Spielberg Special Effects. <br /> <br /> Take the example when our star and violent confrontation, Mr Filth, violently killed a mugger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> My final comment: Get away from it. It is also an unstable story to go with blood, gore, breasts, and hey. So if you do not like harassment, no voices (yes, any words in this picture are rare), then buy it. But if shady movies are not your thing, avoid it. Do not waste your money.
