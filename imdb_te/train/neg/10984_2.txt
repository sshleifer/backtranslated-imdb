I saw this movie for two hours and I'm not sure about it. Maybe someone got killed or perhaps they were not and maybe someone may or may not be they. It brought back good memories of good old days (bad old days?) When all the good CBC Canadian films stinkers. Recently stinkers are exceptional but this confusion of sophisticated feminism makes Hudge podge, mumbled mumbled losing mind of the flash spine and the lost time. I have never read Margaret Atwood's books easily. The film is a good Canadian tradition. It's not easy to see. Chi chi Chicago Toronto Cocktail parties pretend to be the most sophisticated. Folks in us boonies are slightly less pretentious.
