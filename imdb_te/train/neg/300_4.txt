Robert Taylor is certainly a good dramatic actor in the role of a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in the west of 1956. This is one of the few times Taylor has done heavily in a film. However, the film is very far from far away, and Taylor fled to television with the hit series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British voice and made a great appearance as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is big here and really shows his hatred for Indians. <br /> <br /> Another good actress here is aged by older actor Lloyd Nolan, the old timer of drinking and the hunt for the bull. In his opening sequences, Nilon really took the takeoff of Walter Houston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Notice the look of Russ Tamblin in this film. The following year, Tambolin and Nolan joined the extraordinary Peeton Place. <br /> <br /> Write down in the picture is good. At the end of the film, it's the nature of Taylor's nature. What are the elements of the work here?
