It's hard to believe that the film from this book could not succeed its terrific topping! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . She left her pain and started tons of guilt on a small child! Then we have at least six and more (including religious leaders) infiltrators. We later have a wife in the ferry ride lengthy, which is a little cheerful than kicking on tracks. Very unpleasant and co-ko ka ma, help, with the help of friends and politically correct group of friends! This setting was not helped by the story moving from an island in the South Carolina coast, but it helped the filmmakers' budget. The monastery of the most beautiful buildings did not seem logically as a small island required for golfcrafts and such a small boat service. Kim Baziqar, which I really like in this film, is very thin in the film and her hairstyle will be in another decade. There is no chemistry between her and male. I did not like this book, but I did not read it. When I had surfing back and forth, I had to leave when the saccharine got a lot of music. If you do not like an unbelievable story, the idea of ​​woodworking, a contradictory mix of religious / mythical / admiration is to skip this advice. Oh and maybe a little satirical criticism, but a caring dad can not have a little boy a little jacket with a small boat? The best part of the film is the scene
