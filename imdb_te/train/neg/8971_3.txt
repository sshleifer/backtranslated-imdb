After the release of Cube 2: Hyper Cube (2003), and after the success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbar√°r trio took the third installment in the prequel cube Zero. <br /> <br /> A bigger And an inferior company, time and location, two low-level operators, placed in the giant network of cubic gamblers deep in the intestines of Win (Zachary Bennett) and Dad (David Hubband), some of which break in the net. Hearing these horrific and deadly tests on fatal injuries can be found guilty that these observers do not have any problems with their jobs, a mathematical intellectual finds a woman named Cassandra, Stephanie Moore, who is not in the cube. Suddenly it probably did not seem to be their "jobs", and they realized that they were deeply unhealthy and distorted ... <br /> <br /> The prequel to the people who have seen and enjoyed the original cube is probably not to your liking. This is not the story; This is not the first cube film ever to be expanded. Standing alone, it's a pretty little psychological thriller that's very interesting about the most interesting concepts and its own message. It is also well self-contained. <br /> <br /> The problem with Cube Zero is that the actual original Mistake will be destroyed, and if you are trying to answer questions with questions, it's really confusing for the needed fixing. <br /> There are questions about the psychological nature of totalitarianism and the harmony of the evil, the good questions to be sure of, but perhaps on their own merits, these aspirations. <br /> <br /> Other traits such as acting, directing, and writing are not terrible. The film has a bleak, dark look compared to the movie Norris, such as the film 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they certainly have been able to regain the first Cube's Claustrophobia feeling. Unfortunately for barbarash, there are no positive qualities to protect them.
