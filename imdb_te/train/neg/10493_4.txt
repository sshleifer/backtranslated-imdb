A complicated picture to classify. I was not giving 110% concentration & so simple as the plot seemed to be unable to tell what I'm doing between what American american FBI characters are & what their roles are. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's anything more than a glorious episode of Discovery TV. The show, going on with a largely remaining sub plot, just got it. While no Irvine show is always worth the watch, the film is well-documented, but not Christmas. <br /> <br /> If so, I have done a lot better than to speak here. <br /> Most 4/10
