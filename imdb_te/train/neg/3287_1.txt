To change this film, it is "The Jacqueses of Hazzard." For all this, the film is not 88-year-old immature pigs, enjoying the famous 1968 Dodge Charger in town and across the country, chasing girls and spending law. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the "Dukes" and the characters that you appreciate the movie are not crucial. <br /> <br /> It changed the good name of Dubai to the trailer. <br /> <br /> Compared to the television program, acting is terrible. It is the only actor with the right actor, named after the 1969 Dodge Charger General Lee. <br /> <br /> "Dukes" is another disaster for 21-st century Hollywood Television-to-Big Screen Transition Tragedy. Skip the film and buy television series on DVD. <br /> My grade: F
