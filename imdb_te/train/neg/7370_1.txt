<br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of Seagull movies, and not too great, or even better, this steamy pile lowers bad movies bar <br /> <br /> Plots: Definitely not. Something about a medicine that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is cut to go back into the dark rooms to complain about how good the seagull character "mashal" is. <br /> Acting: Blows. <br /> <br /> Do you find anyone who can hear anyone like Seagal? Chech or Chong Voice Overs, then at least entertaining. <br /> <br / > This film is boring and totally stupid to avoid it at all costs !!!!
