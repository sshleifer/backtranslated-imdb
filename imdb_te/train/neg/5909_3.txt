The initial 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved to be the only good idea for the rest of the movie. The absolute lowest common denominator humor. Painful view. Complete task. Less than a week, no doubt. Give the mayors hook and lock him with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. Do not allow him to get out until he develops something good, a good script for anything. He has it for him. These Austin Powers are troublesome. <br /> <br /> Do not drown without Goldmember trace.
