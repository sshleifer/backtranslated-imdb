I do not know about you, but I have always attracted ART. Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" was filmed as the first art I caught, exploding it as my mind and creative spirit overdrive. The film is the ultimate paradox, beautiful and grotesque ... what is the 'art cinema', the intellectual ideas exploring and bringing the blast to the advantage. Life, Real Life, lives in a Magda House and shows the art of what it expresses. <br /> <br /> "I'm 8/2 Women", is a powder, I love all kinds of movies, but most importantly both have fun and say something, the name of clinical 'comedy' is a father and son to disturb their many sexual fantasies A harem was collected. The filly has a very small description, as suggested by Fillyini. The main focus of the film 'close relationship' between father and son is after the death of mothers. Father's regret in the opening sequences of the movie is reliable, you can experience his pain. Greenway Standards, Harem Collection, Observation on Love and Death, and Meat performed for meat ... It can be argued, but this film does not mean, as it does. And I'm worried that I feel this comedy. For the most part acting is good, ... especially the good Polly Walker and the Amanda Plummer (while the poor Mandy is forced to put his clothes back) is a compelling story of the film, and the most common Greenway Collision's other films are amazing. <br /> <br /> When moments of insight, and occasionally forbidden, "8 1/2 women" cut and cut a lot to consider art, are considered 'funny', and very lame <br /> <br /> Save money ... I can recommend this film to help you sleep. <br /> <br />
