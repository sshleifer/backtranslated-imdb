Many people agree, Origin is a beautiful actress artistically. The music created by the graphics, and the world is gorgeous and it really is on top of other modern animated tasks. However, if you're looking at more than this, I'd like to see where else I go. Beauty ceases its appearance and there is nothing special when it really comes down to the plot and the characters. The action is slow and low, and people are flat at times, cool at times and do not work realistically. Not to mention the plot hole and the plot hole there ... So, the essence, Oh my goodness, I never saw this a beautiful anime; And oh my goodness is like this ... -Pock-people do not do that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps back to bad classification times, and unfortunately, there is not much action to do for that ...
