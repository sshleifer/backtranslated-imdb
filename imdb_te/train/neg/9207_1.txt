The film was sold to a dollar in a Wall on a DVD and I think I would miss anything to watch this movie except my TIME. Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling) enjoyed acting, was the youngest he was looking for, and gave it an outstanding performance as a horrible script. The story is about college students who just decided to play the game mazes & monsters, in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has had problems playing this game at other colleges in the past and suggests that his parents leave the game alone and get good qualities. Robbie meets a very good gas and is in a romantic quest and when he starts playing, he catches her and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the area around the World Trade Center and the observation floor and the roof area. It is sad to see this part of many people dead movie due to the evil of the world. Unlike Tom Hanks, who is trying to keep the film on the sinking entertainment level, this is not a very good movie.
