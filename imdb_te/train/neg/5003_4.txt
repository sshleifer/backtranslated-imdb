I was not embarrassed to write this review. Because I read it because you read it, I know I'm sitting through the whole thing and I'm also struggling to admit to strangers. But I had to alert readers of the viewer's comments on IMDb before they see that the film should not be seen. This is what I can do. It's a bad image! Trust me Plot goofy. Acting is enthusiastic. Direction, camera work, sets, costumes etc. All second rate. Let it go.
