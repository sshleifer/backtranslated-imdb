Wow ... where to start ... In Big Lots it was selected for just $ 2.99. I never see it again ... anytime ... and who has three bucks? I say to myself. The boring, boring, boring chat and college anangist's hour and fifteen minutes seemed more favorable for Lifetime movie than a horror flick promoting the box. (Design marketing droids which permanently burn in hell for all). Cheap gore (not even good gore you mind ...) and comes out of nowhere, and follow those up with a plot twist that makes no sense. Awful, awful, awful ... <br /> Do you have any ransom? Well, at the Joe Bob Briggs, there were six breasts, but my long lost three bucks were rare. Without that, this coulda science fiction at say two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
