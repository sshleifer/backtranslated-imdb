This film is now compared to my gauge, all other movies ... as in, "Is it stupid as revolver?" I also went to the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night with a room full of more than 2000 people quietly after 2 hours completely silly silence. Jason Stratham would have been wonderful if he had only one purpose. In the first 10 minutes he gave the Andrei 3000 and Big Pussy (for the fame of Soprano), which makes NO SENSE ALL! Then there's some shooting and then there's some animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, shooting lots, teeth, wah, and elicited laugh at every show that's more of Leo's awkward body .. I'm not sure I'm looking at 5 times anyway. Everyone in the film is smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he is an incarnation of Yogi Bear. The story lines may have gone somewhere but the postures are not visible! If Madonna is in her, the film might be worse.
