Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of the pictures by the end of the story takes place in the 60s Now his resistance warriors have been transferred to the South American hills, with enough food and water and tensions between the groups have increased. When he crosses the border in Bolivia he heads up and the government forces will speed up their campaign to bring him forward. <br /> <br /> Without spending between the time and places of the final film, Soderbergh's second installment is fully focused on the action of the hills, and maintains an even duller experience. And the more pretentiously, the score is drowned, giving the second postponement proven as an unwelcome breeze giving more artificial wind. There was only one breeze in the film that was released forever. Soderbergh's ambition in the main character or Dell Toro's drive is not a mistake, it's just a shame that you have managed to take such a disappointing turn somewhere in the things generated. **
