<br /> <br /> When I was released in 1958, I'm sure it is appropriate for its time. The films were slow to allow viewers to follow and analyze the story. Where a man moves to his last wife's house, secretly deceased with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (who also played Alex Nicole, who also directed the film) is really an underappreciated character. He gets a skull that indirectly warns Jenni that she is in trouble because he knows he is playing foul in the first wife's death. Jenny could not tell directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with the skull. Jenny, we also find, her parents die, and thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that can lead to institutionalization. Today I like many audiences and my tastes are very slow. <br /> <br /> If you want a slow-looking horror without gore, this image is for you. <br /> <br />
