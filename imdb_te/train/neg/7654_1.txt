When I got it, I read all the terrible, terrible reviews for this film. I mean how to go look terribly but ended up in theaters in three weeks. Gigli is the only other film to handle. <br /> <br /> When the movie is on DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it is. I can not imagine a slightly awful look at this film. After seeing it I can understand it. <br /> <br /> First movie, this film is not without some cool shots. There was a nice shot at the start that showed a bullet that was removed from the gun inside, and I felt better. And in this film the monsters die very good. But after seeing the first time it is old. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the most unfortunate incident in this film: Tara Reed. If bad acting is a sin, then hell will chuck her Tara Reed because she is not so unbelievable in this movie, it can not be imagined. And all the characters, she plays a curator. Now if she plays a dumb and a girl sex toy, I can forgive her how to play her role. Even if the film was removed from the shirt, people felt that Uwe Boll did not recognize it. He just does not realize that making the film just doing the middle of the film at exactly the wrong moment just made the movie more ridiculous. And during a Mexican song or something dry humping scene? I can not say. <br /> This brings me to my next complaint: Yuvi boll will show you the worst directorial skills in the movie. I mean, I want to give the House of the Dead a fair (and I'll do it for a lot of movies) but the head is scored at least B as compared to this screw-up junk off. The film will be confusing soon after confusion (and read a terrible storyteller) and from there, the cuts are really muted. Slater and Reed are surrounded by a destroyed building and a point where the screen is out. When it came back, Slater and Reid fired everywhere, suddenly, the whole army reached them. Huh? <br /> <br /> There is no problem in checking the errors in the film. At one point, the band is broken down by glass, but before the glass breaks touch. Tara Reed's earrings changed colors in the middle of a scene, and after slaughter walked out of a dead mate, you could see her get up. <br /> <br /> For the story ... I really missed it. Darkness and release something "old way" or something and something about pop out all the evil demons. It is quite necessary to have boring guns (the technology is not very sophisticated, the film never needs to be restarted). <br /> <br /> "I'm not laughing, but I think it's still stupid, very, very stupid.
