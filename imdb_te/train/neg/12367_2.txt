Looney Tunes entered the future two times (at least). The first time with the brilliantly funny "Duck Dodgers". Next time is this ?? Um ?? Effort. "Lonatics Unleashed" is not without merit, and it can be considered a good product that does not belong to Warner Bros. quality. WB cartoons are known for their cheeky humor, and are more attractive to children as adults. <br /> <br /> There are six common people in this series (2 Bunnies, a Tasmanian Devil, a Duck, a Dancing, Roadrunner, and Coyote), who live in Achmitrossis in "City-Graham" and buy Super Powers when the planet hit 2772 . From the 21st century to 2772 these individuals were in the titles section up to 2772. <br /> In each episode, Super Sextat ?? Fun in the entertaining but especially in the midst of a simple joke? Fight different super villains. For the most part, they appear in every ordinary superhero adventure series and some of the better ones. Like many ordinary superhero series, in this case its villains take the most serious. And of course these guys laugh only those characters? Simple naughty laughter, of course. Why the superhero adventures of the predictable superhero why? Always ?? Are you smiling badly for every opportunity? These types of animated materials abstain from villains and (occasionally) in their Henchiple and / or Hennhatthings, especially laughter. <br /> <br /> In this order, you go. The superpowers of the characters sometimes rely on their previous general abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough WB looniness. Lex and Ace have very biological biased energy weapons, and are actually characteristic personality that can not be described as "bugs-like". What we're doing here is basically and bitterly "Teen Titans", with its overly "modern" animation "Look", but with animals. <br /> <br /> Other mistakes made by the creators of the program are villains (or). As mentioned earlier, these are not very imaginative and make the bad-laugh bit more. Amazingly, the writers have been completely lost with the clear technology of staging WB characters and villains from the main characters. Jupiter Sam may have been telling fun? The Fudded, and the Webboot Hunting? TechEye as well. Are Caite a really nervous villain converted? And so on. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this whole product has gone into overtime (ie 2nd season). However, we can be glad that 14 people go to the 9 and have a new one there. Duck Dodgers for the rest of us can hope for a 3rd season.
