Setting up an interesting premise for the alien I was looking at it on a PS2 so I did not come up with how long it took for 20 minutes or so. I do not think I've seen a slasher image of an alien from another planet bad before. However, when the 'alien' is a massive body-builder woman in a steel bikini, the interest becomes surprising soon. Yes, the alien was perfectly ridiculous. <br /> I do not think I was caught on it. In the shock-horror world, poorly humorous often can be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of its predecessor is really going on for it. Elevator is as funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest in the highest order. Actors' composition on unsuccessful attempts in intensity, with the powerful intellectual intellect of the pure cheese dialogue, is misleading and fails to provide one or two good set-pieces in the direction. <br /> <br /> When you finish the film you can not see the whole concept of the whole tripe of Haystack. <br /> <br /> 'Alien' just kills people through steam, as opposed to doing any 'slash' and is a big throbbing heap with good ideas that you leave to rot. You laugh at the Elimerer, but AT it is not. Go ahead and check it if that's your thing.
