Let me start by saying that I am a big fancier fan. However, this film is not for me. Far distance arguments are trying to make the film's claim that the dragons are not likely to exist. The film claimed connections in different stories from different countries, but failed to fully investigate them, which gave some reliability. The film (nice!) CGI uses a narrative fantasy story telling us in the life of a young dragon. It's not as good as it combines the popular TV-show-CSI-style flash-forwards, making it scientific. In most cases the arguments / sources are far removed. In some instances, dragons are likely to exist or fly down or spit fire is just invalid. I'll have to whip my head to see it. Even with a fantasy movie it needs some reality, but this is just not it. Bottom Line: It's not a worth watching, it's a pretentious fantasy CSI documentary.
