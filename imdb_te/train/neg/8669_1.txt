First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. This is the kind of horror that you get under your skin and sticks. It is one of his best books, you know, fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine. I hoped the film would be fine. It has many opportunities for great actors like Jason Roberts and Jonathan Pryce. And Bradbury also wrote the script himself. <br /> <br /> Previously, it was closed down. The horror from the book has been lost since Bradbury was forced to keep the violence at minimum. All the visuals from the book ... gone. <br /> Then there is acting. Like Disney's thin films in the 80s, children in the film can not work. And, this bugged me a lot, no one of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. Not addressing their strong friendship. This is because they are so popular. <br /> <br /> You may think Jason Roberts and Jonathan Pryce will be able to remove the show in the role of Mr. Hallowwy and Mr. Dark. But here it is as they just do not care. All they want is something to pay off mortgage or something. It's not some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Palm Grire is as good as a witch, but the Wool's Wear does not take her back completely. She is very bad and does not have the presence that she did in the book. <br /> <br /> Everything that's gone out of the book. Bullen hunted the night, spotted Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, Mr. Coogan on Mr. Go-Row, the fate of the Lightning Rod Salesman, the real death of the witch and the oh so much more. <br /> And special effects are also bad for the 80s. Doom's merry-go-round is not really creepy for a thing with rounded horses, and unnatural green mist that nothing really is anything. <br /> <br /> I continue to think about how the film is getting rid of the original novel, but it raises the blood. Watch this movie but read the book. It's Bradbury's classic.
