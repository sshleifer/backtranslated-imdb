Lolita is a rebel and she shares with her wide open eyes to share some gender stories between science fiction and fantasy ... Well, this surrender film is not very good: very bad acting, horror music and story and no line. But, sex scenes are pretty well done, there are a lot of Lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lowell, beautiful in The Exotic House of Wax, offers us a very good and very hot strip show. For lovelov fans only.
