Nekeddo bur√¢ddo sounded pretty good as horror movies, especially J-horror and even Gore's huge fan base. I researched the plot, read the reviews, saw some photos, and confirmed that it was a good scary and horror film to watch before downloading. So I was disappointed and I'm scared of the terrific gore that I thought I was terribly disappointed and ready to be intimidated. The plot is ridiculous and does not even make sense and leaving a lot unexplained, Gore is rather horrendous, and what is the Cartoon Style Sound Effects? Acting is probably the only thing that's a little scary about it. I did not understand the way Cactus thought and the mothers disappeared in the middle of the ocean after a flashing light of the husband, they left the two pretty unexplained, or my mind did not understand what I was seeing when I missed it. I appreciate what I want; There are definitely shocking and some scenes (strange cannibalism and kissing their own mother), I feel that they are going a little bit of horror, they are more ridiculous than jokes in my opinion than horror. But it's a very entertaining film and a couple of smiles and smiles have come a lot, but sadly we expect a comedy for the entertainment value is not so funny its expectation, but expect a darker, deeper horror and horror movie; You will be disappointed. If this horror comedy / spoof, I would rate about a nine, the climax was a strange sight, the husband reached his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but I gave it one as a horror.
