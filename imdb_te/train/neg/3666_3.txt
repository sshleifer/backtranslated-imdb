This film is very confusing. The picture is very difficult to follow and the plot does not seem to just make any sense. Wolfman's Fury was made in Spain and I did not translate any movie to the first meaning when it translated from one language to another. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but it is suspected that it can account for all the problems with this image. Dubbing is pretty bad and the lyrics are not well matched with the characters. The scenes are choppy, the viewer has an array of weird and irrelevant characters that make little more than kangaroo. I like the film and look at the scenes of Wolf Man and his attacks. Now that they have all combined, if it has some sense, they may have something. Do not waste your time at this time.
