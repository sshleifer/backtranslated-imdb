The paint was not needed to get out of the house when it was drying - the picture was dropped after an hour after the paint was recovered. Really tried to stay. The script is not up to cast and just keep going "going and going" badly! Is Uma Thurman doing this thing? Very sluggish special effects. <br /> <br /> This review is the foundation of the first hour - it's fine. I felt a darker shade than when I went home.
