A bloody maniac raises a woman with cannibalism. He was shot and killed by two policemen, and he rose from the tomb due to the devil's ritualistic ceremony, which was accompanied by a bad faith. Women's hunt continues through this zombie-ghost. <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... horny zombies, toy infants, S & M, corrupted and twisted policemen , Eventually repented by the desire to seek refuge in Jesus Christ before and finally what happened to the three surviving police screens To explain (yes, we know!) ... two good shots to save the situation is not twisted. I've seen the worst horror-flicks, but this is pretty much bad. Only recommended for die-hard-hard fans of the genre.
