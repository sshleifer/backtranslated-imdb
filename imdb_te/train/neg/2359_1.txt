It's the last Freddie movie (and it's over 10 years old) - you think you're trying to make a good movie. But they turned out to give us the worst of the series (and was saying so much). The plot is not in any sense (I can not remember it), all the major characters were idiots (you wanted them to die) and Freddie's perceptions were worse than usual. <br /> <br /> The longest bit ever since it was the Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare" film) and the short (and funny) comio. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was in the 3rd part of the theater (reckoning Fredery's childhood). Well - 3-D lousy - portrayed in degraded colors and vision. Scary (I feel) My three flying skulls have a negative reaction from my audience. Everyone broke laughing. It looks worse on TV in 2-D. Meaning and stupid - very lame. Repeat this and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
