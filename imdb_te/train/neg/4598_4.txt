In London, a stage producer's wife treats her closest to the American song-and-dance man who introduced herself to her husband's latest show. Unfortunately, the couple met on their own, the guy thinking of the girl is actually the show performer of her friend (the fact that she should not be wearing a wedding ring must be discouraging any misunderstandings!). Wuffy Fred Astier-Ginger Rogers Musical finally dragged back to Earth by Dwight Taylor and Allen Scott's idiot script, which was filled with childhood behavior. Astaire and Rogers just do not meet '- they meet ludicrously (he dances top like a madman in her hotel suite and her complaint). Perhaps the audience of 1935 probably did not care how both of them were together - as long as they were, and happy. As it is today, central characters do not have any motivation to come into one's hands: he blinds her with flowers (she wants to be "fancy free" in the love section after telling her friend) and she is brush-off. Nothing could cure a little dance! Like the London and Venice settings, these attractive elegant, but Leeds Fred and Ginger are just as we can see. It's a fantasy for having-nos ... do not mind them plainly flat down. The musical movements break down in contrasted scenes and fail to overcome the ambient silliness. ** from **
