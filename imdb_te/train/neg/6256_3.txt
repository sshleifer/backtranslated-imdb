Hmm ?? I accepted the critic, saying, "strange people have reviewed these pictures." I thought it was enough to see the film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is the slightest psychological disruption of the film, and the other is seriously homosexual. The front and the three thumbs are good down. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this film is intended to spread dialogue or spread and spread. <br /> <br /> I thought acting was normal. There is a lot of talk about reality about 90 degrees of reality. I wanted to get some sense from the plot, but only a conversation with a madman (speech). I feel sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. <br /> <br /> The film is every day in the world for more important reasons than the world's losses. <br /> Does the film reveal the innocence of HIV / AIDS? Yes: the audience's intention. HIV is a dark, mysterious, bad killer? What about the victims? The answer to both questions is NO. HIV or its victims have no more or less negative impact than lupus, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, cancer or their victims. <br /> <br /> This disease is not undesirable or unpleasant - or bad - it's just. <br /> Do you take this unnecessary ignorance or fool-hardy risk? - No. Should all people have sex? - Yes. Safe sex will save the world? - No. Is safe sex true in all cases of love and lust between tension and emotional human beings? ?? Not at all. Following everybody's rules we live in any kind of world, no one ever took risks, and sex is never accidental and passionate ??? How can I forget I'm dealing with homosexuals? ?? Yes. HIV spreads by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and infected individuals. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film's violent kidnapping and captivity of Tom And I thought it was a good job of portraying the absurdity towards Dan, and this kind of frantic violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Why do you dont rather than "what you are doing" "Item: Puru with sexual relations with men "Where are you talking here? Is one of the parties unconscious?" Perhaps she did not like to hear the truth "Are you kidding me?" She was in heaven and unbelievably she was Will i hurt about what i know ?? Don's life if he has HIV? Refused! Why is this whole world homosexual? They think homosexuals are the cause of HIV, who will give them to the rest of the world and die? Are you playing me ??? People really stupid to think that homosexuality is the cause ... What's the problem? Do we think of the victims of tuberculosis? Malaria I can see that Tom will be hurt by the death of his wife, who he reproaches AIDS, but seriously? Who is wrong here? The victim or the virus? Is sickness responsible for illness? <br /> <br /> Sure sexually safe requires sex, but not so-driving, not-flying, not leaving home, not country. Do we really want to blame the victim's disease? Safe Sex between Tom and Don Prevented Tom's Wife's Last Supper? <br /> <br /> Do not be the sole responsibility of Don. <br /> <br /> Don to Dawn: "How did you get that?" Please! 24 Days: Violent, Simplified, and Homosexuality. <br /> Do I overreacting? Maybe. But I think this film will entertain a judgment of gay men for their negligent and nasty intention towards a "straight world" by securing sex safe when it's better than the equivalent or heterosexuals that correspond to the rate of homosexuality that safely achieve sex. We all need to wake up and serious about HIV / AIDS. HIV has killed hundreds of thousands of straight Africans every year.
