Where did I start? I enjoyed this movie and I did it. Still, I wanted to enjoy being another zombie image that was worth my loot, and it was not. This is a different experience. It's unhealthy, I've seen one of the most ridiculous films, which is still visible. And the Foolish's excuses are cautious, and there is no need for this film to be done. It's surrounded by a bad image and I can not give it under 4 in less than 4, which I gave it because at least I'm laughing at a movie this unfortunately. br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you want to be a part of it, <br /> <br /> "The stone arrows, or the limb of the jam-offs of the moving jam-offs, looked to the band, so they were the site for many air forces." Hell, what do you do when you die? I had to laugh at some of the zombies who exhibited art swings, kicks, and jumps. My eyes dinner on a floating head, I dug into a huge dose of land, the Philippines, fog, mist and watched pure fiery pleasure they have ponds like the worst closure of the castle moats.The design for healing for this plague is an accton with lines stretched from every angle I was scared on the chalk chain, and I'm afraid when I see with the "Dead One" written in the middle. <br /> <br /> Diabetes is very easy in Japan, I have a zombie here I wonder if the idea of ​​launching a little something to come up with! The upperboard, dubbed the Harid, I'm absolutely unhappy, the story is absurd, zombies staggering, even in a bad way they are all similar, and women are ugly, but I found myself enjoying this thing. It's a pleasant watch. It turned out to be a bad movie and I do not recommend this thing except for a bad directorial exploitation, but still, I will say it again ... It's a good laugh. No matter what zombie movies, but when it's attached to Fulki's name, it's pretty good. Tell me the courage, Zombie Holocaust is good.
