This film has never been made. Honestly, I must confess that I had some serious questions before I saw it. The director is not a great actress, she has done so many films in Holland, and a TV personality with a steady smile on the face of the lady who has taken the lead role and a very self-criticized. Although I have played the other major role that I recently saw in the bride's flight and although that movie is fine, he does not convince me more than he does. I did not read the novel to start with the story, but the wrong script in this movie is to be able to do with children in the birthday of the afternoon on the evening of the afternoon. The same age as the director who likes to see a good movie. Overdraft conversations were really upset and spoke long out loud. He went to camera for me and at least he tried to do something from it. It is a pity to film lousy editing, if not, some of the scenes are definitely more reliable.
