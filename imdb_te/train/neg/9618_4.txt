Although the film is formulaic with a plot stolen from movies like Friday 13th November / I Last Last Watt, this movie is not that bad. Hollywood's recent release of Hollywood movies is not so bad. The killings are sometimes very imaginative, although in most cases the original. This cast is mediocre, which is anticipated from low-budget features, but is much better than what the larger studio Artisan / Lions Gate is serving. My real complaint, which was not due to the budget of the film, was short, which ended "twist". Sorry, but this film is kept in bad category. The end was just stupid and tacked. Before I was a little bored, but actually enjoying it. 4/10
