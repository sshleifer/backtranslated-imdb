The plot for the descent, originally called a plot, has two important events. One at the start - one at the end. These events can be 5% of the total cinema together. The director was disappointed to be in the midst of everything (and I mean _everything_) in minutes. I like dark films and I like dark movies and I can not get through the sunny scenes - but you hoped for me to sit through the scenes / dark (literally) 60 minutes by another hero. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is totally waste here. <br /> <br /> I do not see anywhere in the NC-17 version. <br /> If you want to go away and see "wealth", instead of a nap - you probably have interesting dreams.
