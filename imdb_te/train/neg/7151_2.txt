I've seen three fast and furious movies. Proud, the plot is very stupid, and they're a little cheesy, but I chased them along, and loved all the beautiful cars and secret midnight races. <br /> Do you know the difference between the three and the redlines? Some of the plot bores, and last but not least, the directors made a clue. All three were well-established directors, all of which were made in a different direction, equally exciting. The producer chose a dozen people sleeping on the casting bed and chose his leadership from extra-Hollywood's unemployment line.Script.Images.It is mysterious science theater 3000 bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, the picture is some cool cars, but you can not really get excited by the action in the action, and do not get excited by the action chases too short of directing, and <br /> <br / > Let's look at the movie in this movie earlier. <br /> <br /> F & F movies rent. Go to NASCAR Race. Go to the karting track and race yourself.Anyway, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
