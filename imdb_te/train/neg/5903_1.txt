I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Because I live in Utah, it is good to see places I know in the film. I'm really not going to get jokes inside so I'm not surprised when I really sit deer in the headlights and that's going to be it. <br /> <br /> I know of a Mormon movie that I gave to members of the LDS Church, but I found it to be dangerous for me. A simple template of people without their faith. <br /> <br /> I think that the film is really pure, and they are Mormons very pure and the rest. <br /> <br /> They do not follow the scriptures of the LDS Church, but I think that there is a state of Utah that has Punk Psychos. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the plot around all the LDS members is moving around, but you're not 100% more than Salt Lake City, even true. <br /> As I said, in the film, the non-Mormons are filmed drunken drunkards, <br /> I'm not in their faith.
