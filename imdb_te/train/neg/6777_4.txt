I recently gave a positive review of OPERATION PETTICOAT, although I do not really like this film even though it is very similar. Both have been stuck for a few years, both played by Carrie Grant and both of WWII comics. However, the whole tone and the style of the films were very different. Even when compared to Operation PETTICOAT - poor writing, low power and some widespread performances - it seemed like the whole Kiss, the whole, just the low picture. I think that casting Jane Mansfield is at least a lot of these lies. She has come up with a 3rd rank studio in the form of this A-Budget film with a mix of ample talent and limited performance. Plus, she does not have too much chemistry or energy to link her to Carrie Grant - an actor usually likes his kindness and class. It's like combining Sir Laurence Oliver with Marjorie Main.
