What about the money we put here and how to make money and how to ruin your soul ... or something like that. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, a returning director in gangster mode, is more likely to chew on this film than chewing. <br /> <br /> The modern filmmaker swallowed his pride, good for his enemy, and given his money and fell on his face to overcome the background of a man who would free himself. When Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Leota, Leota frankly runs enough to kill his head in the final scenes. Why? Basically you can not set up a mafia like Leota's character, perhaps at his station in his station, which is clearly visible throughout the film, only then that he needs to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Whenever I tell you that I am missing the point ... I'm not. Am i right? Stop searching for riches & you will get real happiness and inner peace. Be good with your enemy and it will confuse him self-destruct. The essence of the film feels and the story itself is not worse, it's not the original story. The problem is that Ritchie does not have the expertise to act as a film producer. While Guy Ritchie was also aware of this, he was frustrated with the story and began to introduce red-grown up: when the Statham was broken in a car scene - why? Marvel's funny animations are shooting some scenes ... again, why? <br /> You have a lot of loose threads & unanswered questions about all 2001-Ish and about the final drop in it. Try to trace them or agree that there are no answers & each viewer understands things in their own way. Me? The film I just ignored was frustrated with the pompous tone. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do.
