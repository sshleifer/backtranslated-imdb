I saw this film released and I saw 3 or 4 times including last week. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful, luxurious movie without telling nothing more than 4 hours of prestigious. Beautifully painted and designed. Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Bairrshire, and many others. Then there is Kenneth Branagh. If the actor ever has a proud project, this is nothing, and nothing to keep "ham" in Mr. Branagh Hamlet. From stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance by unfortunate unfortunate Jack Lemmon), the bits of business thrown to stimulate the concept of "naturalness", his own performance, and the most popular freedom in all literature throws in each row of others. Confirms his performance, when he comes out well on stage, he is the greatest film actor ever to need. For the sake of the scenery budget, Mr. Branagh has eaten a lot. His performance is a good example of why Shakespeare is going to see - "The sound and the fury are full, nothing is detected." <br /> <br /> If his director is wrong, the camera stays firmly on his grandiose performance. <br /> <br /> People on Bard are a theatrical author of any theories. The brilliance of his plays rest the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although his plays do not have the "right" way to play, there are definitely great performances, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare gives instructions to players in the "Hamlet" lesson. It surprised me how Mr. Branagh had "dishonored me," but it did not. <br /> <br /> Sri Bragg has done an excellent job of mounting some entertaining productions. , He will be allowed to stay behind the camera and those who know it is art art acting instruments. His direction is always better than his acting. I still give him a great credit to revive interest in Shakespeare's shoot. He set a great template for other productions. And, from 20 platforms he is curious to see the stage. But, I hope he chooses more and chooses less work. <br /> Is it worth seeing? Sure. There are too many joys in this movie. But, it's a long, long film, and ultimately it feels less than what is survival.
