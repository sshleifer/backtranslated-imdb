It's really bad movie. The role played by Michael Moriarty in the role of "Cole" is the biggest reason for this flop loss, the actor felt that the character would be more subtle, covering an incredibly embarrassing southern draw. <br /> 1) Badly cast - 2) Non-confidence characters - 3) Razor thin plot line <br /> <br /> Yak! <br /> <br />
