I hate this presentation, and how these leads are written is not correct. These women do not have self-esteem or respect. The whole plot is throwing them guys themselves. Amanda Bynes wastes full of talent. She is "All That" and her own performance is amazing. </ p> <p> Homer says that their plot and dialogue will remind me of "Simpsons": "They wrapped her and Jenny Garth Wraped, Airhead, desperate, men chasing her" old-maid " When he was not, he asked, "Where is someone else guessing?" Some talk about whining about all the discussion centers, and then some person whining List all the changes and instead gaikodukuntadu person. Then they are back together or break up in the end. 2 women, poor, stupid or sex slaves. I think the word "sucks".
