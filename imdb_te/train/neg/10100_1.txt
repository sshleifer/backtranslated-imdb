Generally I support independent art and I try to be very thorough and tolerant ... I support everybody, because their efforts are valuable, but this film moves away from all comprehension and tolerance <br /> <br <br /> <br /> If you have not really seen so far in your life, Think rinci. <br /> <br /> Think about some great, attractive ART for that movie's DVD box ... and a good plot ... <br /> <br /> Wow! <br /> <br /> See if you really do not find anything else good. Anything good.
