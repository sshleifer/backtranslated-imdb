I do not know any film of Van Dummey to hit the Universal soldier but never know. This film is good but not the first one. VD should return a look & fight again. He tries to get 2 b funny here, but it's worth a smile. VD This time is good from Alley W. And it's good that it shows a picture of 2. Goldberg was cool, he made his famous move-the reason for its name I forgot I did not see wrestling-sucks. VD & Goldberg have some good struggles. It ended up as 1st, but that's not good. VD always makes his best move in his career, always like a helicopter kick. Even so, the end of the end is over. Anyway, it's worth looking at, but never will never be.
