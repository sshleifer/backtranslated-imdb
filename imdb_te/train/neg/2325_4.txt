Although the first scanners are not a great film, this is not original. It does not like this performance. In my opinion, the play is worse, the story is very slow and not unique. Like dialog. And the special effects are much better than the original. This film is the first of all varieties. The different thing about it is that it is loud and cumbersome at times. t good story. They did well with the story and made it interesting, it might be a good movie. In fact it has not been fully achieved without fast forwarding. This is an unforgettable movie for me, and not much. Despite all that, there are worst movies. In generous mood, I give scanners 2 to 4/10.
