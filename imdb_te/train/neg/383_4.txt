The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, the subject matter is interesting. But, as we look at the film, we say strongly, "The filmmakers are struggling to find good places, lighting is good, makeup and hair good ... why is no sound too bad?" The whole sound of the film is echo, is not disturbing and does not mean much dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is good work in the film, I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. <br /> <br /> I can not reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, give good sound. . The sound is a big part of the movie, and it's doing the right thing. Could have earned a 6.
