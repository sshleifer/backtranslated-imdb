I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival. So the movie should be good, so close at the great cast and festive, right? How wrong I am. <br /> I was directing when the director seemed to know how to speak, he met an unknown actor, Kevin Spanieni. First blah) ... Edison's director / writer Kevin Spacey's two indictment films must surely kill a homeless man because he (including other actors in the film) is a disaster. <br /> <br /> This film is totally scary! It's a mixture of hard-boiled cliche in each police. There's nothing new with Edison. Acting is good and directing is even worse. It looked like an episode of brilliant promise. This is the best cast for video movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There are some examples of bad crazy moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman Dancing does not cause rock and roll music for any reason in his apartment. By candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firefight ... 3 guys filmed in the head ... <br /> <br /> This film is a good opposite. <br /> Stay away from EDISON!
