Here is a horror version of PRISCILLA: A Desert Resident who pulls off a Bank Heist by Clarke, Boyfriend Johnny (Jason Darr) as Candy, starring Melinda / Mindy (Return of Living Dead 3). He ends up in the south-boundary jail, run by the brutal chief screw (a touring by Robert Inkland). Ends up hiding at a gas station convent until she and her beloved pet poodles are transformed by a newly fallen meteor. Dogs turn into a bad drag queen "bitches" and she can not control Candy's long, spoken, and killing tongue. Thousands looking for stealing and other classified numbels add additional problems. <br /> <br /> First, Clark looks great and does what to make the film. You look very funny to anyone at the time watching and watching the glamorous, slapstick scenes at the most ridiculous scenes and very sexy during the various beauty salons and disguises, including an eye-popping, skin-tight rubber bodysuit ... and this actress is a huge star. The rest of this fictional effort can not live until her promise. <br /> <br /> Blame director / scriptor Sisama who thinks he can make a different campus just laugh, but his indecent hypocrisy, harrowing supporting characters and stupid conversations are not a substitute for true humor. Another nail in the coffin; The film looks cheap, gorgeous colors and sets are muddy muted with mud photography and dirty desert bases. Fortunately she has Clark in the movie, because she is looking alone.
