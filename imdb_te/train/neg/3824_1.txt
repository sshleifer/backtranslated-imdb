I feel that this film does not play the role of Smith in history. The aim of the film is to tell Smith's life that the LDS church leaders are "comfortable", and historical accuracy is very low. The film is designed to be a "encouragement to faith", and Smith is not a "balanced" man. I studied Smith's life and read the LDS works and none of the LDS works. The film is beautifully portrayed and acted as most LDS projects. However, this is not a realistic filmmaking of Mormonism or Smith's little life beginnings. <br /> Smith was given an important time to repeat a risk when he was seven years old. Although the incident is important in establishing his mental outlook, the film is likely to be the dominant cause of Joseph Smith's sympathetic idea. Another point is that the film in which Smith's teen years are portrayed is silent about the Smith family's involvement in magical techniques during the 1820's. <br /> <br /> Another issue that shows that Joseph Smith has entered good-looking wrestling tournaments is that he sometimes lost his temper and failed to act violently. <br /> I have gone. The film is not a historic one and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I will not recommend that movie for entertainment for other entertainment.
