Her post has gone to Protestex Wasteland (now played in Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie), after her death from Protestant aging, Protector Elias Cotias, who plays a real good actor) and now she finds herself wandering through the crowd looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash stones. Her gray out cyborgs (which is an anthropologist played by William Cut, Evan Laurie and Zach Gulligan), is opposite the hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has a two-minute screen time as Lynch's owner. Cyborg can handle much better than the other two entries, but it is still very dull. At this point the problem is never used well with probabilities, action sequences are gradual and minors like McDowell, Cat and Galligan can lower. HJ is actually a whiny heroine and above lynch (usually) and the movie is not as motivated or amusing as fun as it's the happiest ancestor. (Van Dummay, the second is dull). The frustrating science fiction perspective, it strongly opposes any good idea. It is an action flick through routine and b-movie stuff and it is competing, the only thing I have to say about it. <br /> * 1/2 out of 4-)
