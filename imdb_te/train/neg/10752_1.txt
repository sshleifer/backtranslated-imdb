This film is very disappointing. I decided to see Phantom Love (why is it called?) From the belly. It has some interesting images, but they are often random and do not understand. They actually seemed like they were included to fill in time. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film is thought to be the atmosphere, but it is not. The lack of a coherent scheme did not help matters. You can say that you are suspicious, but I think it's uncomfortable with the weather. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed shattered, but there was not enough plot to care about her condition. Without looking at the cast list, I saw the main character as a child. There is very little context for the movie, place or character. I'm not a proud, but sex scenes (many are) meaningless and I seem to be more confusing, but I'm not sure if the same man, the other man, lover, her husband or her prostitute. This is only when I think of the hair recovered credits as her lover. <br /> <br /> The nail filing actually means more sense because some suggestions given to the emotional state of Lalu. <br /> <br /> The absence of context or flow of the film is not a matter of ambiguity or because it is great. But the final result was disappointing. <br /> I can not talk about it.
