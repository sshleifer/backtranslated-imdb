How difficult is it to write a watchable picture with Vince Vaughn, Paul Ziaatti and Kevin Spacey? <br /> <br /> I still do not know that Santa is young and still 20 years old than Vince (a big brother). I've lost a piece of the story but in reality, it really does not matter. Several scenes seemed to be space and contrived; <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go to the "tear jerker" at the end of the "Funny Theater" scenes. <br /> UG, the main disappointment. I can see how some enjoy this OK because many people say they're the worst, but I strongly encourage you to wait on this DVD. It's not worth $ 23,978, it will take your family to movies today.
