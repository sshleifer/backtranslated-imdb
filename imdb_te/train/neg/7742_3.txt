Thick film. Completely unhealthy. All the chemists between Indiana Jones and Guy from Blackhawk Down. The car chase scene will just go on and on the add-ons. They managed to change the vehicles a few times, but always end up in the tail of the buddies. The sight of children in car in the car behind Hartnett is just stupid. He told them about East Philosophy and I thought the authors thought it was funny or witty about what the right to die. <br /> <br /> Some subplots are not even explored, they are just used to fill out. Why Hartet Looks Yet In The Crime Scene And Why Does Burgers Order? And why, and on what field, the bad IA man was suddenly arrested from blue to blue? Why do I pick buddy cops, answer their phones or act as an Indian spiritual leader and then leave a lot of them out there on the wrist? For some reasons, Ford looks cheated when dealing as a cheater and realtor (he raises prices when he attempts to sell the producer's home with his own commission), although they are coming back to him! Did he lie to both of you? But they will never go there anymore. Stupid, just stupid. It is one of those police films that fired innocent people in the streets of the world without the care of the innocent people in the world. There they were standing on the adjacent explosion while they were just ducked for cover. <br /> <br /> The script writing is terrible, action scenes are boring, the plot is adjacent to a very reprehensible attempt. We have root for Ford and Hartnet. It fails miserably. And Ford's phone! Turn the damn thing! How many times can a ring in a 2-hour film? 50? 60? It's seriously discouraged by the midpoint in the movie! Every 30 seconds, stupid tune will be played! And it's not Ford, then Hartnet's was ringing! <br /> <br /> Ford's worst image from 7 nights to 6 days, without doubt, is the lowest point in his distinctive career.
