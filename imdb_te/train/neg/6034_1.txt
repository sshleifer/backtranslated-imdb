Oh my, where to start ... This film is just awful. Writing is bad, acting is bad, special effects are bad. The only good thing about this film is that it made me laugh! I'm in a mood for a horror movie but it certainly did not come! I thought it was good enough because I was not picky. I saw a lot of bad horror movies. In fact, my goal to see all the horror films is not what they were awful. At one point in the film I gave a comment about "corn syrup blood" and special features all the necessary things (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid) for the film a horror film if they actually admit that it is the image of Karo syrup (brand name corn syrup ...) Movements) but there is absolutely nothing to make it really good. The author should take some classes or just give up!
