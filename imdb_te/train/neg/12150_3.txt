One of your recent grossed zombie movies feeding the mashes after your hard-earned dollars. Reference? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's get one for this one team with the good old TheatreX. Learn about the plot? Captured zombies. This time, however, for realism (?) This movie will take place in Rhode Island, and I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie based on Rhode Island to be honest. A government-controlled TV station will keep "normal" broadcasts, so that the rest of the citizens do not consider any problem in the world, ie, not going out or going out. I will say that some commercials broadcast by this station are the most entertaining part of the film. This story is somewhat true but I am suffering from that problem because you do not worry or fall asleep shortly after. However, there is a lot of horrible acting to throw it all over the front of the camera to "see everything before". Believe me, you can see other things to do with your time than you can see. 3 in 10.
