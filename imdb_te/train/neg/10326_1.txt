Once again, Canadian TV surpasses itself and produces another show that is unnecessary after its show episode. <br /> <br /> Last time, I must remember that SitCams are to encourage a laugh at business laughter. How do all the white people smile stereotypes that all Muslims think of terrorists? OK Maybe a joke just stick to the mass. But not 30 minutes. It's called a dead horse beating. <br /> <br /> There is also a small dispute in this script. Can not serve cucumber sandwiches to withdraw her or her Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh this is the stuff that Emmy has here. <br /> And the characters! Which characters? They have all cardboard cutouts without anything interesting to make us want to follow the next ones from a situation. It's the point of the situation comedy. We have strong, interesting and dynamic characters, as we are constantly drawing to the TV set everyday. We worry about what the problem they are going to get next week to take care of these characters. If I have never seen these letters it will be soon. Fortunately I can not remember any of their names (Note to CBC - this is not a good sign). <br /> Acting is very soft. It's a problem in casting more than cast. None of these people actually have characters they play. They play their role as they work on a movie weekly. Sitcoms need the actors who live and suck the character - we fall in love with them - they are inseparable from character. Look at any American sitcom and see how you can easily identify characters. Although the actors are a big part of the problem and are the venue for better things, they play the next 8 years as a big role in their lifetime. The level of dissatisfaction with letters and projects. But to be honest, considering lame feeling and terrible writing, the actors do not have much to do but try not to bump into their lines and any furniture. As another commentator mentioned, this TV is not a movie and not a sitcom. <br /> The lack of direction or lack of direction! What can I say, Canada has a lot of talent, see what the Kapet Channel Puppies are doing with Who Kill and Panchet Up. Look at the trailer park boys (this movie is not Big Hallium Dog bit). <br /> <br /> See any American demonstration to see our talent in which many of our saints go to get a good job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember "The One"? No - do not try to learn the names of any characters in this show, as it is sure to go to Dodo's way. <br /> <br /> Let's all hope for the complete Blane ACTRA strike so nothing like this has emerged from Sib to a good period.
