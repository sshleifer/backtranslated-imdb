I ordered a big Jane Austen fan and a movie from Amazon. I was able to see the UK without hope without hope, that it was the US. What happens after Anne Wentworth? The whole thing of Anne Elliott is her silent and refined. She is not sudden and obscene. And Mary, she's suffering a stroke or something? Her speech is not normal, or her walk is normal. There is no chemistry between the two main characters that made their entire "romance" totally unreliable. In the final scene, they wore Sally Hawkins in the letter scene wearing the same dress Amanda Route. The same clothes do not make the same film. In my opinion they did not see the 1995 version, even though it's flawless, it's pretty close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. It is like the Cliffs Notes percussion film. Tap all the more points without explaining anything.
