By about halfway, I realized I did not care about these characters at least; However, I looked a bit more. Sadly, the next day I returned. <br /> If you know something about the movie before, you know that the main character is surviving a plane crash - and what's right after the title is - he's got on the phone and calls people about it! <br /> <br /> I realized that this is an old film, the acting style of those days is less intuitive than today. But by those standards, acting is a disgrace. These are not letters, they are stereotypes. I suspect this movie, more than anything, Betty Davis's attempt to help her husband (Gary Merrill) care for her. <br /> <br /> Playing Davis's Happy Pleibig (ie non-attractive character) is probably an experimental and daring career move. It's not. It's just boring. Tesske (the role of Merrill) is true about love and forgiveness (even though Tin is less successful), she is a little kind of Tim with a sense of life and relationships without reference to her beloved husband. <br /> In the end, the last scene that his wife called her husband in Ayodhya in the United Nations affected the two ends of the phone line and I was almost crying. <br /> <br /> I recall that these people actually paid for what they were doing in this film. <br /> <br /> I saw many people enjoying these pictures. If you're doing it, it's great. But frankly, I found it bad. There are plenty of older movies from Hollywood's Golden Age, which are well written and starred.
