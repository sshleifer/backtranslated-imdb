If they see so many of their stories, one can imagine if they could find this little one, but I know that humor is very subtle. I saw their sound shorts (their stuff was better than IMO) and I found them one of their weakest attempts. <br /> <br /> In this year (1930) Stan and Babe shorts and a feature. They were very popular and their owner Hal Roach had full advantage by continually working. In addition, it is an experimental time for writers and Stan. I will say that I really do not work. As someone says, it does not play their strengths. Most dialog and plot. <br /> <br /> "The best part of me is Agnes maid and" Thelma Tod "," Stan ". <br /> If you really want to see Blato, or Brats in their most creative and funny check from the same year. <br /> <br /> They have long since been short-lived, and may be forgiven to remove some of the less-a-part short films. They were like 108 films. Very few (except for those made at FOX) are completely failure but some. County Hospital, Me and My Paul, The Live Ghost, and The Fixer Apperes are particularly reminiscent of the weak. But the other then I just find something amazing about their all shorts. <br /> If you're enjoying watching their other shorts, take a look at everything, but I'm Stan and the Babe.
