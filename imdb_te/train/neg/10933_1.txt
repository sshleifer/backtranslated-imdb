You will reveal each stereotype and false depiction of semi-dirty mormons and you will see that you have acted without this fraudulent need for the film. Finally, Kurt Hale's fortunes have changed (thanks for courtesy) and hopefully it will be long before he can see what's in his theater. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is irrelevant (I do basketball scenes). This plot is limp and very useless. Why no one understands why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> This film is not the reason I give a negative rating because the level does not allow me.
