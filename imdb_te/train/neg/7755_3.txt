Three giant sabertut tigers (a mitochondrial DNA, a "genetic progress" occurred in a laboratory adapted from the fossil material) accidentally set free sets to unlock the security (a computer geek's introduction virus are devastating by a structure & structure of a security guard Leave in the air to open the gate and threaten the lives that come in contact with it Llipoye missing page from a porn mag) novelty shops in the resort at the time of searching for the putting out of action. Tigers are always starving, but they are unable to digest and eat. So pretty tigers slice their food into pieces. We have a group of college children who are victims, security personnel, and we are somewhat improved rich scanners (who have earned a girl with jokes and tech nerds) developed for those who are easily hated and desperately seeking death. /> <br /> Expressing the range of bad science fiction channel flicks, Sabertot's assault has the most wretched computer simulation animals I've seen. And, the last death order is so putridly you'll be demanding within the deep recesses of your soul that you spend on this really awful work in the time organistic characteristic rule. Heads have some good dark humor that are cracked from the neck, but here too prosthetic work is incredible. Prophylactic body parts and blood like the victims are crying for help inappropriately, without having to cry. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, repeating myself in every user comment that I write for this science fiction channel flick. I may be the time to go to other types of movies. Robert Karadine portrayed a ruthless businessman, his real adversary former brother, Nicholas Bell, "Primal Park", a resort / zoo with genetically created sabretooth tigers, which is the main attraction. Stacey Haiduk is still a very tasty, security guard who tries to convince the bell to get investors he hopes to irritate putting money on his multi million dollar project leaving the island. Brian Wimmer is a lover of Haiduck and his role is to run smoothly with a mechanic keeping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The fate of the bell is in the end of the resulting fruit from a turtle statue. Karadin Bell, who spent most of his arched postponement of the film. The tiger's point-of-view shows humans in a bright color, as it moves toward them. The film was driven by dark corridors (finally tech targets removed the virus) and feared for their safety. College children break into and score certain items needed (a scavenger hunting type of activity) to enter a fraternity / social club. The casting of these children does not increase above their cliche.
