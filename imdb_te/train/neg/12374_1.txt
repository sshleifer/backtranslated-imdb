I do not remember seeing another murder / mystery film badly. The film is full of voucher for a bad film about a medical examiner who investigates the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident: accident, boring story, lack of suspense, lack of suspicion and drama. I have seen this film PAX, a low budget and a TV station for dishing out of campie making TV movies like this. TV movies, of course, movies from the Big Screen are not on the edge or suspense. But, this film definitely hit all sour taste. The filmmakers lost the opportunity to make a great TV movie "Recipe for Murder"; <br /> <br /> If you like a good recipe do not see this movie. This movie only destroys your TV appetite. <br /> Grade F
