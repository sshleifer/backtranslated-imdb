As long as 3D technology is, (I think of the 1950s) it has an animation for it. I especially remember the Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale. I did not recall the name at the time, but the plot worked in the Donald Circus, eating elephant peasants and stolen chip and dale peanuts. It was probably designed to be seen in 3D in the 1960s. If you look at Robinson's Meet in 3D in the theaters, they showed the cartoon before the picture and explained the details of its origin. There may be 100 cartoons exclusively watched by 3D glasses. This claim is a wrong move because it is not difficult to prove them wrong. On top of that, this is just a bad image.
