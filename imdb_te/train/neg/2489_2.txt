He is here with his cardboard character moves, experimental and slum (with his trademark 'Batrorn' for his bad marks with him), but without the back of him. Henry Silva is a screen villain but he is totally unfortunate in the Arab protagonist (in red barrett), and the terrible script discourages her appearance as a sculpture of him. He is L.Q. One of the hosts of action film actors including. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who fail to add anything to popup but mix. After a disappointing first half without a lot of exciting action, things will choose a bit at the end, but it's too late and it's a fun thing to do. *
