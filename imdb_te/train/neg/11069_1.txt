I really felt cheated after seeing this movie. I see 101 minutes watching this film. I do not understand what they think when they do this. This does not disturb Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and it does not end there. They seemed to be leaving the movie for the sequel. It's like watching the television episode of Sopranos. It will end suddenly, and you will know that next episode is in another episode. I saw Part 1 for only two-part film. If there is a mistake here, there are many opportunities; They got lazy, they lost money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to do Dahmer 2. After seeing this film, they sounded very clear. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I heard this music, then came to the screen and dreamed that he had been sentenced to 2 years and was attacked with a fellow prisoner and was killed at the age of 34. Wow, he goes from a walk and jails to his death in jail. How about showing how got there. Looking at Dahmer's trial. More about some details. I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it has grown over the place. In fact, I was speaking with disbelief, "Is this the end?" I would like to end this review saying that there is still a good dhmer film. I want to tell filmmakers, if you do, do it correctly.
