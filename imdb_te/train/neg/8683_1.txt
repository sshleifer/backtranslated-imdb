This presentation is not intelligent. This is basically what is dropped down. The "genuine humor" that the writers attempted to avoid bulging the rest of the world's bush was just injustice. In another comment, someone says a couple of happy lines. Me standout George H.W. Books say they do not want to watch any TVs along with Fox News. Wow. I think parts of what I saw were bad. <br /> <br /> This instrument is my concern to the political rally, and these folks get a second season. I know that a liberal republic and Bush is a good president. We all do it. But there is no need to put this poopie waste completely at that time. I put these writers at the same level as Meligius, behind the 'Spartans Meat'. <br /> <br /> In their formula, you have already dismantled many unhealthy topical jokes and dismissed in the worst real issue. <br /> <br /> And again, Unexpectedly, and it makes me feel more unsatisfied, such a garbage is restored, but the amazing and original performances, such as the arrested development, are placed after 3 great seasons. Do not look at this rubbish, except one of those green-blooded liberal hippies that the Bush and Moody's words can think of any sentence with funny gold. <br /> Oh, and Bush's vocal sucks. Anything he does is mimic a little bit of texas accent and evaporates at the end of his sentences really hard. At least South Park voices agreed that they are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, see Daily Show / Colbert. Or stop motion action figure animation, look for any political sketches of the robot chicken, which is fun to watch. Watch for George Bush as Jedi bit on YouTube. Priceless
