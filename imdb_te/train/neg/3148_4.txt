In particular, the story of human nature is that the film has beautiful cinematography, the custody of the lush forests of Ceylon and the existence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film is not really anywhere. New Lindt Taylor ignored and neglected her husband, and later entered the plantation garden where Dana Andrews starred. The owner of this gardener is Peter Finch's last father, who could fall on the ghost Elephant Walk, which was a controversy between Taylor and Finch. Elephants have been determined to rebuild their traditional path, which is blocked when the building is constructed in their right way. Animals go on a rampage and provide the best moments of actions in the picture. Andrews had some good moments when she struggled to be a loyal wife for Tyler and Andrews, despite his marital difficulties with Finch.
