In 2004, I ski to ski captain in the theater. Nearly every review of this film is positive, previewing previews, looking lovely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beyond boring and poorly written, the film is available to 2 people in 10 stars, as everything in the film is stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and a stealing: it was stolen. More importantly, the filmmakers seem to not steal a point or move the story out. They stole to show what they could do. Except for setting up another scene, there is no point in showing the clip of The Wizard of Oz in the movie at the beginning of the film, which steals from the same movie. No need to say, every feeling in the film is not original or spin in old sense: it's literally literally from the Pulp-era robots that reminded the old Superman cartoons and the one I just saw recently. The Iron Giant ", the villain's silent martial artist, has been used in countless films, most recently in the" Star Wars: The Phantom Menace "as Dart Mowl. <br /> <br /> The subject of the original film, Maybe the whole movie is on the blue-screen, the filling of computer imagery in each and every actor <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this film, where there is no need for visual reflection. The protagonists are the only real humans, and almost all the enemies robots, and the number of friendly characters that can be shown during the film can be counted in one hand. <br /> <br /> If the movie is not a bad image, so if I did not give it a 1, the film was wrong with modern action films: filmmakers tried to justify these images with special effects , But without any kind of artistic vision or originality, it's flat.
