This film is a disaster from start to finish. Bono and The Edge and performers with performances from "The Beautiful Loss of Next Generation" interviews with them. It gives Leonard Cohen's clips a short amount of time, with his commanding yet sensitive existence, wisdom and humor in the film. Still others are busy trying to appoint him as Saint Leonard or some Old Testament prophet. Many of the exhibits are unforgettable-specifications (especially Rufus & Martha Wainwright) or fewer achievements. Beth Orton and Anthony were the only versions of Leonard's own use by using little control. The focus of the red spheres, such as concert and interview shots, moving vague camera work, and some of Leonard Cohen's remarks on digital delays, have wandered throughout the film from exaggeration. Under the interview segments (an attempt on the extra gravitas?), It is the most scary and imposing low drone. For the real thing, see the songs from the documentary Life produced by the BBC in 1988.
