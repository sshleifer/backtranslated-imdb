Painful to watch, and fully empathies in fighting the characters. Two of the main characters, the Synthia mother and the daughter of Monica, the huge amount of the film was buried and ruthlessly roam. Their characters were strongly convinced that their redemption was reliable for people who were tolerant after the rapid family of Catharsis. It's not worth the wait. I wish there was a headache less to view a valuable pitch for honesty among families.
