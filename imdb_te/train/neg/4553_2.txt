I'm looking forward to reading Cecestine's prophetic book and watching a movie. Indicate that this film relies on the book. There are not even the most interesting elements in the book. This is the best "B" image. How many events, characters, characters interact and how the book joins is simply changed or not. The flow of events that are so soft in the book, choppy and food you view as a child. The development of the character is very weak. Characteristic personals are separate from the book. In this direction a "B" horror movie is similar. I understand it will take about six hours to showcase everything in the book, but they have lost many points that are based on the screen. Casting is very good.
