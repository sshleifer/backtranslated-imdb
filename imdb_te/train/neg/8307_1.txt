Unbelievable in this show. . . It refers to what and what it focuses on and. . . Words can not describe madness. They will report anything. If a veteran is also connected indirectly to the story indirectly, it will report it. If they have a dog pope in Tom Cruise Yard, they will report it. A famous person dies. . . They speak for weeks on the subject of public jealousy. If a leading person is in the trial. . . ET will report for MONTHS at the end. There is no end to the timing of the time frame of the show and how it will focus on the story. Think of legitimate reporting too? Reports end up with unwanted interruptions with very terrifying noise voices and a very important feel. I can not see this presentation without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is usually a big reason to avoid evening performances earlier. I can allow IMDb at least one star rating and negative or zero negative. -10 stars qualify for this show.
