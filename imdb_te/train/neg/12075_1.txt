This hamlet has made it one of the boring MST3000 episodes ever. I'm not a Shakespearean fan, but I do not believe he intended his writing to be this slick and brown. This is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are too many hamlets on the list. I said this is boring. It is black and white, the slow progression and the lowest view. Actors can not help all. This is a MST 3000 reason that I can put someone to sleep on his lines the way the person playing Hamlet can see a sitting.
