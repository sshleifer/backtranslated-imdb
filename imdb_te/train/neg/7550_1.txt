Well, I'm actually a Wicker Man fan and I do not usually want to recreate British images by Americans, so why do you put me through the most painful cinematic experiences? I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, maybe I have a mad moment? This film feared! A bit of crash / fire initially did not relate to all the films and the women were aware that Edward was going, and two girls finally went to the mainland and did not become a bit. The whole thing was examined. The history behind The Wicker's Person is not really explored - and estimating that being set in America does not really help the whole pagan theme. This image is slow and there is no atmosphere or suspense. I should say that the best bit is right when Nicolas Cage flims up! I'm in such desperation to see the original again to refine my frustrated soul. <br /> <br /> Do not want America to make a return to the British Films? B) the original original fan? C) hates Nicolas Cage
