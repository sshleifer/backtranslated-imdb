This film is probably Muslim-customizable. <br /> <br /> Why did I write it? The main character is Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lived for the first 20 years in the Christian village. At the end of the film he put his predecessor, his common clothes, and his masks because he was a Muslim. Although he is a Christian, he has a six-year-old infant who is head-worn and therefore a Muslim. The main character chooses this as a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. One of the other male mainstream roles of Christianity is the development of a child. At the end of the film, Muslims are Muslim, so it appears.
