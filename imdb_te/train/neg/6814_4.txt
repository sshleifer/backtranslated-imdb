French director Jean Rowling is not well known for great films, one of the reasons why this messy mess. One of the most confusing about this product is the title. A director directing romantic movies about homosexual vampires; You may want to use the term 'naked' in the title, especially with a picture in the bear breast; But in reality, there is not much nudity here. Instead of any formal sex hammer vampires instead; There is a cumbersome plot about the person who wants to secretly unlock the immortality of the immortality, which can not do much to hurt a young man and commit suicide. A young man in the film encourages a young man to watch a young man through a mysterious bunch of masks under the watchful eye of the French young man, who is also the son of the eminent person. Through his research, he immediately finds that this woman is not just an ordinary woman, and as he delves deeper into the cult; He can not go to bullets, blood and drink in daylight ... He finds out that there is no clear cut case of vampirism. <br /> <br /> It is not interesting, since Jean Rollin, the movie, but the plot is so intense. It is possible to continue what's going on, but there are so many other movies that follow similar plots. As the climax is not primarily a necessity to describe the movie to the audience, the director seems to be discovering that he is also quite plagiarized in the plot. In the end there is also a twist thrown; But without the image it would have been better. I guess Jean Rolling's attempt to be a little bit original, but this is a ham-fisted attempt, rather than a logical continuation of the story. Cinematography is very good, and it takes place in a number of gothic locations. The girls on the table are beautifully filmed, and Rollin's film lacks logic and consistency, which is somewhat styled. In the film's defense, it was made in 1969; It describes some lack of shocks but I do not know much about it because this film is not recommended.
