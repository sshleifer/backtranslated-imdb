Frank Capra's creativity spent the time he made the film. While it has some lovely moments and many excellent performances, Broadway Bill (1934), the first version of the story, is not just a script, but Capra's complete reuse. That means he uses the footage back from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling. But he uses all the dialogue scenes with small actors, which brings back those actors and expects that we should not be able to observe clearly, for example, the Ward Bond 14 years old! If you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's final shows, rather than skip the Broadway bill.
