Most sequels follow the same path. The first one is great. Second is the average and this is bad, full of acting and some stupid dialogue and suspension of a lot of disloyalty, the film is weak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] I liked the first one. <br /> As explained here is not explainable, what time is it and why is there? <br /> <br /> I understand another of the writings. <br /> <br /> <br />
