I can not read an IMDb comment for the film as the film's role in the film shows that the film's black role is shown by a racist skinhead with his face as a little baby like a gun and a gun barrel down. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone can understand this as a balanced account of university life. <br /> <br /> If the Montone did not do extensive characters like his characters, I endured it and the title was enough because the universities were tolerable. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he promotes the role of ice cube as a bad guy, Remy to become the Remix Skin Head. But who is finally the graduate of the film's liberation episode? White Singleton Points could not only sympathize with his fellow black student or racist path (I can not say sympathy!). <br /> <br /> Many of those who are facing threats by someone else are not seriously criticized. <br /> <br /> Those who are raped are instantly portrayed as a culture rather than lifestyle. What is the honest point?
