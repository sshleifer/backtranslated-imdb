Where did criticism of democratic governance and republican criticism take place? After all, he belonged to the government for 17 years, not in his power. Oh I forgot about 8 years He is the 2nd most powerful country on earth. The film is pleased to show young Senator Gore's pictures to ask why a NASA scientist is pressuring him to change an end to his scientific paper, but Glover fails to ask about the complexity of Clinton / Gore in warming. Maybe it's very close to the election year, or it hurts the possibilities for Hillary's '08. Either way he is a political coward and bitter end with the hands of the party. He has not given any criticisms of any criticism of capitalism. There is no history of industrial development. This time has led us. <br /> In the end, this film is about Gore himself than any real issues facing our environment about Mr. Mr. Gour If you really want to make a promotional film - it's smaller and actually called it.
