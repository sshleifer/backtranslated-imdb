"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" is one of Charlie's 1915 essays. While these group pictures are more than their 1914s, it is less than average. With a dual combo-locked vault and a hard-luck ending, Charlie hangs out the hair of the main lady, in which he has an arched head pillow and two classic Chaplin moments. They both start and end ridiculously. The mediator breaks the bank robbery to deal with an opponent's colleague and steal the girl. Mope is perhaps the greatest physicist prop of this film and Charlie uses it as the intent of his character or whether it is an expert comic influence. The innocent Alley-Ego of innocent Charlie does the things he can do but can not do with his own two hands. Interesting thing but good.
