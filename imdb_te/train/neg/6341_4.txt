The East Palace, the West Palace, reminds me of the detective somewhat, in the role of Frank Sinatra police, and William Windom boy. This is a progressive film for China, I guess, but it makes eternal myth about homosexuality: men are made up of Chinese myths about female characters. The film focuses on a daytime man who wants to dominate and hurt a macho guy. He hopes to take into the stationhousehousehouse - park cruise without fear. And indeed it happens. Then he is subjected to light torture to his entire life story officer: time, hand cloth, cut off. This is what the gay man wants, and, in implicitly, gay man challenges the self-image of the police as a man-man. The story is about the life of gay men (which are also flashbacks), but when he describes old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It is compassion for China's gaze that only requires China to fulfill the traditional role of society. Sorry, I can not say.
