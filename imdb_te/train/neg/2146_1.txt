I'll keep it here, it's the worst sequel to the classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In the 1950s, Disney released what I was coming to be one of his greatest films of all time. Now remove great songs and add a poor platform similar to a lost TV program. "Put it together and what do you get?" The biggest load of the crude I've ever seen. After watching it, it was all for Disney. Cinderella should have ended up, "and they lived happily later." This is not the worst. This film is not eligible for this sequel. I thought it would be like a twist in time. Moreover, what are we seeing for Anastasia? She turned sides like Igbo, but it did not help anyone.
