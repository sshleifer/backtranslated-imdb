This is really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> I do not know how anyone in this release can dare. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the product standards. There is nothing acting in cinematography here. Camera work, scripting, acting and sound unbelievable cross. I think there is a plot, but it keeps watch for 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would like to ask someone to avoid any time or money on this topic. It's really bad. <br /> JDD - 14 December 2008
