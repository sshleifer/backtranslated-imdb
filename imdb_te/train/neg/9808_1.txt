I have never seen a worst performance. Some of the stories in this story are super powers, and when they use some special devices they become weird and poorly designed suits. Acting is good when they are not in retarded appearing suits. Definitely not good, but it's not the worst act I've ever seen. However, when wearing their suits, actors' performance is very bad; Very, very bad. Hyper-animated idiots have many unnecessary movements. They seem to be abrupt even when they speak. The villains are wiser than the Rangers. Each episode comes with some planning to destroy some weak, idiot villains Rangers. He / she then sends the power of high-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then start their 10-hour transforming animation, and then they can eliminate foreigners. Then, a poorly designed villain may be an armed villain that is truly visible and bad for a manned ladybug-like creature, who is the amazement of the obvious signs of men retardation. Power Rangers will fight off the villain, then transform into the villain Godzilla, whether it is a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot Nixes at creatures and become creatures giants). Power Rangers spent 5 minutes with hyper-animated acting and used special shows to produce toys that were exposed to the exclusive images that produced their shows. Power Rangers win, villain madness, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brain washing, fake kung fu combat.
