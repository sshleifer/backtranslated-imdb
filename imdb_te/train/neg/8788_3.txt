The potentially attractive and refreshingly low-key story initially ties your interest and gradually lets you gradually more and more slowly as you scratch your authoritative head. . Unfortunately, it happened to me at the end of White WHISISE. <br /> This is not the fault of Michael Keaton; It was once again happy to look back as the star of a brand new movie, managing to give a strong and honest performance, perhaps a bit wrinkled. Anyone whose wife has died recently, her whole life will be engaged with her revolving spirit (not a new idea) and can contact her through the funky electrical fusel business that you see on your television screen when there is no broadcast. /> <br /> The idea of ​​communicating spirits through the airspace is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) and there are a lot of people who actually believe for real, so I'm not going to make any comments about what I think of them, or them. Let's say I'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to purchasing into stunning movies like this, but I can not tolerate hell I'm not going to understand what it's going to happen about where I am, not credits eventually left when the roll starts. <br /> <br /> In this film I have painted the images that are completely invulnerable, but if the film does not appear to me clearly, I think it is a mistake of the filmmaker, but my own (unless something I saw or tired when I was tired). Well, I wake up wide for White Noisy, bright-eyed and bitch tail - so guess who's to blame?
