It's not so great. <br /> <br /> It does not know exactly how to laugh or want to go for sweetness or satire, it's a kind, um, hesitant, dilapidated gas. So we left three weaker mixtures. <br /> Also, these ideas are really tired and recycled, almost destroyed by themselves. How many times do I have to be confused with the ambiguities in the 50s in the States? And that it will be permanent through aggressive consumers? And that emotional repression of men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> The biggest offense in my eyes is actually how different it is. I know the comedy and everything in the whole movie that you want to have audiences for so long, you still need some relative guide through the emotional anchor, the story, to engage it. An old lady, two heroine pupils to see the 'hero' kid and finally his father dies in zombies or his hands and bow him with a cheery smile and sleeves for all of the best way to fight what kind of that. Mum is the same. If you make your two main characters authoritative at the top, then you have a risk of losing me and that has happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was right and I thought it was not a person. Billy Connolly's big fan: Movie Star. I will kill this panic and try to steal every scene, but he has played a very low-key role and brought out the most sympathetic character in the whole movie. <br /> All in all, but not great.
