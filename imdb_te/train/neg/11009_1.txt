I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie was great. "Everybody Guarantees Guilt!" The trailer said. Well ... it hurt me because this movie really sucks. I laughed about two seconds in the whole movie. And what's with all the homosexuals in this picture? I'm not homosexual and I do not have a problem, but what's the comic image that's adding a lot of gay-scenes when these scenes are not funny? <br /> You have my advice: If you want to waste good money, go for a good comedy already seen. Million times, you'll be better than watching this mother of all Lousy comedy. It's really the whole worst.
