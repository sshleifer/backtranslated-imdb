<br /> <br /> The film never exceeded 6 stars per day. The script is very common and obviously it is a disgrace for someone who is dependent on it. Cinematography comes directly from the slick world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore is not surprised by participating in the film. Overall, Don Simpson is also a "high-concept" style film that is shy.
