In the first 20 minutes, every cliche was trotted by the author and director of the hack possible. NTSB preliminary investigator with violent family life; NTSB board member who politically tortured [any TV can kill] Ted McGinny; Father who tortured crash victim; <br /> <br /> Hollywood has no idea about the vulnerability of the aircraft. The crashed plane was 737 and it was mostly on the ground as a hippo. The third part of the fuselage remains intact, with half the intruder on the back of the plane and the debris does not show field wings or engines. Many people have left behind many people who have escaped from the plane after losing its hydraulic in Europe. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of the scenes in "Air Force One" where the 747 water touched the inch-thick steel. <br /> <br /> The presentation is very difficult, it is impossible to see. My wife, I confess more than that, was commenting on technical flaws. What surprises me is how this POS is always made. Are the producers of these things used to cliche that they do not recognize? Some people read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million bucks making this true. I wish I was the next person's appointment. In New York, I had an amazing bridge, and I sold it cheaply.
