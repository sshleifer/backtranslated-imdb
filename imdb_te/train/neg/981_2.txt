As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I (finally) got to see this very, very dull film. It is the first color film of Miss Dietrich, and the most beautiful elegant redhead in the world! Bad start. This story is a sturdy posture, it's a hard thing. (It's necessary ???) All Dietrich's movies (and I've seen so many, including "Pittsburgh") maybe it's worth noting that her appearance is worth watching too. Color photography is OK (this is a very early technicolor release), but there is no benefit. Ridiculous casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough?). The only thing that's interesting is that this is an unusual caricature of John Cardidon, played by "The Sand Diviner". Being "greetings" is always discouraging. David O. Another example of Selznick's most enhanced reputation (which he ever made a good film? - Unlike that one?) And, for one last irritating, the soundtrack volume levels of MGM DVD seemingly random. Not highly recommended.
