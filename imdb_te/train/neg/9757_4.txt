<br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Breadstance) is probably the greatest swindler ever seen. Zorro is shy! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>? Forget horror - there is nothing. No nudity, blood, no demons; <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film is Gracieella Nilsson, who has done four films in two years and has disappeared. Miserable loss. Where did she go?
