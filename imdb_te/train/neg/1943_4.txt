Let down what! This secret began with intriguing and interesting characters. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey has good value and he is well-managed by Suron Jones. Muslim elements are very interesting. <br /> <br /> Morrissey's character has died and all air balloon has been abandoned. The last episode is dull, dull and dull. The whole thing has turned into a very small beer and the denoment is unbelievably weak. <br /> Five hours of my life? My advice: Instead of dry paint watch.
