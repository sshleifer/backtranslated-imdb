Ladies Man is a funny picture. There is not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? It is better than most SNL movies (i.e. Night at Superstar or Rocksbury) Tim Timmos and Will Ferrell are both very funny. Chris Parnell also had fun for his short scene (one of the ludicrous in the movie). Besides, the remaining cast is supported by mean and meadows. I saw absolutely ludicrous movies, but I also saw dumpers. Again, this is not exactly a deep image, but it's good to have some laughs. It's ridiculous though a skirt. But still, if you're looking for a beautiful funny picture, I would recommend this. Do not think too much about it or you hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
