There are so many discussions about molestation these days. This film is all over. It's about a good guy who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he suffers two mental women. Since then only one kick has been attacked. I do not know at any time you do something about it. Nowhere is there a wife and a child; He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there must be a few times he's acting. This film is a joke. I suppose in the background of Monson's murder, there is a bit stabilization in both of these. However, why does someone make such a film? There are no requests except for inquiry. The end is completely unsatisfactory, but it can be a solution with a clear plot twist. Oh! Good. Another hour and a half in my life.
