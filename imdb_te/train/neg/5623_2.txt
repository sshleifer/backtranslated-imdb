Hollywood's attempt to change Jack London's life as a "Jack London" adventure is not a bad idea; Certainly, he led an interesting, and sometimes courageous, life. But the film is flat and unsatisfactory. In particular, it does not have integrity. Michael O'Shee (as London) are some of the Londanesque lectures; And, it's nice to see his chin Jack received "Call of Wild" after spending some quality time alone, in snowy mountains, with his dog, "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are very beautiful. The film's unfortunate "yellow pearl" has parallels between London life and World War II, both of which are both serious and insulting. <br /> <br /> Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santel ~ Michael Shia, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
