Writer / director Bart Sibrele said in his film that he was wrongly sent by NASA. He said that he used the camera tricks to show off their tour of the footage of the tour to the moon. Astronauts are in low Earth orbits, and the editors on the ground are composed of this raw footage in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research does not make him realize that the "backstage" footage is really taken from a 30-minute live stream (mostly on the reel), appearing to millions of people, as NASA tunnels do not hide. It's surprising why Sibrell takes on his own conspiracy comment on the astronauts' audio in the scene, because astronauts are not clearly tested by the camera in their own words. Finally, anyone can see the raw footage without having to buy the hack-up version of Cibral. He shows more of Zapruder's image of the murder of JFK than his "smoking gun".) Sibrell thinks he's the only one he has seen. The clips from the raw footage that choose not to use the sibrel is to reveal that the distant terrain is hidden by the window frames and the staircase and transparency in space windows. <br /> <br /> Like many of these images, Sibrell is misleading, inappropriate, misleading Commentary and selected quota one of the original evidence Udda ear piece.
