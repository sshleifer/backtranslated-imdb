The film is made up of a budget of $ 70 million and is beyond me completely. Storyline and conversation are beyond amateur. The characters do not react almost to the things that the real person always says and the things mentioned earlier. There is no real world. Leeds's acting may say that this work is such a bad thing ... but many actors in the supporting roles really grab the product. The hair of the hero should probably have gotten its own credit, it is extraordinary attention-grab ... not to mention that it gave one of the best performances in pick. Finally, L.A. The film is intimidating for a film about a huge reptile siege. What a shame! If you look at it, your mind is constantly racing to take the SFX scenes and think about ways to build a better image around them. Sadly, it will never happen.
