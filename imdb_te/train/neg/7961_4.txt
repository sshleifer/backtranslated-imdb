Five years after the original Creepshow, another minor horror sequel by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2 There are only five stories in this period. None of these three stories is really original or unique. The first story is a major horror story, a wooden Indian statue that takes revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really nicely in this story, but it's very familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour are playing the older players' store owners. The second story, "The Theft", is a Stephen King story. There are four young men who spend a day in a wooden pallet alone in the middle of the lake alone. Soon the children are hard in their lives, because each of them does not have a clear reason. However, instead of having a suspense, children are burdened with the behavior of bad dialogue and doping head, and are prevented from really worrying about what happens. There is also some random humor in this section. The third and final story is "The Hitch-Hiker", which was originally reissued for Creepshow 2. The original story by Lucille Flatter was portrayed as a film Noir suspense film. It was designed for the famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Eager Stevens. "The Hitch-Hiker" serves as the best of these three offerings, but without its problems. Lois Chiles plays a cheater spouse, so he runs a hammer, or as she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or to condemn her. In many of the average stories of this kind, the characters are just to say stories with their turns and turns. A bit of surrounding area seems to bite around the bullies story. In this installment Tom Tomi is seen as "creep". The good thing is that there is no continuity yet. 1/2 of 4 stars.
