You can give it a pass for JMS and boys so that they are at the start of their series and in a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Not bad for me, the B5 series is the best TV series ever so far, but when I see this movie, I ordered this series. I do not like O'Hher as an actor, the dress is stupid, and the tones are richer. That is the first season (except for Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire in the series and it became spectacular scenes. If you're a B5 fan, watch this movie, see it. If you're not a B5 fan, do not want to see the series.
