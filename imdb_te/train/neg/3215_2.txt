The film has a nude scene: a man sitting on the bed's edge, and his exposed genes scatter the spots in the middle of the screen. This is a very long sight. What's the point I thought it was almost funny but I was watching it with my mother and we did not like it to be with us for a full-minute look. <br /> <br /> The movie is cooler. No characters like that. Audrey Tatou is very beautiful, but her character is a happy girl. <br /> <br /> I do not really recommend this movie. I wanted to be beautiful and fresh but I was disappointed. I am surprised if the director is from a very high crust, educated French family and he sees down on these characters. <br /> <br />
