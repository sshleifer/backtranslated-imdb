A pretty tough entry for a different link to admit to having fantasies about Brad Pitt. But what can I say? Probably everybody is talking about it and one star is known to be a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into an unknown sensitive and emotional land. Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Evan McGregor, and Billy Cruptup. Women fall in love with pregnancy, Dietrich, Catherine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and many more recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, unilaterally, is redefining the concept. The only reason for him to go out, get into the car, find a parking lot, buy a ticket, buy a popcorn, and get to the theater to see "Troy", you can enjoy it if you like "Jupiter's Darling" style. But if you do not, go to all of these and want to put Brad Pitt in business.
