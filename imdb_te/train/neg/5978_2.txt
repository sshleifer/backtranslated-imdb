This third Pok√©mon film is too old to follow the little kids and is very repetitive to entertain older children. Motion picture - Loss of dealer - The father of the young man returned during the credits of the film. Team Rocket provide some entertainment, but they are not really part of the smaller plot, so they do not seem too often.
