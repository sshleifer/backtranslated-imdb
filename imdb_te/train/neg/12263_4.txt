As I first did in Turner Classic (which is listed as "Dangerous Female"), I see the film and only increase your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart-Aussor version. Ricardo Cortez should be paid by Smirk. I hope he remembered his dentist and his bilalique salesman with his will; They made him an actor. Women are all better, but better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a bit better. More interestingly, "Joel Cairo" and "Mr. Gutman" deliver many opponents of rivals, but there is virtually nothing in Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet in the set-changing atmosphere of their heirs. Humphrey Bogart and Marie Asterrey remade important roles of their characters; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) Is not. <br /> <br /> This film is not exactly stink; It's there like a big piece of ham. The great films like '41 'Falcone "are not going to happen, at 1 to 10 levels I rate it for the camera work and assistant players.
