The "Three Brave Daughters" divorced, redeveloped, and single-parent living in a pungent sweet, pink color. Clearly, there is no place in the perfect life of a parent's mother who feels that social issues and financial difficulties are deteriorating, cruises, and then marries the dates and band conductor. Despite the fact that the term "its only one image" stimulates the script from real-life problems, Dotters' relatively absurd high-lyrical songs, kids of the original people and band hero Hoose Irubini does not rely on children playing. Is not it strange that any real person is going to act in a realistic self self-engaging film? <br /> <br /> However, the film was released in the nineteen forties. Old style Hollywood romance and comedy love only 'Daughters' makes a reasonable image.
