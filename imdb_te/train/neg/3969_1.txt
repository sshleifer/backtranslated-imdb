I think the Dark Remains are a good movie because I'm writing this. <br /> <br /> Previously, if they did not act in big names, is it more likely to ask a more attractive lead actress? It is painful to see plain actress in her dull acting film. The story is a clich√© and poorly scripted script. Special effects are low. <br /> <br /> To be simpler, Dark Remains are much smaller than the Masters of Masters of Episodes of Horrors. But most of the quality films are still very similar. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any of the artworks, even if it is not right. For anyone, it is time to spend something more valuable - it should be very easy.
