What happened to all Turkish actors? No crime but I thought all of these actors were for nothing. There is no script in this movie to test the talents or talents of the film. I did not buy this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film is another failure for him. The script is so bad. Your teeth are not sinking and all the characters are two dimensional. Madison tried to act as a hard ass but the script and direction did not allow his character to be more interesting or 3d dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sound effects of the storm have also opened fire on the skirmish with the sound of paintball guns at the beginning of the film. It's really weird and they do not sound like real guns. This video game has better sound effects than this video. At the beginning of the film that was a member of the robbery gang was really bizarre block. He has this American American voice voice like "F # $ k here" and "Voices are what's going on", as he sounds like a girl. I laughed for a few seconds. Who's that? W. Film poor Madsen.
