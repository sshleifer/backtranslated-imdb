This old Frankenstein premise has a split. The acclaimed scientist dies in an independent accident and his father, the famous brain surgeon saves the brain. It is a robotic body in its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives inspiration to 'colossus' to transfer ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not feel like it is going to happen, <br /> <br /> The main characters are Otto Krueger, John Barragre and Ross Martin, and Ed Wolf played the role of 'Colossus'.
