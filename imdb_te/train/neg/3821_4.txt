What's the worst picture ever The feminine nightmare of 'Cries and Whispers'? Acidized psychodromus of phosphider? The dark house of the last house on the left? I'm sure of a good shot of Buster Keater, a part of the picture-dear people who just make their masks, just one answer - one of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know how my soul has made a mistake in this film - Keaton's complex and extreme physical art will keep the hood slapstick; This masterful filmmaker's painful contraction with conversation - he is not a lovely comic voice, nor does he mean that the conversation can not be funny; It seems that the studio does not seem to have taken him enough, and so he is only trying to remember his lines, before delivering him - Keaton, his character looks silly; Or when he gave some of the most wealthy accounts of porn disappointment in the film, shame was seeing Keaton caught up in a tawdry sex farce? <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is not sitting next to notice Jimmy Duranti's skitty to see the movie's greatest comedian. <br /> <br /> The best way to make Keaton sound is to become a Marx Brother. Sound breeding, elaborate, tedious 'clown', shambolic slapstick, stage setting, success through confusion, and Telma Todd. Keaton is not just such a comic, and Groucho's malicious tongue and happy opportunism is not Baster's socially useless professor, as he worked on this plot, and he studied and predicted. <br /> <br /> What is the buster that allowed long-term experimentation in 'M' or Ren√© Claire? He always tried to catch the waves like Chaplin. When the film like 'The General' is ignored - difficulties with trains - the loss is more clear. <br /> And the thing is, in the flat direction patches, the film is not so bad - the camera has a wonderful jolt when Keton is alone in a single railway station; And inability, if not the original, it has lived at least in the past. Keaton is something almost enticing the way it reduces a plot down all the zip it can get. <br /> <br /> There is a film about the cluttering effects of loneliness, mental frustration, education etc. and struggling to get out. Professor TZ is the best way to watch the post of the post, but retains a cryptic grace of the intellectual intellectual Buster Keaton (in this case in the studio) trapped in a simple jail that is confused with new technologies. That way it becomes a kind of artwork.
