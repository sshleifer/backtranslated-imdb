<br /> <br /> I am not a low score by 'Koi Jiko' because it's not a bad movie, but it's not worth the praise. <br /> <br /> Before I did not see Hosso-Hsin's work, but for uninitiated (also included) is a tribute to 'Kôhî jikô' Yasujiro Ozu. <br /> <br /> The Japanese film director released in 1962 is a very small task. There are very little conversations, story, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> YO HITOTO 'YOKO' is unemployed, spending her time at her local coffee shop or the role of the Taiwanese composer her favorite. Tadanobu Asano covers her otaku interest in her friend, who works in a CD store and occasionally trains. <br /> <br /> We see yoq drinks coffee alone ... running around ... waits for a train ... catches the train ... slips on the train. Anyone in Japan can see a worldly kind of daily. How to capture these simple moments of life of these characters, but it is absolutely or in no sense without any meaning to these sounds.
