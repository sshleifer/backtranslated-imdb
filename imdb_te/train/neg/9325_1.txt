Illness. The incredibly crappy was so killing I was really there. There is no acting to talk. The best part of the whole product is the artwork on the cover of the box. This image's budgeting is enough. This filming is sub sesame street. The product appears as underground filming for mob hits. The goods used in the film were stolen from a clothing store. You can go ahead and laugh at the end of 5 minutes. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it looks good. I will avoid all these costs. I enjoyed the close scenes and they made the whole movie worthy. Something fun.
