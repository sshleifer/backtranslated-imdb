But Thomas Ian Griffith has a big bucks actor, which happened 5+ years ago. The comic lines may have time to take some action, but comedy. And how do you get KC out of Katy Koslovska? Plummer's character is so thin, he'll fit better in a Bullwinkle toon. Personally, if the action flowers are going to show the skin - I'd liked likes seeing equal time between male / male, otherwise do not show any.
