SunDown - I have a weak, dorsiest vampire with the most prestigious and proudly scoring scores - with every move and speaking word Shane Vampire, I broke half a time out and broke the half-time <br /> <br /> Vampires have no special forces - strength (Sometimes), with their lamp a lamp (once) and .. that's true. No one was afraid of Dracula and he was forced to leave the bullets. Practically any other film-Dracula consumes the term for breakfast, using his followers as skin and their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, in the fight against a bloodthirsty gang - is a few old geeks versus Dracula. This was a good old B-movie movie, but it is obvious that a dramatic musical score is a bit more intuitive, and it is quite crazy that it's funny, in the end, it's not just the bats left to destroy the bats. Sure, it has some fun moments, but they are very small.
