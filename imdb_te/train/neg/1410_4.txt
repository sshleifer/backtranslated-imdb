The famous but dilapidated actor (Morgan Freeman) has not been shot for four years. When he is invited to take part in a new project, the director's clerical cousin asks him to leave him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to investigate the task of a small supermarket manager. He sees the beautiful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Pazz Vega) and he attracts his ability. His driver does not always come back to catch him and travels to Scarlett's actor. But the first is that she has a job interview for the position of secretary in the production company and helps the actor prepare her; <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, meaning "10 items or less" is definitely frustrating. This low-budget movie storyline does not have, and supports Morgan Freeman and Pazz Vega's chemistry and improvements and actually takes about 82 minutes. The vague open end is just ridiculous as Morgan Freeman returns to his silver spoon world and tells the general worker that they can not see each other again. Was he afraid to destroy his perfect world with his family, having a love affair with him? Or class clash, and he finds that his fancy neighborhood should not be enough for a simple worker from lower classes? <br /> The title (Brazil): "Um Astro Mina Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
