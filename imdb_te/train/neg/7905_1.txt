Outside of the archaeologist Simon Watterman (Harvey Carman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) expeditions, the deepest darkness starts in Peru (looks like a dusty look). He feels that the old Aztec buildings are actually a space control and he has a goal to prove that alien creatures visited the Earth, but in a similar structure he sticks to his backpack and returns home and is in the small American town of Sweetwater in California. As the creature is going to share his exploration, he decides he is the proof of his appearance and decides to leave home for some different reasons. Take care of Simon's Paul & his wife Cindy (Nadine van der Walde). Meanwhile Simon's brother & fast food businessman Cecil Watersman (Harvey Carmann again) steals the life so that his brother can not make money from it, but his idiot step dude (Jon Stafford) struggles with it <br /> <br /> Betina Hirsch This story, directed by Kathai, but the individual parts will return to different smaller creatures. The worst. The script by Lance Smith is unfunny so it's painful. Each joke in Munchies misses the proverb mile, and the hypocrisy of the hypocrisy will also appeal to early teens. It's not even funny or fun too remotely as I am concerned. The basic story is very bad, with no explanation about what the creature has ever been, no one has ever seen before, how quickly you can learn English and learn how to run it. The whole thing is a big Gremlins (1984) Rip-off with Elements that made that movie very good. This character's wretched, stupid deputy (Charlie Phillips) & his father (Hardy Rawls), wore along with Cecil's awkward wig & fake cocktail & his airship wife Melvis (Alix Elias) & more. They are just plain trouble and ridiculous, I have someone to suddenly find out which of these is garbage worst is funny. Usually Munchies has been unsuccessful in being a comedy or horror, which ends, yes it is assumed. <br /> <br /> Director Hirsch worked here with a low budget, two houses, desert, some caves & a mini golf course. This is really cheap and inefficient film-making. Munchies themselves are really awful with special effects, their toy that does not have movement unless someone pulls the string attached to it's hand on their camera. I can not influence how bad effects, these things can not convince my 4 year nephew (proved me & yesterday to him!). <br /> Technically, this film is terrible, bad special effects, lipstick design, garbage sets, as well as everything else. <br /> <br /> The two characters are playing Carmen to Cops, acting and acting through acting. It does not prove that both can not prove that they can not act. <br /> <br /> If the smiles try to achieve it, you obviously do not want to see it that I will not stop you but you have not warned you! My advice is to watch Gremlins instead, but the decision is yours!
