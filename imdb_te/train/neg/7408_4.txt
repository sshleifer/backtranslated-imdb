I'm not quite sure why I click on "spoiler" because there is not enough explanation given that the movie knows enough of what's going to spoil it so honestly. Visually it distributes more. Well, away from some 80's throwback rubber-masked monsters. I say now before I look at that I do not see the Band Lordi Band anywhere, or they know something about the bar that won the Eurovision. Apparently members of the band in this band, pretty much their stage guy. Whatever. Anyway, I'm not looking at this moment. I thought the demons / demons were more passable. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-cohesive explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it may not actually be known. It's probably too lazy to think about it. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is about half the entertainment factor, the film is going to be quite a good way to keep it entertaining, even though it's going to be perfect. Especially because I know how pretty much nothing is out, because it got a good laugh out of it. I must have a mood that I am, but I found a funny reason for Hella. Then I look at the movie on the internet and know what hell it is supposed to be about NOBODY. <br /> It is not scary or particularly coherent, but it is pretty good sight and sonically. Overall, very necessary, but worth watching. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to be any sense, and if you're in the right mood it can entertain you.
