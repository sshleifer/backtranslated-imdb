I have hopes for this film because I have seen some of the other issues and she has some expertise. But, a study on what the film should not do in a screenplay. Customized characters are not completely undefined characters, and what the plot does. Is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? Filmmakers do not have a clue, and we will not do.
