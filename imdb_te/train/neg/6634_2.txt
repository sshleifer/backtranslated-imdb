The first look on the cover of the film is that it looks like a good rock n roll image. But the cover does not let you fool, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie do it. The storyline is just terrible and acting. It's simpler and simplistic: the bad <br /> <br /> It's not about the road, its just a narrow love story. The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and why I give 2 to 10. If it's not for music, it's 0 from 0. Meat Loaf is a terrible actor (at least in the 1980s), and watching the girl who played the groupie is also not good! It makes me a lot of good promises, because this film is very disappointing for me.
