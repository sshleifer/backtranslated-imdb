Want this comedy or serious play? The film starts with a sigh of relief between the three women. Fine. This becomes controversial when one of the women meets them. Fine. There are some criticisms among them. Fine. But when the plot thickened and finally turned black, I began to wonder whether I understood the first part of the film. At the end, it tends to go back to the last light-hearted depression, which will last a long time in this vein. But now it's too late. It is hard to see why these women still talk to each other, and ultimately do not believe. A lesson about how to do movies (anyway, British filmmakers). Producers do not know how the film works. This weekend (four years after the film's release) has never heard of the film, the box office has proved to be a real real flap.
