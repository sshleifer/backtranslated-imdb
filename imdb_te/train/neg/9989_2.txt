In the cold cinematic night of a cold winter night, I have a bad luck to see this trash. I'm not a big fan of horror films, most of them are worse. This is a lot worse: one of the dumbest pieces of garbage I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror movie? Yes, there are terrible things in this: acting, script and special effects - Gosh, I'm frustrated at this simple attempt 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to make fun of the producers do not think about this rental. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vote: 10 to 2 -
