The title creatures were destroyed in a peaceful, desert town. The whole plot, mainly for the film, and the scenes devoted to Munchies are somewhat fun (in the simplest way) are just filler and bad fill. From the "hero" of Allen Wannabe Allen Wannabe to the ultra-dumb urban police, it is difficult to take up the most irritating role in the film. Almost everything is on the screen while there are some people and I think, "Well, sweetheart is beautiful, but why should we put it to the rest of the Morris?" The film is also filled with pop notes (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably dates back to the early 90s. (* 1/2)
