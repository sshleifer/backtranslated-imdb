One, otherwise the worst picture will come out of Britain in the 80s. <br /> <br /> "This is one of the most inspiring, bizarre and unrealistic, funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial efforts." <br /> <br /> The bad thing about the movie is that the strong cast of George Costa, Michael Holmes and Siobhan Finesters is entirely cut through such a dirty script. It was not surprising that Andre Dunbar's work was delayed to come in. At each level full and completely rubbish.
