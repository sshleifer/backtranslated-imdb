The program is thicker and dull, and basically all the different types of ripes to make it "original". First off: Animation is so ugly ... Johnny's bizarre ... and annoying of everyone. The twins appear as teen women's dexters from "Dexter's Lab", and Johnny is almost like a brilliant Male Dee (from "Dexter Lab"). Second: The plot ... are difficult and harder to follow. Gags corny, and nothing really makes me feel a little laughing pressure ... especially when it tries to be funny. <br /> <br /> Third of: The whole theme starts by removing tune from Green Day's "American Idiot". When I'm not a big fan of that band, I'll take the same melody and correct it, and I find it really dumb to change it to their own. <br /> <br /> In case ... it's a big fat ugly bore. 1/10
