Not enough here. There are some funny spots, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love the stupid movies. I was expecting this to be a hidden gem. That's not. <br /> <br /> The whole time I'm looking for, "I think geez is better than I and I am a morse." Do not believe some good reviews. I was succeeded in them. At no point I do not scream. Maybe this is a funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man, it fell flat today. The film has been promising, it's not just delivering it. If they are rewriting some more times. I can not make the actors wrong. They are not the best, but they do not have any work. The film failed due to the threadbreaker. Disappointed.
