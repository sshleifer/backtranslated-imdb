I have high expectations of this film (title, translated, "how can we get rid of others"). After all, the concept is so great: the ruling elite is in the near future of the right-wing government and in the near future to take the consequences of commonly called freeliders and legal wings called left wing and everyone is going to kill. Can not be proven (establishment is called "common good") S, but the fact that the interests of the ruling capitalist understands the theory). <br /> Very nice! Ideal for satirical writing! Only, this film is completely unlikely. This sarcasm comes only in a few scenes and shows of absurdity, but this irony is not continuous; It's not sharp or witty. And for the comedy comedy, the film has almost all the funny scenes. <br /> <br /> The comedy, as I intend, needs to be in the absurdity of the situation, but the situations are more uncomfortable and intense than motivating the idea of ​​laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The errors in the script are crawled by the cemetery. This action is to focus on political issues and make a mistake to do what such a thing is, but it's time for a young man who wrote new laws for fun, trying to protect everyone, and ships to Africa by handling resistance. It's just that! This movie should not be so serious! It's an irony! A political statement. But it really does not start to solve the problem that should be about it. Probably afraid to go too far? How shy This is not art. It's not even real satire. <br /> <br /> Soren Pyramac is very intense and one of Denmark's most senior actors is very good. He has a very low entertainment value. <br /> <br /> In fact, the language of problem with many Danish movies is not natural. Formulation or delivery. Why is it too difficult to sound right? Why should it be shaken and artificial? <br /> <br /> Now when people see these pictures from over 50 years, they do not think people have spoken in a simple Danish society. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
