What Steven has done is you're all new. Steven's last film was shocking since the shadow man directed the same director. Shadow Man is not very rare in this movie and it is good to say that he is not too funny. He is in a guest role and is half the time he's half a time in the film. For action well let's just wizard's wizard have more action than this trash and there's hardly any action in the film when it comes to barely irritating irritation and shotful action sequences. Seagal will kill anyone who does not belong to one person's army, such as 1 and 2, and not from the wound, unlike his over-the-counter movies. The plot is very confusing and has many scenes, which sometimes do not make scenes. Fury flight is good from the better ten good luck on this garbage 0 5 pound wasted ill
