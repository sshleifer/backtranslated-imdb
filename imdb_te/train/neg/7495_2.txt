Fox's "The True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is their outstanding poor Wide Screen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James". I'm not wrong, but in this version of the two main characters, Nicholas Ray's unparalleled direction and ham-fisted screenplay will have to do with it. <br /> <br /> At the end of the thirties and typhon power fox in the forties, his star began to decline in half-century, and the studio head Darryl Zank replaced Robert Wagner with his replacement. This is a major flaw in Zank's part because Wagner is less than the right position. It is hard to think that Wagner did not recognize himself with exemptions from "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956)! Furthermore, Jeffrey Hunter does not have more than a Fox Contractor player before Wenger's Jessie's "The True Story of Jesse James". Last year was the stunning and public appearance of John Ford's classic "The Searchers" from this unique stand of the actor. But here, along with Wagner, the second half of James Brothers is not the smallest of boring. Any player can bring their respective characters to any personality or color. They lose the mark altogether, not in the original power and the attraction and the appeal presented by Fornda. The film is also a very serious picture and replacing Vazner, like the American West's Robin Hood, is an attractive intro that you can not get any emotions. The supporting cast is rarely mentioned, but it seems to be a disgrace for Agnes Moorehead as a great actress. It does not look like our James. Excellent cinematography / color cinematography by great Joe McDonald and excellent music score by the understated and lesser-known composer League Hurlin!
