At the beginning of the film, I suffered a stroke on my stomach and closed the film. How does the film give more than the rating of 1 buffaless? I know that the purpose of the film is shock, but I have shown the actual footage of a dog with a living skin (holding the vomiting I type) - please! I closed the baby's scorched scene. My eyes were up to that time. No wonder this film was found in the bargain bin in HMV. I do not really want to see any other movie by this man. Anyone enjoying this experience. Period.
