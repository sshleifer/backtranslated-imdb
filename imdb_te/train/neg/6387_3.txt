When I initially selected this film, I was worried about the basic idea and showed interest to see what was going on. I'm an animated fan and I like this when it successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this film is all about what I enjoyed. Actors' performances are superb. The visual appearance - including the animation - gave the piece a spectacular wind. However, as you alarmed the scene, the scene was lost between the images of both the visual and the script. The most annoying plot about this is unimportant. It seemed to be the horn boots at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that deteriorated heavily from the plot shoe flow. Voice overs from Felisberto - especially at the end - felt like a desperate attempt to fill gaping holes in the plot which neglected in favor of side problems like most ants (and also not correctly addressed). A young man who spent a lot of time reading DH Lawrence, I saw the whole piece as a "reasonable first attempt". It's not what you'd expect from movie makers.
