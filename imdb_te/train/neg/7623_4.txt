This small performance is obviously some stupid little prequel / spin off the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Live Action Series, this performance is completely worse. The live performance show includes brilliant jokes and story lines. I probably think kids hate this rubbish though the animated series is mainly a sweet version down to luxury to younger viewers. <br /> <br /> The storyline in each episode is just Sabrina some stupid and nonsense dillemma and she uses magic to solve it. Each episode is fundamentally thought out. Sabrina is the most extreme part of using magic to gem and gem to become a Sabrina. So the gem becomes a witch and hippotice makes her vulnerable to becoming a slave. This then leads to a hideous yet interesting scene Jem says "now worship me" and Harvey begins to get his hands and knees down and kiss her feet like a god. (He's very good since his mind control is a slave) but this stupid spin-off time or effort is not worth it.
