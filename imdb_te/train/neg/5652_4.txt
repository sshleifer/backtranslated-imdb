It's not a bad movie ... but it makes you look at your girlfriend. The story is not bad .... It looks just an hour and a half long. I really like this idea because it's difficult for me to make this film worse but it's tall and thin in the story ... it's so bad. The main character never really seems to change all too much from beginning to end. I go through something "life changing" and he can just break a smile. I really think Mack is really good. His weird unsaturated film has kept the film from a complete disaster. Maybe I can not "get it". If someone can explain it to me, I'd like to know.
