After seeing only half of the school in November, I saw that it was on Flick's channel and decided to see a new review and write a new review about it. <br /> <br /> That book, Hatchet, based on the movie. <br /> <br /> It is a horror parody. <br /> <br /> The horror (and I'm awful) acting, bad dialogue and average cinematography are these ferocious adaptations of hatching. <br /> <br /> Brian at 80-year-old Teen's Cliché (who is lying on the head for the Broon's 80s rock music) and his mother divorces driving in a car to go to her on a plane to see her broken dad ... now dramatic Bray.) Now Brian's mother has waited for a dog and flies to see her father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude guy (not as in the book) who is a heart attack and dies after 2 minutes in the air. The book pilot goes in more detail with more pains and the pilot seemed to be in the air for a long time before his heart attack. <br /> <br /> If the plane is empty (in a couple of minutes) the fuel is empty (leaving us, the audience, he did not change the position of the sun and assume that he was up there for hours even though the scenery looks exactly the same.) Now he's crashing of <br / > <The book is in the movie where everything is very different. In the movie it is perfectly fine with his jacket pieces but in the film it is absolutely fine with the tears or rips (he's just like buying), it said he wore a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell there asleep on the hill, he was a bear (tall but bear No, he never claimed to have attacked, he had a lot of bugs, it was about a second tornado He did not say that he never learned to learn to get or spray them, and he did not make them or that small fish farm trap (which was destroyed by one of the tornadoes) or that it did not hurt his bones from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> In the film the tornado shot I think you can call it too. My favorite part of this Camp Fest is walking to the window, especially Brian's Cliché Scenes, with Brian's slum bracelets (never mentioned in this book) and his Dad (all his things packed just fit just behind his truck With all things) seeing and abandoning "DAAAAAAAAAAAAADADDDDDDDD !!!!" (Although his father did not listen to him, but did not hear him) and he pushes his fist by the window (wtf?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the book, <br /> <br /> "I think they're mixing for Thanksgiving (they have a turkey in the counter.) He then completes his temporary home (three days in the film, but several months in the book) and his ax is still complete here in a dead tree (he did not even in the book): "home" <br /> Einid from the coat world said, "It's good that it's bad, and again and again is bad" </ P> <p> <p> I am someone who reads (does not read the book) and watch a movie or I book a book <br /> <br /> For those who read this book, create your imagination as an image, It's awful and will drop your thoughts in the book. <br /> <br
