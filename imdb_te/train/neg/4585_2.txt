The ideas that I submitted in this film are quite suspicious, but I have a lot of innocents about quantum physics, I remember from the wonderful "Short History of Everything Everything" and "A Brief History of Time," which is interesting at times. Ironically, it is ridiculous to have a clear understanding of the story of Indians who can not see explorers' ships. I really started questioning what Shawellor did at that time, but Clecher said that one of the speakers actually had some suspicion, "Ramtha", completely disappointing Applecott. What two hours waste.
