I'm sorry to say this, but the acting in the film is terrible. The conversation is the first time they read their lines. Perhaps I made a "dress rehearsal" version mistake. Directors use slow motion in special effects as an attempt to replace the actors' poor performance. The story is pretty well written, and I have seen the action scenes in many action films. Battles appear pretty true. But two well-known actors time and time will again happen if the amazing automatic point of fire is survived in an incredible amount of automatic weapon fire, bombs, morter rounds, and bazookas. The enemy soldiers certainly have some of the worst shots I have seen, especially when they have a truck that has escaped in their sights from 30 yards, and each shot shot is at least 50 feet wide. Those bazookas require serious site alignment.
