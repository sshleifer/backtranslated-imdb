<br /> <br /> The renowned actors team are in the lead role (with a pair of prominent exemplars), performing beautiful beauties. Penelope Keith is a lover of Aunt Lewis and Jonah Lamley as Diana is equally good. <br /> They are good with scripts. There are mean sets. It is not like the house described in Nanchero's book, although the house is used for the Deover House, which is unusual. Then the Dover House is too big. <br /> In the following episodes the writers decided to bring back the whole story back to the UK, reinventing Silen with perhaps little speculation to save money. <br /> Now evil. Screenplay. Such an unfortunate bad adaptation is harder to find words to condemn it. Edward Britain did not die, survive and survive in battle. He committed suicide after a short appearance - why? Livelie has altogether altered to a wise farmer who is in love with Gus, and she can love her love with less tears (than the little emotional brief encounter). Gus, love-loving man, was ready to leave his love without complaining. Walter (mud in the book) turns from a seductive loyal husband to a devoted family member. Jess talks about a mentally disturbed young woman. Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but is now without any justification. The army occupies the Dei's House, excluding a very little scene that feared the armored soldiers with Jess. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are very happy, I can not see how many times their show has gone on. Happily named Nettlelard is a worldly dobson. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if this sequel (I've lost interest in seeing this nonsense) and changes in the story. Rosamunde Pilcher's film was stuck in this fantastically pessimistic picture; When she bought the rights she lost control.
