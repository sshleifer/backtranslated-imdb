End started the game, at least say good about the end. It was only a matter of things that did not happen in the plot, for example, the journalist was initially very enthusiastic, intelligent, half way through the half way, really stupid and completely out of character, and the next scene would not make sense without it. The whole story may have been about 30 minutes, it would have made an average TV political drama. The magnificent Cuban Gooding Jr. is very much viewable and is considered a wonderful job by James Woods. <br /> <br /> The game honestly is one of the worst films I've ever seen ... and saying something, I saw Gigli.
