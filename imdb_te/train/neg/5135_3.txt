I think it's a frightening creepy, so this film does not let them do more. <br /> A group of thieves dropped an emergency parachute from an airplane into an enormous field. One of them missed the loot, while others were abusing him without abuse. This act is hammering and intimidating aspiration (they move out). On the positive side, the director gets some suspense from the constant horrific. As Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a table goes away and it's a surprise, the bomb is in the table but it does not come out, and it's suspense."
