Realistic picture, obviously, except the fact that the characters do not seem to be scared. When Billy Jane tries to kill anyone, he feels bad ... but he does not look. That's why I do not like his performance in the film. Tom Berenger has acted again as a soldier. Good thrill, realistic scenes. Not always shooting, it's a great thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter order, the terrorist kills almost the entire sea bunch ... i **
