I did not like this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I was very disappointed that the film would pull out of the huge hole that it dug, at least for me, came to the conclusion that the film is going to protect myself. Unfortunately, it did not. Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman have two pictures of the film. I do not know Lindsay Lohan's work because she is interested in bringing the film up. Later, I was disappointed in me, even though they were "moments" in each of their shows and three of them. I imagine that it's a daunting task given to the fact that everyone can find their "motions" character development and an incredible lack of uninspired dialogue. Although the storyline is an interesting factor, the film is very strongly written, directed and edited, as anyone who plays the role as an actor and is stigmatized. The alarming way of dealing with sexual abuse and the simple and insulting attitude of small town America is the two main reasons for failing to touch the mark of the film. As one reviewer observed and I agree, the film is almost impossible for a given market in full form. I hope that there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting room, or at least (for that of the actor anyway). Sad to us but the truth is that the actors take comfort in that and feel a little better about their talent and time lending such a flap. Oh and another thing ... I'd love to see an American movie, because there are also disappearing but exotic designs of the song, which do not have major characters and / or disrespectfully pop catches country, CDs and other such trash!
