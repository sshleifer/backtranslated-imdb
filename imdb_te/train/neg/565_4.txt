The difficulties I have with the musical form of "Les Miserables" apply to "Oliver" equally. Instead of writing composers of the stylized period of play settings, they wrote broadway-type melodies, which are historically unilaterally and in the style of the curve. Do not mix well with some sunny deities that are spread over the score. <br /> <br /> Boy does not help Oliver's casting matters: the temporary temporary and sad value, where it is less than solid. <br /> <br /> "There is so little of the tunes that he should perform when he has a strict composition, throat and deterioration as long as he's needed". The two big product figures, "Buy Who" and "Consider Yourself" are all produced, but the product is thrown out in the sink, one thing to go all out, yet another cross into another excess. <br /> <br /> The dark, disappointing and degradation of the novel does not seem to borrow such duties and choreography. While the novel is classics, Mr. Dickens is feeling embarrassed, and his writings release negative vibration. This may be due to the unhappy personal life extension, which is filled with frustration and sadness. <br /> <br /> The combined talent of this product can exceed the incomparable nature of the basic material in the camera or back. <br /> <br /> These results are becoming uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br />
