"I Love Love New York" is another entry through VH-1 (MTV Networks), showing a garbage, bad, feminine look. It's the most cruel, ebonyx talking, crazy contestant - and her mother - it's a simple decision to give them a show on this network. Many argue, "This is a performance". <br /> It reminds me of a skirt in Kinan Ivory Way from the 90's premiere "In Living Color". The "The Love Connection" was mimicked by boxer Mike Tyson on a dating show and he chose "Robin Givens" for a date. <br /> <br /> This show reminds me. <br /> Men have given names to degrade themselves and the woman they are dating. (I am a genius man looking at the date of a beautiful woman - she is not allowed to - and her mother - you give yourself a name that is ghetto, every time you appear on TV), but these are professional realty actors. <br /> <br /> This will help me to learn how to be fun about all these things. Is it true that her newly implanted additions are fake? 15-minute reputation and hundreds of thousands of dollars during the announcement for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make a buck.) Maybe wonder - who would like to be with this lady for an hour past? Surprise if she and her mother are in the next WWF! <br /> <br /> Does it hurt you? Now you see a number of times that the ruins of the train are not down to nil shock value now. <br /> There are no twists or twists, no different from others. There is another nail on the coffin about why the lowest common denominator and the reality show appeals to the so-called "end".
