It just saw yesterday in the SÃ£o Paulo Intel Film Festival. <br /> I'm out of the 15 minutes (never done) <br /> <br /> I do not like, dialogues are not bad and somewhere else, characters are different than dialogues, drive anywhere, and worst and worst : Siemens and Organics plenty of advertising in this movie. Although I have already paid to go to the movies and entertain, I still need to blow through the internet and her Siemens mobile popping up time with the main character chatting on her lap-top; Or cutting her hair to have another character bathing or just organics shampoo displays much on the screen! These are all bearable if plot, characters, romance, anything good, but bad, really bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
