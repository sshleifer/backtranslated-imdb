The weak entry in the Bulldog drummond series, as John Howard. Simple funny fun and pranks, but not too much plot. Barrymore is the inspector, drummant, algi and tenny wanting to disguise drummond for his doom, disguising himself to drive a satirical goose chase (perhaps more circular, perhaps a budget rather than usual), to protect the poor Phillis. For keeping the score, this one is drummond, plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and is worried about Alzheimer's baby's Christian. It is a pleasure to see Algie and Tenny fisherman as the fisherman, but the little one gets up.
