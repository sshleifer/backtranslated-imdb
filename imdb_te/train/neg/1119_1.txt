This film is still a terrifying film despite a joke in response to critics' response. At least if it is committed to some sort of joke ... . Otherwise he was worse than box office poison and jeron crab. The poorest's box office poison .... It's not really economically superfluous. '4th Man' Bourgeois's criticism ... what am I doing? That's not. Let's just say speculative, if it's supposed to be, it's not sharp enough. The irony is a tricky thing ... if it's not sharp then the viewer is just a joke's fault ...... I think what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable nuisance characters to care for someone and not just in a very interesting way ..... (More interesting and worthwhile application See what Louis Bunuel movie .... very sharp <br /> <br /> Really, Jonathan Crabby's role in the cemetery is very difficult to get the job done ... You also care? Is it funny? I can assume there was some misanthropic joke that gave him the benefit of doubt and out of control since Stur Voerhoven is supposed to be a good filmmaker ..... I am however he is Jeroen Krabbé is a pretentious bourgeois donkey he is the worst actor and every character he plays ... It's a very unusual satire unless it's inefficient. Mr. Wearhaven deliberately did so  శాడా? మరియు జోరోన్ క్రాబ్బే జోక్ యొక్క బట్ కూడా ఉంది? నేను దానిని చూడలేను ...... కాబట్టి నేను ఇక్కడ ఉన్న గందరగోళాన్ని సరిగా అర్థం చేసుకున్నాను? అతను మంచి డైరెక్టర్ గా ఉండాల్సింది ఎందుకంటే ఇది ఎప్పుడూ చెత్త చిత్రం. So there is some type of diupory. I know the 'patch adams' terrible without seeing it too. Worhoven's reputation as the '4th person' cheated impressive packaging or better director.
