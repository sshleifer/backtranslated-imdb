I have never understood the popularity of the American version of the American version of the two versions of Japan's ultra popular Super Siamese series over the past three decades! <br /> <br /> Many children say Power Rangers are the best, but they are wrong. <Br> /> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they will learn how well the super sendai is over the American version. <br /> Power Rangers is absolutely awful, instead try Super Centai! Find for better performance, instead try voltron the third dimension!
