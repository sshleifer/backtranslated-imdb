<br /> <br /> The long dancing scenes and characters coming out of the film - the film was nice to explain the story and the motives of the characters. <br /> <br /> Nuba, Minister, Atti, Mother - And there is no real depth in the film because of the mobility between the Hatsummo and Mamaha and Hatsummo and Sueri and by reducing important rivals. <br /> <br /> If you read this book you can not really understand why Seri Charmin loves and why he has become his teacher. <br /> Visually the image is fantastic - and the actors C rated script is all they have given, but that's good about this film.
