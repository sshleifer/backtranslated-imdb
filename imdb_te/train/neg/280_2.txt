God, I was bored from my head when I saw this pilot. I thought I would be James Cameron's huge fan (and not only from "Titanic", but I can add), and that its name was nominally a guarantee of quality. , He wrote the Strange Days Led ..). But the thing failed miserably at holding my attention at any time of its nearly two-hour time. At that time, it exceeded its two linear summaries, and I worked hard to find any coherent plot from all the chaos that never went away. On top of that, I do not think any regular "A-Team" episode also outcid acrobatics. For the Alba, yes, she is beautiful, of course, but the fact that she only displays the whole image (pouty and surly) of the same facial expression, I also make her "gary wit a stance" schtick pretty soon bore. You can spend me from Mr. Cameron
