Although the storyline is not discouraging enough, the film shows that the film was shot in a slaughterhouse for five minutes, but described his early life as the hero. Weird thing. Then he goes to the mainstream of the hero / heroine and cuts his dick because he said he had gone with him if he was a girl. This guy is a mental, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things far away? And what kind of painful childhood does he have? Although he was not adopted, he had to live with the nuns, first loved him, and then hated him because he hates him. He attempts to explain what he has done to us, but it really is very difficult. Such lamentable and unusual self-destruction. Did you think it was funny? What really is this?
