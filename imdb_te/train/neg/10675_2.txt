When you star star in the opening credits, you should recognize that you have read a good time (credit "Cuba Gooding, JR"). Some nice car chase, Shoot 'Em shoot, if you have all of the action' em up action, because, no plot is weak at best, and totally unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially those at the end of the Gooding, are disloyal after being worse and are nonpartisan when they are unsatisfactory. Andy Cheng I feel like to be a really good person to get these good actors in this foul project (he does not have all of them, he?).
