I'm a big fan of low-budget 80's horror films. It's not the worst but it's still amazing. The plot line is fine but pulls out too long. You're halfway before you see any zombie action. The killing is not very creative and zombies are not very insidious. I really think this film would have been better if they were left out of zombies and made into some mafia movie. It's worth watching but I think this film has stolen at least one hour of my life. I give some credit for the original original film. If you really have B horror films, it's worth a look, but if you're not, do not panic. But you do not have to take my word for it.
