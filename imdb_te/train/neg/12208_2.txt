Army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is insulting for those who fought in the Vietnam War. It is very little to say that the real SF soldiers who have suffered by these intellectuals are corrupt. If the film is sarcastic or cartoony, it gets better. But it took my foreigners, especially foreigners. Wherever I go in Europe at the end of the 80s, where am I and the Americans judging me through this film? Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A fraudulent, muscle-bound Cretin removed a jail mob to go to a secret mission in Asia to free some American POWS. In a running battle he will kill nearly 500 enemy soldiers, who can not get out of drugs with an M-60 machine gun and never overstay. And he never missed with a hand-held 32LB gun. I have gone, but I'm headache. I gave this 2/10 because it was slightly better than Rambo III.
