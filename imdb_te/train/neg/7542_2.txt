Suppose this is a mysterious and intense thriller about a guy looking for a missing girl. However, for 30 minutes, the film turns into a funny, dubious story with annoying characters and random scenes. Cage randomly karate that blonde girl kicks or can not imagine anyone laughing whether old woman is "bore". All of the lines, characters, and acting are all less likely to get-go. I always liked Nicholas Cage as an actor, but this year I've done some horrible movies; <br /> <br /> I do not like to see this story thriller that tells a bad story. If you really want to enjoy this story, take the actual rent. However, if you're looking to see it, be ready to laugh at some grooves and finish scenes. This is the only way you enjoy it.
