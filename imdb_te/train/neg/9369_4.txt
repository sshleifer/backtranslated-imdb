I have heard that this film is a bit dry, and Scott is looking at something else. At the beginning of the film I was great 20 minutes before the end of the classic cheeky, enjoyable Scot-Gets-Girl. The plot twist is crazy and unexpected and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed that it worked and all the credits were rolled down and until I realized that a happy and content is not going to end up, there will be some terrible misunderstanding. Unfortunately I was watching and leaving regretting that putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the great Scott's goodness was difficult!
