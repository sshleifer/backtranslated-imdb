The disgraced Ed Wood "Classic" Plan 9 an angry alien called the human race from the outer space, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!" <br /> <br /> Falling action star Jean Claude Van Dumm√© returns from the original film to a successful character for him. , Luke, a former Universal Soldier is now a good global universal soldier. Von Dumme's role in the first two sequels was again large, and was unable to do much in the fourth solo series in the Universal Soldier series. So, probably the whole way under his breath, he kicks and kills karts grunts and scowls through ninety minutes. You will see the brutal torture, but when you start looking at this thing, I advise you to get a coat check for your brain at the door. <br /> <br /> You really are responsible for forgetting the time it left. <br /> <br /> <br /> Luke is called against universal soldiers. All other universal soldiers become bad and unforgettable killers. <br /> <br /> This is a program that is programmed, but in this case they are not a killer of their creator, because it is not "enemy". <br /> <br /> I love the foolish logic of this movie. Because Michael Jai White is in this film, a supercomputer believes that he will create a body for himself. The logic that Seth creator is the blue-haired cyber-stereotype geek steals Cloyce more frequently than the Old Faithful. Logic with a climactic karate fight lashes two minutes on the screen for three minutes, while the glass has ten different pans, but two characters are reflected. <br /> <br /> In this film also a daughter, Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal solder, and a romance, I have to think that the writers thought it was shot on the characters that they really liked. And the movie ends, it ends. It's not a few minutes of running credits after a giant high-end end-style explosion. No preface, no matter what, last kiss, just explosion, hug, over. <br /> <br /> It's not Plan 9: US: TR is a crazy little trick of an action movie that Red is a fun party full of fans and Van Damm fans really reaching new heroes. Do not look at the stomach.
