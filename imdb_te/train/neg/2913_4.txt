However, the improvements in the Turkish film industry are great looking, but I guess something more from Togan Goebbark. Beginning from the script, it is believed that some people are not as wise as one might think. Especially if you are not smart enough to understand the dialogues, most of the time the movie is unable to bear the dilemmas of the audience that keeps the audience in a position. It's a clear end; You initially guess the murderer. It is impossible to act like ordinary people, such as radical psychiatrists specialists! They are not as ordinary people as medical professionals, as well as for professionals who work as experts and use all of the medical regulations ????? !!!!!! In the scene where the crew is looking for a very dangerous patient, there is another weird point of any weapon film to protect themselves. And the scene was very positive to the title "Deccat Saan Cybilier"! The weak parts of the film are not. Most of the film has ancestors. The most accurate patient scene from Hannibal is a very dangerous copy, and eventually Togan's performance is the greatest mistake he could have done in his very first film! Faz's interest in the film's greatness and interviews to the actor has been compelling to see them. Gen is total disappointment. I'm surprised, if Sahan is not this famous person, can Tango shoot this movie? I hope Togan can realize that I am not in fashion to play a role as director in an interview. It's Hutchcock made it clever and Night Shyamalan has been successful! If he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan, he must be sure to be more careful and creative in this big industry!
