If I did the first sequel well and in the end it was a good film then I was not strict in the sequels. By 1999 I thought that the first five films were Cruel Intentions. It's a great way to escape from a novel and has everything except the original story. For Cruel Intentions 2 it is open to the series based on a film called Manchester Prep. This should not happen. I can understand when I see the original image. I'm at least a writer before the subject starts and director Roger Kamble has done this too. I was disappointed in this movie for 1 minute. This starts with the original opening resume with a different twist Sebastian rather than naked as a naked picture of a fake daughter's school principals run by a net school. This is exactly what the Lady 50 did not look like. And primarily the remaining image of Vanabe carbon copy of the original. This means that if there is any mistake it means the way I understand it. But you can not do that with the movie. This is actually a prequel I just gave them a chance to see how they turned out as they did. But Sebastian is more or less just a prankster and one of Catherine's being a true story and he is not the foundation for this film to be Sebastian into sexual predators. Whoever actors will do this. They tried at least to look like the original cast, but they really gave some really good actors. I use this term because I do not know why. <br /> <br /> In this film, no one has ever done it. <br/> <br /> <br /> This is the film, which is a group of liner. Another bad thing from Part 1 is that you have a part to understand that you need to work for their attention because it has one of them because there is no involvement with teer parents and they are less used to show children. It did not work. The best thing about the original though is that they have the chemistry they took you into this world. The tension on the screen is what made it picture. This will definitely destroy the first traffic experience from scratch.
