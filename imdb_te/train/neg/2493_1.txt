Really terrible movie. I did not know this kiwi effort first - but soon I began to realize that all the characters were speaking with vague kiwi under the fake Americans. Why is America required to set up? - It may have been set in NZ and then actors can use their regular voices. Are you able to hear terrible endeavors when talking to American composers with the structured team? Bad bad image. I'm wondered why this long lasting one - how can not this be? It just seemed like a seagull / whistle-type action-man movie very little effort. The whole waste of money! If there is no tax payment in this piece of trash, I would have led a revolution that includes all the money back to the Treasury. I'm still in the perfect trash I have just seen (get it, pun, turn!). Why did I continue to look? Well, I am helping a movie freak and cann, me!
