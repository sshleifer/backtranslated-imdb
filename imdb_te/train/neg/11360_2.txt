Okay, so, somebody, somewhere, a few years ago, was stowing away from Apollo 11 and thought it was a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies going on the moon. So they are. Anyone, somewhere, is an idiot. /> <br /> I give evidence of doing homework on the hardware to give artists. As far as I can say, rockets and launch hardware are in the bang. The graphics are pretty cool - the rocket launch, which gives me a cool rocket launch as always (my popular mechanics flying car GearHead blood still runs strongly) and 3D is pretty effective. CG Pixar-not quality, but it's generally good. There are some half-assed delayed anthropomorphics, some half-assed thrown for the color of the flies (like hippie afros and black shades, black-shades, black-shades, etc.) and maggots looked like grubs more human baby heads (although they made succulent gross squelching sounds). /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . In a film intended for iMaks, they dropped out of an incredible opportunity to sneak into some educational content about physical and space travel - they could not get their physics they couldn '(please burn zero-g in lunar module during landing). Original radio papers between Houston and astronauts Not even bothering to read, all of which are in the public domain; Instead they get their own conversation, sounds like a brush </ br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But we liked maggots .. Uh, yes. 1.5 / 5.
