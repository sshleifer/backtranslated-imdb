I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this image look. Disappointed. Plus the good side that leads to the male side, and some interesting photography but the whole failed to convince this picture. While trying to say something meaningful, it has its own self-determination significance but is shorter in all of the films and has an incredible mess in all. <br /> <br /> "One of the films that has been classified as a movie" <br /> <br /> "A film star has been identified with an undoubted, fatigue, fantasy, and dull characters". <br /> Here's the story: 3 Loss of mental illness, drinking, laziness, debt etc. and kidnapping a kid with each other and conspiring to outwit each other is causing their cooperative problems flawed on each other. <br /> <br /> An improved film story is more confined to kidnapping kidnapping instead of kidnapping failures. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do,
