... from this awful movie! Acting, acting, directing, compilation etc. are rare, and it is somehow topped and proves to be absolutely worse. Music! The film has two music directors. Because every single frame music has music, the "D" movie style will definitely move. They never heard of expression, "less is". This is very painful to listen, the conversation is not good, and every time I mute the sound. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see the characters like this in the twilight of their careers. Look at your own risk.
