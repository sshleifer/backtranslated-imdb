I rented only because I first rented it. However, it was called the John Wuders Vampires: Los Murdos is just a trick to rent. <br /> <br /> He is indeed the executive producer and apparently of the film (Jeepers Creepers?) <br /> <br /> A tragic hero, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi's least acceptable Vampire Hunter All the time. It's not too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> We are ending a terrible script and undoubtedly a bad and unhappy movie with bad and critical acting. This will only reduce the low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid the bubonic plague.
