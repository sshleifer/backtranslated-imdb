I did not see this when I was pregnant. My eyes shouted and / or vomit. This is mainly a disturbing kind of disturbing. I personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way. But I was cringed when she touched herself in the belly stomach and the rusty roles were low when she left the child in her 3rd quarter. Also, an animal lover is almost crying when I take a cat to her bleeding pulp. However, I'm separating myself to live as a baby and as a creepy and evil. And I have a lot of interest to see the sequel in this film ...... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... .....
