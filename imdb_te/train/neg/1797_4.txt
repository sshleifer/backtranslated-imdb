The film is very hard-to-swallow by the scales of the film. We want to take the dead person back to the record, but we want to record recorded messages that specifically target the singer when the child is not injured. There is no way to know who the record ends. Anyway, the film is happy for a while, but ultimately the illness and nonsense rule is supreme. If they really were trying to create a new Freddie horror icon, they stopped: the villain does not inspire any personality, does not stimulate and vary. (* 1/2)
