A group of women who did not work in the smoke pot to sit around and talk. They are another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because they are handicapped, and occasionally some store-purchased ham they've worn by sticking on some plastic fingers is really this man to kill some of the human flesh. We do not see anyone killing them, suddenly there is a body on the ground, covered with a blood test sheet. Because of this I can no longer spam the cover on the sheet. The idea of ​​spam covering through a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoletic fit brought by trying to get through all of this film. The occasionally randomized sequences of a person who accidentally inserted "hunted", had his basement to harass some of his chairmen. Why he never caught this guy and he never explained how to connect to the Sit-on-the-couch sisters. Some of the "supernatural" scenes are also scared. <br /> <br /> He pushes through a blood and a wall, but does not explain what is wrong or wrong with him or is bound to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no story. If you're sitting around some boring people and want to talk about nothing while eating ham and smokers, then here is 90 minutes, because in a chick a street street corner and some random scenes, nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, when you go to their new apartment, look to move some items including sister with disabilities. Not sitting on the couch or lying on the couch.
