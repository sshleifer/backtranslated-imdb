This is not one of the worst movies ever. Worse, my older hero dolph was in it and he starred. The story of Jesus is actually very good but the path that has been conducted has also hurt my body. Fighting scenes for starters were portrayed as a fight between two male giraffes in slums. Actors, who can not help you, except for the successful dolph, but if their reason is for all of the director's friends, they should not be by the way, or else. This is ยง 12 million that spends an unexpected way, because of the effects of the effects and scenery, the cost can not be 1 per cent above ยง1000.
