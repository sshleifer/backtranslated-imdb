This movie is not very bad; Many comments suggest the obvious errors of the script, but it is worth watching. People like Justin Timberlake cast for movies, and that really cries for me for movies like this but really gives me creeps. I have never heard of the name of man before I look at it, but very instant he seemed I was plain irritation. The voice is worse in the pose, the face is a bad split of Legolas, and he can not properly coordinate all three. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey I have enjoyed it when I left the disco as I had hoped for it ever since. Very wrong I'm wrong. Both these and also LL Cool J give me a very good performance and the main reason I give them a 4. <br /> <br /> I'll watch many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast ....
