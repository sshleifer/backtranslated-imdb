In the 1980s T. Rama Rao has done some very beautiful pictures, but in changing times, he is seen as an unmanned filmmaker with styles and fashions. <br /> The actors would not be good, it was not good. Anil Kapoor generally convinces both the father and his two characters, but the flawed script often makes him funny and curious. The curve is good, but then - she's always nice, and here it is not more than that. She is the best she has given, but she always does that. In the end, nothing is great. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Is not it a delayed movie? Well, it's still authentic. The script is terrifying, the film is overdone and the story has not gone anywhere. It was considered as the film made in the early 1990s, but the script looks bigger, the style being from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of actors.
