When I look at this film in this song, it's a documentary that I've listed as a documentary. As I have seen, I started laughing, thinking of me and hoping that this person really believes this truth? So I had to watch it, now let's see this is a movie, but now that it is not a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. SO, either way, it's very bad. I did not do that in the end. I had to shut it down. I was a NYC Police Officer, and I thought it was going to mislead anyone to think of this documentary with the intention of earning money on me and my colleagues for a terrible day. So, I took a little personal. Maybe that's my eyes, and it's not as bad as I personally think. Everyone has their opinion.
