I found that this time, effort and money is completely waste. I know that Disney always has creativity while doing "straight video" movies, but it's an all-time low to replicate the plot of the original movie with a "new perspective" ... they'll soon be back, releasing the original animations with new animation and new songs, New version of the picture in love ". Nathan Lane is surprisingly again coming back to the role of Timon. <br /> <br /> The story of Timon and Pumba animated animals from the original "Lion King" world will tell us what the original story is really telling. <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are dull and the animation is worse. Are you impressive for a video feature for the voice talent, but again, when were you last time that Matthew Broderick, Woopti Goldberg or Nathan Lane marked the point of real commercial material? If you like the whole, you hate it. This is insulting because it is unfair to children and adults. And that's about it.
