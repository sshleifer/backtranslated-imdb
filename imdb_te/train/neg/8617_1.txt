I saw 10 minutes of this film, and I saw my toe curling for 30 minutes. I can not just believe: the film is very scary. In fact it was very awful, I thought it would be all over (!). At this time, I reminded myself of the comedians from the 60s and 70s called Danish. It is as follows: Take the most famous comedian, putting this comedian up in the most strange situations, jokes (specifically a-liners) and spice up with cute young couples, and you have a success! I do not know if the film is successful, but it seems that there is a market for this kind of film in America with some quiet comedies (some great comedies), rather than the Danish tradition.
