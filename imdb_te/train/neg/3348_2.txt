The 1963 version of "The Hunting" was one of my favorite horror films, so I thought I would be better off with this 1999 remake release. It is rarely seen to be true or equal to the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my worries are well established: the film sticks. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people are involved in this movie. John Doug Bond, he's a little bit (or more bad) here, when he has directed his amazing "Speed" with "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control". "I do not think he is really capable of turning back into bad performance - but he can not save the slow script and the weak story." Catherine Zeta Jones once again proves (but not all) She did in "Entrapment") to come up with more than what she had given her The lady leader who made great in the episode of "The X-Files" appears to be perfectly cynical, like Eleanor, Inner, and that sleek man is wooden than laughably strange statuettes of the carcasses carved around someone else's home. <br /> < <br /> <br /> "Whether the house really is haunted or invented by Eleanor's offensive mood. The main feature of other great horror films, such as "The Changing" and "The Blair Witch Project" - no souls are actually visible to the imagination. In this updated version, we get CGI deviations tons, which is mainly a thoroughly ridiculous image (in a weak script / theme background). F / x is not even great, they are made by ILM. Frozen breathing is particularly fake. These effects I have seen in the lesser Peter Jackson film "The Futures," are very early. Carcasses carving creepy children, crazy (especially when they laugh out loud), and CGI monsters have nothing to write home. Instead of providing relief from bad acting, bad direction and bad writing, effects are only added to the mess of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the most dumb scenes: Eleanor bedroom with three other characters, and no one will be surprised to find a huge scowling monster hovering on the bed. Eleanor's home is a scene from the rape of a former lady ... It's very bad to act here. And last, but at least, Wood utters an uninspired shout of supposed to be a burning guy, accidentally hits up a piece of hilarious bit furniture, and starts to slash away at old, bad guy painting. Just a few seconds after this attack, some of us have been satisfied with this past, the Guild Guy pulled into the oven by the ghost of the old Guy and immediately cut his head through the mud. <br /> <br /> Overall, stick to the original 1963 "The Hunting". 3/10 stars.
