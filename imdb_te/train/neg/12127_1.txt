Sorry for Fulci fans, but I could not get through this. The soundtrack was annoying when they arrived, acting was very passionate, the story was done and was done, and the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> The massacre seemed to be an honest children's film project. But I've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this! It seems underfunded they can not afford ... anything! Not a DoP, not a director, no one even having a clue what is acting remotely. This is a very poor film experience; <br /> <br /> It's about the worst cook fest that I saw next to Terror Thones, from the Outer Space to Killer Cloves. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
