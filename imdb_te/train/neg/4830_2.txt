Really? Really ???? You know if you make a political battle movie, but this film is just worse. Terrible in every angle. In many ways terrible mistake. I have an easier time suiting up, flying the United States president, a jet fighter, and shooting down aliens. It's easy to note some things that are true. When I told some people that my jaw was the best in the last 25 years, I fell off. <br /> X Box, YouTube, ACUPAT FEATURES Did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? You do not have to do extensive research, it's only five years since the end of the film. I am an Iraq War veteran and if you spend one day with an infantry platoon or an EOD team you can use B.S. This is a picture. It's ridiculous to compare to this platoon or saving private ryan. Why do not you throw there commando and red dawn; I think that might be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If you look at the plot, historical and real contradictions that you do not believe, the film may be right for some reason. Not much more. When you hear "Oscar Buzz", add your own Pumpwa's Review and go ahead. I'm writing the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
