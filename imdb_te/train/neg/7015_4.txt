"54" is a film based on the infamous "studio 54" in the 1970s - hangout for social high and party clubbars. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on Studio's original employee from 1977 - 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it's all glitter and not style and substance. It tries a really horrific and investigating irony like "Boogie Nights" but ultimately comes across a low-wannabe. Playing Mike Myers cocaine-snorning club owner Steve Rubel will be grateful for the job. It only plays a slightly more humorous role and has made their best efforts at the time of acting as dramas like Lemon and other comic actors, a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" is another dumb teen movie that is interesting but rather entertaining or remote. See your own danger.
