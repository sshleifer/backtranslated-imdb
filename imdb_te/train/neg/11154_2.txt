This action was on TV last night. I guess it's a perfect time because it is badly sucked! There is a need to show some teats and donkey about the beginning of the film and somewhere half way. (Though not bad tits and donkey). But the words of the story are very ridiculous. "Wolf", if you can call it, can not fully protect his teeth. When it's totally in sight, you obviously have some internships working on the CGI, he runs on a treadmill and all the shiny :), the CGI fur. The image is full of gore and blood, and you can easily find that you're killing / killing / eating. <br /> <br /> These films are disappointing if you like the movies they like and they can not do a good job. <br /> <br /> Do not start with me. Scream at everything about 5 seconds each of the girls. But again, when I ask me to do a bad act, give me some bucks, then hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Total boring and ludicrous horror.
