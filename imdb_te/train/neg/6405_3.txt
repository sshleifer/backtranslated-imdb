This is just a series of small skits acting on a real plot, some very old jokes. I initially chuckled one or twice, much to my anger. But also 73 minutes only this movie is too long before the welcome and will be worn and tedious (creeping here and there with some nudity you wake up). The film is also pretty bad (and pretty bad), which is pretty much a comedy gesture compared to Aaron Sultzer and Jason Friedberg (Date Epic, Epic film, Spartans Meat) <br /> <br /> My Candy: 3 < <br /> <br /> "This is the trailer for the movie;" Deer Pit "," The Farmer " "Engaging Ones", "Power Play", "Soul Survivor", and "Wiki Taxi"
