If you do not see this movie, * splyers * do not read anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> After the discouraged "fancys II" Tom Man kidnapped Mike, but Reggie and the new boy spend much of the rest of the movies trying to get him back and end up slavery in Tall Man's "Red Planet". This one gets really crazy: thieves trilogy in the bright pink voice are not only for comic relief, and black karate chick (she can not remember her name) so irritating her role could not wait to see if I killed Tallman. In the end it's going to be Tim's character, which comes to the end and finally the hero, but ... it does not work that way. By the end of the story, Liz Killer was cut off by Midgets, Mike would have a silver sphere in his skull, sphere regimen and dwarfs get Tim, and finally there was no one to stop the Tall Man. <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1993 and was not released until '95, and the end was in the end, and it was frustrating and fit to this prestigious small miniseries and the perfect finish. But the fourth will change this term and add new badger jokes and even worse and more involuntary ending ... <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
