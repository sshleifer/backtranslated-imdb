Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (Wacher in the Woods) Hough-directed image is so small. <br /> While it does not have torture in Gary, it does not have storyline sensibility and "letters". <br /> The title's "incubus" is a ghost with mammoth penis that converts rug sperm into vaginas during intercourse - or more accurate, rape. John Cassavates, who is shining out of his successful directorial career, has been convinced as a doctor who inquired about the extreme attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrors of the victims who increase demonic children are not considered - the tolerance of a slow mood to the audience. <br /> <br /> The objective of the script to address the dramatic effects of this fertile precinct illustrates major problems with this big Big-scrolling-on-the-loose workout.
