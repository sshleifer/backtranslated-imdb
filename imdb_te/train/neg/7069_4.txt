It was a huge hit when the film was released, and it soon became a blockbuster. But it is a ridiculous watch with a story which is a loser of the film. "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" is the sweetness of love but it is immortal in Bali - the film is the tag line. Hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices for his love story (Pooja Mahatma Gandhi) both loved each other! The meaning of his justification tag-line. This film influenced so many young broken broken hearts that they did not pay much attention to these "losers" and hence they went with their lives. Ganesh's acting in the film is stupid and uncivilized. In fact he looks funny in a song, (Onde or Sari ...) when he is supposed to look all beautiful and cool. His appearance does not help the main character. His hair style is badly held in most part of the film. Pooja Gandhi Kant ACT. This image in her suit is horrific and very different. <br /> <br /> The best part about this film is the amazing cinematography and excellent music by Mano Murthy. The lyrics written by Jayant kaikini are very well written. Director Yogaraj Bhatt has praised the songs that are portraying songs in an exciting way. <br /> <br /> Anything else, except for the songs, the movie is very simple !!!!!!
