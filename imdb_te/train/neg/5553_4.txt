This third darkman is much better than the second film, but is much worse than the original. Bad Guy was changed and the fact that Durant did not bring back what made D2 better. There is some indication of character development when it comes to the evil person's family and Darkman. It made my heart soft and I gave this picture 4/10, ie ** / *****.
