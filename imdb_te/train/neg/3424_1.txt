You can never watch the movie and still know that The Jerk Two is a disaster. <br /> <br /> "When it's made up" is not a question because if you throw someone money, tell them to do the movie, they will do that. <br /> The question is, "Why, why Steve Martin let it?" I think he needs money to fight a nuisance and decided not to spend anything for him. He knows that the sequel is not so terrible, with pride, it does not count his royalties as revenue. <br /> <br /> This sequel is not an embarrassment, but Karl Gottlieb and Steve Martit revived the country's favorite poor black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" Blankfield?): It's transparently clear that you have worked on this film with some tragic potential and the only way to enjoy your interaction is to be a lone cheerleader of continuity as an IMDb customer comment. I'm praying for you irritating, but alas, you're really trying to spin. Why not 10 stars?
