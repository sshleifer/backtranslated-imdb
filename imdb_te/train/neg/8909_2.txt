This film is lame and not funny. The plot also does not make sense. Some scientists from the field of science open a door to another (perhaps hell ???) and his daughter sucks it or something, then one day she is back and now she has a big chest and wears a little outfit (I guess the demons in the other sense She) wants her main character to marry her boyfriend, But she is homosexual, she is more interested in her new girlfriend, and they end up spell book on this witch (they want witches or something ???) and when the bad alphabet is read again, this is only a bikini top girl and a spurious guy in love It comes to clear ground. There was no reason for my absence and my boyfriend was a wrestler who was very familiar but his piece was absolutely unnecessary, and certainly they did something to keep him, because perhaps the wrestling fans actually did not understand this. I'm sure the girls without either do not hurt either. Additional features on the DVD are more confusing than the rest of the images, but I think it can help explain what's going on but it's actually more confusing. Who are these people, what are they doing? It is basically a go-camping-to-fight-at-fight-a-monster film, but it is a group of things (like other size and book seller) rather than confusing. I do not like the film but it's like a big deal like five bucks. Though it is very intelligent, I do not recommend watching it, it's not good for any part of the film.
