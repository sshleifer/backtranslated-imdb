There is nothing new to say to me: 4 hours people die in the same hill and die. Star cast, but unfortunately looks like producer / director / editor / god. He hired a true script writer and hired a real editor, who did not appoint a musician, in some ways (some cheap versions of "Apocalypse Now" on Indian drugs Seemed to hear), a true professional staff Exceeded, all the throwing of fireworks, said the real story. Unfortunately, he made big decisions in the Indian army and made terrible decisions for his actors and his audience was terrible. We all died over. <br /> Do not do that again, sir! <br /> <br /> ps: The Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha Regiment the next time, and I suggest that he appoint more than one Nepali to represent the team. There are certainly Nepali men who work in Bombay - the last count is from 40,000 to half million.
