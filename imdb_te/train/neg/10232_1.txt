This is one of those plays that is so bad that it's almost so funny, the script is completely terrible, the terrible terribly, completely igniting lighting, the only thing that's good from letting it be good is that it's good and the sound design is very bad; This adds no suspense to the story, but it does not destroy at least any of the speeches. There are continuity issues with seasons of doors shots throughout. Last but not the act is not afraid. It has the experience of their university media project for a professional product, sorry to forgive anyone to keep their names.
