This film is terrible. Carlito's Way (1993) is a great movie. Good carpallus is not one of the best crime films ever. This image should be considered for STING Part 2 or perhaps Zone Zone. Remember those gems! The film is the only reason to invest in cultures of the original film. The film did not work hard on de Paula, Pacino and Penny. There is not a preferred character and it is responsible for everyone. I think RAZZIE can succeed and I hope it will find some new categories to have a new record. After I saw this S @ * TEST film, I sat down and saw the way of the original Carlito to get bad bad taste from my mouth. After looking at this, I come across and hunt me from my troubles.
