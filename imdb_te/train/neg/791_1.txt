Some scribble writers sit around a table and "Show a black woman in the street to be black on the street and ask him if he is black, then go out". As the other writers suggest repeating in each episode, the epilepsy is about laughter. More laughter. If you think the campus is funny, and there are many different conditions in the event, you will enjoy this event. For the rest, use your jetper and find something fun as watching more and more dry. Writing of the luminous reports of this program must make them come out more or be forced to watch the genuine comedy television. Another example of humor in the program, a girl trying to hypnotize a cashier tries to pay at a supermarket checkout. The first time in a variety of shows with different cash is simple, funny but why repeat? I can give other examples but this can only be treated as spoilers, divulging why the comedy is not just funny.
