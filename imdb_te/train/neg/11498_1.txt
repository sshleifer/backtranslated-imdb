Ghadar is one of the most deadly overtered films in Bollywood. The film is directed by Anil Sharma, who loves to act over time. The songs are boring and the type you want to hear in your car, the full volume. Sunny Deol is known for making Daft films, where he pushes 100 bad guys to himself. He also kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car away (Teesri Aankh). I will give you 50 more examples of Sane Deol's insult. But I know many already already. A similar character repeats itself. By using violence, a man who claims to be fighting for his countries. Amisha Patel falls in the hands of a dead body with dead body that he loves bones. But this film could not be avoided from the disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like her, she is not in the film. Perhaps she is playing a Muslim role, but she does not act in the film. Overall, this is a poor performance, I appeal to some people who love watching Bollywood actor hit 100. Will you be.
