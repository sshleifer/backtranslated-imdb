This film promotes the development of the mind. Read the book! It would be wonderful to think someone deserved the time and investment to make this film. I've seen "B" movies before but the "C" film just discovered. Since I stopped watching my kids I did not think the Power Rangers would be enjoyed, but I'm looking for videos for fifteen minutes "Nights." High school productions are better than this and the participants involved in it should be removed from their resume. There are many interpretations of the mind. My roommate, who loves this kind of films, also stopped it. Now you have to say something really. If you see this movie, I pray for you.
