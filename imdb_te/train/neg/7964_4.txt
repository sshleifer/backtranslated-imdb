"Cryprix 2" is slightly more than the pale imitation of the original film, designed to be less than cash on the last film's name. It often increases its previous deficits, which are speculative and heavier. Still, the first time around, it had enough thrills for periodic movements, resulting in an unusually fun and fun attempt. The sequel has some useful moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more clear. <br /> <br /> In the original story, all the stories revolve around the common plot of revenge and just desserts. A wooden man takes revenge on his employer's killers. Young people eat by a water giant. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to continue the negligent motorcycle. None of these premises are inherently bad, but are not completely inspired. There are some surprises and no fears. This is a textbook example of unmotivated, by-the-numbers filmmaking. This cheap-looking movie does not help in having a flat direction style, to be honest, there is not much to work on. In the end, the second story is the best, but not too much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the shows are the best. George Kennedy is an unfortunate general shop owner, especially if not inspired job. Dorothy Lamourr, on the other hand, is a good-minded motorist and is in line with his plight, despite speculation and repetition. However, the characters are pretty thin. <br /> <br /> "Creepshow 2" is considered a better one. George Romero, originally directed by Stephen King, based on the narrative of the stories, returned the screenplay. Make-up effects artist Tom Savin will change some good, scary work. Why is the film a bit daunting? I did not think Romero really wanted to make a second film, but was forced to do it for financial reasons. This is a decade's horror sequels, clones, rip-offs and etnot, so this is absolutely inevitable. I guess the script writer guy, his cash withdrawal, and running. He predicts that I need to fund his own projects; We can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (From ****) <br /> <br /> New World Pictures
