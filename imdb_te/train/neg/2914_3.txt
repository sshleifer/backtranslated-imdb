The title above is used to introduce a movie to "audiences". The gene is a sick mother about a doctor (doha rutky). This film starts with her mother leaving her to start her new job. When she was running, she was not in the house because she was in a remote area in the hospital. As soon as she enters the hospital garden, she sees the body's death. <br /> <br /> It begins with a nightmare in the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital for suicide. In fact, they need to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to all weather conditions. Their communication is much cut off from the outside world. There is no way out !! In those few days, there are more dirty murders. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea was good. It was really scary. Of course there are positive shoulders of the film. I really like the beginning of the film. Especially, when she goes to the hospital and her first moments at the hospital. The actions are ok. Some of them are trying hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the last shock should have been expanded out of the picture. I'm telling you, it's a good turn, but in the end rather than a parody, we've seen what's going to happen. I thought the director did not work completely. The most dangerous patient in the film is at the age of 48 but his body is very young for the person who spent most of his life at this hospital. Finally, I want to say a few things about the director. I'm sure he will improve. This was his first attempt. I recently realized he was just 21 years old. It is more positive about him and his future films. I do not rate this movie though *****.
