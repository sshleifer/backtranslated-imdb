This is how the film is junk. I know that it is bad at first in the premise, but also with the embarrassing effects of combining large amounts of people in general-sized (causing effects in Hercules too). But the most terrible part of the movie is dialogues. It's totally irrelevant, crazy and stupid. I thought it was a 9th grader of creative class and earned D. <br /> <br /> I have my share of cheesy and bad movies (I love the series of tremors), but this ... I do not recommend it at all I wish to slap Casper van Dm and other actors. It's silly and completely flabbergastingly bad dialogues make you cringe.
