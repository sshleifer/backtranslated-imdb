When you seek the dragon to eat each cast member, you have to read some of the other comments, you know that you are in for a bad ride. <br /> I went in very, very low expectations, and did not let down. Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, though, this is a really ridiculous (and unexpected) throughout the funny <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW- /> <br /> All plots do not have the first <br. /> <br This is very different. The "small" bugs like the dragon growing within 3 hours is about the past, the whole idea based on it is messed up. Look, the movie dragons really wants to believe that the dragon eggs came from outer space in the form of meteorites. After illustrating this, some farmers talk to one with his pitch fork and the dragon goes out. Later, the task of "crazy scientist" is how long the dragons have grown dinosaurs. So obviously when humans are around dinosaurs, or we have a fine small plate hole here. The main thing is that the experiment was blown up with the "strong" energy used for Hiroshima. Then two guys walk in checking everything later, and it is almost unscathed! There is also another dragon, which is thriving who knows what to do. All in all it's very predictable. As soon as Clone says, I guess they want to clone a dragon. That means that if you ignore our Mr. Smarty-pants security Guy film you know that the dragons are like you know about this film is not so intuitive and smart. <br /> <br /> When putting aside, the second worse is "special effects." Others initially mentioned the CG helicopter and the fake rocks in the dragon. This is a bit better than a blob, but when it cuts the hall at the same time, it destroys it. For their credit, the flying dragons in the beginning looked okay from far away (one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie.) But these things are funny to watch. Millions of different scenes of the same person who are in different ways are not visible scenes. "Introduction" screens with Nar key statistics. <br /> When coming to the stars, they are not great, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what's more than a number of recent participating actors "BloodRayne," for example, and you've got to give them points for that. But one thing I have noticed is that the woman who plays Meredith is often easier than the rest of her face with her face. <br /> <br /> She looked like a bad run with a white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and cheesy. You do not really recognize the music, but it's actually quite a part of it. <br /> Not too bad for <br <br /> The bottom line is that only funny things are bad CG effects, even though you do not see (unless you want to see it because you want to see it bad). In addition, do not waste your time and money.
