The 2 points are dedicated to a reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood movies can not really work realistically, but Walt Disney's production is more realistic than this platform. The father dies and makes no good parent ... kick his son to his son's wife's son. 'Indoor swimming pool in the' bedroom 'bed and some things that are very difficult to swallow and go from those who are hungry in her aunt's garden shed? 2. Akshay suddenly got a job as a stunt man, poured dogs would be bitten, then just walk. This film is an INSulT for our intelligence I really take my family to see it and believe that people make 'this film' financially, we leave the movie with an angry look, please see this mess is not your comment and do not waste your 'no' waste.
