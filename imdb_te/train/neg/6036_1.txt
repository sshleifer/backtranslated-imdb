An unknown cast who appears to be likely to be that way, is another cheap slazer film that surprises me as this "movie" is still released. I have no problem with the horror and slasher flicks in particular, in fact they are my favorites. But when they finish this bad, it is not surprising that there is such a hard time to really take the monkey and not the genre. The story is clogged and hollowed out by this zombie / ghost guy without any imagination with a bunch of people in a cabin in the woods. Its not too much of its story, its vicious acting and duyouse, home-directed quality and an awful soundtrack. Do not tell the funniest effects and some amazing lazy paintings - these morals are clearly out of daylight and do you believe in the night? What was the idea of ​​the director with this move? What has he got in this film all day only one day? Was he scared of darkness? <br /> <br /> I think the positive attitude of the actors will look like the people who work in the local supermarket. So at least they can not escape from this film. <br /> <br /> "Teenage" plays Bingo in the local pub - but she is 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anything good for a laugh but cine and time is a different waste.
