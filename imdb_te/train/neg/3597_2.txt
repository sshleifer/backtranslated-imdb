Well, you have another fantasy in my account. Two, indeed! First of all, I do not hear about Joseph W. Sarno first, though I want to think of a little about 70's euro-robbery and its most fruitful journalists. Here is a man who made movies for seventy cannibals and cult laden and I never saw one! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, even worse, the director's most famous and planned "masterpiece" occasionally discourages discouragement, as you have discovered a new source for vague cult movies. Nevertheless, lesbian bloodthirsty films form a pretty sub-genre, but some of them bathe in ominous environment and interesting romance (such as Jose Larrage "Vampires" or Harry Kammal's "Daughters of Darkness"). Joseph Sarno's film did not give anything, excluding the amount of nakedness nicer, and soon becomes boring. These events take place in a solitary old castle hidden in the mountains of Germany that have been malicious and bloodthirsty (literally) refuted five centuries ago. Her loyal disciples still deny naked dance parties in the grave of the castle, cutting candles in a penis shaped form and wanting to reproduce the boronji at any time soon. Suddenly young and sexy female guests are in a completely filled fortress (no matter how much), so more romantic rites occur. Enough is tasty and fun enough, but the "Devil's plateau" is not unthinkable and facial expressions are just incomplete for cast members of the cast! Saro√±o was unable to create a suspense or build a gothic atmosphere (or just bother) and the actress's capabilities stand in front of the camera and stand in the camera and really take a curious face. Please be positive: if you're trying hard to see all the melodious lesbian-vampire movies of the 70s, this is not a penny value! Jess Franco and Jean Rolling's performances are also pure art as compared to this art.
