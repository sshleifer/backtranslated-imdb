For most of the hastei movies, it is very weak. Continuity is pretty lousy, you do not have to continue to characterize enough to feel really like what the characters mean. Peter Faulk was great, and he was one of the reasons for looking at its value. Fall has some great songs, "He's right back, he buys some cultivation" or something like that ... there are some actors, but the cause of the actors is entirely responsible. Direction, script and editing is pretty lousy.
