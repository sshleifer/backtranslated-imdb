This image is too long gray. The film describes quite a bit, so the weird scenes seem to have a deeper meaning, but they can not understand how to look and feel simply because of the heroic path. It's the sort of forces you see in the movie again but there's no way I'm going to do that. I saw this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I saw this film in the evening I had fallen asleep. I like this movie like a poor man's "Blade Runner". <br /> <br /> The movie will lose many questions and dissatisfaction. This makes the movie nonsense and a permanent impression. <br /> <br /> The weird form of this movie is not very helpful. The film is based on Sagan CGI / Halve Real Life, but it is better not to be impressive, impressive, and imaginable as an example in the next films like "Sin City" and "300". They created half the image characters through the computer, which looks like a very meaningless and odd choice, considering that it is not too impressive looking at the character animation. <br /> <br /> The future environment is still good looking and the film is not cheap to make it clear, but its style on its style and it's not really good to say in this regard. <br /> <br /> There are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. The main god of the film constantly reveals such lines; 'I'm going to do this but it's not your concern that I do so.' Just do not say anything at Mr. Horus! If you do not care to explain something about the plot, it's a very simple thing to keep in frustration and movie. The deepest questions and meanings of the film are slid in the movie and its script. <br /> <br /> Actors still make their best. They seemed like they believe in the project and what they are doing is unique. <br /> The story and the movie are not very original. It breaks down from classic and semi-classics, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. <br /> <br /> This is also due to the very repetition of the film. <br /> <br /> Failure, unpleasant cinematic experiment. <br /> <br />
