This image disturbed me! When I think of a cat in a hat. I'm thinking about a cat in the cap books. You know, as parents have read their children for a few years. Well, I like this movie too! But my profits do not have much books! Insted which is like the film of young adult humor. A gardening tool (hi) cat in one episode is the same as its hei (Azeen adult joke). I was slightly unpleasant for a child's image while naming his car name. In the rating you get: lightweight chicken humor and some double entenders. I feel younger this adult joke. I want to get this film back! The Wal-Mart movie was opened because they were not. If you are thinking about buying this I suggest renting before I buy.
