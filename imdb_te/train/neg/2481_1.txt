I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but as a judge on this effort in writing and direction, he should continue his day-to-day job as an actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize these images, it is not scary or terrifying, so it is not called horror, it's not a play, it's not a play, so it's not a thriller, you're just a fan of Blair witch's project Not a bad image. People who love this movie are "ambiguities" and used complex and subtly but they have read in the ones that are not there. Like Blair Witch, people were scared because they were afraid and bought some guffs as scared. The film was originally started with a local "meeting" family after touching a deer. It appeared as a modern day ransom, but the next 45 minutes, (more than half a movie), nothing happened, the family pocketed their holiday, which was all very nice and beautiful, but not fun. It is clear that some locals are taking part in a stage, but Essendine is not clear how to build a suspense in the film. Finally, when something happened, the father killed how he died, how he died, and how he died (the nurse says that his liver is only a livestock) and this silver inspiration 3rd grade special effects in a very clumsy way. The movie was called Wendigo but did not attempt to explain any clearly, the movie ends all the muddled and you are very unsatisfied leaves, I would have agreed with 15 minutes to go but I would like to see this film itself redemption. It's not.
