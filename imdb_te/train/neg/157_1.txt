I was surprised to learn that it was released in 2001, exactly the same as in the 80s and exactly for all the videos. The second is the storyline of all, the story from the right bat is confusing. It is good to have some brief prologs or introductory story. I also like to congratulate Fantasy but this film is very much. It is bizarre and badly portrayed. The scenes do not flow smoothly and the characters are odd. It's hard to follow and maybe it may be translated but it's also hard to understand. I love the Chinese epic images but if you look for a Chinese epic fantasy film I would recommend the Promise (visually magnificent, plot interesting and good character development). Be careful that you will be disappointed.
