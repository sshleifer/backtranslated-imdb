At a glamorous 10 year old, I liked the 70s sitcom's "love-winning" philosophy "Bridge Love's Bernie." Adra Lindley; I understood the controversy between a Jewish cab driver (David Barney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and (the two sets of parents Herald J. Stone and Bernie's parents Bbie Osterwald, and the young couple's interfaith marriage. br> <br /> <br /> The experience of personal life is now looking at the show Dizette Parents David Doyle), I'm amazed that the show is one too successful, however, the highest rating season. A successful drama was written by Bernard Slade, a prominent TV writer who writes a successful drama "Next year," after a cancellation of a few years show, "Bridget Loves Bernie" is a very smooth and unmatched comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight. <birney and baxter does not deny real life chemistry. But in later years, the two actors showed that they were good actors in other projects (his short-lived "Family" and "Family Ties" in "String in the Places" and Barney in the Baker). Here, they are trying to breathe life in a necessary show on a very gritter comic edge which might have given more depth to the issues that are very controversial for a show showcasing Saturday nights between two CBS energies. <br /> <br: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of those shows were smart, funny, and an edge (more on that in the past) that was interested in the edge and my characters. <br /> <br /> "Bridget Loves Bernie" is not very smart and some have only occasional chuckles. <br /> This is another example of a demonstration that I'm not as good at remembering.
