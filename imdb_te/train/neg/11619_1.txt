I saw the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Perhaps it's my fault to deal with bad and horror instead of psychology. Is it unrealistic to say about the Oeppal myth? Would you like to compose a musical theater with my uncle and marry him to kill my father and mother? Why did some plot stuff also exist: Why is the construction upstairs, why no one is actually going to do their own stomping with a definite spot for someone to come to their doom, why the sights at daddy at all, why are you going to eatout only takeout If you have a nice kitchen, why the boy is baptized and parents The other way around will instead of them to resist. I will get good reviews for this film ... My taste of 70s B-movies and old science fiction has been corrupted?
