Another chapter in the ongoing question, what happened to Mel Brook's comic sense? This runs well with Mel, like a trump-like Mogul Goddard Bolt ("You Can Call Me"), a bid that can not live on the streets for 30 days. But the moment the movie hits the streets occasionally "funny" bits (Mel sees a black kid break-dancing for money and a instrument buck and wing, yuk, yuk). Leslie Anne Warren is not waste small. The worst part is the musical number of the film, featuring a silent dance for Brooks and Warren Cole Porter's "Love to Easy". Brooks' musical parodies are usually the headlines of his films; Here he plays the whole thing, like "The Carol Burnet Show" (which is a Rudy Delucca, co-author of the film, started his career) as an aged guest actor from the Dancing Excerpt. Rent The Charlie Chaplin's The Kid, which has covered the same area 70 years ago
