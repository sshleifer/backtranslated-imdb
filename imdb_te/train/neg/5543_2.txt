Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but I watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted into all my time five. Did you think about this love story or zombies ??? After the film was so bad, what I could do was end up with compassion. Thankfully I have so many anal to turn off a movie without seeing the whole thing or I can not brag about looking all this way through a sitting! I think it is good that I say something good with the theory that I recognize the movie's most positive asset and that it is too small for the full length movie.
