Lou Gospel is a major disappointment for me. I received an e-mail from the theater that was a great and exciting movie. It's not great or inspirational. Cinematography is very beautiful with whole cinema. There are a lot of flashbacks that can not be said at times when they say whats in the scenes. Voices are often distorted for any reason. Most people in this movie are far away. The relationship he has with his former & son has never been clear. Moreover, the whole picture has a way to him, and suddenly BAM is all he is cured and inspiring people. The whole cinema boxing seems to show things that are bad in his life, in his life to live the way he lives it, but when he turns out, he does not leave the boxing, he teaches others the box. Bad.
