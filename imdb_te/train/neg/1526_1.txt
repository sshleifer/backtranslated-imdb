I have seen the worst pictures than this, but if I have, I do not remember. Or have blocked them. If I had to undergo hypnotherapy, I would remember them, perhaps, kidnapped by aliens or other suffering. <br /> <br /> I am happy to make those memories for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to give some credit to the film: it created an emotional response. In fact, other movies and TV programs began to become angry at the sarcastic scenes, and this mockery hates them through the association. I am afraid that I can not see films like Dr. Stranzlow again without this film without having to touch my mind.
