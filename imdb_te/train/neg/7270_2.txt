I gave this "loooooooooooong" movie "2" due to attractive actresses and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you do not read as a speed reader, try to keep speaking at the speed of Spanish you never talk through the subtitles! And, if you can not read the subtitles, what's going on in the plot. Endless stairs and gofye-eyes and persistent denial. Just boring after an hour. Some good cinematography, but some believe that Dark has burned your screen. It never succeeded. It is difficult to talk about "acting" because the main actors look different when each other does not push one another. Zerado's character is very attractive, it is hard to believe that nobody will push him away. And what is his mother? I have two boys who have a history with each other, but who has found the "EX".
