TV Guide This film calls a secret. A secret to me is that you can not construct a single movie at the top level, which is the perfectly representative of any kind of complex and complex classical music and intellectual mathematicians. It can not be said to be the best / worst and honest difference in Bollywood. Each level, story-line, conditions, dialogue, music and choreography are disgusting sweet, kitchy cliches. To be obscure, you must have a retard to enjoy it. I have seen it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but I have time to go out of it because I can not take it. The only ransom quality of this film is the delicate aesthetics of the famous actresses. <br /> <br />
