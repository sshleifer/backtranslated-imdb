The film is very good - though I know the book (apparently a book) that the movie "Spiritual" New Age Variants, rather than me, is enjoying the film. Therefore, you feel yourself "spiritual" and can be less or less susceptible to things like "Aura" and "Astral Body" and do not use the term "power" often outside the context. <br /> <br /> If you are in the physical universe, if you have the ability to indicate the probability of spirituality and if you are expecting a reasonable wooden dialogue, you may have little patience for cheesy lighting effects, based on the new age nonsense The plot is disappointing to rely on it and this is my recommendation to you about this film. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. I have personally seen Dugins and Dragons personally in a movie theater (I can not count movies, such as Plan 9) that I look awkward. At the same time, I ran almost two of the films that raised grand total (D & D other one). Since New York BS continues to get thicker and thicker from that time, I'm not even in the film, but when I first saw the visual depiction of a brightness, I did not play the movies. <br /> <br /> The plot is a group of people who have some old prophecies that seek to bring mankind into the quest for spiritual enlightenment and its evolutionary phase. Or something like that. They speak of these spiritual things as the next step in human evolution, and someone who has a stupid idea of ​​human evolution is terrible. This film is astonishing. Occasionally people should describe it as "another dimension", or possibly "another plane", they have only been enlightened to be visible to their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director encourages the audience and stimulates "perceptions" that make up the prophecy, making it harder and slow, so that we can remember them and leave movies as better, more intelligent people. <br /> <br /> The good things about the movie? <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that if the film is interesting or acceptable, it will seriously affect my ability to take a person out. It's really a very innocent kind of El cheapo spirituality, and that's your thing except that, something else you better with your time and money.
