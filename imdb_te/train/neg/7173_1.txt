I hate flight crash movies ... all of them! In fact, I hate them all with a passion! First of all, they have cheap looks and craftsmanship! Secondly, they say to the audience who insult the airline industry and tell all the audience ... Sky and crash! <br /> <br /> Why am I so angry with such a movie? This is something that happens to us and has been worse than the characters in the film ... This is an air disaster yarn's unique chilling item. It's like all 50,000,000 stupid-donkey chaos movies before I hate this movie! Freefall is like all others: the clutch bullshit is nothing more than frustration before dramatic scenes. <br /> <br /> First, we have the same cast of retards on this flying death trip: a clean-esquire family, the Buster, and the Flight Attendant's bitch who finished with three big cleaned hairstyles since 1987 at least bit frightening anyone! <br /> <br /> My second stomach can not be a full-length film, but Air Canada is a documentary that describes everything about "freefall" incident of "Guillaume Glider" incident. /> <br /> All airline movies of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless) with my third and final stomach. Why did hell man instruct passengers to eliminate shoes there for passengers? (I did not understand the high heels and sharp, extreme stuff, but could not understand the c'mon!) 'They made them more f * * king safe than they are now! The plane knew that they (passengers) were not well aware that they were going to crash the land. Why would you force 100 skin injured down a rubber slide that might cause the skin to skin and only the footsteps that walk on the feet to store their ruins on a ruins field! <br /> <br /> The Fearless and Hit ABC series "Lost" is simply "exaggerated and realistic to the wind with failure." Misuse of flight- People panic - the airline flew gray and jackets without the same old rubbish since 1975. Freefall is the most distinctive in the air-crash film, when I see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves, what moment can we see that these poorly acting characters are going to the general level instead of the happiest of the tragedies that exist in advance? The director of "Freefall" is committed to those who are facing drugs and marital problems for cheaper movies produced by TV makers with white-aged women with narcotic males. Hack! Why we should sit half an hour and half of the audience at the airport Vanuabe Rhesh. I hope God does not make movies in a plane crash like this. If it were like the ABC series "Lost", it would have something to see. But it's completely rubbish and then some. "AirPort 1975" Each plane is turning a catastrophic movie! This is not the cheap pathetic waste "airport" of my time. I do not recommend anyone with this movie or any TV air disaster movie for anyone with my worst enemies.
