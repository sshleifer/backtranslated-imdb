<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies and rarely I rate a movie "1", but this film is not terrible. <br /> <br /> These performances are terrible, plot scandal, effects are dull and characters are annoying. When I hear sounds in house / forest / school / etc, I think it's a DUMB, and then "hello to whom?" - But when they believe, they are believable when doing it. It's not right for this movie. <br /> <br /> When I watch the movies I have always open minded and say that the film is only full of waste and I write this comment, watching this movie Think again. It's sad!
