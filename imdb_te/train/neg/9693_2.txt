The high-heated plot of "Bonejore Terrisse" is derived from a childhood first novel by Fran√ßois Sagan, which became the best seller, although why God knows. It may have a specific appeal, for younger people wanting to get rid of the potential phase-parent. Do not take the fact that David Niven plays the playboy's father and Deborah Kerr's step-mother-of-chance. Unfortunately, there will be a lot of Jean Seberg's weak sleeves. Her beautiful and easily skinned teenager fulfills the image. The problem is that she has to strike the poses but she is not working. St. John of Otto Premenes - anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Seberg's first film - she was ineffective in 19, carrying a movie. The film's first "promise" is also fulfilled by preening. This is her second film; She is now 20 years old. Can Nerwen and Kerr be able to replace Seberg's lack of acting ability? Is not it possible? Seberg's character is concentrated in the story, although she is still beautiful, although she is convinced that she is at the age of 17, can not receive the emotional demands of her character. If she became a successful actress in her short life, she did not have any influence on my consciousness in later films. But anyone who thinks that this film is better than average requires a taste of taste. Despite Neven and Kerr, it's a short story that plays a child in child acting.
