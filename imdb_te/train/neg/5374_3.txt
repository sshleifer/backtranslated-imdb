CRIMSON RIVERS I have mostly seen most of France coming out of town, over-the-top, over-os mess. The best example of such a vicious horror / action / buddy movie is a French production that attempts to get out-do movies made in Hollywood and CR. <br /> <br /> The film is some kind of extravagant horror film, but soon from the horror to action to the buddy's kind of x-files type, finally, CR is nothing and nothing. It is so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. Painful dialogue and silent disruptions, fades out and giggles me, at the right exposures moments with fades. I thought the films made in Hollywood will use this hacked technique. <br /> <br /> The Chase scene with Vincent Cosel is very beautiful after the murderer. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe that GOTHIKA is directed by Climax on the mountain with Stupid Revelation about the killer (s) with Killer and Reno, playing "buddies" in 48 years, This overbaked, confusing image does not come close to awful.
