We rented a DVD that we had hoped for a better Western. The picture is beautiful and the scenes are reasonable, but the ideas are very bad. <br /> In the first part, why does a bad guy kill my boss? <br /> <br /> The bank employee worked badly, unexpectedly to appoint killers from his employees. At least keep guessing us. <br /> <br /> There is much delay. </ P> <br /> Martin admitted to killing laws in the gang in the absorbed campus that still needed to see the judge. The more sheer abusive she can not hear the sheriff man who agrees with the judge and the judge. When Martin hangs down and the rope breaks down, the sheriff goes back into town and takes him to the gun to save his wife from a bad bank employee. Did he not just come back after the gang's quick distribution to rescue his wife and arrest the bad bank person? Send a note that the judge agreed before being killed on a gang pedestrian. In total there is a very sad acting and there is no point in the film.
