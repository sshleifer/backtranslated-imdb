I'm starting to write this review during the break when watching the movie. This was the first time I was trying, but I was struggling with this by no occasional breaks. <br /> <br /> It's almost painful and unbelievable, especially the naturally strong dying brother Ryan (Komme Feor) when tragic and bitch, self-joy and self-pitying. <br /> <br /> If you leave the character in the story, it is a much better film. <br /> He adds Makhachkhi, Maudlin, and very irritating play. Maybe someone could not make Ryan believable, they decided to make him bad. What is that problem: Who cares if a spoiled, whining, bad jerk dying? <br /> <br /> This character is the only thing that can happen to him if he dies, but it is not enough. Dying is not unique. We die, sooner or later. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, actors (such as David Kubitt, Theo and Chandra West) are playing too much. More interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pitying interruption, has made a better image. But it is not yet, and it's time to hit again. <br /> <br /> Thirty years ago, sorry. This rental turkey tonight goes back!
