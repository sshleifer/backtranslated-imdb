A somewhat embarrassing spy secret of speculative plot about the two hazards of World War II. Whether or not Mystery Jane Graeoston (Nancy Coleman) has a memory. The best acting by Dr. Ingersol is done by Raymond Massey, a good doctor turned out to be bad. He coded information related to the head of the spy ring, the affiliate operation, trying to get information from infection Zen. She knows? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr Goodwin) is partnered with Massey. The role played by John Garfield (Dr. Louis) is not dangerous. He is a very bad mistake to describe the filmmaker's worst in film history. It is a very talented actor who is incompatible with his talent. Although it is a half spy and half gangster movie, the film is valuable, and has a single concert concert. It's easy to forget this one, the memory is not needed.
