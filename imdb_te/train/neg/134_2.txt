The film is super intelligent. This is the theme rhyme with every horror film ever made. Valentin makes the ZERO effortless. What is Valentin anyway? It is a group of people giving the same lame messages that the same people gave a year ago. There is nothing original in the valentines. <br /> <br /> I saw only one time, here are some of the images that it has stripped in a picture that you see here. <br /> Crown 2 at night 3.Scrime 4. Other horror film that someone else kills. <br /> I know more and more, but my mind is slowly gripping. <br /> <br /> Valentine do not have a good image. How every horror film should have a "suprise" killer, people you do not care because their emotions will turn to each other's scene. <br /> <br /> In general, any horror film (in my book) can be saved by Gore, and it is not for Valentine again. Although they tried to make PG-13, they failed, so they left the amendment. <br /> If you do not see this extreme inspiration, unless you hate yourself, and you want to die. <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.
