This film does not really start or end. And it's really unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are considered interns in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are placed in a 5-star hotel (from Coliseum to the bottom of the street) and all the other internships they work with are just an exceptional pattern. One thing that is clearly visible in this film is that one of the twins does not end up with one person. I guess I tried to twist a bit of their usual plot. Good effort.
