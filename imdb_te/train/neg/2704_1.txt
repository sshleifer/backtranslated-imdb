I do not understand why people would complain to this dirt. Its wrong, stupid, dubious, awful, and just about everything else. The movie is about life, racial issues, misconception and everything else in college. It will fail. In fact it did not hold on to it. <br /> <br /> A black man, a black man with a black man, holding him up. <br /> <br /> It is the same black man who hangs people on a roof that is stopped and closed The white man will stop and the rodent King style beating will be given when the gun man runs. Only one of the four guards left after a moment. <br /> <br /> Another harsh criticism in the film, the depth of unadulterated main characters, is a former critic of several white 230lbs men weighing about 160lbs. From the black and shocked white people and from the average, angry, and more correct (?) Blacks. Its insult to both its black and white people. I am a white man and I know many blacks and Spanish people who agree that the role is played by the characters and that it is wrong to specifically give them their characteristics. <br /> <br /> The storyline that I now describe is around three characters that revolves around. A black athlete and another confusing white girl asks her sexuality and the third person is even confused and afraid, then blames her problems over blacks, in which she becomes a nazi in the film. They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex, rape, fights, love, hate, misconception, ethnic warfare, and do not forget to educate. It will eventually come down for deadly fires. In which they go back to their boring lives and think that "white is bad". Is this sound like your college years? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Overall this is really bad, bad, ugly image. If you want to see more accurate feedback or racial issues you will see American History X. If you want to see more accurate view of college rental porsche. Just avoid this mess.
