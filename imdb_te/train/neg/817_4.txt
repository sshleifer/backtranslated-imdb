"You're not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place, they did not hurt you, they would have radiation in the second place." Ah, what is the budgetary 50s science fiction joys ?? Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and Mole-Men are pretty uninspiring with a lean 58-minute running time. Although it has a surprisingly altruistic message (which is a fantastic useless frames of a shotman flying over Superman) and is it pretty dull cheap? Mout Mole-Men, Extended skulls and fur coats that look more than the MAP Moxzptlk than the release of the underground world released from their underground world by oil drilling, are not only harmful, and are just a small local town headed by George Reeves of Man of Steel Jeff Coory To prevent them from killing the crowd. The fate of the day is an interesting setback, perhaps, but recommend it a little more than good intentions.
