I'm subject to this television personality, why do I wondered? Why Diane Keaton agrees with this trash? The film delivers meaningless, strategic plot lines to thousands of homes worse. This film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film is not meaningless, and all lenders have been exhausted with the high consumption of stereotype. <br /> <br /> Keaton tried to make this film worthwhile, but eventually she needs to remember her old age. I hope you did not see your New Year's Eve as a little more sensitive to the TV movie. I tell you that the networks started broadcasting on Sunday night, to remove the garbage!
