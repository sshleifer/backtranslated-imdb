When my own child begged me to leave the premiere of the film, I knew it was bad. I wanted to send my eyes out. I wanted to get through the screen and wanted to sacrifice his last honor for killing Mike Meyers. This is one of my few films in my life, I have seen it and wanted to "unwatch" as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Other films, "Toll 2" and "Fast and Furious", are much better than this worst in the cap. <br /> <br /> I can drink as I sleep today. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers I'm stick with Austin or resurrecting Waynes World. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrie worked for this, and won all the Canadians' success. <br /> <br />
