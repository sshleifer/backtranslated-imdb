I saw this movie in Starz. Tell me about some of the things that make me feel improved; Acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. The authors seemed to have nothing to do with the film. Clearly in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super powered stealth bomber that would go totally invisible to $ 75 million. Now these days are about $ 3 billion and they disappear. Apparently you can fly from the US to the Middle East for an hour. There was a completely random homosexuality that I did not care about, but it seemed like a lame attempt to see more people. The camera randomly zooms into actors and skips random scenes. Oh Yes, from Steven Segal's film, its imaginable hell. All in all I positioned it right with snakes on a plane.
