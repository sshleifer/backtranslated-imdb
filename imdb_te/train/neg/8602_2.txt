After the first scene, everything a person needs to know about the film, and a man falls into a lake and eats. Then they're rolling header credits: "Slugs!" Large characters, then "The Movie" later. This is it! I accidentally tuned into "slugs: the musical" or "slugs: the game show". However, the film moves from there to kill. A man finds his hand cut because he slugs in his gardening glove, get a stumped killer slugs death when two people get the attack of slugs while having sex, and falling back to her in an underground passage. This is a very pretty silly movie, falling in the "so-bad-it's-good" category. It was a little less graphic of such a grainy picture that you are surprised to learn in 1988 (my opinion 1974). I'm surprised that this is the highest score since I'm here, where most people do not love any kind of cinema. But if you want to make a scary movie, it's ridiculous, it's one of your top candidates.
