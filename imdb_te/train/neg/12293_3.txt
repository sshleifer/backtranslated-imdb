David Hasselhoff was the only one to be bothered. Well, then let me bash it. These days, when they come out of horror, the film is not very bad. It's beautiful Leslie Cumming. She was very hot, but did not speak very well. There was a great scene with her when she was raped. She shows off nice body. Linda Blair does not have here and Hasselhoff. 3/10
