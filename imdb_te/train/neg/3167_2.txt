Henry, veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his wife's fianc√©, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking at their last minute arrangements for their reception. It is a frenzy, giving a catalog of deafness to her demand for her wedding morning and Kate's food show. But, horror horror, Kate's "angel" ice sculpture comes without wings. When struggling with a sculptor, the heavy "ice" falls on the virgin kate and sends her back to her. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges for a mental patient to tell the young man, Kate wants to be dating her with other women and wants to go further. However, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) is interested in Henry, who is very fond of the concerns of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate has created an epidemic for Ashley from the other side and said that another woman did not intend to take his hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate for good? This is a dedicated romantic comedy, which is not as disturbing as this particular fan has ever seen. No, not in its work, they endeavor to work. Longoria is beautiful and funny Fiance is the fiance's future fiance and Bell also has a painful style and humor. Biggs, a funny thespian, also, completely wasted. Rude, the most gorgeous actress (Ankorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please see) he tries all the hardest and is actually the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, attractive and easy film is far away to make the movie bearable. But nothing, the winner, absolutely nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction. So, if you're a wearing in-wool fan of romantic comedy, feel long and hard before clearing you on any money for this. There are also free tickets falling on your lap, beware that the film is a near-death experience for those who love the pictures of love and laughter.
