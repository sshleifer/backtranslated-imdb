"Smithereens" is a worthless film that works as a cheeky Doom novel in the public library and hangs on cable channels. The average director and the first effort for Sedelman, all the things in the film is filled with bad acting, bad sound, bad camera work and poor quality. Many good films do not get into the market, and why such waste goes on and never gets away is one of the greatest secrets of life. (D-)
