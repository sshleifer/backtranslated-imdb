The world may end. Unfortunately, the film remains another evidence for inefficiency beyond Canada's acting power. This is because our good people (Norman Jusson, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) This is not really bad, but it's not the smallest of these small acting and simple ones. He may have given it some credibility. The Canadian government must recognize --- and the film is an excellent example --- making money in the teens is not a good film. If people who publicize these public funds have to compete, they should come forward with valuable things. They are producing another snicker impression.
