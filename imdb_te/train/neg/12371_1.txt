The film could be so great (which came with some attractive campus), but it was never above the sharp satire. Acting was seriously flawed and I thought my seat would fall in my theater. Never and I can never see this godly piece .... The Danish cinema is getting very good in recent years but if I cross this point, I'm scared that no one can rent a film. I have chosen to register this movie here. I really think it is necessary to drive people away from this part .... My sympathy is already going to people who go to watch this movie
