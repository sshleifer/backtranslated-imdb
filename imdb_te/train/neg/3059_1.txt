All right I had the opportunity to rent this recently and Santa Claus martens. Although children are more passionate in SCCTM, I have to say that Santa Claus is a very bad movie. Spanish Appointment in Spanish 5 We had to see it. When we look at a movie we all talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everybody opened the thought that he was going to pitch a bad blow there. Help Merlin Santa Claus? !! Or is his robot reindeer come and save the day? This is a big piece of rent I've suggested to rent and I loved it. : D
