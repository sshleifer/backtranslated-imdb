While the actors do not have anything special, everything works correctly, the story looks like a good idea, the script is bearable and ultimately a very good twist; <br /> "<br /> <br /> The second directive is weak, this film is not just a essence of the story, a doctor does not catch The devil (or demonic organism) should have time or intimidation of the prisoner's spirits. <br /> <br /> All of this is a pretty poor movie, and even though it is fun and sometimes fun, it still remains lonely. <br /> < 4/10 is sad
