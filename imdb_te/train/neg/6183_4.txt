In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as president of the United States; North Korea announced its nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died of a long illness; And appeared in the film called Into the Blue. The film's existence was not as bad as other things that happened the same year, but the film was curious and perhaps worse since that year. Now, in 2009, there is another president of the United States, another Pope, the new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the film Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original one ... but similarly: "Cut your fingers cut your head Is better than getting ".This sequel is a really bad movie that has kept me awkwardly frustrated and unwanted. Blue into 2: Cast Reef Each credibility and dramatic complete absence are composed by the TV series actors, but are perfect for showing their bodies. Chris Carmack (OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Wandwort (Smallville), Marsh Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) take empty and boring performances. Directed by Stephen Harek (Critters and Bill L and Ted's exotic adventure), but in this film, he is not even producing minimal tension, emotion or entertainment. The characters from this movie are badly performed, but they are also repulsive. Cinematography is sinking from the film and a technology team making promotional videos for the hawaii hotels seems to be doing. Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie better than the original film, but it's nothing, as I have mentioned earlier. Remove this rubbish image with all the expenses.
