After seeing three other versions of the same film, it is very weak because of Scott's more dull and staging performance. His emotions are all in the dark, it's hard to work hard. Alistair Sim played an infinite role. While Schugge is in his sense, you're talking to Scott very confidently and he's reluctant when he gets his metamorphosis. I can not think of any actors in the film that fit from Alistair Sim versions. This music version (and obviously Muppets) is good. Very frustrating.
