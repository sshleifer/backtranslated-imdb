This film is F.B.I. History, because the berry form of Natts is the old west. Unrealized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Fight on Crime. Hoover's huge hand (is he any kind?) TV quality displays with script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101s. With a dramatic ability of Jimmy Stewart, the Vera Miles scene, each c-lister called the 'Yachman Jungle' from 'Baard Yard Barbecue', the sound stages and everything behind the back, may refer to each c-lister with humor or humor. Even gun shirts are canned and familiar. I'll drink Mervyn Leroy every night. Except for some (very little) interesting outdoor establishment shots, there is no note beyond a korea.
