I am always different from all people and for almost every film you get two extremes. <br /> <br /> Stigmata is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is there. First of all sound. The producers spent much time in the soundtrack than the modification. <br /> <br /> When playing the soundtrack and no one is talking and she is very loud when Patricia does not speak in her singularity. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patricia and Gabeel, flat in this film. Patricia has basically 3 emotions. Quietly, in great pain, or really angry she is stigmata. The first one is important, the second is the screaming pain, the third one increasing his voice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> When you see a 3 minute video, it's quick, and requires a slow motion, in a 2-hour film, it's frustrating. I can not understand her, that women see the kid and reduce the child. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> End up shooting.
