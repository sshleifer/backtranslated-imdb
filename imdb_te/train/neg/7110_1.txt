Well, he has to give the director credit for how tight it is. Getsy is the correct word. He did not use the entire cast of five people (LL at ATL), but he also decided to use sub-par special effects with clutter and boring platform, and he also started shooting the film as the Freight of Diet! However, they promise FreeEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIFIIIIINNNNN. A creepy blistering gardener is always a good move. <br /> If you look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you can see it. <br /> <br /> You prefer to display horrific images, to let you know. <br /> You are a good gift for those who hate you.
