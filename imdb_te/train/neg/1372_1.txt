It's seen on TV. I am happy to see this movie or spend money on rent. The film is entirely imaginable - from the corrupt owner and the planner, for snacking electric cables. The plot is really weak and unreliable - the surprise expert man has been hit by a 20-foot wave bone, using an abrupt (using the actual footage) and waving everything up to what he's supposed to do and moving himself down. A few days later, a snake is killed by thunder and highway. <br /> <br /> The original avalanche content is some impressive and its devastating power. <br /> <br /> The agreement between the real storm and the subject matter makes this movie even lighter. <br /> Please feel free to contact T.V.
