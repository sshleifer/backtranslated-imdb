I am a big fan of Lucio Fulzi. One of my favorite of Giovole and bright films was one of my favorites, but it was made for TV movie, which I did not expect from the great Italian director. Falci's more striking Giolous, or most of his cult classics, are very interesting; Hence, since it is not in two main areas, it ultimately ensures that the film is not very good. The film works from a platform that has been used many times in the past, but it always casts an interesting story, as it focuses on the ultimate not-for-life life theme. The film focuses on Giorgio Messardi; There is not a lot of people who are unpleasant to see and after a clear stomach bleeding, he is sad to see him. This means that he is trapped between his devil's life and posthumous life, so he decides to come down to his death and his only friend in this attempt is his daughter. <br /> <br /> I am proud to say that this film is "in the style of HP Lovecraft", and one of the most blatant attempts to sell a movie I have ever seen. The great horror writer in this story also has little memory, and the tagline is similar to the Stuart Gordon / Lovecraft movie, which is similar to the film 'Beyond From Beyond', because it is very good. The film has gained from the typical Italian style and the score is good. Unfortunately, however, it is perfectly suited to shoot at every scene - so the theme is quickly annoying. The plot is really boring, and in most scenes the ghost is trying to find 'disappointing' things, or the daughter put her suspicions on her family. The film was made for Italian TV, and it is not entirely surprising. There is a nightmare sequence with little to gore and zombies; But it's not everyone we know and love to everyone. Overall, the film is very mediocre and is not a good representation of Fully's talent. Value in trouble with, unless you completeist a full.
