<br /> <br /> What can I say more than Baad, Baad, Baad, Baad, Baad, Baad? I pray that there is nothing to save this movie and they should not talk about the sequel. If you're thinking about watching this, you need to know that the storyline will throw two worst men to save the land. Men in Black are torn to pieces and put together to make this 'comedy' but totally failed. Please avoid this movie (save yourself).
