I made a big mistake to look at the whole movie a few nights ago. God I am still trying to recover. This film is not even eligible for a 1.4 average. IMDb should have 0 ratings for really relevant movies like this vote. <br /> <br /> I have heard how bad the film is, but I did not really think the film was really bad in this day and era. I was the only cheese film from all the awful movies of the 1950s and 1960s. My God is wrong to me. Believe me, this movie is really bad. It's terrible; It's beyond curiosity; That's what I think about it. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best movie of the year compared to this film. <br /> <br /> In the first 25 seconds of the film, I saw some high school theater class Or better yet, I felt some Saturday night's live ripoff skirt of the real thing.I mean, it's obvious.The acting is terrible, filmed with a 20-year-old VHS video camera The whole film is almost exhausting ... Special effects ........ It has better effects than better than the good of the Lord's day.He gets shot at the door and looks beyond the funnier and cheesy.I mean seriously, my Intro 4 From the years ago we had a better movie to all of us working in college The worst part of Arthur's nude movie is the worst part of the movie.Oh my God I'm right there right up I'm a strong stomach, but I'm terrible. They talk about legal issues that they have never heard of; Ben talks about getting music that we never heard about again; Arthur is looking for job and money for college and the next thing we see is that he runs a porn store. <br /> <br /> It's not really much of my criticism, but everyone knows, I'm not gay. But I am supporting gay rights and I believe that we should all be equally involved. And I support any gay guy in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this film, seems to cuss each other word by the way. (Where * F * (* * white white?) Hahaha but I do not think anyone who hated this movie because I was about two gay guys did not have anything with it: this would have been <br /> <br /> Ben and Jill instead of Ben and Jill <br /> <br /> When I see what I'm saying is not really bad, be a warning to all of my readers: how much of a few films in the 21st century If you look just at the sight of this picture is adhakaramainaviga navvalanukondi. <br /> <br /> Earlier in mind: How in the world there are 7 movies at IMDB? There are 7 movies this darunamainavi!
