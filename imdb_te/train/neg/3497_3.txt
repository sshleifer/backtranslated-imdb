Unfortunately, Sarah Silverman did not appreciate her performance. This character is not even remotely disliked and "Oh I am such a touch *" is not a situation where I feel "I love her such an Ip * touch." This character is just plain old self-righteous, ie, b * tch.Sarah struggles to take part in this program because she is just semi-funny. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman's program is so unbelievably boring that I'm thinking of changing the channel to see married married old repeats with a kid. It is funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "barbaric" .I 'm sorry but I do not find a program packed with dry humor and corn off wall stories about some angry, bitter, defeat, angry, bitter life kein Reeves with a cooler anywhere The sound like hell sister and gay friends is fun with her annoying. Although I can not retain this show, Sarah loves herself as Abba Touch, just like Sarah Silvanmann's School of Rock, and she stands out very much. Boring with the characters who understand and tell the letters and do things for the value of shock eg. Depressed, uninterrupted, and frustrated $. Sarah Silvanmann tries to be funny, and it will fail, laugh or better writers. Even if someone compared the South Park, it is not even close. The opinions in the Sarah Silverman show and you are not annoying to me being in this * El * TCH and continually seeing the post as "this show sucks" and "why this is not canceled yet". You enjoy the Sarah Silverman program.
