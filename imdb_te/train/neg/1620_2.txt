The film is very small, yet it is difficult to bring in its weak points in the company of such a rave reviews, in the direction of a breathtaking scenery, cinematography and wildlife. However, it does not make satisfactory plots and disappointment. <br /> <br /> I have seen this with my children and no one of us is finally impressed. Yes, the pictures are great, the wild landscapes and the landscapes are magnificent, but what happened in the foreground? Diligent description of the stupidity of a hungry girl who is learning very basic lesson about friendships with very slow wildlife - and very easily gets the track record of the subject that gets off. This is not exactly a new story, and in reality it is not a novelty remotely about the way it is told, and can be seen as much as we have seen before and by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. <br /> The only thing that really collected from this movie is a sense of how to work with these amazing lenses and wild lighting; Waste for the rest of the time.
