Less than half the naked men slapping a bunch and little about punching each other. That's it. We'll see it for about 5 minutes. It tunes of black and white tons of half naked men running around slapping each other in the tune of horrible music. It showed interest but did not really trace the plot - it was disturbed by the characteristic violence in this. Moreover, this kind of human beings are played in humans, but combining violence is not a good idea. Some people who like Avant Garde prefer this but I recognize them as incomprehensible, boring, stupid and ocassionally. Really - what is this all-in-point? I saw part of the celebration of gay celebrations and the audience sat in astonished silence. I really want to go less than 1.
