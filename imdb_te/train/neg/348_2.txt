This film is a worst and unforgettable Sean Canary vehicle. The shows are usually crappy by Capcha, Fishburn, and generally the great Ed Harris. The Canary Harvard academic has a misconception. As it goes on, the film is absolutely worse. This is a third rate, mysterious, and it explains a lot of time. The film stripped the cast of an amazing support. George Plymupon also changes Connery some gravitation in a small role while discussing the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere Pepper is the third degree mystery / thriller with high degree manipulation. Scripting and directing are very poor. The only attribute of the film is the image of the attraction and screen of Canary. Manipulative, violent, and riddiculous. Avoid this.
