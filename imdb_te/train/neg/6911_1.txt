No large pile of manure. Shot-on-video (REALLY crappy camcorder, NOT digital) is the worst pile. It's no doubt, the absurd thing to do so far. In fact the fact that this trash is released is entirely as Asen. Everyone watching it stupider for seeing it. Seriously. After seeing this trash, I felt like killing many brain cells. The positive reviews of this $$ worst are apparently "filmmaker" (and I have a very loose word) made by himself and / or his family and friends because the ordinary person with squirrel's intelligence is honestly the life of this waste. Trust me, stay away from hell with this video. Thank you for this. Be like herpes.
