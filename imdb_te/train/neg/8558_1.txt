This film is absolutely awful, I feel uncomfortable to call a movie. Its "simple" mumbcore image stumbling around trying to "zero out stuff" with zero plot and targetless whiny twenty somethings. <br /> <br /> I'm not in sync with the movie, I congratulate Dogma's 95 films, my favorite time with idiotern is one of the movies. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film is awful, acting, in writing (or is it all improved?). , Direction, but everything else, above all, the camera work is just plain and simple nonsense. The camera is never logical anywhere, there is no stability. I agreed to a person I heard was naked in the film, if it had at least nakedness (I know, I've got one). Uber crappy camera Well thanks you never really see anything, and the things you see, believe me - you do not see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever a dialogue, a camera-work, I want to vomit, but most people appreciate some of the film's critically acclaimed critics. Well, now I want more vomit than anything else.
