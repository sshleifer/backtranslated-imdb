I read this Thornton Wilder last year in the eighth grade. I was forced to sit through this weak translation on the screen. Tell me, this is not an amazing game, it easily surpassed, but man deserves a better shot. Acting is not really, God's view-honesty-it looked like a group of three years old was designed out of cardboard. If it's not worse, the sound quality is lousy ... this mind-numbing buzz is whenever a star speaks ... and I can not help but chemistry between George and Emily, well, does not exist. The actors are very uncomfortable for all. Music is not there. It is black and white, it will be OK but it will bring more cheesiness. In any case I'm going to have a point of seeing this movie, which I do not really reccomend, then high your hopes are not targeted. The play, like the stalwart, is probably better.
