I saw Gator Bite images and this is almost the same thing. A woman is attacked by a group of sexually abused persons, and she gradually turns to take revenge on each other. It is not a matter of sexuality that can not be distinguished from the images (not very good). There is a lot of faded nudity throughout the film, but it's sexy for a second. The rape scenes appear to be a bit wider, but the film is trying to strengthen the audience's desire to take revenge. <br /> <br /> It is a weaker film, to save the interest of cheating our natural desire to take revenge in his attack on this woman. I'm not in your tomb but you do not want to make a serious moral delivery, but I'm happy to see it because it has a significant level of violence against female mainstream losses. <br /> <br /> B-movies are due to nudity and controlled teen sexuality And I have the US Graeme Spit of B-movie while more than the nudity's share Do not drive nakedness plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is a space to take revenge against the rapist group. These men are evolutionary drop-outs, as they are in Gator Bite films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to come in new and exciting ways to kill them, but this film is still not any kind of message than a nonsense B-movie, but it's a perfect fit for the rapists. Satisfaction will satisfy . <br /> <br /> The sexual problem is that we have to sit through sexual assaults. Strangely, the first half of the film is partially naked (but not too much), but it is very painful to watch. We also throw a little bit of a woman's revenge (eventually a man in the lake has an overwhelming desire to encircle him, press on his genitals against the motor and propeller, the woman wraps up some final words and the rope pulls) , But again The first half of this film is satisfied with the desire for revenge. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) You mean this movie is all movies, which literally ends with the minute the last person killed. The woman does not write her book, she does not leave, and does not return to the nightmares, when she sits on the lake and the motorbike, the film stops on its tracks. <br /> Oh, and have you read the tagline? If you decide to waste time watching it, try and find any broken or burned person. I'm really looking forward to that?
