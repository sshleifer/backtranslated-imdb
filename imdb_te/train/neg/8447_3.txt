I do not know what I missed here, but most people in this film can not believe these positive comments. I thought it was a bit silly, a bit above. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, I really do, but for this it's a bit more alphabet for me. Comparing "humor and horror" "Army of Darkness" and "Dead of the Dead", as well as those with "The Re-Animator". You have to be joking. I did not find this movie funny, it tried, it made an effort (probably a lot of effort), but it failed in my opinion. <br /> <br /> When I hit the 3rd or 4th one-liner, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> For many other movies, we have a joke for horror fans. But here it just might not be the original idea. There are some good special effects, good gore, but it can not take full movie. The transformation of Grant Jabba Hut, and "Weird Science" (after he became a monster) and "The Explorer" appeared in the early stages between alien creatures / mutants from one of the children. It did not work. I thought it was the idea that some kid from grade 5 art class looked like something. Then Brenda, Grant was a woman who was not in the womb. When the help finally came, she looked like a huge tick waiting to popped. The design is once again completely unexpected. A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. <br /> <br /> Now I see with many more zombies about jealousy - Jorbi a Romero patent on them. Movies about them. He is the only person he can do right except Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (except that comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they're a different style zombie. Perhaps Mr. Romero had been forced to start his setup properly before the animated rendering of his zombie motion by the casting, groaning and sound of his actors, as his actors were dying of his kidneys and the loss of cyanovial fluid, . <br /> <br /> "Wheels" "people do not have the right inspiration. They are horrible giants. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was laughing at some of the laughs.
