The fair, clich√© dialogue and plot (the same thing in all of the 1980s), hook music and paint-number-numbers characters run most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film is protected from the junk pile, the fact that Bakshi's work, Rothoscoping, and Frank Frostetta teach the animators to look like him. This is in the freshest ... motion. Violence is amazing and unlike any other knife and cloth image of the art direction and animation period. <br /> <br /> With this sound, I am playing a soundtrack for the first canon film.
