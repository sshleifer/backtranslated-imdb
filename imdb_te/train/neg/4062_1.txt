Some movies have made me dissatisfied, it's not a compliment. I saw a theater (how do I surprise it when it's over), because I am 90 mm. The hate speech, the worst of the worst, the main point of view of this other illness is "Do not answer the phone" - but worse. All of this has been damaged, and everything is for rape and everything (except for strong stuff like "Last House on the Lost") and (absolutely) victims and everyone is totally defiant, and the viewer is passionately gas. In the end I felt like taking a shower. The director does not have credit
