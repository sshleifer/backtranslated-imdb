(David H. Steinberg) 's script initially had some good smart points, even though it did a good romantic comedy, but it' s loved! How has never happened ??? !!!! <br /> I told you what happened. It was originally (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although it was long ago, but the ancestors of the new genre, the raw teen comedy. Then came the 1990s. Smash hits (people who criticize me) think slackers, like the dumb and the next era The Prophet, one and only: (American Pi - 1999) is a sign of a genre that is undoubtedly and unbeatable. <br /> <br /> "Strange, unhappiness, strangely, shameless sex - in those days - is as easy as pie! The first smart plot of the script, then some of its manufacturers had to add a real big amount of handicraft, oral sex, urination .. etc just look for a la 'mode: like they fill out every scene with freely items like they are completely unnecessary <br /> <br /> Some of it is literally terrible, and it looks like you're looking at, all of it (Jason Schwartzman's appearance and performance), memorablely memorable. So romantic comedy is a pure combination chit <br /> <br /> If you hate it, you can do something (more courageous) than ever before, I love it, for me it is a scene of Gina Gersa Cameo. Anytime they have a baby's naughty dream, the whole design to achieve the outrageous-for-outrage. It is the nightmare of the majority. <br /> While it's near the end of the game is a real potential work at its core, and another sadly made me sad, it's another stupid comedy that eventually managed. (Boy loves the girl, and the girl loves another boy), so it's not really nothing (remember weirdo cool guys trying to reach a girl by blackmail), so the details of the stolen test (the first 2 minutes) . It dealt with the bunch of dirty college boys of its material dirty college guys, nothing came out but doing anything mawkish out of it. <br /> <br /> "This is a good one for another good movie yet, for the cheat or the slack to win. It is not necessary to understand that the manufacturers of this film are real slackers! Perhaps being a stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but also .. The final result here is no feeling at least a moment <br /> <br /> PS: A basic page in its story (David H. Steinberg), written by the story (as well as American Pi 2), is where his usual "Plot Keywords" is where you will get under "Additional Details": Sex / vulgarity / crude humor / ... They just forgot to write urine when they are just 70 years old or in women!
