The cabin is back by the lake ... just not been able. It must have a very low budget, because the fair amount of the film should be filmed with a normal video camera. So, in the same scene - you will have some movie quality camera shots and regular video camera shots. It makes a very odd mixture! I found some ways not to influence the "home video" type! <br /> If you see the original CBTL, you can compare and view the differences. If you do not see the original CBTL ... you can not see it if you see it first! It's probably too cheesy and stops you from being concerned about the original.
