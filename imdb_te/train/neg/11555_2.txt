A great slasher movie - very bad is it not part of the producers and script. The primary plot summary - Reddie invites man to his flat with a fetish, some in a strange coma and only at the various levels of success. The film's cutting-edge band thought I was in the movie and removed the heck from the film. Nothing flows, but he loses no time at all (he's not already ??) and the camera continued to shoot while he was sleeping long enough to leave the man. I could not blame him. I went out 2-3 times and tried to rewind the small plot there and rewind. Do not try to connect with anything that happens before the warning when you see the end - you will just get a blood vessel. Time, effort, or God's banning of money is not valuable. The only chance to get a 1 instead of 2 is the only chance that hacking occurs between the release of the film and the terrible reforms I've watched.
