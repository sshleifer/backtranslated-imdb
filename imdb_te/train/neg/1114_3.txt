In this day and age of incredible special film effects, this is a serious disappointment. Actors like conversations seemed stiff and uninterested. These days, Hollywood does not have Western normal charges, but the film like "Silverado" still knows how to make a good guy there. It's hard to guess that anyone can go to any cost in the release, creating such weak images is very low. If you love and are looking for a good west, keep looking!
