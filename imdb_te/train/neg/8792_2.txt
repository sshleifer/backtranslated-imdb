The film is another example of the curse of East Asian Cinema: two or more different stories in the same movie. There are many references to the "first part" and "second part" because other critics have clearly taken on it. How do you know the character or story of the character and the story of the character when the characters and story appear for such a short time? (Wow!) Wong Kar-wai's work is a good thing to replace a staggering and complete unbelievable second piece (Wow!) To enjoy the first part (until it's not "end" I'm looking forward to the day when the script is given!
