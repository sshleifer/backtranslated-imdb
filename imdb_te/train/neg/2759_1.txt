Happy, loud moments laugh ... not yet comedy. I especially liked the nagged gag of a "dirty boom" soaked ambulance to be angry "dirty booms", and anyone online literature is turning off! The dodgy voice effects, and the plot holes with an echo, storytelling movements in the story, an imaginative trash script, anticorrupted trilogy, the development of Jolie's character (including the characters they meet and are known for all the years), and the plot holes .. Oh there are plots holes !! To be honest I can not even write looking at this whole thing, but I certainly can not improve the already patricic effort in the last 30 minutes or the movie ... we've got a good looking lead to somehow thank God that we forget that the image is a load ... well ... Use the imagination for the end of the special sentence!
