Scary Cinema 2 is a deadly disappointment. Referring to movies as simply impossible not lead to 2 mission comedy. A funny white people in the movie scene rapping James Woods and Andy Richter opens well with an amazing use. From there the picture drops unfortunately. Acting was terrible. The Tori alphabet fully looks from the place and works. The film is hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. And in this snail pictured no longer gags, some of the previously mentioned Tom Cruise film joints werent funny to anyone in my theater. The film, thankfully, comes screeching a frightening unfunny ending at 83 minutes to a halt. I dont know to say continuity to move the sloppy who has made some cash on the backside of those dumb youngsters except for what else I do except I do shy (because the conclusion also does not attempt to end with humor). Overall, very poorly made image.
