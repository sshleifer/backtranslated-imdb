Anyone can edit this image? Or is the DVD release with huge thirty-second gaps between scenes? It was, however, dropped I fell asleep for the first time. Then I fell asleep for the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I've ever seen ... but it's close. Production .... Well, I can honestly say that it's the worst I have ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Do not worry if I hate the horror movies or I will not enjoy this movie. I'm laughing in the movie than I thought I was laughing with it. <br /> <br /> The characters have grown awkward or neglected by all, ultimately the end of the twist is very bad <br /> <br / > "
