Snowman is probably not the longest 90 minutes of my life. There is not a laugh; In fact, I do not always remember smile cracking. Diane Keaton is a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder, the textbook overbearing mother character, is a generously annoying woman who is apparently suffered by some kind of personality disorder. <br /> I would like to briefly refer to other characters, but why are you suffering? <br /> <br /> Only "the industry", the disturbed and the long lasting sadness or the father who somehow still loves, is just a respectable wife, Before, I've never been a Diane Keaton fan and why do you recall me? Overacting is overacting, no matter how many pictures you have in your lead. Her efforts in physical comedy are particularly insulting. <br /> <br /> While I like the Docs Shepherd and sometimes even live with Liv Tyler, their performances are very soft and dull. The endless self-absorbing character of the psalm is incapable, and sometimes Shepard's dislikes seemed to be true. <br /> <br /> At the end of this film, I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> <br />
