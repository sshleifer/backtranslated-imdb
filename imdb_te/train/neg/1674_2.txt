In the premise it is funny, but sadly the film is just no justice. Casting is pretty cool, and it's pretty portrayed - but most of the stylist's direction is absurd (ostitalized fast editing has no effect ... I waited for Steven Bochko to repay credits in credit), the characters use the on-screen coke specifically (and the role For the rest of the remaining boogie Nights for development) There are no individual characters to attract the viewer in the story. Very unforgettable movie.
