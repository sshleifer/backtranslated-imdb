The film was terrific for both comical comedians. Fast forward and never got any better! Time waste and waste waste! Tina Fay is such a great writer, I thought it would be great in her comedy. The previews are good, but they show only the best parts of the film. My husband also sucks it for chic flick. What's with it. The film is very slow boring. I do not recommend anyone at this time. I want to get my money back for this money! BOO to us from here in Arizona. Thanks but not thank you. Stupid stuff of this kind is considered by people who are pregnant with you. I thought I would be very funny, I had my own children and I helped others to have children. It was more like the opposite of reality.
