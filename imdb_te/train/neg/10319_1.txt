Unlike most, I'm not a bit objectionable to the prayer or plot of this show. But its implementation is completely different. Like most B-minus films, all the good clothes are pasted into trailers. For 22 or more minutes we can not imagine a real funny slave. Or at least to keep one from the fidgeting with some remote or counting carpet fibers. Performance with some exceptions is terrific; Comics over-emoting and gesticulating some cast members are better suited to a midnight infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (Canadian one.) Although the original cultural perspective is approved, I help but it is mainly portrayed by CBC to reflect the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got tone - and the script - completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult they were not clear to have a job in the real town (why Saskatoon is very difficult to look at?), Do they want to trick the audience through downtown regina exteriors? As a proud Canadian, I hope this matter will soon be over and the rest of the world primarily by CBC campaigners, I hope this big problem of Sitcom will soon be forgotten.
