Razzone is an awesome movie! It's easy. They seem to have tried to make a film to show the life of the reeler. Just as Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark does not have good young actors. Lyon is still a very young girl in the "Kommersmans Jub", and Laura is not enough to play such an important role. <br /> <br /> In this movie she plays with the soul many times and it destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> I want to watch the movie. I agree that young people behave this way, but I think you can see how it will end if you leave your child. <br /> <br /> It is important for supporting movies and movie companies like "Film Folket". Because it's not a great movie, but because of the movies that deal with important themes. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes, and in fact these scenes, Laura is the best acting. - That's the edge she's holding the gun!
