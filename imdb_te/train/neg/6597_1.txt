It is much worse than the horrific Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were awful, but at least they were the regular riffs of the Stan and Ali revival. The new audiences have discovered a couple of intellectual genius and the cartoons are mind-numbing garbage intended for the children to take interest. It should not be imagined. But it also tries to make this work rational ... I can not even think a word. I'm sure the producers felt that it somehow stimulates another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire the past interest with a shallow and unfunny sarcasm that made the original so impressive. Impressionists (I'm willing to call them actors) Vegas will act and where is it. This plot attempts to extend the ideas of two reels rather than the ones used in the old days. If the film was first revealed to Real Laurel and Hardy, I removed the viewer from the original duo's reputation. The only film I hate worse is that I spit your ghost. And, you know, these filmmakers have made the same thing for Stan and Ali.
