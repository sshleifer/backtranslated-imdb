'Mojo' is a Fifty London story, which causes junior rock stars, violence and homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique that emphasizes physical disparities in our manner for the 1950's to be frequently seen in movies, but refers to speech in a very hyperbole (much as indicated by speech in speech during that period); I do not know if the people really talk outside these movies, but have not made movies yet and are used in contemporary times using such a stylized language. The stubborn speech of the screenwriters of the 1950s was formerly used for a lengthy brief master. Thus the story emphasizes rather than universal. 'Mojo' has had a stiff performance from Ian Hart and Aiden Glenn and Evan Bumner, and is still struggling to build 'Ten Spokes' career; But as time goes on, the modern image is constructed deeply into an old breed. It is actually dull.
