Some of them were originally thought of by the story and screen placement of Preston Schr√∂s in credit. Sturges was one of the best Hollywood filmmakers until his skill was deteriorated and he retired. However, it is not Preston Sgers, it is Preston Stuges, Jr. The story is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Battle Imm". The good man seizes an evil object, which will give him any desire but ultimately entrust him to hell. Never mind. No one says the screenwriters should be original. Actors are generally pretty competitive to give the general writing needed to translate the screen. My biggest complaint comes from the end. The hero hopes he finds a way to his stirring but tries to solve the problem a bit differently in an attempt to save an innocent man. At first it seems code of modern horror film but looks real, they feel they have to provide the last dollop of horror at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. It is good to allow old horror films to win at the end. There is nothing wrong with good success on evil no matter what film producers seem to think of the current crop. You can give audiences good health fears and ultimately make them happy. In fact, I think it's best.
