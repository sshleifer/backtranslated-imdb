To be honest, I first heard this program, but it is a bad idea to make a showcase for Muslims to use racist jokes on their own, but that is the opposite. I realized that using a term like a Muslim in real life helps people understand that it is not a terrorist issue. It also shows how to show how bad it is for people to work with their Muslims, by watching the demonstration, and for all the bad people, it is not a bad thing to try to live. At one point of time, Aamir got on an airplane and he took the wrong way for people to use it as "blow up" or the azger used words saying that we'll blow away the competition. It is not usually happening as a Muslim, but they and many Muslims believe that they do bad things about Afghanistan or Iraq, that is not the right thing to do. Looking at this presentation, people will see how much we are treating and how it can take action. I'm happy with this performance in the air. As a terrorist, there are many people in Piotr Muslim people, many people will find my api for funny, because it's right to do it now, and then many people do not make you happy, but it often happens and really gives people a bad name.
