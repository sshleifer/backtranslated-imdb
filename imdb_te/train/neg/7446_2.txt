I have 2 words. Sean Bean. He is only worthy of the film. However, this film did not see. Although he is good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> I do not really care about the characters (except the little boy) and if I mix or die of star lovers, I do not really care. The film does not care or believe me, these people think about one another. I've read a lot of "classic" novels after watching movies and the film does not even like to read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to redeem the story on my head. <br /> <br /> <br /> Get away from Larnau Doon. Lorena is also in the actress Sense and Sensibility. Sharp, Horatio Hornblower, A & E include great movies of novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like Forsyth Saga. Check them out, do not bother with Laura Doon.
