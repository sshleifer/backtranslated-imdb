This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I saw at the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. Director John Lennon was a little better and said too much in the premiere. It's a play, but how laughs the movie is laughing throughout. This is not a good sign. Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard Levin's co-workers were only savvy. The rest of the movie is very serious. Beatles' cheesy song is just abusive. However, the soundtrack is fantastic, however, the best part of the film. You do not have to worry about this silly, except one of the most dominant Dominic Moghaghan fans.
