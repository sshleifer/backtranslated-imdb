I managed to capture this view with the help of MST3K, and Oh boy, even riffing this film is painful evil. <br /> <br /> Imagine the highlights (small ones) from the special effects "okay" Most part acting is also "okay"; <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is bad and bad, they seem to be doing just the camera. On the roller skates move him along the camera man. The story is almost as funny as it is so full of holes (if it is called), it never really stands in the first place and explains why hell, or why human flesh for survival. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is just on the edges of the plane stupid. <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it with all the costs.
