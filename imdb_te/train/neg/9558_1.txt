I thought it was a sequel of some kind, which is considered to be the original since 1983. But the sequel does not destroy the original plot and destroy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have very few expectations, but I have just wasted 95 minutes of life. I do not have any suspense - I really like clear, poor performance, and technology that is grossly inadequate, so I can not believe the computer geek. They tried to make a simple war film and a mix of 24 hours. But this is not enough for a low-budget TV movie. <br /> Do not look at this film, it's time to waste completely. Get the original instead. The theme is still valid. Do not bring more machine to a machine. And the acting and plot is quite exiting and compelling.
