Normally, in the IMDb, more references to the entertainment value of the film going through the majority vote instead of the "weighted average". In this case, the majority gives it a "one". How they are! To start my review, I agree that this film is completely clueless with the name "Foreign Intruder". It contains space and an "alien" (I suppose), but in the long run, there is no verse or reason (all) for a real plot base or resolution that I can not do anywhere. /> <br /> When you see such bad movies you have very few scenes (on scratches, timing and how it's spoken). <br /> <br /> "The plot" is a place where a place called the J-Spot is in the place of forgiveness. That G-Sector ... and a realistic reality program alias sort of infected (?) Virus. <br /> <br /> For many, firearms have been fired, falling from loafs, and seemingly infinite, computer moniter "Aire Ariel?" ("Ariel can not be found" (many of the other shots are interacting with Erel, regardless of Ariel). Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sees and sees every fantasy in the VR programs of the unexpected person who finds the foreign virus and sees one of them ...? <br /> <br /> Before filming this film, Billy Dee Williams took some courses on "How To Work In Desolation". We know that he's been waiting for a long time while he's hanging on his face and grieving. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with a ship nose is semi-happy at the other, and as we are spinning in a circle, we provide for a laugh along with the opening scenes that we see several shots of the ship, like a very Lego experiment wrying watching. <br /> The film dies, so why are you struggling? "<br /> <br />" I'm about to buy my money back to this DVD. <br /> <br /> I added the story to at least one novel and added a lot more detail
