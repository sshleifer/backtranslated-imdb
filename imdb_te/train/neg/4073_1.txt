<br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this is a poor effort that can never be done. It is also called "an image". It is not worth looking at this "random-clip-off-off-follow-and-piccio-violence-and-a-ugly-woman-experimental action-sexy edited poorly". <br /> This is interesting looking at some random family's vacation pictures, and about the same quality you expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new VID-com, and for him <terrible.
