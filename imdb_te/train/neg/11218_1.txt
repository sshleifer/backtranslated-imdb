The image captured in this image is not precious. The dialog is filled with flat, clock overdose lines and the first time by enthusiastic actors as their reading script. Choppy, moving, motion picture style "The Ring" is the simplest simulation of visual effects. Characters do not work as a normal person. For example, her dual sister is looking for her doorstep in her way through the front door, all the creeps around the house frightened and angrily and she does not call her sister's name if she's staying at home. What? She buried her instead of looking for her sister. She has a lot of chin. Most unnecessary flashbacks are a simple sign of an amateur director. Driving his car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, oh side view, is now actually looking at the many shots of the woman seeing a previous view. Already enough. You may think that you are watching a TV business for solaris! Terrible picture. From 100 to 0. I'm really sorry for those who have earned money to see or see the movie.
