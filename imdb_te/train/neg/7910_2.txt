I saw a lot of people in the "My Bollywood Bride" at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and left the theater for feelings of disillusionment inside me. I saw Bollywood movies and I saw the remnants of Bollywood movies. <br /> <br /> It is copied from images of brides and prejudice and Bollywood calling. A sloppy, lazy job at that. Is there any conviction for Bollywood with overseas and well-written scripts? There is no one who can bring millions of real and lovely stories that exist in existence and existence of a billion people? The over-smart auto driver, the cow in the street, the inaccurate scenes of overseas locations and the streets of Mumbai are nonsense scenes. Each click of India will be confident. So sickeningly predictable. Hog !!! Acting performances are weak, except for the talented and beautiful Neha Dubey. One wonders why she would choose such a scheme.
