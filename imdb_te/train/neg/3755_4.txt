I liked this movie, I accept it. This is the best picture I've seen (straight?) Video image. Well ... I wanted to rent this movie as me and my friend shits n 'decided to end. We know what we have and what we have expected is correct. When that red neck was slammed against the tree by Sasquatch, we literally looked at that part from three to four times, which is that amazing (silly, of course). And why? Oh, why did the main character play too much? Honestly, we know you're in danger, it's not that much helpful. But really, this movie is a local video store if you have it. It's worth the money and it's not bad, it's not too bad, but it's also bad. Overall, if you rent this movie, the story will be completed for you.
