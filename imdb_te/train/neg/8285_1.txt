This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson does not have any acting expertise, but the script is too shallow and lame. Listening to a serious conversation that you really listen to, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the film (online) after the first half hour, and I can not take it anymore. She does not just work "the charm of the southern girl" and really annoying; <br /> <br /> Her efforts at the slapstick comedy are flat and she gives her lines as she reads the page on the right side. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not read the script before doing it? Or is Papa Joy (Jessica's father and filmmaker) coming to the big gains promise? Hopefully he knows now better than the sign of another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - because he suffers from bad communication, I see the scene that I am on his face. <br /> Along the way, Papa Joe has been assigned to play a part in the film or give a better rating. In their right mind nobody actually sank in the film. <br /> <br /> Is there a lot of money in Jessica? Maybe some acting lessons can be purchased?
