I'm all for the great epic idea of ​​the American Revolutionary War. It's not. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a promotional screening at old MGM Studios (now Sony). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Nastassja Kinski, who had felt emigrating from the Scottish ancestors (!) Was an American bailiff (and!) From England (!!) - whispering derisive comments about Pacino's terrible misguided accent, beginning with people squirming in their seats. <br /> The story began and it was all downhill. <br /> <br /> The impulses are slummed, conversations are worse, events are not for historical or political issues. There's a plot that's absurdly coincidentally pushed up; Pacino and Kinski each other have been sidetracked for the second or third time lovers, who became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave a brilliant performance as a British officer / pederast. His voice is very much across the map. <br /> <br /> I guess the English actors are not available. <br /> <br /> The residents tried to press and then publicly gafroved. I postponed it - I found that at least war scenes could be better. I made a mistake. <br /> <br /> Hudson chose to paint them with hand-held cameras, not even a stereotype, but a false news bulletin with a false intent. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-well-known TV critic in the audience ahead of my rows: (at the end) Gary Franklin Channel 7 Evenews News. I can say he was persecuted by the rest of us. In his TV segment, the next day, he gave his 10th film '10 to 10 on Franklin scale'. However, those who are at risk of screening before night, I know the art when they see. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino did not appear for nearly 4 years in another film. Hugh Hudson's career was not recovered. You can not tell me I did not warn you.
