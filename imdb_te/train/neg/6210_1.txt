I have seen Lindsay Lohan from "I killed you". <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, you can see that I can not assure you and disappoint you. Hey, Tim Burton, I'm a big fan of you ... did not you open this film too? <br /> <br /> Without giving away anything, there is a blurred story ... Nine wakes up, he does stuff, his actions and decisions are unrelated. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning! Spoiler warning! At the end of the movie .... it rains. When I look at this film a part of my soul is dead.
