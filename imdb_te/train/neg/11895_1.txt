Oh my God what happened here? !! I can not say it again, but what kind of backward picture is? The dubbing in the film is worse than dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller is one of the worst actresses and the claims are really cheating. Gorilla King Kong has the same power to build a robot about a villain named Dr Wol, but this robot breaks up and tries to kidnap the kong and then build another one. When he is (when Linda Miller gets annoyed) he makes his slave to Kang but everything is wrong and King Kong escapes <br /> <br /> Then the doctor sends the robot. <br /> <br /> When Linda Miller and other clowns came to my head when I saw the film, I got a headache. As I play it, I am hoping that I am fighting a mad fight in this film. Ultimately they were very bad because they showed Kang again on his island fighting dinosaurs. <br /> <br >> Do not look at the film under any circumstances or if you do not ... beware of disappointment.
