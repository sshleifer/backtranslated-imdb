I was sitting by this film this evening, and I never thought about what the characters did, but I moved on with it, because Gerard Phillip and Michelle Morgan, the main actors of their era, and I wanted to see this "something different". <br /> In fact, the whole picture is a shattered little town in Mexico that has almost the same unpleasant characters (doctor, course, main exclusion). . <br /> <br /> It relied on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. <br /> <br /> If Sartre's work is like this film it should be a very simple attempt to imitate Camus' master novel play deal with Plague in North Africa. Well acting but uninteresting image.
