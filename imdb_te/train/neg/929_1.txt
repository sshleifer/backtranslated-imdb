My wife and I really rented stupid horror / sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We have seen it in fullmoondirect.com and have decided to add to our Netflix list. Now, when I say this film is awful, I understand that in good condition. Everything about it, acting, camera work, story, clothing, just cheezy and low budget but it does what makes it better. I really saw actors in a scene that was running in the scene. I hope that they really make a surprise when someone who made this film really makes it, because if they are, it's just sad. I would recommend this to make them fun if you really want to see stupid horror movies.
