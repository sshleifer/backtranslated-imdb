W. Somerset Maughgh of Human Bondage is considered an English language classics. If so, here must be a lot missing from the picture version. Philip's (Leslie Howard) attraction of Mildred (Betty Davis) is completely incomprehensible to make the connection from person's viewpoint to a post-breakup refusal. As a family lawyer, I have heard many such accounts; <br /> <br /> That person does not have a goal to be a respectable and always correct one, and to rob the woman. <br /> <br /> In fact, the filmmaker is an uncomfortable movie to see. Philip was also involved in Mildred, when she brought her patriarchal father to the baby, but Philip Mildred - alert and now unrealistic integrity - free run of his flat with real forward outcomes. Betty Davis was attractive for nearly five years of her life, but it did not happen here. In fact, by the end of the film, she is playing the role of Baby Jane, where she is played after thirty years. <br /> <br /> I saw Howard's role and how to get dressed. It describes Philip's middle class dignity. Some such women can not work fast enough with the cockney voice from a woman. Philip, for most film, a student; If such a person is younger, he is more reliable, and with less earnings and less self-esteem often accompanied by student status - English Raskolnikov, such as it is impossible. It will be balanced by giving charm to Moldld.
