Now, I like science fiction cartoons. However, when "Robot Boy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I saw the premiere and inevitably frightened. Characters are simple and common (Is it an African-American person who wear Tiger-strip prints and does not really need to speak with a jamaican voice? Why do all Asian characters have strong yellow and squirting? Does mother have big thighs and chest and constant complaint?) Things are dirty , Speculative, gross and sometimes become disturbing . Astro Boy also has huge comparisons. Give me permission to describe robotboi / astro, Konkaz / Tengma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombieby, Tommy / Alej√≥, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshmo / Oeshe, and so on. "My Life as a Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Comedy Riders", "Sailor Moon" and co. Rupondutunnaru. Not to mention vast ethnic / gender stereotypes. Do not even start fiction. I'd say they're hidden and very dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to look at it. Especially when you liked Astro Boy.
