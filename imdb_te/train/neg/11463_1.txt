This film is only a classic, MASTERPIECE, response to Yahoo that says Jaws is more realistic than genre. Yes, the brain, the great whites (and the shark, the bull, the black-tip, the sea-white tip, the tiger and other species) are well known for the densely populated areas. Humans often do not grant it in that menu, but the shark in the film has repeatedly suggested to show unrealistic behavior. This is not what happened. One killer whale's inequality overcame almost dozens of towns, resulting in a human nenesis, many dozen jaws crossing the North Atlantic fishing boats, and some people are very soft to reach all the friends of the above-mentioned "hostile", to be ridiculous. These jaws are a jaw. Ludicrous. Great white tunnels are often popular for boats, such as boats, protective underwater bogies, and rafting and surfboards, which look like seals from below. The size of Bruce (if you do not know it) is more than 6,000 lbs weighing over the boat, such as the Orca (hey, the name of the rare name we're worrying!). I have gone, but I do not need it. Joss is fantastic (good acting, better effects, improved music, better writing), orca is even worse (jazz, blout writing, unpleasant effects, the most ridiculous plot on this side of the Olson Twins film). It does not take to get masters from Columbia University. See good movies.
