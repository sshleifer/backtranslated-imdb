Last weekend I bought this 'zombie picture' from the bargain bin and thinking with some friends that it's thinking of the budget version of "Land of the Dead" <br /> Boy, I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Chicks come alive and talk somewhere on the cell phone, get some car in the car with some uPy, one of the girls before killing him They really talk to the guy; <br /> <br /> Some people think it is "very bad and good", they are liars, I did not finish the movie, but one of the other reviews Saying the police officers told me that it was very happy, it was not seen by all the way. <br /> <br /> The "Ghost" does not look much worse than it is!
