Well - when Jason Miller (who disappears rather than what he did in Exorcist IV) portrayed the character of Cameo, how big is it? <P> <br /> It's a small country, a little rock n 'roll: Christopher Walken in a basement with a pest-dried mommy with a bad one (two of you - have you lost a brass? - They are going to visit his relatives back. <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The problem: What do we need grandmother? <br /> <br /> The problem is: they play the role of a true Shifti as a husband (he is his sister, or Celtic, or something else, perhaps you can do something for her. Can he sell his wife to the devil? He can look forward to a trust fund that he or she owns) He is a good haircut and good clothes) He drinks, he hears up, he is not a bad guy, it's not good, but it's impossible. <br /> "Husband has beaten him. He returned to knock the husband. <br /> <br /> Now she is alcoholic, he is alcoholic; He married her only for her money. The grandmother was locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle will bring our hero to the dungeon to show the witch's mummy (who are you following this?) Who can come to life? In fact, if you know that you are coming to her life, music waves. A little girl lives in the house, grandmother takes tea (opening the door to do that) and grants a cigarette. Periodically, the grandmother comes out. But nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose a boy at home and lose their bedroom. His throat will be cut in an uncle basement. The famous woman has nose-bleed. Husband drinks. They both drink. In the face of all this, the awful truth mentioned in the first over-voice - omigod - the main woman is pregnant when she is twelve years old. <br /> <br /> These dangling-thread materials, no one managed to get a story on the screen. There is no graduation between scary horror, somewhere in horror, and slowly moving scenes somewhere .-- Laughing, really, caring - and they have places to go with those elements - she is a monster because she can be grandmother, but not her worst mistake There is smokers. She had great hair and good makeup. <br /> Small, no plot. In a dark library a little random (predictable) violence, rain, and sound track enters us. You need more than some drugs and Christopher Walken to make the film. <br /> <br /> The product values ​​are good. Oh. Nice scene, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knows what he's doing. <br /> I bought it. I feel good.
