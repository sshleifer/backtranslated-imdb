Some called Howard Coach a slammist, but he wrote the screenplay for "Casablanca", not him? Or he is not. Perhaps more than one coach is slowing down in Hollywood, and I do not like "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, another Howard coach moves around Hollow. It's written "Casablanca". No matter. <br /> <br /> I would like to have a lot of attention to this comment by Howard W. Koch. <br /> How does it look like you? </ P> <p> Some of the readers have read Cliff's notes on Shakespeare's "King Lear" because the original ideas were on the Inspect Inspiration Express, to update it and finish Hollywood with greetings. <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to split his vast estate between the three sisters, before he asks them how much they love him. Two sisters throw at his feet and wheat nose brought him to his money. The third will refuse to go to the opera on a good girl and Lear. But in the play, Lear is alive to regret his decision to give up his stash in the two compounds and to depose the honest girl. As he puts flowers on his hair and sleeves, he carries the wind on the moorings and catches naked. Children can do that for you. (Take my kid, for example, have I worked on growing up, doctor or lawyer?) In the end, everyone in the drama will die. <br /> In this film, apparently, the good sister is the courage and suicide but when she tries himself off, someone jumps in and saves her, so the end is more or less, happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, if you do not define Hollywood as much in the tragedy itself.
