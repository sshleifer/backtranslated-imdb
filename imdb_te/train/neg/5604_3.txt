I have heard about this film for so many years, and finally got a chance to see it. The major killings of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 led to the closure of the cheerleading camp. Fast forward to 1982, and former student Bambi reopens it with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debray Scott). Each one is murdered and left alone. <br /> <br /> In this film, Tom Smaters is a terrible voice like a Canadian mount and Paul Rubens is his P-V Herman Shitlic. The plot is not entirely developed and quite dull, but some comic scenes take place in bad pies and strip poker scenes. <br /> <br /> It's good for a total of ten or fifteen minutes, and the rest of you can move faster. Maybe catch on the TV, but it's not worth buying.
