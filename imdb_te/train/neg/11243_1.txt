In short, this film is totally unmanned. <br /> <br /> When creating a film, from the beginning of 1900, when someone is thinking about the future. An interesting idea, but lack of compelling story or characters prevents our totalitarianism from being blocked, so this idea is upsetting. <br /> Apparently the whole picture was held together with the stars before the green screens and we were supposed to be impressed. But as a graffiti man, soft glazes are a clear flame to hide the harsh sharp edge problem with green screening. This color wash away to any related effect other than decreasing visual quality. I do not understand why anyone in this film should be considered ground breaking. If anything, the ridiculous retrograde graphics really lowered the bar for bad graphics - they did not even measure ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The designs for robots are very plain, plain and very uncompelling. <br /> <br /> Animals on the island are prehistoric animals, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> The story is terribly worse than trustworthy. I can not believe that I actually did not come out of this film. Regardless of the interaction between Polly and Joe, the film is based on distrust and hypocrisy. Why is Morris Paley role? We are not convinced that Joe is a hero - he flies on an airplane, protecting a man (polly) for personal reasons. Yes there is a great hero for you. Decks has a very small screen time, so why should we care about Joe wanting to save him? <br /> Plot holes: (1) Why the role of Bai Ling? (A major fall from her splendid role in "The Crow") prevents Joaon captured robots? They searched for the sword and did not see them. (2) Why the dex captured in hell but not killed (he was about vials or not, and bad guys had those vials of polly and connected with Joe and so did not know Dex)? (3) Poly Totenkopf indicates that they do not know "to them", and she has some secret source about herself as having an entirely hidden FBI-style file. (4) The blank spot on the map Nepal described - if they knew of this mysterious area, why would their hell be empty in that place? <br /> <br /> * Sigh: * 5) . <br /> <br /> We are happy with the music we have produced even when we do not enjoy anything interesting or remotely on screen. <Br> <br /> And acting? Are we supposed to have impressed a bunch of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Lingu's dialogue is the best in the whole movie (she does not have a single line). The conversation is not a camp, and does not grow up to the level of cheese. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not hero or compelling; They are the kind of people you are trying to ignore or deny if you have the bad luck in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has an average rating above IMDB. IMHO must compete with "Batman Forever".
