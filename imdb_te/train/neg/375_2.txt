Two years ago, at the Berlin Film Festival we saw Amos Koleck's movie "Sue" in the Panorama program, featuring the mainstream Anna Thomson. It's a film about loneliness and sex, and one thing is how to replace it by the other. Now in the same section of the Festival we should complain against Sue's useless contradiction, "Do the extension du domaine de la lutte", now lonely tries to convince us and have no sex. Unfortunately, we are sympathetic to the "our leader" (how he is called Katha-teller), because he is unnecessarily and ineffective and tired of himself. Own mistake, I'm sorry. I can not understand him. Not enough, the destruction of his self-consciousness or passivity of his personality, what has brought him so far, but rotten society and sex is not its image, the writer / director / actor wants us to agree with him. Yes, there are some in-depth perceptions of gender relationships, but we can not follow him so far ... every part of his part is to say no sex and without reflection. In the beginning, some exact changes have been made to lay down the situation. The "hero" in the bed shop talks about hindrances to buy a new bed. It's hard to come up the stairs, you have half a day in the house ... It's a sarcastic about a character who knows that it can take in the hands and hearts into the arms and can do something ... Cinema does not follow this path, with his characters in helplessness. No one believes, "our hero" can trigger Tissenrand for a murder. Very dull, very kind, too - passive (not to mention the complex of Tisserand, he has a resistance, but he's of course not, women's murderer!). Finish: There are women and the world, it is not a modern sexual community's instrument. Help you make it easier, but do not follow the "knowledge" of the movie, bankruptcy of human relationships, and avoid real controversy.
