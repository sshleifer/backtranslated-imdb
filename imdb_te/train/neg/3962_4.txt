I saw Renoir's amazing first work, after watching Werlpool of Fate, really looking forward to Nana. Nana is generally regarded as her best silent film, so I have great hopes. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hesling is the main problem with this movie. She is above acting, a silent film too. Her performance was not late in the 20th, more than anticipated in an image from early adolescents. She usually has the same face, which reminds me of a person with a stomach ache (sorry). It is very hard to believe that someone will fall for this beauty fruit. <br /> <br /> The film is very long drawn, camera work is unhealthy (unlike horse racing) and editing is sluggish. The pandora box of the story puffer reminds me. It is interesting to see that both these films are only 3 years old. <br /> <br /> The movie is only for Renauer's complete or very serious silent films.
