I have seen this film for a long time. It is a police drama and comedy combining the two hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shootout at the Hip Hop Club. <br /> <br /> The plot is contrived and there are many side-to-side problems going on. Hsthott, who runs a yoga school in his spare time, is both in the internal affairs trial, Ford's former girlfriend (Lena Olin), an IA researcher and a psychoanalyst with a radio show There was a man set up killing at the club, Iii shot /> <br /> necessary for a dirty ex-cop car chases and humor <br few dull efforts, and this is about the essence of Turkey.
