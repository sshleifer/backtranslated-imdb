Will Nikhil Advani draw people to the theater till the day of release? I mean ..... Let's look at the cast, the promotion is good, good songs and trailers are good. It makes the first day full house, but it is only when people go and find that they do not need to pay back their money. The house is finished on the first day, the film is out next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by 'Love Assoccham', does not manage to perform well for the whole cast. They tried to keep up with big stars, but neither did managing to provide an average presentation. Stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can not connect with any of them. This is a big disappointment for all the big actors or Nikhil Sadhu after the big success of 'Kal Ho Naa Ho'.
