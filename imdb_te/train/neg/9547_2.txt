The below average video game has become something different in the next terrorist conspiracy found in US Perard. Welcome to the simplicity that is made cheap for video movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game disappears and our "hero" wager makes real money and it does it better. It's like gambling, unless it's part of gambling, it's sucks. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that both strangers of computer games are fighting and saving everything. End. <br /> <br /> The whole $ 1 is also not worth a rental. Please take it. "D-"
