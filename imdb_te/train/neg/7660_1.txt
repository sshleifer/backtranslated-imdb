0 * Christian Slater, Tara Reed, Stephen Dorf, Frank C. Turner, Matthew Walker, Will Sanderson. <br /> <br /> He tries to rebuild the game action-packed nail better based on the video game director Uwe Boll, who is not successful. Instead he made one of the worst films! Even though he is a minor celebrity like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff do not have the necessary fundamentals that need to be as good as his film motion picture, and some basic relativity of what's going on in dark and light. The film bounces all around and has no creative control over the Uve Boll. And the bad CGI was not used to make demons. Though they look cool, feed nuts are good, small lame. This is one of the worst films ever made. My last rating was 0/10.
