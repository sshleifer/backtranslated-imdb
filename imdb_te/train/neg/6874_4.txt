The story of the second wave trio of this strange movie directed by Jean-Marc Bar (Being Light, The Business Blue, Dagglele). I might be wrong but I do not think I really feel a piece of this movie of Dogma '95 Manifesto. I'm not sure what I think about this film. All the actors are good. They are pretty good performances, especially the Rossana Arquette and Jean-Marc bars. The story is something interesting. But I do not know, there is something about the movie I do not like. Sexual scenes are too long. It's a very interesting work of art goes to the romantic part of the worst I'm not sure it goes. It is not exactly a bad image, but I do not want to see it, I can not tell you not to see them. Do whatever you want. If you feel interesting and if you're open-minded, try it, give it a chance you like it.
