I did not really see this movie but I can not tell you something about its product. In a comedy / vintage radio DJ in 1988, I had a call from the production company. They asked me to write and record that they would sound into the soundtrack while making sounds from a TV (never screening the television screen). I'm sure, 50 'sci-fi monster glies, some sound effects and another DJ. As she was in the air at that time, she kept on a long song, reached me in the production room and cut the voice track we once made. Googling, she mixed up with Goofy's sound effects, went back to her program. If we know that "Woodchipper Massacre" is going to be such a turkey, it will not be paid for our efforts. - Gary Theroux
