This movie is just another average action movie, but it's pretty good. When guns come out, some choreography needs help. Andy McNab - Those who have done an incredible action sequence when they move into the street from exploitation - the scenes have become slippery into something special. The rest of the movie is too late because - the imagination but visually - is much better than you would expect from this kind of film. The final scene, the show-down, we are looking forward to, but it's like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, hits nothing, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.
