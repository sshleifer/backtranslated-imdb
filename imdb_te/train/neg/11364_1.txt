The first ten minutes of the film are about to take on an international film in Belgium: the real confusion on the set, the producer on the edge of the nervous breakdown, the cool director (Mickey Rourke), the evil nature star, etc. You've seen everything before, but it works well. But then! The rest of the time, the film is just repeating: again the same ten minutes. Climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, even bad acting, it just goes and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes, talking about his character about his role in reality and fiction scene. <br /> <br /> The whole 12 makes good minutes. <br /> <br />
