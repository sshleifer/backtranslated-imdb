Seen Bean as good as photographs, locations and clothes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the end is flat. The plot has changed since Cornwall's novel, and is not good. Unfortunately, this adventure is better read than it is. Sharp is very small here, even more intelligent and decisive, despite his fear of his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks, in contrast to his literary disguise. I really enjoyed a brief scene where Sharp dropped a "real" officer, and after a quick break and strangle, he came back to the surprise and weakened officer. This sets the tone for his next trials as a commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" "10."
