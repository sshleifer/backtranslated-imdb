My wife and I have rented this movie because some people are in parallel between it and "office space". <br /> <br /> Now that I have Office Space probably 15 or 20 times, blockbuster and IMDB are also "recommended" option. I loved it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Being ingrained, humorous, and having reminders of people I have worked for over the years. "High Tunnel" is the same as "Office Space", two images. Where is the analogy ends. We probably sat in the middle of 50 minutes and gave it a suspicious advantage and did not expect it to be good. It's not. We can not take anything, tape is disabled. Thank God for this is a free rental. If we paid for it, I'd say p *** ed. We have to sit by it and make money for it. Now, since we did not see the ending, maybe it's magically coming together and returned to itself. <br /> <br /> The hi-tech tunnel is much worse. The film is unnecessary, it is painful. Just mail friggin letters already! Basin Asin. Jokes are awful. We came up to the "printer does not work" and came to stop. We can not take it anymore. EMBARRASMENT for the film Josh Kornblut. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Space, do not waste your time with this tide. 0/10
