Typical Troma-Worst, along with the "Toxic Avenger" released a year ago, as one of the smutty 80's film Lloyd Kaufman's brutal production studio's "headlines". If you ask me, "Toxic Avenger" is very high, but it has the fiery-fist with integrity; Make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. These events take place in a small town in Timomile, which is proud of being the poisonous chemical capital of the world, and they are certainly not lying. By saying that safety precautions are low in the local nuclear power plant, at least (by Homer Simpson is not of this type) and the toxic waste is moved to high school. The first narcotic victim claims to be the stereotypical himself who has begun to prevent the green stuff from his body cavities, but his death is believed to be in danger because the two microwave ovens in his house are low! Oh, humanity! However, shortly after, nuclear pollution also affects the school's weeds and begins to be really bad. After smoking a joint in a party, the most beautiful couple in school make a big worm monster, settling in the basement and feeding on a young scum. "Nuke 'em high class" is a low-of-the-barrel horror film-making and dialogue, so they do not hurt your ears and have a cosmetic effect that gives you the latest meaning of the tasteless word. If you are enjoying looking at the faces, you should definitely see, in half, to get crushed or split! Unlike the aforementioned "Toxic Avenger", when Chrysie and Warren try to figure out what is wrong with their hormones, the film is really frustrating and long moves. Crude humor is not as effective as "toxic avenger" and acting performances are disadvantageous. Proceed only if you're an avid Troma-fan.
