Normally, I do not like retaliatory pictures .... PERIOD. But double impact is a bit more than your typical revenge plot. You see that you have DI, action, accuracy, exotic locations (such as Hong Kong), awesome gun battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your craving for an impressive unarmed fight. Like all the revenge flicks, the villains you love to throw in a pan-glass window on the top of the 40-story building! <br /> <br /> There is no groundbreaking influence on the theme of attack on "I For For Eye" and "Death Wish 2" and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes of a double impact. <br /> <br /> Plot Department is transparent as a double Impact. Chad and Alex's parents have been killed in the mob hit team that is connected to a family friend with money issues or at least I remember it. Why the talking to boys in French tones is a detailed one. The film was not a bad water flow, but the use of movements from Clichard Lines and other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really became worse. Even though double impact is still visible. But why is shitty movies like this (for example, Chad and Alex Parents and the greedy British Red Guy that killed the deadly British Guy) will you love to hate with your being fiber?
