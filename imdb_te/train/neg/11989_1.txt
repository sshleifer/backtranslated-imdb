This clunker of the image sets a new standard for evil filmmaking. Jared Rutzon gave a fairly poor performance of a badly created character, creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The main pressure of the film is that when a boy is temporarily flown into a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness, a teenage who is ill can learn about his mother's marriage. Unfortunately, this kid does not have a child sitting in dreaming of the whole movie, or it turns out to be a strange collage of random "survival events" (two separate hockey scenes participating in a fight with a bear) and strange fantasies. (And it's a nightmare!). Furthermore, there are many scenes that do not fit into too many small children or family views, although some of the film's viewers have a critically hurdlest for the film's viewer, a dead pilot's underwater graphical scene exploded in one of his eyes. <Br /> <br /> All in all, it's a horrible film that no few innocent children should avoid.
