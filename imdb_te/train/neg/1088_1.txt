I rarely saw such unwanted waste for talent. There is nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of the film. The film seems to promise some interesting strings in the film, initially slightly higher than the red herring. Stature actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - have been replaced anywhere else; Occasional intellectual director has produced a film that appears to be filmed by a coffee-stained camera lens; A writer (John Grisham), who does not produce anything of Merit, has discovered a depth of new depth. The film has a cheaper feel about it - but just at the interpretation level - is really part of its aesthetic. In general, I would make balanced, generally favorable comments for IMDb. This crazy catastrophe of a movie wants me to produce endless and hateful wealth. I'm not, but this is not the tragedy of my "mind".
