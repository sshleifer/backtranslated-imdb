The minute that started, we know for trouble! The premise is the most ridiculous. <br /> Acting is hard and actors are inexperienced. You'd expect more from Slater, Reid and Darf's likes. Lines are delivered from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like the read but she is very unbelievable as an archaeologist. Slater and Darf try their comebacks and choose a lousy movie on stage. <br /> <br /> Continued in the whole movie. The creatures are not bad, but they are not really good either. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I need to return ninety minutes of my life. They can put money, but give me time! No waste.
