Someone could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version succeeds at any authentic and interesting draining from the worst-TV phenomenon. Dozens of popular bad movies (eg "Manaus: The Hands of Fate") show creativity and spirits that show intellectual waste rather than creativity and movies. <br /> How seriously is Jerry about the documentary Springer Show, an answer to realistic questions like this: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? <br /> <br /> A good way: In a "trend" session for guests: "People, I can not hold this enough: NO weapons!"
