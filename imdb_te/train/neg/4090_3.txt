Full shock-dealer Leo, in his usual cettacarya, instead of just harrarku coherent, one of the worst, barely coherent knife and enchanted by the fantasy film was a change of pace. <br /> <br /> ఇలియస్ అని పిలిచే ఒక వింపీ ఓర్లాండో బ్లూమ్ రకం, కొంత సమాజం నుండి అస్పష్టంగా కనిపించే ప్రాచీన గ్రీస్ మహాసముద్రం గుండా కేవ్ మాన్ భూభాగంలోకి వెళుతుంది, ఇది దుష్ట యుద్ధానికి కొన్ని అస్పష్టంగా నిర్వచించబడిన క్వెస్ట్లో ఉంది, తోడేలు-మనిషి మరియు ఒక రక్త పిశాచిగా ఉన్న చెడు దుష్టవేత్త Of the mutant ministers. Wackiness is great. Sorceress, oppressing local cavemen and wants magic bow for her. Antyadisalo win our leaders, suppressed everywhere, strikes a blow for the caves, many delegates than she, even older than the pump. Does the film have a steady stream of WTF? Items and moments. <br /> <br /> For some reason the whole image is painted in a soft view and the image becomes more obscure by the continuous presence of smog on the screen. It may be an attempt to create an atmosphere or hide how dummy everything looks. Anyway, it failed. There is no atmosphere, it does not hide how nicer and light irritates and except how thick everything looks. Wolf-man servants seem to be like a poor man's wookie. For some reason they fell in love when the director slowly hit the wind in the motion, Six million dollar man style, and attacked our leaders. There are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and every time gets goofier. Other than humans, who are dressed in leather minimentlu simple wizard, a little white marpucendagalavaruga, who will be seen in cobwebs. They are slow and unthreatening and lisping Dalale, when they speak sound like gay Hispanic. Battles are stilted and incredible and special effects are woeful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He especially put his maiden clothes and big hairs off completely, and apparently a moron. Sure, he has an extraordinarily shot with his magical bow but he takes three or four darts with him in his mission of evil this whole continent war. In a few minutes he will go out of the arrows and do not need to be rescued by the traditional sword and hypnotist leader Massey. He met iliyasnu, he established himself as someone who does not have food, he himself does not have any friends, but they compliment the hills, the hills in pursuit of compliments, instead of the interests of the mayas iliyasto Willie promised to take him. He's going to Elios. "Wherever my legs take me," he replied. Good enough for Elius. Masaye is an animal lover and an outrageous man. He is very fond of humans, because he is very fond of humans because he preaches about his great love and affection for animals. He said that he hunts and kills the animal to eat him, but steals the meat of other people who have hunted animals. He's innocently not on the killing of innocent passersby for any good reasons. Shortly after they met, he was a bow of Elias tested and tested some of the cuts to the caveman random, looking for his own business, walkable and kills him. This poor soul has indicated anything to this and even Eliros deserves, who do not even raise eyebrows who belong to a more moral and civilized society. <br /> <br /> Films villainy is very unusual. The whole image is totally naked except for her g-string and a gold mask rolling her whole head. Foolie added one of her movies as an obligatory ti & an item but she decided a bit of a bit of a bit of the last minute. She is delighted by her pets and she spends time with an unintended bow, dressed like Ilius. Wow, such symbols! Later when she fails to defeat Ilias and Masses, if she kills herself, some give her the old slave's sex slave. The most horrific villain and women's rights in the world are not really going forward. I'm sic of the cobweb creatures that he is on our heroes and nobody around impersonates the mose in the situation there is no one but moles fool. Has he really valued your self respect, okron? <br /> There are very few WTF? Moments. Most of them come to the end of the film. Ilias wusses, I forgot why, perhaps got her mussed with his permed hairdo, but his path ignores the error and returns the Massey help in the fight of evil forces. Suddenly, without any reason, his bow suddenly opened the target with multiple targets seeking bolts of energy. Bolt can also be shot by cubic rock when needed. There is no need to tell his small work of bad people who captured the masses. <br /> <br /> The climax is also involuntary. Mass deacetes the remaining forces of okron using bods aimed at lace attack capability. He could shoot Ocron away from one kilometer using his shoot through a rock shoot. She starts to die. Her mask was ripped off by a bizarre Muppet head. She screams around with tears and dogs and revolves around another dog. Mass laughs. <br /> <br /> This dodgy low-budget knife and astonishing imagery is surprisingly similar. No one seeing the Lost Kingdom's wizards tell you these films are really weird and in the brain.
