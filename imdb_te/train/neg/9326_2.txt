A group of me and a group of friends had rented horrible videos to laugh at them, resulting in some terrible expenses, but some great laughs. Illness. One of the best horror-non-funny movies we rented. Complete the plot over, take your friends into the whole woods and never return the thing is too old. The goriest part of the movie will be visiting your local butcher shop except for a little dirtier and blood on your meat-looking game Dow. If the film is ever scared anytime, they must adhere to their whole life cartoon network, which is vibrant. The best of the film is that the two girls are reasonably hot and the other one is better and you look naked in the movie. The other good thing is that the movie is very difficult, and you laugh till you cry. I do not like watching terrible performance or renting these horrific videos, but I can not find that entertainment, but the amount of effort to keep these people is still very bad, happy and hired. <br /> You have to give me 8.5 for your rent / purchase.
