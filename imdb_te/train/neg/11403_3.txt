I love horror movies, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's. But nobody can think that this is a very good horror movie. Compare titles with similar hunted house films. Haunting, shaking, shining. Or FAAAR for a similar technology-based horror film, (Demon Seed is still great). Okay, I'll be fair .. Compare it to TV-horror movies! Do not sleep .. waaay creepier and good done. Most of Salaam's, night chasm, night gallery, are also well do not go in the basement or cacheensave farm. For a good scene like a bloody shower scene, Spaniards * First, you have a scene like an early scene .. Oh boy! The garden hose comes alive with some frisky young people down the hose! Terrible. Also, what we mean about the house .. It is clearly necessary to see what's happening to use its video cameras, and this is a very emotional house. Is not a soul, or demon, or organization, is a house that is "having", but what is it? Do we believe in a real thing that we know about Suzie / Margaret, our heroine? Now I'm on the subject of Saji's. This half-old crazy lady comes up, she tells you your nurse, sends her heart out, falling in the boiling pool, 45 seconds, and Margaret what does she do? Did she lose her hands to save this poor elderly woman who came there to warn her life? No, she stands there and looks! Performing a lot of performance for horror movie is good, but it's in the positive end. At least the most interesting and entertaining horror film looks at the dead bed: the dead bed. I did not view it since it was too high for people who rated it, or remembered that they were scared of children. This image is too small.
