I did not see "Henry Fool", but I'm not sure after watching "Fay Grim". Perhaps Hartley wanted to be the director of "Anti Thriller" - he certainly succeeded with this hero. Based on official description --- The woman realizes that her dead husband's written document has a threat to national security - I imagined a tat geopolitical drama. Instead, I change mockery, goofy dialogue, flush specification, messed plot and a "tone", which suggests that at any time the heart changed the script to his heart. I can hang on for a long time with frustrating, hard work (eg "duplicity"). They leave the hanging questions (e.g. "duplicity"), if they do not, or they do, with sharp writing and acting one's interest. But halfway through "Fay Grim" I reached a disastrous perfection --- I do not know what's going on, and I do not care. It is very bad, because Parker Posey really does not like her, desperate wife and desperate, asks her to be morphed from Clueless's mother, a tough and active international player for a human being with psycho-mortal terrorists. There is also bad casting. Jeff Gold Blum is very good, but he has not been able to overturn a misunderstanding as a CIA operative. He was uncomfortable in the role because I saw him in that role. His CIA sidekick was worse; He appears as a refugee from the quarterback of the "American Idol" (young CIA agents mixing the hair on their foreheads with large stones). Then there's the sticky question of the characters' age. Goldberg is 54 years old when he is "Fay Grim"; Thomas J. Ryan, who played the role of "Henry Fool", is 44 years old. It looks or feels older than their actual age. However, one of the main features of the story is that they worked as agents in the CIA in Nicaragua in the 70s. Gold Blum's role is already in his 20s; Henry Fool is a young man. Will Hurtley be "quirky" or lazy? There are a lot of problems list ...
