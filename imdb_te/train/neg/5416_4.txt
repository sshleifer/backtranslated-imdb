Director Van Stroehim's third attempt - it's very raw and no one has shown exceptional skill of camera and editing skills, and he has performed with his master, brief and wedding march a few years later. Especially we have a trio of grifters, as a Russian count and two Russian princesses rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use duplicate money for gambling tables and win a fortune. As part of the plan Count (von Stroehme) feels like a visitor to herself as a visitor to American ambassador and her "crazy" wife, hoping to make her some money by betraying her and playing her weaknesses. He also makes the mistake of taking the life-saving savings of the man who promised to marry. When she sees them together, she sets fire into her room (von Stroehme and her room in the balcony of the room). Here Van Stroeheim establishes the first person as "a man who desires to hate". He is totally evil and his role defects ultimately bring him to the very bad and livable end. The film is tied to cinematography and editing, and unless the director is fascinated, it will not be visible. There is a pretty bit - when he tries to meet the first Ambassador's wife, she reads a book - we see the title Philosh Vives by Erich van Stroihehem. Originally considered a 210-minute film, the studio was reduced to 140 minutes and finally released at 70 minutes. The Kino video restoration returns footage from the previous version (most scenes are damaged in some way) to give us a 107-minute print.
