The film is a major disappointment. In this film the relentless brutality and violence level is very worried. Some scenes are really unnecessarily ugly and average zealous. The main characters are impossible to spot, or even sympathetic. The main character's role is slimy as they come. The sickroom / hothouse atmosphere has also come over the top theatrics. There is little or nothing about the Spanish Civil War from this film. Luckily, I was aware that Spain and this are not realistic! In addition, the use of homosexual appeal as "horror" is also very dangerous and poorly maintained, packed on DVD and promoting gay viewers. The actors are uncomfortable in their roles, if you like watching the killing of children and killing children, as they are trying to distance themselves from this mess.i, the film will appeal to you specifically.
