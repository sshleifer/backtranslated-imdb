This film is similar to the name 'Blighty Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The stories of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Coward's work. I'm surprised that the films of this nature do not accept the concept of the original author. <br /> <br /> "These films are very expensive and I'll perk when the screenplay is originally released, <br /> <br /> I realized that the films are still more fun, but I'm happy when the people's taste is granted Incanu. <br /> <br /> In this case people did not taste. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to this movie, for better cinema entertainment. I'll watch the drama.
