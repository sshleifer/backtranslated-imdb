The original "Vanishing Point" is a great movie. The real motives, the characters seemed to be true and random. Remake is terrible. Preci, obviously outright; It missed the point why it was a classic original. The black charger is cool, but it can not even save this image. Why stick with white challenger? I did not think it was the best option for '71. Some parts of the film are unexpectedly happy. While Vigo is standing on a hill looking after a deep valley after his "Dream Quest". His Indian is standing next to him. Wego only wore his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just seems silly - observing Vista in the fruit of his looms. Another scene ended after the bulldozer was blasted - its effect was clocked at 180 mph. He later stated that he did not recognize his remains because of the invention of the police, but some believed he would help and hid in the crowd. Then get out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you can not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car did not continue to travel in straight line for 100 yds. Nobody has led it. It should go roughly 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you will be closed in different squeeze pieces. However, we will stand with his daughter and see him. Overall, a film that insults someone's intelligence.
