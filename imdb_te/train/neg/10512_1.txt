Tom Saavini, I rented this movie for a reason to respect his work, but this is true, I have horrible clips, and half the naked women in the film are "horrified angels" occasionally "Blair Witch" black and white motion skin camera scenes. Tom's character is really awful, horrific script. And you've got to love these lines they use. "Someone is there, who's there, it's not funny," is not your acting. Can I be a picture of this? Oh characters names. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they left Anthony, the breakfast club rejoined in an unforgivable acting.
