First of all, I look forward to "Cause Heat" along with lines such as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I'm wrong! This film did not rob the 70s, "chicks in the chain" or "women in prison". <br /> <br /> Previously, a group of women in jail have plots that wear btw (very funny), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong opponents, no one can try and escape Warden Doctor, and make prisoners. There are 2 shower scenes, I suspect that just recycle footage, but there are no stunts / no one persuaded here - or anywhere in that respect! In the absence of the plot, from the incredible, impartial and flat factors, a couple of escape prisoners will actually return to prison to "release" their fellow prisoners? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
