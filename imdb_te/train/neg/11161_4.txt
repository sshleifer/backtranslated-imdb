<br /> <br /> Cast: Jack Black, Ana de la Regera, Hector Jimenez, & Darius Rose <br /> MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (raw rhyme with some tough action and dialogue) <br /> Tell us what you will do about it. It's a bright brick on the wall, but a funny movie, though - I've always thought "Napoleon Dynamite" is a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man - overheard, yes, and overly overwhelmed by the adolescent audience who practically worship him, but funny. Jack Black Comedy rarely I am somewhat enjoyed. So, I've heard Jack and Jack for a movie about a Spanish friar who turned out to be a wrestler for writer and director Jarade Hess, "Napoleon Dynamite". My only reservation plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, all my reservation has fallen out of the film. The plot, in some shows such as "Saturday Night Live" or perhaps "Mad TV", was a blunder and worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, for almost one and a half hours, this joke was flat. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. The whole monastery, Nacho (Black), now Monastery Cook, decides to become a professional wrestler to follow his dreams. Nacho decides to join a wrestling tournament, so that he can win the prize and provide good food for the orphanage of the monastery, when the monetary finances are lowered at all times. This plot sounds very sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect image for Jack Black. See what he did with "School of Rock". Well, in my dissatisfaction, this plot is almost completely ruined offensive and gross humor that takes away from the heart of the movie. This is a common idea for many young people, as everyone knows, and the way to Hollywood's way of thinking that teen audience only understands rare jokes and nonsense. Looking like a mouse across a floor like a mouse on the floor makes sure people laugh, but do not expect to get an award for putting in your image. <br /> <br /> Performances in "Nacho Libre" are actually good. Jack Black once again proves that he is absolutely hilarious and he can create a lot of careless and worthless lines placed on paper on paper. Unfortunately, this film is not enough for him. This did not give him anything to go, and because of his work was the only cause of his jokes. I did not see or hear before Ana de la Regera, but now that I can say, she is not only very talented, but she is one of the most beautiful women in my eyesight. Clicking on her role has worked greatly. Hector Jimenez, playing Nacho's active partner Esclito, kept me laughing constantly. He did a very good job and it was very effective with the partnership of Jack Black. Danus Ross plays an orphan, Chancho, who does not have many lines, but I enjoyed him very much. He is adored. The rest of the cast has done their job. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" simply does not work. Its plot is a very narrow length. Its heart is soiled by melodic humor and sickening jokes that do not work at all. I rarely laughed and, if I did, it was a jack block or another member of the cast. And it leads to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": yes, cast. This cast is not good, lack of good, they are. They all click together, have amazing chemistry, and pump life as much as possible in the flat script. I was surprised that Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" was completely bored with "Nacho Libre", after fully filmed. Something went wrong here and I could not understand what happened. I know that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie yet and it's not entirely working due to its cast. Jack block work is only a small reason to watch. But, if you're not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this picture like a plague. I like black, but I have done with this movie and with this review. <br /> Final Thought: Oops! It was a hopeful disappointment of Jared Hess, then to his silly "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> Total Rating: 4/10 (C +)
