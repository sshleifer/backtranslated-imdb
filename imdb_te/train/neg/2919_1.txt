Geez, a gay man who lives in NYC, I am grateful that I can not see the underbelly of the gay culture that was filmed in this film - and I am so glad !!! The film is aired on TV across the United States, and there are great anti-gas setbacks and I can not say I've blamed them. People in this movie do not represent the average gay American or average Trandgender American, what they represent is a pure and totally nightmare. These people's actions are disappointing that the apparently lower-aged characters are appalling and obviously racist moods (white-opposite) are vague and unsatisfactory - people can not blame people for drugs, unemployment and denial of education in the part of the film's "cast" Any denial and Of a man who was willing to do something to self.
