When I first saw the film cover (a big bug chasing some big nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey", I'm not a big Hollywood movie. I was surprised to see Steve Railsback in this chess-ball movie, doing a good job in what role he always has ... FX is beautiful, there are not many plots where the movie is not sure why it is called Blue Monkey, because there is no monkey in this movie. But when it comes to people, what did you expect ?? It's not as bad as it really is .... If you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug-attacking movies, these updates are mainly updated with updated versions,
