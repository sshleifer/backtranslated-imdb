There is no plot and the actors do not care, so this is the most nonsensical movie I've ever seen. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot, I laughed too much when I opened my rib pain. The bit is ridiculous when old men rob Robert Duvall. Making a Nair film does not have a rainy sequence and mean sutters in the lead role. It failed to create a Noyer Thriller and to break the viewer with conflicting scenes. As I have seen, based on 'Manuscript' by John Man Grisham, I did not consider one of the books in the movie, because no suspense was shown and sinking up like films or 'The Rainmaker'.
