The movie begins to show some idea, but later becomes a great disappointment. What if the rest of the film is a bit less to prevent a clutch plot? The film is very unbelievable. Will I take a nurse dress that I realize that I am not in a clinic, kill a doctor, take a patient in her bed and go to her chevy pickup? I guess nobody answered the question, so they just jumped in the other scene hiding these little details. The shows are just plain bad. The villain is another "bizarre crazy villain", what a deep, completely linear character. After 20 minutes of the film, most scenes were unbelievable, and they were kept there for 90 minutes because they were totally irrelevant. A doctor is looking at a woman who is clearly visible under stronger medication, denied her to be examined, abandoned from home and abandoned silently. The end of the scene made me burst into the launcher, Mickey Mouse can only do more from reality. Say it first 10 minutes and 10 minutes.
