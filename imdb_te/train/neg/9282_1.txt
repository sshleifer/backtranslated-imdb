The film is ineligible for the female title. It's so bad that it really was hit by the classic nature of the first three. This is never done, they need to change the title. <br /> They did not say exactly NAME's of the Damian Thorn! And the most important part of all Bahubali movies is good. Drag it out of the shelves and shoot it.
