San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. In the film, filmmakers have made no attempt to use the city. They did not fundamentally carry out the original details. I do not recommend anyone to be a San Francisco film. "Oh, I'm there," you will be thinking "How can a two story turn into a quiet hotel lobby in firetrap / stinky armpits?" East Coast speech styles and effects are used. <br /> These stories were originally shot at least three different styles. Chinatown's story is the most influential and interesting. The plot is weak, scene from classy Hong Kong action movies. Actually they have more tension and emotional resonance, they are inserted and better. But acting is a lot of fun and we can see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> Do not understand the introduction of the White Boy. I think filmmakers do not know what to do with it, so they are loosely constructed and reduced it. The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley Liberal - really, folks know that everyone is not "groove" to live in the ghetto - but his departments are very funny. They threw some good choices. The West Coast is educated and unhappy, whereupon Jupp is a different kind of Yuppie jerk than they do in New York. They can not afford equilibrium but are always noticeable. That was interesting; <br /> <br /> Hunter's point intro most disappointing. It is the most derivative of the three, and stylist far from stylistic from the stylist. You've seen this done and you looked better. Also video game is good! <br /> <br /> Despite the usual non-locality and the non-target script, these characters have probabilities, actors have talent and ten minutes to round up all the interesting things in a clumsy direction. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> PS Here is a missing minority, see what you can imagine.
