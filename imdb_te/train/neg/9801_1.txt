When I was a child in the early 1990s, I remembered that this program was on television, with the Goofy Letard's kids spinning around the plastic dinosaurs, doing this kung fu for someone else. It was called Power Rangers. I remember that little kids go around hitting each other and then shirts and programs are banned in many school districts in the country, as they teach each other how to resolve differences between them. <br /> I did not really imagine this presentation, especially as the Tick has played good performances in Fox Kids. Most old teens have always looked at power rangers in a cunning and scornful manner, and why not wonder why. The footage is greatly ridiculous. Color Rangers dresses will work for you and it looks like the dinosaurs plastic nonsense. Then you get into acting, and of course those really ridiculous haircuts. All the boys run around with earrings, half of them wearing 90 mallels, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then switch to the power rangers wearing the lettered. <br /> The toys are particularly ridiculous, and joke of several midnight talk show hosts. Two of the previously filmed movies and the two films that have so far are based on this show, almost every reviewer dispersed both the films, and was based on that. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are not more than a bad television commercial especially for bad television trading. As an adult, I do not look fondly, but the children of the 1990s shows as another embarrassment, the fashion and the guys' earrings.
