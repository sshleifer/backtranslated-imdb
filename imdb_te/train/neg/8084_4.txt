I chose this title from a friend who's sitting on a full DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so I do not have to pay for that luckily. I know what's bad after watching the really great looks, and now <br /> <br /> Solar turmoil is a bad thing, but now I'm dead in the dead Things and Living and they do not play astounding Strange Creatures who become mixed-up zombies. , But it does not reach the complete pain of some films. <br /> <p> However, the general set is to destroy the massive solar mass on the Sun's Earth. Humanism has set up an aerospace engine and team to deal with this imminent threat, hitting a huge bomb (described as "the biggest explosion") into the sun, through some twinkling science fiction. <br /> <br /> The evil episode of the original Star Trek Recall as the sounds I described to you. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> </ ref> The crown of the film's unsatisfying success coincides with the villain role (played by Boyle), who killed the mission Insistent to do. By the way, he sends a bad minion to an awkward bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the genetically engineered scientist of space crew, who played male lead Annabel Schofield. Why is he suppressing the mission? Because of his moral attitudes, he believes that the burning is not possible, and when it does not, he will have a tremendous wealth as he dug into the stock market of his evil nails. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is amazingly twisted and slowly developing, and the storyline of the characters that contain vulgar or useless characters. I will sit here and actually click, or explain what happened to show the screenwriting's inability to make the plot of your attention, but I'm sitting on the review in Microsoft Word, three pages, and I will only lose your interest. But again, you will have the same effect from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film is suffering from very poor conversations. At all times the Star Trek Enterprise, the characters rolled back the psyched-jerk jargon at each other. Yeah, I know, they have already done it, but if they have everything they did, and what they used to create strangers and unmanned scenes, they used to create any enthusiasm, tension or interest in the audience. <Br> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <br> "The script explains the explosion danger in advance, but he is not bothered to explain why or why it's going to happen, and why he really can not escape. + Overall, you're sorry between extravagant and ludicrous. <br /> <br /> We have a lot of dramatic scenes There is nothing to build On his death bed, the end of the fence is the fact that our boy hero finally puts his last name (a terrible bruised that makes someone put a balloon under his eye) While wearing a job dress up), he says he kept quiet about before Col. Travis J. Richards.   ముగిసిన తర్వాత ఆ బాలుడిని నిశ్శబ్దంగా పునరావృతం చేస్తాడు, ఈ చిత్రంలో కొంతమంది పేరు తరువాత కొంత ప్రాముఖ్యత ఉన్న ప్రేక్షకులకు ప్రేక్షకులకు ఇస్తాడు. బహుశా చార్ల్టన్ హెస్టన్ యొక్క గ్రిజ్జ్డ్ అడ్మిరల్ పాత్ర అతనిని తెలుసు మరియు అతని పేరు పునరావృతమవుతుంది ఒకసారి ప్లాట్లు ముందుకు సాగుతాయి. Something. <br /> <br /> Do not worry. Sorry. This moment is quite a moment, hoping for something else when you are trying to create a drama, which is a stain in the perennial palace forever for flat and honeymoon for a character, as well as the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Completion of the film is a climax under her opponent's spell to jump up the bomb in the middle of the Schofield and the Sun, which contains another of the film's substantially good visual effects sequences, including the feature It's really cool. To be the most diverse budget of this movie, Stingger and Boyle, Heston and Palanes, have been unfortunately lost with a supporting cast behind the script. /> Grade: D-
