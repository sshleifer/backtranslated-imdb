<br /> <br /> When I saw it in the late 80s, it was one of the most horrific and boring movies. <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. Check settings are really amazing. <br /> <br /> Political background is with the tone, but Ollen and Binocco are beautiful, except such "historically set" stories (e.g., givigo_ (qv)). But this film will make the "romantic" scenes plowed and slow. I'm for romance, but this film is very boring, I started to shoot all of the Russians and hoping to end my misery <br /> <br /> I'm sure if I have read the book! , The story was a bit more sense. However, it spends a lot of time in life.
