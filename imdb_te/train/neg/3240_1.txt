It is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and it is unhealthy, in my opinion. Some boys were torturing a girl before finally killing her. And this time, I will say that these movies are not true! <br /> <br /> The scenes are obscure in many cases but are irrational. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can see how they can kick the floor near the girl and stump! How stupid looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes are the intestines of the animals thrown on the girl, the girl is put on the wounds in the body of the girl, who can not carry off the fingernails for many hours, puts wounds in the body of the girl, pierced the eye and triangular details and pieces in stuff like that. There is nothing too precious or cinematically important, very sick and average dynamic image. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The next part of the devil is not bloody, like the blops of flesh and blood, but this first entry was unhealthy and highly enthusiastic Guinea Pig. Experiment is probably a sick thing that I have seen and there is a neat thing to snoop. This is still the only difference (of course) faked s (n / t) uff, the only realistic "smile film" is that the picture dies or hurts the real one. This is not recommended to anyone because this s **** y and repulsion. Those who think that this is a great horror film is nothing about the film and the meaning of the original. I saw this curiosity (the other parts of the series) and now I know how they are intolerable. They work only at the shock level and this is not the most valuable movie success. Perhaps I saw the devil's experiment and the most horrible movie I've seen mermaid in Menhol (Guinea Pig 4) is probably the most unpleasant film I've ever seen. So this is pretty bad in my book, but for all of them.
