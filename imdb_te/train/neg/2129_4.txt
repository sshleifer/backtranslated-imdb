In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY music has only two things - Tin Daly and the version now filmed with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to see.) But it's all there is to me. Most cast will be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips Kim really does not know who is and wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when Jorge Wendt feels he will be back to Bar Bar Stool in Boston. Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig should go and I saw good dancing in Buggy Malone. As I mentioned, it is good to have the version of the stage script now, but I have never seen the young people there, they never saw a musical direction, do not judge them all.
