I saw this movie and did not read the book. <br /> <br /> The good thing in the film is that you, for a time, have been thinking about your role in spiritual, evolution, sin and the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film is easily broken and there is little understanding between the viewer and the characters. The book is very clear that this film is very difficult to reform. Suppose to show the sincronicity of events are almost unrecognizable. The scene should be a lot of argument for the viewer that suggests a coincidence, and it is more likely to imagine having something with more advantage. <br /> <br /> Enlightenment scenes are visible and do not create a good feel for it. Do you recall enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in the Little Buddha)? <br /> <br /> Many scenes are poorly executed. <br /> <br /> The good actors in the film are not Hector Elizondo, Jacqui de Alameda and Jürgen Prochko, and there are a lot of scenes that do not develop. Bhadhraparucu. It appears that they have gained more sequences than their characters in saving the first 2 pictures, and they do not work because they paid more. <br /> Jürgen is good in his scenes and sells as an evil man (as always), but the script does not help him. All. The scene that he first attempts to convince John (Matthew's settlement) to join him is just a bad script. The execution of the scene will be run unexpectedly when he dies in the explosion. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie is a big waist, reading the book! I did not read it, but it's a billion times better than that, it must be. <br /> <br /> When I wrote my first comment in IMDb, it was very bad.
