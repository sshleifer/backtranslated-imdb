Do you want people to "telegram their intentions?" Have you ever heard that? Well in this movie, the characters' actions are more than the future of the telegraph - they are drunk at your home and you show at the buffet about the head. If the setting is used well, or it may be forgiven if the characters are more attractive or aggressive. <br /> <br /> Embath David's character is not just a mysterious, and just tells Kenneth Branagh that he probably wrote his role. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Clear plot, one-note performances, unused characters and strange "southern" voices by British actors.
