I was very dissatisfied with this move. Everything is terrible from the beginning. Comedy is unusual, action overdone, songs are incompatible. Also the storyline is weightless. I have high expectations from the writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom. Actors worked very hard and did not help the movie. However, Kareena rocked a bikini on the screen but for two seconds. I think Hindu stunt directors should investigate how to do action studio films. They exaggerate the way too much. In Chinese films, this style works because of their signature piece. But Hindi cinema signature songs. A good action movie should not be more than two hours and should not be seen unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure these action movies will get very sharp. Note: If the humor and action films are not done correctly, mix up. Good luck next time.
