When the series begins to tell how it begins, I can say that the pilot is less than I thought. Yet this series is still possible. In fact I saw Voyager, and I thought it was capable - but was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pilot has good ideas and good ones. Themes. I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the show with the progress of the search and the appropriate background song are interesting. <br /> When it fell me down, this story would not have "feel" over a great grand adventure. The episode's theme is "simple" trek story with subplot and subtext, with elements of "exploration" and "the first step towards the place". If you modify the instructions to be the first deep space mission, then it will distinguish between the ages of enterprise, TOS or TNG. <br /> <br /> The plot, which started the first mission, was sufficiently grand without "action". Instead of referring to the freshness of the novelty of search, they may be the story. Get a little nostalgic and philosophical about it (Oh, for a TV show that once again makes us think). Let us feel the excitement of "air" and instead of being a rescue and branching of gunplay make us "sea" instead of attention. <br /> We feel that humans are "new" in a foundation school. New kids in the block are opposed to entering the most unknown universe. Unfortunately, Clungsons went to our home instead of us. The meeting was very historic and more social. How to interact with two different groups? <br /> <br /> "I wanted to look fresh and fresh, this series promised a new idea But so far I have not seen this new, great feeling. <br /> <br /> When I reiterate the sentiment that has the likelihood of this series, I will end up with some interesting characters: Bakula is fantastic. The whole background is the most interesting thing to look at Kirk in the maze.The future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we have a program to create new epic. <br /> <br /> You will shoot an arrow into the air ... Good Luck Captain Archer. <br /> For producers: Getting more Risk, US * Think !:-)
