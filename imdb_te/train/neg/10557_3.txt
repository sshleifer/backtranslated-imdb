It's a terrible little product, appropriate to give a nightmares as well as headaches. This is a bizarre blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's unrealistic, but a fun, lucky trip can hopefully hope someone. It's cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy type is weird. There is no reason to see this film. After all, Disney has done excellent work with the same source material. And the Kosgrove-Hall stop-motion made it very attractive. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, it is a French product. As such, the French does not have a horrific feeling that re-stereotype reacts.
