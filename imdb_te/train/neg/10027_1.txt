Action Sunny Bhai is in the Gadar. Akshay Kumar has the Super Powers of Leonidas in 300, along with Neo Spiderman and Superman in the Matrix. It's so happy. Except Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I can not see anything positively in this film. The story looks like the author can write and tell his 10yr old son. The film is very unreal and Anil Coopers shooting with a long shotgun is very bad. Tashan is not excluding the film except Tasan's directors. I worry that I will waste my money in this film and I do not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 I can give it on IMDb or I will give you zero.
