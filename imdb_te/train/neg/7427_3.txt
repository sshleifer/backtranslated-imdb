A friend told me "12 Amazing Skipjies / Horror Movies!" I'm a little bit cautious when giving the box set. But, as the item is a gift, I really do not pay my general feeling of truth. After all .... movies for free! So if they have a small cord. After many ideas, Anne was the first in the overseas films. Ironically, this was the first choice because it looked better of the bunch. <br /> I mean, I think what is best among them, what else are they? <br /> <br /> On the surface, there are some good things to do. Four (Count 'em!) Those actors I know. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Skaggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conway. I have said ... "Billy and Tracy are some good scenes (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) so that they can not sign up for a turkey, Max is a famous soap actor ... but most actor is not an actor ... A jeh .... well ... he made movies and TV very good and bad. <br /> <br /> When I discovered that Jeff decided to add "Ugly" to his movies' concerts Hours. <br /> The first scene is the first clue. Jeff finally finds his way out of happiness with a scene of "I am mad" before he kills himself. Really fun guest performance. Unfortunately this is not the most exaggerated, highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> Along with it, we are commander of the mission (Williams) sent to see what happens to Jeff and his staff. Criminal element. But this assortment is not a very dirty dozen - like an untruthful form. Plus, one computer hacker, one of the crims, is shown working on a laptop computer in his cell. Is not it a bit as a murderer running a gun shop in Slammer? Pretty lame jail, if you ask me. <br /> The effects are really terrible when they finally get taken. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. At the age of 8 some space ships dropped out at noon. While Jeff's vessel was in an invisible location, the criminals rewarded their good behavior, and they endured their male fantasies on weekends giving realistic realism. All the better and the better, and the use of scenes from their fantasies will begin to appear "foreign menace" works for a contact. But did they get it too late? Foreign intruder? <br /> Finally, they only make the G-Sector and the alien's presence, and fight for each other for their love until only the good old Max remains. In the end, really positive garbage image in the vein, hints at a sequel - if! I will also make a look on this film as a character I will be nicknamed "Sweatdroid". He needs to be an android, but in fact he has lost this fact on the creator he has made, giving him any sympathetic qualities. <br /> <br /> If Williams and Saggins, to be honest, do so little in the film. They only need to stay awake, work alone. And, as mentioned earlier, Jeff Rain gets a prior journey, and therefore, his dams are not allowed to come to light. Max makes his best effort as a pair of other cast members, but the film is just worse, just to be honest. <br /> <br /> The film is one and only half-way imaginative conveying convention. They all named musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is fun and enthusiastic. <br /> Made in 1992, I watched, one of those 80-minute video in the initial view. <br /> They seem to have made worst films in 90 years, it seems. <br /> This is fine. A film with a beer en chips is also a stinger, but at least you can come forward, I think.
