I'm a great fan of Batman comics and I'm no longer disappointed when I'm not finding Batman: the animated series on The TV no longer. I'm excited to see that I'm going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I saw the first episode of the episode and I was very disappointed. <br /> First, the animation is very weak. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. Then again, this is about every modern cartoon. <br /> <br /> The design of the character is even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, appearing as Catwoman Chihuahuo, a red version of Bonn Hulk, Penguin a Kung-Fu Master, Mr. Freeze with a snowball on his head, and Ridler Gothic Marilyn Manson Look-Alike (which is fun , Because I hope because the complications and the puzzles are tidy). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is the Joker's. They changed him to a monkey / denderm Bob Marley / Kung-fu battle! Joker is considered to be Batman's most popular enemy, but he does not have a threat when his crimes are very nonsense and nonsense. His plan in an episode is to put his joker poison in dog food! Oh, how bad! Because Batman is a lovely and complicated character, because he haunted his parents' deaths, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman is haunted by his parents' deaths and is not interesting. He is not a detective, just a fighter. If he is an enemy he can not defeat, he will not study the enemy to find their weak points like the detective, he'll build a huge fighting robot to defeat them. <br /> <br /> The show does not feel too many times in the Batman show, it is not another intellectual disgrace, it is not understood. <br /> <br /> I hate most people about the show. What did they do to the villains? They make them preferred and relatively and are taken away from everything that has turned them into the stereotypical evil bad guys. Man bat is the biggest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist studying bats to find a remedy for his deafness. While experiencing himself, he accidentally becomes a big bath. In this program, he was a mad scientist, he deliberately converted himself into a big bot creature without any obvious reason. Just like all villains like that; None of these, except one or two, is a real purpose for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The deadly feature of Mr. Freeze. In comics, Freeze is a fantastic mad scientist and intellectual writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode "Heart of Eyes", which freeze gave him a new origin, making him a more tragic, three-dimensional and favorite villain. This fan became very popular, the fans accepted it as his original source and used it in comics as his origin. The bad movie Batman & Robin was used as his source. In this program, he was a small jewelry thief before Mr. Freeze became. After Mr. Freeze, what do you think? He also spends a small jewelry thief! Great source. <br /> <br /> As Batman fans, I did not like this show since I was not a comics because I also liked BTAS and Batman cartoons, then came to Tim Burton's Batman films, and, obviously, the wonderful Christopher Nolan Batman films. None of them is 100% credible to Comics, but they are still very good. The problem with this presentation is not exactly comics or BTAS, it is not any depth that is most popular for other Batman media. <br /> <br /> I gave this presentation a lot of opportunities, but if I look at what I see, I'm more discouraged. When I am happy with all the Batman cartoons, I will lose the good old days.
