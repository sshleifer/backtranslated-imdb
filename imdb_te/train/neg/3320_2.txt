<br /> <br /> When I first started looking at the film, I was honestly slightly more predictable, but this has become one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> First, the pace is very slow, it has a lot more time (and it's not small). I'm sure when Jen Austen wrote this book, she has made several pages long, filled with an explanation and is not intended to be read by people one day, or "Emma" is pretty sure that it could drag and lose appeal. <br /> <br /> "Sense and Sensibility" has a slow flaw, but at least it has cheerful lines to make it, as well as some good performances! <br /> It acting on course, which brings me to the error # 2. I do not think they can do good things, but I do not see much of it in the film, even if I do not work for the participants of this film. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to be British (well, some of them), trying to make it difficult for "upper class" so they are all like a group of actors and people like <br /> , Only actors, in fact not like the people they were playing. Perhaps it's a good thing because people who are acting can not really be that good. Why is everyone like Emma like an example? Sure, she is rich, beautiful people in front of them, but she is an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were "ugly", she did not even feel sorry for her back. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people tell stories, "just for her laughter?" The snab of course could not do that too. <br /> <br /> I had problems with Gwyneth Paltrow with Gwynath Paltrow, and her "Emma" definitely did not change my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's easy to find out that I did not take care of this. I'm a lovely book and I'm all perfect, but some books can not really make for a big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
