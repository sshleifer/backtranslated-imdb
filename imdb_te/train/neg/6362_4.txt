I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I'm not hesitant to list the beautiful Barbour Bouchet in my favorite actors from time to time, so I have hopes for the film. However, it will soon be revealed that it does not go anywhere. Apparently no one will go into expecting this too, but this also gets more annoying when you even feel dull and the characters are noisy interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; In this case a steal, women and stealing stuff. This is basically all the plot of the movie. The film has a real 'seventy style' and it is very reckless. Directors like Borro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson seem to be trying to put on some sort of point, although that point does not come well. It is always fun to see Barbara Bouchet on the screen, and it's here; She is definitely the best thing about the film and the best part of the film is in order to hang in her naked car. Overall, there is some appeal to people who love the Rogue seventh style, but unfortunately it does not.
