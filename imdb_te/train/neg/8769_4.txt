This was the picture I thought I could refer to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to complete the movie, I could not see the closure. The original war is not that long lasting. Others try to question my patriotism by criticizing a film like this. But flat out, you can not go from watching private Ryan to LOC. Forget about movie budget difference or audiences - do not interrupt a director without making a brilliant image. The length of the film is not very bad and it is a recurring fact - they attack the same hill and give different names. I think LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. Character development scenes (before portraits of the past, before being reopened to their last moments) must be throughout the film and not hit in a long memory. To this day, I have not seen the end yet. But the boundary is a much better picture (not quite telling).
