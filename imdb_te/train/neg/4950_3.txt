I can sum up this presentation as well as anything. Batman TAS may be the worst ever for cartoons based on comic books, because everything that comes later will be compared to it and nothing is yet available. It's very damn good. Is Batman "Yes, but it's not TAS." Is Justice League Good? <br /> <br /> Batman is certainly not TAS, but I can not hold it. It is unfair and there are a lot of other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of a young, less experienced Batman fighting crime is good, and sometimes art is very good. But the rest of the art is artistic, and it's a lot of the show's errors. It is penned, written, and created as an American time. If I want to see Jackie Chan Adventures, I'll see Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could bang my head at any time and get the same effect. Joker is a homicide, mental staggering clown in a suit that uses his humor, unpredictable, and ingenious gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight the hand, he gets cheaper or completely disappears. He is not a monkey with a known bunch of kung fu and can be twenty feet in the air with speed speeds. If they wanted to do so with a villain, there were other less important characters they used or * gap *, they were created entirely new. And again the assumptions are not bad stuff, I'm not wrong. TAS (where I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard ice gun-grabbed B villain and made him a memorable and ethically complex character. Course freeze is certainly not a classic villain at the moment and they have performed an update, but the point is. Batman takes you everything you like about Batman comics and loved ones and takes them a big, smelly dump. What to guess? They were eating maize. <br /> <br /> This demonstration will not stand against TAS but will not stand on its own feet and it still does not work for me. The plot is not good and they are not good. They have written for a child of less than twelve. Can kids enjoy the show? Of course they should. This should not be an adult performance with swearing, nudity, and inappropriate violence. But the really good program's icon can be enjoyed at different levels of all ages. This show misses that mark. <br /> Do you want to show it as TAS? No, of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
