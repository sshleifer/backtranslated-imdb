This Italian film from the '70s is not even classed with the terrific American werewolves in the Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or Paris ... but it is very fun to watch. I'm the main actress, a wonderful blonde, talking about the execution of passion in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, full nudity ... It's obvious that she is a real blonde ... Humma Humma Hamma !! The story is an owl, the SFX is a kid and acting (for the most part) sticks. The only ransom value of this film is all of nudity & sex scenes (and there is a lot). TEM by HBO Standards, but it's still fun when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. Okay ... here's no spare ... except for the previous scene of the heroine (before). The girl just imagines that she is a wolf ... In other words, Clinical Lycondrotop.
