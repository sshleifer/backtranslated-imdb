I do not like this movie too. If you read the Puzo books or at least two first films (especially the first), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> The script of the film is sometimes ridiculous, even by the Pulo novel with the Corleone Saga. Characters and relationships are distorted. <br /> <br /> In the 90s, you can understand different times for Curlyon's saga, and we will not gonna find previous things. On the other hand, I do not know why they should copy copies of some dialogues from other movies. Why is this <br /> It looks like the poor sequels that attempt to copy the properties of the original image. <br /> <br /> This is not what Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have been incorporating in this regard. He is almost forgiven in the movie until a man who has directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather. So al Pacino, for being an actor. But Mario Puzo does not write this. How come He damaged his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo novel "The Last Dawn" is a 90th story about the mob. We never know about the plot for Godfather III.
