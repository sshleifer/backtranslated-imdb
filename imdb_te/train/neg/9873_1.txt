<br /> I saw my mother. We did not get it. I might have been wrong with this, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. That movie is terrible! Those who love a good suspense film are not the film. Bad suspense film! * Moving in the movie can not see it again. And I'm also a big fan of lifetime movies. They try to make movies outta books. <br /> And wit two but-ugly and yet, she loves him more than hug, she sees a little bit. <br /> My rating: 1/10
