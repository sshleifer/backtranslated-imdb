I did not have a very excellent rating in IMDb, but I went to see anyway, because I was a big fan of biblical related material. The first thing that hurt me is that Indiana Jones vanabebe film Casper van Dean did not see the pictures of Jones (but he must). I believe he tried his best, but the script was just washed away. Music has also been a great Jones style. Great work, but for such a movie it seemed to be a great job, no need for great music like the video episode. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script brought down everything. "Jokes" old school, somewhere 20 years old; They brought only the hateful smile with my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks at home and unrealistic. Kevin vanhook has a good idea on this story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but in the end things did not work properly. Maybe it's still fresh on his head to put on a paper. In the first minute I saw that I was not one of the low budget films of that film, but I wanted to hear at least a good story, but sometimes I thought the films were disappointing.
