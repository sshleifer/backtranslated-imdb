This program is really overrated. The detective, such as Danny Pino's hot-head character, was transferred to "rubber gun squad" years ago. The whole team is made up of 2007 by the standards set by Zonmion's Egomonics, which determine decades of decades back. Each Vietnam veteran became a killer, unless they were another Vietnam veteran. Only a black murderer is present and he is kept by his white boss. Only a Hispanic killer is a "street traitor" who killed another homemaker of a Hispanic street boy. A group of campaigns. Hey, screenwriters: Minorities and poor people are also murdered. <br /> <br /> The arrests of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s were joking for 50-60 years of crimes. The real-life DA murder will push for one because they mean that the state will eventually be difficult with their humongous medical bills until the kick. Their families and insurance companies are in favor of the state. The prosecutor appeals them to the involuntary manslaughter and they do not serve one day. The only oldest offenders to go to jail, criminal offense statistics or former Nazis, who increase the profile of high profile DAs.
