"Sleepwalkers" is the first film written by Stephen King. This theme, and the fantastic Santo & Jonny song they used as a background story, you can imagine the odd, ultimately the viewing experience. Unfortunately, you do not have to. The thing is, they probably have done a good picture of it. Initially it was witty about the small town horror atmosphere. But something strange is happening in the film about 20 minutes. The picture turns funny for the obvious reason! The whole atmosphere of "sleepwalkers" is disturbed from that moment.It's looking at you, who's good old Johnny "COP KABOB! After that he's got a pencil in the ear of the cop? But do not make me wrong, there's no redimetric quality, humor I have for the first time I first saw it wrong, the plot is real, but I'm right. I can not believe that Santo & Johnny has got the rights to the songs.
