Flock is not really cinematic. It is wannabe film, with wannabe actors. He has done a brilliant performance, including Richard Gere, but one of the actors really gives his character and the other cast is just acting ... as a result of this movie is curious. You thought of acting, hiding the fact that you're acting. What are Claire Dines doing? She is the most inappropriate actress for this role. She is rarely seen in 99.9% of the film, everything comes out !! The only stupid question she is doing is "Do you really like that?", And do crazy faces. I was so annoyed by her performance and I liked her ... she was a romantic movie, where I did not know what all actresses chose her ... LOL, and Avril Lavigne! This really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up, this movie will work for you! I want to vote -5.
