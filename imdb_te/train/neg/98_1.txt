I received this movie as a gift, I know from the DVD cover, the film is bad. I have seen it for more than a year without seeing it. <br /> I'm not finished watching this bad movie, but it's unfair to write a review without looking at the whole movie. Trust me when I said "this movie sucks", but I did not spend more than $ 20,000 to build this movie, although it was a bad bad movie producer. All you need are a low camcorder or a cell phone camera .No acting skills are about 15 people, a script written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> The ultra evil move is a reporter (Tara Woodley) who wants to be a man who is in his way to report on the hunter town. He is completely safe. They wanted to leave the house, but fortunately it was almost a full bottle of liquor and a bottle of alcohol on the doorstep. <br /> <br /> Then the drunkard man began to tell the tales of ghost / zombies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Ben Dreper is one of his soldiers full of fatigue (I feel what I will do) Sitting in a poor soldier's private Wilson, he turns to a grave, a soldier's fall, and Ben Draper, killing him in a shallow grave. <br /> But sargent. Ben draper n are for the big surprise. His wife / girl fiend knows about this and kills her and her boyfriend Sargent. Ben Wilson decided to take revenge on Private Wilson. The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of a zombie and kills them to take revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like B Horror movies, do not watch this movie
