The desperate "period" film for a widespread and graphic depiction of the funniest "The Beast" is only a narrow need, a monster who thinks every woman is a century of rape. He's pretty much what, and the depiction of the beast's picture is really really awful; It's a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard a long man in a fur suit that squirts large volumes of white liquid in large amounts. For fake animal porn fans, I probably expected this to turn on true turn. But I made fun of by the early performances of horses who had sex in the open square.
