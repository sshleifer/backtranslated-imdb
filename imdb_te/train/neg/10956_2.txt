I purchased the movie from the movie bin gemstop discount used and the envelope made me laugh, so I bought for 99cents. The image is also retarded and they use ten different monkeys throughout the entire film that they rarely appear. <br /> <br /> The director is more likely to be a murder-suicide director than chimpanzees after the film. Some other low-cost Warner Bros. ended up with a preview of the movie and making money for the studio. <br /> <br /> He did not help him even for the terrible job he had done, and he was not even sure to produce a pope-film. <br /> When did this movie take place?
