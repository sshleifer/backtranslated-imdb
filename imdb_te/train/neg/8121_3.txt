Time is valuable. This is not a movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to learn that critics should ignore the arrival of small films like Fergus. This is full time waste. <br /> <br /> Theater is packed and everyone is left with the same response: Are these critics recollecting this film? <br /> <br /> The hook of the film, the upcoming mobile black daughter, finds her white trash family. <br /> This work is amazing. <br /> The product (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is more than 60 minutes and 2 feet. The characters are shallow and unwise. I was insulted by the fact that these people who were clearly visible to the audience could not recognize one another. <br /> <br /> Aside from the audience, the movie will be circling the screen.
