T.Z. Post, college professor, receives a false letter saying he inherits $ 750,000. Now as a financial way, he withdraws his life savings from $ 4,000, and finally decides to go out and live. After sending his luggage back to Chicago, he meets the band of Wyuteville, and takes decisive determination to keep a show on Broadway. The night of performance, poor professor. The post lenders have to hide from, solve the problems between the relationship between the love pansy and the younger brother Diva Ennore and make sure that the show will continue. After seeing Keaton's silent gemstones, it would have sat one, but I thought, it could be very bad. Supporting actors such as Durante, Todd, & Selvine are often very worried, but still preferred. Charlie Chan Toller is an early film director. 90% of the script is written incorrectly because MGM is doing this kind of effortlessly like the Marks Bros movie. It was a sad moment in Buster's life, composed of Keaton's drinking problems at the time. Rating - 3.
