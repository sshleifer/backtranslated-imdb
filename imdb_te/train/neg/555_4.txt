The film is very confusing and funnier. The plot is terrifying ... but the plus side acting is pretty good, with some good chatter and slopes. Sharon stone this time is okay ... you're not half as good as the original Secret. These murders are not the first to be a nail, it is an insult. Its unexpected mess is saying everyone is it though. There is a beautiful graphic at sexual times, while others are clear that it is fake (they are totally dressed). Script time is very weak, but there are scenes highlights with banter and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn. The plot may turn out a few times, but the end is terrible. Tension is always with the big dolls of Oh My God. Chase sequences were brilliantly directed, and the shots and camera angles were impressive and carried a bit into class, otherwise the rush-thinking film. Sharon Stone is also a bit old for this. The bits we see on her breasts, the first, delights. At this time, they're so terrible to explain. The average of its self-images is very low, but it is valuable. Some are mainly eligible for good buzz ... because the early sequence is highlighted. Not complicated, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Do not ruin the run. You will be happy to leave this stone.
