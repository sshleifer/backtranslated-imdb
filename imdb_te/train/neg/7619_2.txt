As a mystery science theater 3000 fan, my film can drop on me, but there is no reason for this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a baby, <br /> <br /> Robert Napton, Robert Napton, The Rare "Forbidden Strategy"! It's shameful for you to exploit these poor Mexican actors who have given you the assumption that it will make big in American cinema. <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this film. Did you use a snack on these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in a field! Like 6 of them. And is not that an Asian guy in the background? Why always on the daytime? <br /> Let's see why this film should be shown 1/2. And more importantly, we have seen more than 1/2. <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
