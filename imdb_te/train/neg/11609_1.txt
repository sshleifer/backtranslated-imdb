I'm not from America and I know that I'm a 'wiff swap'. When the program came out of the program, I was amazed to see some amazing glamor sex events in the show. But I've got a real sucking stupidity. I did not mislead its title, did not have a large number of things, no nudity, not even obscene conversations (I think the hallmark was thrown out of the channel and they would be edited / muted to make them better). <br /> <br /> The image of the current American / Western Family state, a program of overweight chubby people, polluted teenagers, and their suckling family tasks. In each episode two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were selected to live in each other's home and reverse each other family routines with their new own rules. Sometimes it becomes good or even bad. In the final section every mother is brought back with her husband and tries to tell what they did to all the past families. It is part of the sucking piece of the program that every contestant fights for their rights. I sucked some cool adult sex stuff instead of all of this. I understand who made this program, more than "wiff swap" name; It's good to be called "mother swap". All in all true Wife corrupts all great things for swap! <br /> Wife Swap = Average Sleeping Reality Show.
