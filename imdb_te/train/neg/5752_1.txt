I usually do not comment, but there are things to say. Where to start? <br /> Jeremy acting in London, terrible! I did not think he was too bad. The plot is good, which is well directed by the lead actor with good performances. Unfortunately, this is one of the movies you've read, which has great potential to be fun, but disappointing from the start. <br /> Well, I was at least laughing. I will not waste my time if you are.
