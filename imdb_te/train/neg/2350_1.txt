This presentation is laughably bad. The writing sucks, the dialogue sucks. Craig's person can not get out of paper. It's Thursday night, it's definitely great to see some beers. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, and everything for my entertainment. <br /> This is a play / unexpected comedy. I do not care about any of the characters, they are all boring and stupid. Since the victim was unable to reveal, the first five parts were worse, writing the dialogue around it was terrible. I mean, it's ridiculous in the cemetery. In fact, all the scenes currently happening are completely terrible. <br /> So review. Everything that's happening in the present time sucks. Flashback scenes, writing, dialogue and craig's acting only sucks. Music is ruled though.
