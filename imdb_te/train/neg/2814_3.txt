8/26/2001 - 3 in 10 (Dir-Tob Hooper): The horrific and cruelty of the cousin of Marc√©e de Sade (which makes sense) led to torture and made it his ancestor. This Toby Hooper is not really different from playing the same role (Freddy himself - Robert England) in his style Freddy Kruger films, as the role of the dual character (Marquis de Sade and his cousin). But even then it finally loses my anger but that leaves a staggering feel to the film as it really wants to hurt at Christianity. Incredible sexual abuse and violence were a lot worse, but despite some unpleasant scenes they tried to keep it low. My final idea is why Hooper wants to make this film. In fact, it took a little bit to distribute, then it had to be promoted and could earn some money on his name and his nose with the name of Hopper. This is clearly not done.
