<br /> <br /> This story is nothing new - but this is a cartoon, so does it matter how beautiful and fun it is? <br /> I'm not going to go deep like the characters, or I'll be here all day (except to say there is nothing; the characters change personality when it's convenient for the plot), but whoever writes the script and visual direction is more accessible than pencil and paper is prohibited. Bad? <br /> <br /> "When an object / break is narrowed, cut the character close-up, the character gives a sense, the audience can not even understand the distances. <br /> <br />" Large lumps of rock Crashing around each other, usually destructive, and it kills them at any time - but they appear to be in danger, Nearly see the cattle 'green stone in the distance and stop them from scratching. <br /> <br /> This is the Plan 9 of CG cartoons, except that it is not the End Wood Gripe Factor, it's fun watching Your Cartoon Budget on Pixar Movies.
