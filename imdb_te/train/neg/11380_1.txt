I first saw the robotboy, I was fresh and curious, but I saw that with each episode, the show would make you feel good / evil. Episodes are predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see their big brother, hyper smart boy, who does not understand their kid parents, and his friends: girl and fat boy. There is no logic in this show. A super-modern robot working on two AA-sized batteries, and many weapons can be used. But the big problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots and reduce the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot should learn how to behave in human society"
