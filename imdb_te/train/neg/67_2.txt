From the beginning, the political background of the film is clearly and heavily handed, the result is completely imaginable. What better textbook on writing screenplays combines the layers of characters, character mats, and three reactions. No one will find you in this movie. The police were bad guys, and consequently shown to be unpleasant, ineffective and cowardly. It seemed that the filmmakers were well-respected citizens of the police, as well as being a good cop for the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> There is no chance for the viewer whether or not Ned Kelly is a good guy or a cruel villain. The film opens when he is arrested by a horse stealing, but we have no evidence of his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the gates of the gate, but after a few years most of the conversation he knows is only three years he heard. <br /> <br /> The camera with the sharp expression of many nodes of this ned. I found a real shortage to watch the movie. It is directed to modern films, and keep me off watching this one.
