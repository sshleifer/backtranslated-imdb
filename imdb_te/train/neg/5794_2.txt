All Germans are in the open and drown with a machine gun. Good boys die, except for dramatic purposes. The "plots" are very ridiculous in its holes. (Eric Estrada? Please!) And when the whole idea was hijacking the train, where did Germany's troops have fuel tank? How sore it is! You know the Germans you are going to be, you can not leave the track! No waste. I hit the ball with a pen hammer on the head. Then sit again 10 times. I mean, seriously, Felt as it's made in 60's, but it's produced in 88! 1988 !! A-Team is more believable than this terrible need for a film. If you'd like to smile better see it. The film is John Wayne's Green Beret to Television Seville.
