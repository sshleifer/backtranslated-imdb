Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved in such a trash? The "first blood" may be rated as bull *** t but this kind of nonsense is only with Ratbot and toting. If you're interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman is part of the Navi cells) one of the most stupid cliche you think is the great movie "GI Jane". Performance from Viggo Mortensen is a bearable but hell of the film, not being Demi Mor Rambo (notably last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott did not qualify for credits to women with equal rights to this film, which was just a foolish campaign for the American army and abandoned Moore to become more attractive. Horror movie.
