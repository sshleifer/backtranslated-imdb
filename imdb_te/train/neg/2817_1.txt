Tobey Hooper is the biggest offering of horror style. Like other horror fans, I love Texas Chainsaw, but to keep your name on the cinematic name, you need to be at least a hit film. I can not really think of Hooper (which does not count the poltergeist on his own), which really has an impact on the Hooper genre or film world. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert England, I give him credit for at least a good job with the awful material I've given. What can he do? Is this movie related? Pure Dudez. Unnecessary naked scenes are every five minutes, one of our heroes, and a really awful scene, a story written in music and cinematography. Nothing in this film is redeemable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 10 out of 1. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems like it's ended before it really started. I hope he can pump out at least a good movie, so he can do some justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
