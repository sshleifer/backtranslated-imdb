I will admit that I did not complete this film because I was wonderfully stupid and not looking worth. I watched with a room full of kids, who did not laugh at nonsense and dirty humor. The director, Bob Dolman, was very much involved with the spinsters and genitals that surpassed the true story I grew up with. This is not a good movie for kids! In addition to the fact that the content is too much, the film has only a stupid bad stream and no intelligence behind it. The waste of a perfectly good story. If you read only when you were younger, do not waste your time watching movies, it's so bad that it becomes angry with you. Buy your children's book instead.
