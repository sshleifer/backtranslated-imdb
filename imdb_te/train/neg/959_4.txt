If I did not exclude this film, I gave it from 10 to 1. Claudine Barretto performance. And I take this time to oversee Chris Aquino's here. <br /> <br /> I have really escaped watching some Pinay Horror films because stories do not have originality, and I (some) writers do not pay enough attention (and their progress) stories (unnecessary ??). When they drew their heroine, the film is like 'forward'. And my goodness, creative fatigues and other movies to pull off. Why ?? Why did this film get a good review? I am very merit. The film is scary, but when it comes to dealing with the Philippines folklore, the film is quite simple ... it goes to the 'most happening' section of my list. I spent a lot of time improving the stories and wanted to fix those flashback sequences, while absorbing lighting, your content would not be too far away.
