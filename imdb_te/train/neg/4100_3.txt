A bit of a frustrating image, I say: Acting is stilted, something. In many cases, I do not think the faces of the spoken words or scene of the confrontation were intended. The angry (or sad, happy, depressed) character believes that the viewer is angry (or sad, happy, disappointed). <br /> Not here. <br /> You already know the comment about the authors. They do things and say things that have not come out: Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; Then he storms and storms out, telling his father "Do not touch me, you're f ***!". Perhaps, if we see the prequel, we can understand where it comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat in the ocean because of the reason! <br /> <br /> An odd, quirky thing made by Andrew will go to the old stone quarry and sit on the edge while looking at the "still water" below; He then reaches his jeans pocket and cakes a pack of cigarettes and lights. He did the same thing in the film three times; Would we like to see it as some torture alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is a fact that recently learned that he has received; The opening of the film begins because of this discovery he does not have any dramatic shift. <br /> <br /> Although I guess I feel a sort of linchinese cinema, the director of the first time really needs to calculate such levels. Is he a mountain in advance of his career?
