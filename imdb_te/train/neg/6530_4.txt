** Possible spoilers before ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr will lead the film to a busy film actor Mars during Forty Years and Fortis. Before we come to the Red Planet we will be entertained with a romantic potter between Mahr and scientist Norah Hayden; Resident Dupes Jack Kruschchen; And Les Tremane's vision as another scientist with the Billy-Goalk chin. Martin exteriors have duplicate backgrounds and tintes from red to pink - "cinemac" propaganda in advertising. Real cool monsters are a large amoeba, a three-eyes creature, a huge Venus fly-trap and unforgettable rat / bat / spider. With the influence of hypnotic drugs, the whole bizarre adventure survived by Hayden. The Agrod RED PLANET report has been followed very much, and it probably picked up most of its followers in the sixties.
