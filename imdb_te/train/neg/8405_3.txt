Before watching this movie, I do not expect a fictional drama based on ideas in the book. Instead, this book was interrupted by dramatic scenarios that describe different "illnesses". It did not bother me, but it blocked my feelings of cinema. A story or two or three lengths of stories were the best in my opinion from this book's book. If you are going to build a source in the mental verse, you find more interesting (and accurate) text than this one. The film is cheated during a slightly larger film than the 19th century sexual psychology video encyclopedia, and it's totally inconsistent if it's not sexuality (because most of us are "sex = interesting"). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many stories with the original characters that lost our character. <br /> <br /> But, frustrating, the theories of sexuality of Kraft-Ebling have largely failed. <br /> <br /> I hoped that the disadvantages of the ancient consequences of psychology could still be used to show how much still remains today. <br /> Finally, what do you do? Some of the exotic catalogs of facets and trends, some of the less interesting stories are cured after some of the trails and difficulties of "sexual philosophies". For the most part of the film, the film moves with the crawl speed (and mood) of a awakening. And, a clear low-budget film, cinematography and acting is not exactly the top tier. <br /> <br /> I am happy with music, clothing, and interior design. <br /> <br /> I thought the subject of the film was my narrative. It deserves a 3/10; If I feel too generous a 4/10. If someone is not interested in sexual orientation, they can not imagine anyone enjoying it.
