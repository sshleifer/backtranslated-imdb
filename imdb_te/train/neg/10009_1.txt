This image loads a large band. Paul Schruder loses completely on his own bad screenplay. And his direction would be as comatose as it does not have sleepwalking on his show. <br /> <br /> If Woody Harryson is the worst, I usually like when he's properly cast. The frustrated wives of the Washington Elite are the social colleague D.C. He plays as a "Walker", a homosexual. If he was cut from a magazine and kept him in the cap, he bounced on a popcool stick. His "South Slang" is the "Rock" version, from the very beginning he finally releases each line until the end of the line, making South's heat and humidity still losing power of every ounce of his energy. It's unchanged. But it is not his worst voice in the film. His "boyfriend" starring Moritz Blebritou tries to influence some kind of Mid East tone, so he is just blooming the bad lines written for him. In real life he speaks German, and many languages ​​- one of them is Italian! Is it a kind of good reason for casting someone else? <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, to the screenplay, direction, camera work, performances by Leeds, from the beginning to the end. Lily Tomlin, Lauren Baccal, and Kristin Scott Thomas have been working with three supporting actresses in the film. Only these three made their image in their tactic through the film. In fact, despite being trapped in three outstanding bad films, it's great. Unfortunately, no one ever could be good enough to redesign this endless series of errors. If you want these three actresses, you can see them. This image is not worth your time.
