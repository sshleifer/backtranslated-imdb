I recently watched the cable and enjoyed it very much. I am reading the comments here and everyone likes the second half of the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (not too bad.) The second story, I thought. And that's "California Dreaming," if I have heard one more time ... Chungking Express is not something alright, but the main audience is something to catch up to like "catching tiger".
