The John Goodman program is pretty awful, but this is just plain stinks. The only thing I have in this mess is Patrick Starfish as Fascist. This story is silent, and anyone who has erased the memory of the childhood rebellion has never received any adult feeling in the coming years. These characters mature the world of darkness. Not everyone likes, and for no reason. The plot is speculative but the show churches from another unsustainable, unified scene such as late-night are fun in watching it. The worst thing is that no one seems to have seen ice at the crew of the crew!
