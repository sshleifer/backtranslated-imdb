I give ZERO stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give one. <br /> <br /> I can not laugh ... but the game did not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are suffering from some illnesses, go to your local cinema and give this film 10 stars. <br /> But for me ... in a movie the children are shot dead to achieve humor ... good taste goes to edge ... This is the third time I have wasted my time watching a boll movie and this is definitely my last! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of a country like Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Enjoy taking more movies!
