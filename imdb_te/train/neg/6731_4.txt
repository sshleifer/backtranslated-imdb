Contrary to another reviewer, I think it's well written, especially because it's more imaginative, no more imagination is required; And well-played because there are no other characters to share this dozen-minutes-plus, well-finished monologues. But I was not entertained by such majestic, holy sentiments. There is a story telling everyone and some more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more serious than others. These are only ten, not very varied stories and problems, and how life is the animal (or part of it) animal feed. Then again, I also think poorly on TV's reality shows, too. So, if this is your bag, you might like it. This is a kind of good phone and / or internet gossip; But without the full-on-noise action. Even though everyone is speaking, I will leave this gender.
