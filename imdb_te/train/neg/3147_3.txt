I really REALLY happy when the Elephant Walkk is completely dull image and ultimately destroyed by the elephant herd building and the end of this film. Though I questioned the dramatic casting of Dana Andrews as a man in love with Elizabeth Taylor, you might think of the money and the cast and the movie is very good. It's not just age difference, but I can not see the couple in pairs. Perhaps Miss Taylor could have been a substitute for the Vivian league in the last minute (due to the deteriorating mood of the Miss League) - I also found Andrews and the League. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor sessions in England. Their plan is in the tea estate of Finch in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the first seems to be a good life. However, there is no woman to talk and the housemate opposes her. On top of that, returning home, Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable. Neighbor Andrews can see this and he proclaimed his unfathomable love for him. Still, Taylor was not ready to cancel his marriage. But in the finch film, Liz gains a lot of things as an item and in the end she is ready to go ... When she came out of the blue, she broke the cholera plantation. So this is up to Andrews, Finch and Taylor to work together to save the day - though by this point I'm not really chemistry between the characters, the dialogue is pretty dull and you can not understand <br /> <br /> This film is not particularly appealing or convincing And despite a good budget through Paramount, the film is slowly cumbersome. Although the film seems to have been filmed in the movie, I was surprised that many scenes were clearly shot in a studio (and Grine) shot. In a scene, for example, Taylor, Finch and many people sitting on the veranda, the grass is bright green. Then, when the film cuts dancing people in front of them, the grass is brown! It is clear that this scenery does not really have scenery in Ceylon or in the giant reclining Buddha. My advice is to skip this one or at least keep the coffee pot to keep you awake. Despite its budget, it is not a very good or inspired film. <br /> <br /> Does Mr. Taylor's pregnant as part of this film? Some scenes (especially at the start) she wears Billy clothing, double beard and bulging. This is not a criticism - after all, women do not get pregnant! <br /> If you look carefully, I'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Also, in many ways the basic plot is similar to Giant - actually a great Taylor film! It's amazing how casting and a lot of good direction can be done.
