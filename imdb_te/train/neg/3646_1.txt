Oh ... my ... God ... It is without doubt the exact clearestest image I have ever seen. Acting is good, the story is weak, the characters are weak, and the whole picture just does not make sense. The pair has the average direction, really weird scenes (such as being a child undercover), and a completely silent dialogue ("Look!" "Masta his Pants People!"), And you are a complete failure. The fact that Mr. Atlas is only found to be losing is not the case, the case of chocolate bars. But this is part of the film's appeal. Sit down and look for some of your friends for good laughs. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie because it's great!
