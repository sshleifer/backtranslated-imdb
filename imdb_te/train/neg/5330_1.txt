Some commented here that the film was made by Walt Elvis. Well, they are only partially right. For me, it's real, and this film has been built forever! I have never been crude, and insulting, and disgusting, and never seen it against the human nature of this film. The real impatience of the motion picture industry is not bad, it's good. There is no campy trout fun to be like other bad movies like some of Elvis's. This is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure Garbage. Native Americans must claim suit for their poor clich√© and stereotypical treatment. Actually, perhaps all human beings should be seriously treated as a whole 0 stars for the crime and disorder. Grade: F
