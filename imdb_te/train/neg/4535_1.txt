Slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three zealous words that explain the book's film. This film is definitely a place where the book never cost you. The best part of the film is the scenery, the spectacle. The slow motion of the actors combined with endless meaningful glances is the worst part. Editing is sudden and haphazard. However, despite this, the actors have struggled to try to be slightly believable with at least one terrible script. Despite being set in Peru, even though Peruvian descendent in Peru, flashback scenes describing Peru in the 17th century are rare. If you have any sense in history, try to avoid this image.
