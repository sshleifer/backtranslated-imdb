This is the most deadly sequel in the world of films. It does not make it again. The killer still kills fun. But this time he is killing people doing the film about what happened in the first film. This means that it is a stupid image forever. <br /> Do not see it. If you look at a valuable bell in the picture, you can not see it. You asked the director and the person to make you. It's not just a combination of the original horror, action, and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not let your children see this. For teenagers, young children or adolescents, the film will have a similar effect on people.
