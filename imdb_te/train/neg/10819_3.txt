I agree with good writers and good actors about good story but do not match, I also moved. This is 24 years since I read the book because it is in school. But since I left the bin, I thought it was necessary to know the story of Jane Eyre, so it would not be absolutely meaningless. Jane & amp; Mr. Rochester rarely speak & suddenly he is proposing marriage !!! The actors do not have time to tell the audience how they feel about each thing in the story. Actors are good but this story does not give enough time to do justice. I'm sorry, but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott is with Jane Eyre of my preference, but you can find the 1983 BBC Mini Series version with Timothy Dalton & Jayla Clarke. I see it very time. It has an abridged version for the full version for 225mins or 330mins.
