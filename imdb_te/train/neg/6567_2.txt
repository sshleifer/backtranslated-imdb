I hoped for the film better. I usually like wartime music. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball made good jobs with their characters; However, the authors gave them a boring dialog. The love-interest between them does not provide real growth; Suddenly there is. I did not think much of music; The snippet is the best number we heard about Spike Jones with "Der FÃ¼hrer Face". The greatest number of Spike Jones was in his great musical comedy role; Even with monkey, beautiful stuff stuff. Bert Lahr's comedy skits are endless. <br /> <br /> Lucille Ball is very beautiful, and has a good selection of most of the most desirable bit players on screen.
