Unfortunately, the film does not have the sluggish social comment on the real incident, and does not have balls to determine what has happened. Clear message (how we talk about Ben's cocaine as an avid gamer) or how the media and music are influential (how we talk about the burning, subtleties of all their boys!) 'Fiction' only because ID gets away. Good effort. Yes, this is a good idea to reduce the impact of the media, but how do we know the children who do not actually run the school shooting that does not affect medium? Or video games? We do not dont, and we are accustomed to this movie because once these kids have enough smarter to leave the media completely and not enough to hit a nazi icon on the ground? <br /> <br /> With the pictures of the normal situation of families, the kid's mobility, which almost completely disappeared, actually went out and killed their classmates, as if all your family feel that there is no serious error. Why does the killers do not have any connection with each other as they make it "clear"? Absolutely false and fraudulent description.
