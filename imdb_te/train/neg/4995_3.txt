I sat through this film and found the real thing. The sound track is not the best and it's hard to understand that some tones have been saying. There was little less frequent movement to move the plot and the action just stopped and the dialogues for a long time appeared in the movie. These conversations have changed between family groups and the observer has left them to try and cut out the common thread that tied them together. In this case I rarely rated this film, thinking that the whole view was "me" and "I wasted this time why I watched it".
