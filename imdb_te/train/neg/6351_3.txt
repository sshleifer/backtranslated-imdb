<br /> <br /> Despite some good acting - especially Chloe Sevigny, and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half - this is not just an attractive movie. The conflicts between comedy part and tragedy episodes are either awkward or sometimes not clear. The viewer was initially confused by the supporting cast in the two episodes; I think people in the neighborhood of Melinda are the same people, just responding differently ("he said," she said in the premise " But we have two completely different stories and two completely different women, both played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> In the opening sequence, the two playwriters - comedian and tragedy - supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but only two stories are related to ten. They do little to support the topic of discussion, which can be seen almost as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but disappointing.
