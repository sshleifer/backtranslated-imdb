I've seen the first film version of 'The Haunting' in my first ten films at all times. 'I'm shaking with this instrument, it's a shame that the old writing, which is not quite right, is shocked. For a cause I'm not scared of the first child. You do not see anything. Robert Wise's new camera work and scary lighting And that's why it works. It is based on clever special effects and fireworks to get B from A, and the leg still has to do different things (actors like Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones). This film is just a studio thimbus!
