In the 80s I was renting back and honestly I was not able to remember the movie - it's the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not the one "it's too bad, it's funny". This is not one of them, "It's very polite, it goes bad with you". It's not even one "what the heck is that?" Movies. I could not recall the performance of the actors, but it was not properly filmed, the story was confusing, it did not have the exact same style. <br /> <br /> I'm annoyed that I've wasted time. <br /> <br /> I have never seen movies due to unknown cultures, genres and / or stories that some of those films have become clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
