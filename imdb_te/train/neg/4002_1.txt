The social commentary is very extreme and the mystery was built and resolved through incomprehensible inconsistent random horoscopes. In the last decade, Fitz has never changed anything in personal life, which makes it a remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I understand why there is no complaint in Australia in comparison with the possibilities of solving mysteries in England. Did he not insult the Australian police? <br /> <br /> The next episodes of the original series are pretty dramatic and degrading, sometimes being ill-fated, and this is one of those mantle series returns. Sad.
