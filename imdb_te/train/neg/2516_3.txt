Unfortunately I did not forget the book, but I'm reminded that I have attracted Edgar Wallace's stories. The film represents a low quality German production. It does not have my attention - though the story is good, it is badly damaged. The most fraudulent and exaggerated characters in the midst of difficulties - there are no short stories in their performances. The well-known and German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddie R. Nutt also did not save this poor scene. But hopefully ... I said that the films related to this film are better and better. So in the end I say that this film does not deserve the film screen but it might be enough for a lazy afternoon.
