After this movie special school, it's not bad, it's a problem. Nothing happened. If you're in class, you think. A man teaches a group of young underdogs for better paintball players. We do not see these underdogs being bad when training a good player. They all turn to good players by meditation. There are not many characters and character development yet. Most time spent the main character and his sexy sister and some of the other kids was not enough. This may be a 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) because there is a girl in the squad for all boys, but the film does not have any feelings. It has no feeling and it leaves your bones a dull pain after watching it, is not fun to watch, is not fun to watch, and just kind of ... there. Plain. Irritating. You would like to see your pre-evening nap after school. The day is too long and the film is a long way to watch.
