<br /> <br /> Cut to Chase, one of the five worst films ever seen. <br /> They did not try. Some good structures are there with good structure, good cast and some good performances. <br /> <br /> If you have a good time, you can do it yourself, I was with a heroin slave and I did not think it was good, but it was a beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old drug dealer <br /> <br /> And the insane nature of gravity is a turning point, but there is a clinical plot that is an attempt at construction, but the final result is vigilant and endless (unequal time lines). <br /> <br /> It's colorful but it's no ending, I feel bad for quality actors that you do not see adequately. <br /> <br /> Skip it, I'm the director for the first time, I was puzzled by how this and many other really bad ideas actually find someone who gives them money.
