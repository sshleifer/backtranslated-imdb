Only a little liberation by Larry Miller. It seemed like trying to be "Mary about Mary", but I did not like the movie too and fell short of those standards. Paul is a great actor who plays the role, but Selma Blair is caught in the folly of her cruel intentions role. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father appeared to be trying hard to play Randy Quaid from London's vacation films.
