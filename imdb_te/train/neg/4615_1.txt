I may not have the longest look, but I refused to see this second film all the way, and I bought it on the DVD due to its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought the director was a big joke, so I waited for a resolution, something laughs, something to keep my interest, but this decision did not come. However, the writing was ridiculous, as the film-length was cut to a TV series, the film was dragged and confused. <br /> <br /> Once again, eight Oscars have been nominated for the Academy. The second way I refused to see through all the way. The first is the "destroyer". I hope this really gives a hint of how bad it is. 1/10
