"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Flegenhemer, is a real person and his rather nasty life is well documented. The film is intended to describe her life as a fictional character, because the overdrafting events are very strong from reality and chronology. In addition, some versions have replaced other versions of the upper NAV. It is true that he was running Luciano, Lansky, and others. Al. But most of this is going on. The exploded plate scene indicating Louisiana's run of Bo Weinberg in her own home helped her own mother. In addition, there is a scene in which the Dutch is approaching his own mother to pay protection for the Legs Diamond. It does not work. Mrs. Fleganhemer's role does not work. The film does not have to ban Jewish mother for humorous relief. The sluggish representation of the leg's diamond is ridiculous enough. I'm sure the man is moving in his grave. And, by the way, the Dutch personally killed personally, but he was not Rambo or 007. It is irrelevant in which he gloves the beer gloves. I do not know. If I wanted comedy, I could not get it.
