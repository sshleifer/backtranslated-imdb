Yes, this is a pure unbelievable condescending mind. We know that the French often have a distorted thought in America, the views of Puritanism and sex. An American (hoosier) living in France, I have a lot of opportunities to observe this outlook. And some of these preconceived opinions may be true, but this is a factor of the Middle East that is filmed in the film. Because a person who has never had sex before being told in the high school 20 years before his penis is too big? Where in the world can you find A jukebox in a bar that plays vintage blue gross? A town that is less than two hours from Chicago, but a major gas station, no home tees, McDonald's, no children ... A population that knows about each other's intentionally hates a bigger one. At the local cafe have hearts and farms of adult males, but do not harvest, they kill everyone who does not like before and it seems to be away with it, and kill all with all the same emotion? Is the very meaty man who goes from getting cornfields off by the breath of an Illinois wind that help deflower the same 17-year-old farm boy, who is the freed French girl who screws 17-year-old virgin boy of sexual charity? Help! I'm baffled by the absurdity of the film and I'm not very clear how ludicrous it is. See it for A-to-Z primer on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope you did not destroy me!
