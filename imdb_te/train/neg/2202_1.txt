I feel that the others I am seeing with this combo is in danger. The plot holds more holes than I think I've seen in a movie that feels something more than a "b" movie. The performance was very ridiculous, and could not even save the memories of Campus's previous camping victories. Considering that the script does not have enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm totally upset about the black buster prices for this trash. It's made for television is that it helped to remove this evil, and clearly these poor films need to be warned. Avoid any of this movie.
