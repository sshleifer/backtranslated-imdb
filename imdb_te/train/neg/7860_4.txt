Martin Weisz, directed by the great "Rohtenberg", warms up another heat with "Ways Craven" for "The Hills Have Eyes 2". An unbelievable story and a mythical mythical reminiscence of a dog in the past, this will be permanently removed by a more technically remastered remake. A group of national guardsmen (and women) were sent to the desert research areas around the hills filled with mutants. One of the soldiers of the weekend was selected. That's it. There is some hardcore torture and a rational brutal rape scene, but it's a little valuable to get excited about. A typical group of "heroes" clichies and mutants is rare from the original "family" of Crewen, mostly from "Brown Thompson" from "Cobra", from which some species are "Stan Winston" from "Wrong Turn" remains. Most of the action takes place in caves, or "The Descent", and well illustrated by Sam McCardy. Ways and Jonathan Craven's funniest factor is a sympathetic mutter who has surrounded his cave, such as Leather Face in Hooper's original "Chainsaw". Weisz is blamed for this despair, but his best to maintain a suspense and to keep some freshness in contrived situations is because he is not really wrong. A fan, unfortunately.
