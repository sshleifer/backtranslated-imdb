I dropped this doll for four dollars! Why does such poor passion encourage alliance's Atlantis film? But the Canadian newspaper Critic's Twilight was surprised by the good reviews given to the film. An image is similar to our media, as it is Canadian and low budget. <br /> <br /> Now about the film: Acting is lower than the average (actually, except for the main role male character, is great). Image quality is weak, I guess I can expect from a very low budget. The script is absolutely horrendous. An example revolves around one of the main characters, one of her clients revolves around, she can appoint herself to fix and steal bicycles for her gang, whose purpose is to accidentally destroy SUVs. Many of her activities were banned by gang members (I do not know that Vancouver could not buy new ones because this big drug deal from Vancouver). However, the story's location (not revealed until the half of the film) drug dealer tries to make houses more affordable for the Firebomb buildings in the Toronto area. <br /> I need to say more. <br /> <br /> Straight Newspapers to give such bias reviews to the disgrace at the Torfill Film Festival, Globe and Mail and Georgia. <br /> <br /> Just a film can not get special treatment because it's Canadian!
