This film is not very old. <br /> <br /> It is the only effects that I have seen with sopranos and artistic character, acting and directing, but for the first time on DVD, I first saw Przezi's dignity. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching is quite different from the audience 24 years ago, but I say, in the end, I'm just scared. <br /> <br /> Do you want to set yourself up? <br /> <br /> All of the cars have been seen since the 1960s, and in 1973 the World Trade Center towers were clearly visible to many city scenes. <br /> <br /> However, in the mid 1980s, audiences found this picture beautiful and funny. In the mid-eighties, meet the last compounds: you only live.
