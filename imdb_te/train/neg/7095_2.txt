"Diary of Sex Slave" is a curiosity in serious plays about sexual computation. Perhaps a movie marketing scandal, the film goes with a good cast and a good cast. Bottom line, "Dairy ..." We believe that our sexual slave character will have a dancest wife in the world, and the kids do not have a job as if they were nothing better than letting their dreams be on him. Well, this film might be a good drama. At worst, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." and not somewhere in the middle. This is for a dumpster. (D-)
