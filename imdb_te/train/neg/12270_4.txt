This kioshi Kurosawa ghost film is pretty wild and it has at least one jump scare, even if it does not guard me. But in everything, he attempts to identify a suspected serial killer, trying to find a criminal, and finds him guilty of crimes. Then he finds a beautiful Asian lady haunted by the ghost, and why there is no idea (and the viewer does). Since other murders are committed, he becomes more and more confused because he is easily available to the killers, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. The studio is not only stupid, the lady ghost is much more fun than anything, especially like her Wonder Woman, flying across the city. And the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If it was not so bad, I thought it was black comedy. Outside of "Bright Future", this is the worst film directed by Kyoshi Kurosawa.
