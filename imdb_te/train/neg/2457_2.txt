Some people do not like animation. Individually, the animation is amazing when the film is finished. There are a lot of old cartoons I love. My problems with this movie are not animated, but mainly the way it's built. All of the characters just ... well, goofy. And for this film, they should not be. Apparently, everyone in the LOTR has a problem with a problem (for starters.) They have irritated me as much as they like. My two sisters and I am laughing through this movie too. If I see many new people before they see, they will lose. I'm glad to rent this and did not buy it. There are some films that give me a headache. This is one of them. However, this is not the worst film I have seen so far, it's in place. Or down, depending on your attention.
