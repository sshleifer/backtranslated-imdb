I can not say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Previously, I can not say I'm not one of the pioneers that I have ever met. <br /> <br /> Okay, a girl is skating, it's good, wants to go to expensive school, it's impossible and a hockey scholarship. <br /> <br /> She has to secretly hide her skating secrets from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I will play the role of Cotlin. <br /> She did not wake up to save her life, making sounds that sounds just like the creeping ships to get her own way. <br /> <br /> Cotllin is just annoying guy. She's the way she tried to work all the good and useful for the people. <br /> <br /> The two skaters tell her about her dancer and some say about her dancer and she will 'draw the line'. <br /> <br /> We know where she should go and Spencer. <br /> <br /> Overall, I feel like watching a movie like skating, but if you do not care, the main skater is very annoying. It's basically good to kill time.
