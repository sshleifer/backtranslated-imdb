I have read so many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel ... so my expectations have been continually crushed. But they have been crushed more than expected. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason they shifted labor camps in Toulon to a complete shipment. Galley slaves. The scene at the bishop myrials is good. In fact, things are alive until the elimination of phantas, apart from galees. A good woman should not be bad things happen because she does not cut her hair, sell her teeth or make a prostitute. She is worse and runs in the mayor's office and spit on his face. Bamatabois completely eliminated. Because the children who are not married also should not speak, Tholamayes is the dead husband of Faustin. Wheelzez, which can get the cassette for fuzzy before they can deal, they happily reunite, and another change. Then the convent comes, which is pretty difficult to scratch up. Thankfully, this was saved. But after three minutes of accuracy, the film will again hurt the classic novel butchering. <br /> <br /> As Cassett and Valsins pass through the park, Marius will come to a meeting. About prison reform. When he came out fliers to Valjean and Cosette, he told me a line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set. "We are not revolutionaries." I dismissed Victor Hugo in his grave. They are rebels! They want to rebel against fake monarchy where you are in favor of another republic, you are the authors of the mute! It is a historical fact. In 1832, a rebellion against the government <br /> <br /> At the same time, Cassett donated Marius for a donation campaign from his father and meets Ipoh. Except ... no Ipoh. Or at least the book's Ipone. This seems to be working as a secretary working for Ipohan prison reformers (working from Cafe Universal against Cafe Moin). <br /> <br /> The prison makers (the most poor cast lead by Enjolras) decide that giving pamphlets is no longer enough. So they're going to build barricades. I do not know about you, but I never heard about killing streets, building barricades, and reforming the movements of the government forces. About three hundred people (which should not be too much) to attack the National Guard and build a bunch of barricades. Eponine thankfully, dies for Marius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is accurate, Javed's suicide is again hard to understand thanks to his miniature screen time and odd character description. The film ends with looking at the jet jump on the river with Valjean. Valjean Javert never let this drown because this is not correct again. He saved the life of man before, why now can he die? Marrius, his deterioration, and his absence on his death with Marius and Cassett beside him have completely abandoned Valjean's confession. <br /> <br /> Overall, I write a lot of problems. I'm happy Enzolras and Ipoh are at least in this film, they are completely barriers, like the whole obstacle. The removal of Phantine's suffering will prevent us from causing her hurt. That Cosette knows Valjean's past from early messes with a good deal of plot. I did not even see Thederdor, and Mme. Thanaradi has only a few seconds screen time. That's the same with Gawwaw. I'm very fond of Vladimir's Frederic March's commentary, however, it is one of the cinematic features of the film. On the other hand, Charles Laughton seems to have lost his way to his great performance in other films and Javet. The shaking of the lips, the unwanted shouting, and his performance was generally considered very bad. <br /> <br /> Many of the jaws I've seen have not appeared in all of the beginning, but that's essential for that role. <br /> Again, if I read this book it seems that the movie is very good. I do not recommend the book, however, the Holans. I also say that the film will be a good follow up for not releasing the exact French version of the whole year.
