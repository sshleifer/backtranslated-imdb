This is one of the most important films we have seen over the last few months, with the imaginative storyline and pretty bad acting (mainly from supporting characters). <br /> <br /> In the interview with Hugh Lorry, Hugh Larry is actually more rewarding than the film. <br /> <br /> Hugh Larry has done a lot of ways to learn how to dance Samba, he will immerse himself at the end of the pool kiddie. The film has a lovely girl and the look of great music, but it is not enough to make a good entertainer. <br /> If you do not look inside Rioni or the British bank, this picture is for you. 10 to 2.
