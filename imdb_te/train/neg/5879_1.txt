I acted in the movie with the actors. Annette Burning is her half, half and half, is she laughing or being natural? It did not make any distinction that it could not change the model of the film, even though it was on the roof. Brian Cox performed well. Whenever I can never really think about cleanliness, he always behaved like this, it's quick, cheat, agile. For Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> This film is very laborious and frustrating. Who would pay to see such rubbish?
