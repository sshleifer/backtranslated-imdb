The movie is very difficult, and it's annoying, in a desire to show a particular end or perspective that it will not be embarrassing with a real story. Those conclusions or perspectives are the first to be featured in movies and the story is just pretending. For this reason, the story is often talked about "jumping through hoops", trying to move forward to an earlier meeting in a logical manner. <br /> <br /> The story in "Comet Over Broadway" is just three ring circus, which just jump through the hoops. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest, most frustrating, most unpleasant, since you are in a difficult position to talk to the screen. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this screenplay is to choose between the Sespool family and the profession The woman's is. It all ends up risky to the public opinion either from maddled so terrible. So in the end there is no point for the story, the theme is irrelevant and, often with a poor screenplay, acting does not save one thing.
