Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done. However, the film is similar to the first filmmaker's attempt to make a fake art video. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is a visual producer, but has less visual artistic content (blank walls, "up shots" with a roof in the background) <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Lynch generally gains great pride in the audio, but this is also the ham of the video camera. <br /> <br /> <p> /> ... will find this daevil Fans are just a joke on David's part to explore his website (bells), because at least that idea is funny, I hope.
