> You have warned that this is spoiler! > This movie is very bad, I suspect that I'll write enough lines. The shots in the great direction are well thought out. Actors are very good, especially Richard Piore Tho I have loved to see him more. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman Classic. Goddess Dudley More God made him better. Again John Ritter would have liked to see him more. This failure in my opinion is the cause of the writer's failure completely. The producer may have pulled the plug when he sees what he has created. It's great, much money went into this boiler, with a little change here and settled in my opinion. They have to pay authenticated rates for authors. Produce a chuckle.
