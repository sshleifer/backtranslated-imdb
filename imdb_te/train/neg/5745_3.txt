The film was nominated for the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. I have seen the award from dozens of nominees and recipients from the last 30 weeks and this film seems to be bad in all - but it is not a nominee but it won !! <br /> <br /> The film superhero shows a group of characters that look like bit like Uncle Festers. Simple tailored toys that are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that there is a different number on the back of each one. If they make the magic on the space stage, they are standing on a big stage where temporarily. There is a poll and there is a stage in them. Tilting slightly starts an attempt to balance the platform platform. It will last for a long time and will continue. Only relief from this psyche will ultimately take on the wrong actions on their side, but this fun is not enough to be seen at least. <br /> <br /> By 1989, Kinky came to the Canak, and I do not know why. Not in nominees. It is too small and is much better than the year or the year of the nominees. Probably in the past years Pixar's success has led to a disagreement, but the Kannik canac is very clever and very funny, and it seems almost neglected. Pixar did it enter? This is possible.
