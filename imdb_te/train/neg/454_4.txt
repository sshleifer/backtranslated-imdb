Usually a strong cast and some brilliant dialogue and of course on the radio film of Dean Martin songs. The problem is that Nicholas Cage does not have chemistry between he and Cher and they are central love story. Cher is almost exclusively with Cage's transfer voice and her responses from control body language. Cage just never settles into his character. He tries everything that he thinks and looks like an actor not a real actor and is in love story. Cage has similar types of performance problems in other roles that require a kind of Jimmy Stewart character. Cage takes these roles, probably prefers those types of movies, but does not hand himself over to his own power as an actor, although he has made much of his effort to repeat. He has to keep the role of these films away from the less enthusiastic actors, fully committed to his role, spending his strength and considerable talent more and more in beat characters and films, where his silly interesting self is.
