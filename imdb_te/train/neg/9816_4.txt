The film is a bad train ruined, it's terrible, you still have to continue. My boyfriend and I took a rent and wasted our day two hours. Now I'm not wrong, acting is good. Not just the whole movie is just angry with us both. In this scenario anything is good or not good. After the film, I had to go to a slightly lighter rent. Most dramatic actress like Jennifer Tillley. Her role is not manic and all there is. Darryl Hannah, however, is doing her awesome job by looking at her whereabouts. More than one time I was talking to TV, she said she needed to fight back or be violent. All in all, very violent film ... for the faint of heart.
