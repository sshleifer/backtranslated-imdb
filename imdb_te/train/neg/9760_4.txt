The filming crew did not have good access to occupied territories, so it was dominated by Israel. I saw almost the opposite of the mother's perspective. The Israeli mother has the opportunity to experience tremendous happiness. Palestinian mother lost children who had only a loved and depressed life. There are no meetings for any meeting with completely different perspectives and meetings. The word "peace" does not mean everything in each of them. Palestine has peace of freedom. Israel has peace security. With such an abyss, this type of film is really valuable? I saw an unintelligible campaign - not on both sides.
