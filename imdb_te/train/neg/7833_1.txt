I saw in the third week of Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes Mini Series; I mean, I've seen 6 episodes so far. I must say that stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, reprinted her short story collection. <br /> <br /> Stories are a lot of poor for the poor, but it is not really unusual but really exciting. <br /> <br /> This mini-series collection does not mean that stories from Stephen King are good. In fact, if any of the short stories of his early stories have any suggestions, then this small series is very small. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I did not read these new short stories. Perhaps they are as good as stories in a book, not easily adapted to television, or it's wrong when trying to write an interesting script of script writers. No one knows. Similarly, these little stories are made specifically for these smaller ranges and are not for printing purpose. Perhaps it could be a problem. <br /> <br /> If Stephen King submits this editor to an editor, I do not think the editor immediately says it will be used correctly. Because it just becomes boring. <br /> <br /> You can see this little "Twilight Zone", because these stories are not with stories / scripts and actors and actresses. "Every series is just half an hour, but it's compelling and inspiring, I do not know why this mini series did not achieve such a thing. <br /> <br /> I can say that this small series can make a good little range, but unfortunately something <br /> <br /> For example, two episodes were shown this week, the first of which was a horror story writer, Who bought the painter who committed suicide and the author begins to see changes in homework driving, with an uncomfortable feeling that he throws painting, but it makes it visible to him.Also, the image of a man in the movie attempts to kill people and kill him. <br /> <br /> <br   రింగ్ ఎందుకంటే నేను నేరస్థులు మరియు వారి దోపిడి పాల్గొన్న ఈ వారం రెండో ఎపిసోడ్ గురించి ప్రస్తావించను. <br /> <br /> ఈ ఆవరణ చాలా ఆసక్తికరంగా ఉంటుంది, కథలో చాలా ఖాళీలు అలాగే కథకు సహాయపడటానికి ఏమీ చేయలేదని చూపించిన అదనపు పదార్థాలు ఉన్నాయి ఎందుకంటే నేను నిరాశ చెందాను. <br /> <br /> I've tried 3 weeks to go to these scenes. But due to poor stories / script it became very intense. If this is a movie, I recommend that people wait for the film to be released or cable. I do not recommend renting your video store. However, I do not say you've already seen this cable channel, TNT, then try for a week. If you do not like that week, you do not like the last series or the future, because they share the same boring trait.
