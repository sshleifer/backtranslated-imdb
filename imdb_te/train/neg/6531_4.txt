In the meantime, I would like to leave me with tears in my eyes only from consumer comments. A comment that bad SF movies became a good comedies. <br /> <br /> If you have a fever of a 10-year-old comic book reader from 1959, you have a handle on this sucker. All the factors are: pseudoscience, occasionally logical, often ridiculous infants. The teenage attitude towards sex with a "Gigolo" captain (a good call, guys!) Creates red eyes in a hairstyling "scientist", which does not set red alert. Mars's ridiculous sense of red glittering asteroids, and an alien monster has a mouse face, and the blue has a rotating eye like a doll's alien boy. Comic relief, he is a high astronaut (!) Who completes his 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a mental stabilization with his ray gun. And of course, just the fact that alien = dangerous evil. If two visits, it will be flat in two seconds! <br /> Do not get me wrong. I've rated this movie low. Still, it will never be boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - all make it sound more sound), and you accept, in your little kid's core, you will jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Do not accept it. I never thought you were 10 years old.
