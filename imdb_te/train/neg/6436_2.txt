I'm a kind person, so I gave 2 instead of this picture. This is the worst picture I've seen since long. We really wanted to know, because of the large visual dosages of the punitive punishment inflicted upon our heroine (Arquette), the less space and the deepest places we really wanted to know. The whole crucifixion in the first 15 minutes was more fun for both her character and the audience. Acting is rare and in the direction it is uninspired. And, if I saw myself flying with water or a pigeon camera, I started screaming harder than Patricia.
