ALIEN LOVE (as the movie is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I do not mean that Peter Greenway or Derek is a subtle art film in German style, I mean a TVM with catchy, sexy, some really good T & A, a bad script and a lot of retro feelings. <br /> You can imagine a man who was directing John Hughes about ten years ago, although he would cut T & A. <br /> <br /> Getting back to the bad script, Amanda is inspired by any kind of problems. Why does she choose either bar or not? Can she meet a foreigner? Do I see what I mean about retro? ET, between the 1980s and 1980s, featured a variety of films and other films, most of which are more defined and persuaded. <br /> <br /> I have found Eliane Love to be unseen and said that the show was only down to T & A. Better than felds Gordon and Earth Giles as a science fiction sex comedy
