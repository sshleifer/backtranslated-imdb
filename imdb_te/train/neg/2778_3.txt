The film is good camera, sound, film, sets, music, clothes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it's his poor acting or just a bad script, but it's two. For taking into consideration his role in this role, I am very hard at comparing him too. <br /> <br /> Then, for the plot of the king to kill the king, did the king die in battle or knife / queen, because the king did not have dinner and sex with him? Pretty lame. And to go to the extreme to kill his own son? And then push his lover after the victory of the King? <br /> Here I am historic bytes, but all the methods here are amazing. <br /> <br /> I'm unable to recognize Gary's progress, but he's awful. I will read another user's comments about dubbing the audio, but do not think he's dubbed ... After all, he speaks English, is it correct? It's really awful. The lines read the right coronation table ... flat-line. <br /> <br /> Previously, I saw in the end, so this film had at least one "interest". This would have been more if the script / lines and casting were given more work. The scenery and the shooting crew with very good quality films really made the film more than anything else. Cast and story are all secondary. I will give 10 personnel.
