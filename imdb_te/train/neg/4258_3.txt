I will make this film at 3 to 3 for 3 ... When I first see it you have to wait for the director's artistic abilities to wait. But the idealist or I would rather say idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government ... It's a shame, because it's nice movies shooting when Qasqfil'm honored by the name of Shakun Aimanov, but it actually ran him. Movies like 'Konak Athamana', 'Kajej Zhibeb' or 'Aldar Kos'. But in the 10 years after Mimi Eminov's death, production of quality films almost dramatically reduced. In the late 1980s, 'Assa' was filmed, which was filmed about the first organized crime groups in the big country, a year later Mr. Rasheed Nugmanov's same actor / singer V. Cseci at that time already Soviet / Russian Rock Legend - 'Igla' (The Neidel or something) is completely new, anyone is called a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately, we do not paint the films in the French and Japanese financial support for the directors, so films are not for professional critics of non-public authors, some of which are priced at international authoring film festivals but few of them come back to business asset products ... . Such films are generally not popular because of the broader material. The same effects were also portrayed by Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Cybersek Cyrillic' about Russian sizes and aliens, and I think they are French or perhaps British. In the Russian people it became 'KVN' as the main subject of 'Kavians' and comedy shows. IMHO
