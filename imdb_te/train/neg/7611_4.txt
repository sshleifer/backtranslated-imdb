First dated 2/28/2006 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Sydney Pollock): - DVD version I named "3 Days of the Condor" - so the full-fledged CIA Drama full movie for a laid-back. The story of the story revolves around 7 of the 8 members of a CIA research group killed by Robert Redford's character, codename = Condor. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford is trying to find when it's not the 8th victim at the same time. Also, he is involved in the involvement of Faye Deweye, so he must have a place to hide, and then she can help her after a little love-inspiring time. It's one of the most innocent of one of the run stories, but it does not have a lot of suspense. Flat shows do not help and close the deal to the end-of-view audience. Although Sydney is a good director of Pollock and classic performers, the story and performances are not what they should be and so the movie is not what it is not.
