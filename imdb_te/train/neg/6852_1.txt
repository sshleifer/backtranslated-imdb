This film is really unbelievable. I've seen very cheap rubbish movies, especially full full-moon- Pictures, but 'Dalman' is really hard. Comes with a lot: the ridiculous story, the actors always at the edge of the simulation and special effects! How long have I talked about them! This is a very bad movie, but one of the funniest ones. If you're a fan of bad movies, you have to watch it. And do not miss the 'Pictureman vs Demonic Toys'. It's really funnier and worse.
