If you like the Grinch movie, look again and again, because this is not good, it's a good Seasian movie translation. Mike Myers's cat is probably the most annoying character of "kindness" in recent years. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs his own jokes with a terrible waiting sound, which is about the only smile I heard at the theater. Even kids liked this one folks, and kids are now laugh at anything. Save your money and see Looney Tunes: If you're looking for a fun holiday family movie, go back to Action.
