Once again, another Diane Lane movie became her cheats. Does she know how to play it? This time it was set in 1969 and cheats with an alien man on her husband. I'm not surprised because it's so much speculative. Then her husband throws the mad milk. I would not be surprised if she even slept with milkman. I'm not surprised if this is a very boring movie because she slept with a very ice cream man. After throwing some milk, she will forgive and see the jacket again. Duh. When she was doing with him, her son would be stabbed by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones in a wasp nest. These kids do not have time to tell him mom, her blouse man is very busy.
