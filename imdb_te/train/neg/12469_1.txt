I rarely come in a movie without seeing the whole presentation. This is true when it is rented on DVD. The one I left was the Syrian. <br /> <br /> The film is chaotic, boring, confusing and poor. This acting is without dry and reliable images. The general storyline is good but it has developed in such a deceptive and boring manner, which failed to grasp my attention or interest. Multiple sub-plots have often failed to connect to each other and seem more like random stories than a virtual connected platform. Such a serious matter and such great actors can create such a fate that they are too bad. Nominations do not get the award of this film.
