I am giving 1 for this movie because there are no negative numbers in the IMDB rating system. This film is terrible. It's very bad, the story is not properly and the action is unbelievable. I suspect the Salvation Army, which forces the troops in this film, is not right. I can not even write any plot spoilers because the film is not just good enough for the plot spoilers. Writing comments in the article does not mean. If I compare this film, I feel like I compare the fire regime, but I do not like the fire regime either, but that film is better than at least one. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, <br /> <br /> I do not think I can not do it because I am not alone. I'm hoping for CGI's dinner and masterfully fighting full, but what's not. Marshall Arts lasted for 30 seconds and was frustrated by the exercise in the flash-scene sequence. CGI did not do well. A scene comes to mind. Earlier in the tank was one of the battles, the troops broke out ...... nothing. Someone just forgot animated guys que on the bit of the movie so that someone was badly devoid of bad guys. I'm thinking of being called a bad guy by voice voice over Imamep from mommy movies. This is something that resonates with Scragli. <br /> <br /> Since I mentioned a fighting scene, I would say that I am considered a spoiler, but I think the Purists only. <br /> Do not see it, it does not buy DVD when it comes out either. You are alerted.
