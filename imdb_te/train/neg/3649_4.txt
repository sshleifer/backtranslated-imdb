This is unusual, even though Art Bell and his Ilk finds how to develop a career in Karl Kolchak's attitude. Although this program does not come well for this audience, there are probably no X-files. Darren McGavin is not exactly a superheroic type, but he is an acceptable (enough) person to offer heroic work. Look at his work in those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he does not appear to be the main attraction, a distressed girlfriend or wife. In fact there is not a whole lot of sex appeal in the program. Panning something I'm noticing as well is not really excitement in a distinctive way. This show has a lot of humorous humor. Sometimes its just getting to the pokey climax. There is a thread from the show until the present Mad Men perform in the style. David Chase wrote Mad Men but the people who worked under Sopranos were certainly not his serial-comic tone emulated and inherited.
