I got the DVD very cheap and I'm a total drobe, and the film has the only group that has always been interested in. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The film is also pretty average or sub-average, and is designed for more than one TV for the film. <br /> The most interesting part is probably the last one because it does not mean to be honest. But there is nothing to understand about it. But at least you can not get the expected end, and it comes sooner than expected. <br /> <br /> The whole film is unique for drobies.
