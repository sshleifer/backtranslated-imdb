Wowwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to stop it within 10 minutes, but I wanted to give it a chance to get it right. Or at least have some zealous qualities, you do not need to say that you're kind of like a movie, or really intelligent, or well-shot or something like that, wasting about an hour and a half in my life. I'm going to get to why it's terrible because of my time waste to explain these "spoilers may be" ... IMDb, you should calm down on spoilers and pay more attention People and movies are not paid to write good reviews or relate to something in the picture or Have I think it's ridiculous when it comes to seeing these horrible movie ratings to be valid and I think it's ridiculous ... All 7-10 star ratings are absolutely a bit different ... Even though still a big IMDb fan, This rating process must be reversed, because this is the case Mob should not be higher than Mbb.
