Burt Reynolds, who looks very tired, plays a hire role for these leaders to sell some of his former owners to sell "the Iranians" for Gazo. The low-rental video inability of the "Silk Stocks" produces some good action shoots and maintains a lot of "drama" ... the lack of logic and true horror conversation, the final twists and loyalty changes may be a nifty conclusion in a better image. Burt still has the presence, but if you notice it more, he suddenly says that the sound is "one-linear".
