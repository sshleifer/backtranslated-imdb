An interesting idea (fraudulent by four African American women and banks crushed under the heel of the community boot) will be offended by F. Gary Gray's terrible slow direction and random funny moments (by Takashi Burford and Kate Lanier). Instead of deliberately misusing and humiliating the men, Gray, Buffford and Loner would prefer to suppress their overwhelming audience with the overwhelming feelings of operatic tragedy, rather than delicate commentary on the role of urban women. It's a play at its worst. Gray's actors are tough on each tired line and refuses to pick John Carter's lazy editing slack, instead choosing to train his camera performers' tough faces. Actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivika A Fox have some raw talents (Queen Latifa is the fourth and actress she is a wonderful rapper), they need a certain hand than Gray's guide and as a result they come in the dark and inconvenient before the camera. Steer clear.
