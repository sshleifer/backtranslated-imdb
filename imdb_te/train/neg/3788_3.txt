Here's a lot to like. The first rate of the actors and the script provides better dialogue and the capture of an eye-knit, preferred family atmosphere. However, this is not a movie. We have clearly seen Leo about discovering his HIV positive diagnosis, and he definitely responded in a manner not tuned to the help environment he found. Moreover, the film suddenly escapes when Leo, his brother and the rest of the family will have to do in the light of his love. Leo's brother impressed the young actor who portrayed Marcel, usually the other cast. Unfortunately, if they want to have a comprehensive article on the effects of HIV on the disqualification, attractive family, or devastation, the writers can not make a decision - so this is only a reference to both. Though the film offers food for thought, it wants more than the viewer.
