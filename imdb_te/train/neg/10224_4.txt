<br /> <br /> Well, one line summary says it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is original and features of "Leon". <br /> <br /> <br /> Alain Dylan is a lone warrior / professional killer in "samurai", he keeps in livestock and steals cars for his job (scenes with a lot of suspense in this regard!). In the end there is exactly the same: samurai desires the honor of honor and is shot with an empty gun in his hand. He recognizes the world and it does not have a samurai. <br /> <br /> Do not kill as many people as Dell's Ghost Dog. But I also liked Jermsch "Lyon" or "Desperado" by Rodriguez. So he added this too. <br /> <br /> What is the original, original idea in the film? < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not see point in copies of carbon (celluloid). <br /> <br /> By Macaulay 4/10 Rating Connor
