<br /> <br /> I do not know what category the movie will apply, but this movie is not a horror movie. For the story, it's very interesting, but slow. <br /> <br /> Why is she the first detective or home of her uncle (or home) on earth? She knows exactly what will happen at that time, plus she has a video tape proof. Instead, she runs there and nuts go and say, "I know everything, I have proof! Then she will be surprised when her uncle stands up and she starts walking as she is going to be hurt. The proof told him that no dumb finale.
