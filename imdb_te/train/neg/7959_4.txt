Andy Lai is another policeman secretly in the story. Daniel voices Nix and he is close to the gang (laurel) dealing with drug trafficking. This movie starts. Police try to make drugs. We then live near Mac and her daughter and her life and cops, and I'm introducing 45 minutes to shut down the movie and put on the news. A movie is as uninvolving as I've seen in a very long time and it's great to see this well. Its not bad its just you do not really care. I mean I do not really care at all. I really started to do something else forgetting that I had in the subtitle film, thats how much I did not care. I thought I would hate the movie, but such a disadvantage of the film did not make any impression on me (I can not sleep somewhere to ignore it). The box comes on the so-called box scare box, what happens after death? This is the one to avoid.
