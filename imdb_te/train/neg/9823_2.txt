There is an interesting discussion in this film. <br /> If the moral good man is not enough, the film will read without the guidance of God. <br /> The beginning of the film is a line: "You can see a morally good person, but I know he's going to hell. <br /> When I'm not a Christian, talks about it are lovely throughout the film, I thought that the film was not intended but moral good enough. * Submitted arguments and debates are heavily biased, Phantatism is a powerful thing, especially when it comes to minds of ignorant and uneducated minds, George Carlin's role in dogma says: "When they were young, hook em." In the basic premise it is very interesting, and since the 1890s, a Bible scholar has begun to publish a book It is morality without God that morality becomes meaningless, do you tell only a child that you should not steal or tell you not to steal (it is not difficult to tell the child to steal because he thinks he is stolen by his stomach? <br /> <br /> The author, Karlislee wants to recommend his school recommends to sell the book (global outbreak). However, this requires unanimous consent, and one of the pundits opposes it. He brings in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about the morality of God's words argument vs morality. To prove his point of view, he leads a time machine (in the movie, I'm fine), and in 2002 Carlisle will lead us. /> <br /> To be clear, he is in his opinion, and has changed by what he sees, and repulsed himself by his return time (he returns, he is not really a spoiler, this is a bible <br /> <br /> It's very slow and does not work properly.It * needed * something in this film, it's Carlisle, he does not hurt anyone, is a crime, <br /> <br /> Also, I am happy to be in the film to confirm that I'm happy with the movie Some points I'm not Christian, or "It's not God or anything" First of all, Carlisle in the corner of the two "bad guys", Karlisle is going to make his * only * really despicable * his time-jump Jesus, and it does "bad guys" (btw also Christians who are enough, enough), they think they just missed the rapture. Secondly, after Carlisle Returns, he found a boy who had shot him in the beginning of the film (but did not mention God, the child keeps marrying and fleeing) at the beginning of the film, and tells him that the stolen time is wrong. <br /> As Carlin says above, there is a faux-pass in my book, frightening children to religion. <br /> Finally, lecture. Another threat strategy. The inventor asks how long they can go and that he does not know. Introduction tries to lay a bible in the distant future (which starts in 2100), and it fails .. He has been reduced for 10 years, trying again and fade-out if he's 2030 or higher is. Throughout the film, Carlis felt that he thought he was filled with the sin of the world and the loss of the divine name. Thousands of years of intimidating tactics are in use .. At the time of enlightenment, the Church also possesses enlightenment. <br /> <br /> I am glad to see this movie. I'm absolutely sure before it's morally good, and it's actually that I know now. If you're not a Christian is worth looking at, to make sure you're not as innocent as folks in this film.
