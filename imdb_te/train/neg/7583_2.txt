The worst picture of David Lean. This is not bad at 'we serve it'. It usually has at least some zealous features in a movie that has a good reputation, which makes it understand why it is considered a classic. But after looking at this I did not get to know why this piece of garbage liked it so much back in 1945! I'm acting, with a strong upper lip, British habit, story, script (which is very witty at times but totally unexpected) and soundtrack. The role of the Elvira is considered attractive and attractive, but the original reality is ugly and contains unnatural and bizarre voice. Believe that you do not believe in the reputation of movies is another movie. Another overtered 'British classics'.
