I was fascinated by the title ... I was expecting a brilliant and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a bully Scott. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are not ready to classify cheesy teen-like poetry, <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the story is to try to describe the inner feelings of <br /> <br /> Sadly, the simple idea is "I'm because I'm that way". And to a low-level person, the poet's edge is paid somewhat. <br /> <br /> The reeks of a quick fix for "Petty Modi" is a durable film, smart, fictitious and meaningful to make a disappointing film. <br /> <br /> "16-year-old alcohol" is very intelligent, artsy or meaningful ... The leading character does not develop at all, and the changing weak effort fails without good explanation. <br /> <br /> The film was heavily infected from classics such as Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, and eventually failed to regain their greatness for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> The artwork on the artwork of Jobson is put in very diligence, and ignoring the rest, giving us a picture which is pleasant to the eye but the brain is uninspiring.
