I got the UK 4-Disc Special Edition of Superman 1 for $ 5. Additional items include the 1951 feature Superman and Mole-Men. <br /> <br /> Some early frustration - I did not check it, and I thought it was mentally tagged as Kirk Alain serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I did not see anything more than Kirk Alyn's odd clip - but Hey Ho, forever forgive me. <br /> This black and white product runs less than an hour. The two-part episode of Reeves' first TV series, the two-partter, was released for the release of the film, although IMDb was filmed as the premiere of the first TV series. In any case, this is the odd choice for the reasons I came up later. I'm old enough to recall the TV and movie structures that are limited to one or both positions and sets, so there are no big shots here. However, for a low budget movie, this is a very low budget. <br /> <br /> This story is a small town of Silsby - 1,430 - it is deep in the deepest oil of the world, 6 miles). This story moves well to the well-thought person. With the arrival of Metropolis Reporters Kent and Lane, these contradictions should be well reported by the oil company's orders. The fact that Clark was born under 6 miles of clock is that Clarke's odd little guys (the pair is big, the smallest on the head, the jump in the jumpsuit, and the eyebrow in the eyebrow) <br /> <br /> Now the deep breath, the rest of the picture in the picture. Young boys can intimidate some children, so Jeff Corey (playing the dominant Jenophob) town can stimulate some of the "killing" of these "creatures." Superman is staged (not moderately affected) and one of the youngest children is shot dead and taken to a local hospital. Cory's pals break down the shock, but the other little boys hide and kill him, but he escapes and the legs fall into the shaft. A lynch mob (although she is arrested by Sheriff) stimulates mole-killing at Corey Hospital. Superman goes to the hospital and takes the injured shaft to the shaft to return him to his companions. All 4 mole-mines were a kind of weapon and they fired at Jeff Corey (I call this an aug! Gun because it seems to make "Aargh!" To its only effect, and Superman protects him). As soon as Superman behaves like him, he will immediately change his way back when the mole goes back to shaft people. End. <br /> <br /> The film is only about one hour, it's incongruous, chaotic and chasing - I'm looking for Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B to make sure that no one is following him, Mole-Mone is engaged in any way - They do not have a conversation - they just turn around, get hurt and go back. <br /> Clark Kent - a very tightly closed reporter, it's very difficult, but he is a terrible, horrific Superman and he's not seen in his episode (at least his hair is black, it's a bit of some TV episodes Improved from mild hair), all in my book was wrong as he was playing. I'm sure he said "Superman is constantly doing" (but Superman constantly does), but someone should say that he does not have a fist on the rings, not anyone should be fist. <br /> <br /> He plays the hard and hearty school teacher rather than Superman - He does not run in the ransom, but he may be. <br /> And a big amount of big money running around Superman - he's not actually the same), and a bit of running. He sometimes takes off and lands, but at any time does not appear on the plane. Oh, some bullets bounced him up, and he uses telescopic sight as Clark, but there is no visual effect. In fact, visual effects are obvious because of their absence, and the present few people are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to observe a prediction of these criteria: I am very pretty at the standards. Thankfully, the TV series had production standards and at least suffered to provide them with stories. <br /> <br /> Do not be disappointed.
