Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture, know little about the Japanese pop culture. <br /> <br /> I can comment on the film: I do not know how happy I am. Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii very good director - despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the Talking Head style, and that interesting and something interesting- and he was surprised that he arrived with this. It may be one of the lost language translation cases, which I'm afraid of, but when I see this film as a European viewer, I felt awkward with English subtitles overturned by subtitles. Jokes seemed bad, surpassing the script-I mean, to give audiences a break, and to shut down a little mournful hero - that's just blowing up the fast speaking and absurd actions over my head. <br /> <br /> I thought the animation was really cool. The idea was great, and the animated scenes were well exploited. Nevertheless, as the eye-candy characters seemed to be put in the Mumbai-Jumbo speech, they are still set aside to begin with endless funny without images. It wants to speed up the scene of the next cut-out hysterical scenes. <br /> <br /> I would like Oshi to actually plan on this sequel. The idea was good but terribly exploitative. Perhaps the second part of this is one of the first one to bring up the good parts and actually make an interesting image, or maybe it will be more and more commentary scenes. But hell, if you considered Talking Head dense, the Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gift gives you a stroke. <br /> <br /> In fact, this commentary is based on the experiences of all European people. Perhaps this is a really funny movie that is lost to the Japanese, in cultural boundaries and in translation. May be.
