Yes, this movie is bad. Worse that it will take any advantage of its own title !! In the end of the picture, zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice. On top of that, we are not really sure if the main character in the film is definitely a vampire. They argue that they will try to "tone it down" or "try to be" realistic, but it just ends up boring. More than half IN IN A CAR is being done. There's nothing to say about the scenes happen nowhere else. Also, there is no clear adversary, and in the end you do not know what the final 30 minutes of the film really happened. <br /> <br /> However, for a low picture of the product value, the soundtrack is surprisingly good and convenient (with a rudimentary score or a sampling of music in other places). <br /> <br /> I am all for independent films, but it does not seem to have been for the mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "It's worse than scarecrow slayer."
