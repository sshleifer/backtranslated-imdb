Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays a major role in Australian stage production, from Jenny Newman (from the sexplay of the US Slasher Hell Night of the APES). As a young girl she saw her wife sexually and accidentally caused her car accident because she was a virgin. Meanwhile, a dark dark killer moves around the theater to smash people with glass pieces. <br /> The killer apparently Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, clears the blood off her hands after the murders and the broken bottle like a little girl will kill a child molester!), but thankfully this is a huge breath POV The camera is on work and <br /> <br /> Talking about the whole cast, having sex or attempting, and in one case A body that's blackmail. Laid. Nudity and blood is quite a bit, but lack of awareness of continuity, photography murky and editing (even by the script and produced by Colin Eggleston) is terrible. The theater arrangement for a slasher film is a picture of Soavor of Five Years and the film of Argento's OPERA (which is better than these two), and Neumann is pretty hot.
