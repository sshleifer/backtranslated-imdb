The previous poster clearly worked on the film. No matter how bad it is, no one can review it as no one can picture it. To tell all the names of the actors and what they had been before, it was obvious that he was involved in something. <Br /> <br /> It is in Cinemax now and I'm sure there is some movie out there where some of these pornographic stars (one called Ava being gorgeous and well cooperated) had to do something for some crazy tax cause It was perfectly done in 1986, and I was born in '73, so I knew what I was talking about ... but not ... it happened In 1993 !! <br /> I'm saying this is one of the best films. Like rail wreck.
