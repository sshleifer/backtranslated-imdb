I'm a fan of a trace from the premiere episode. I can not really express my frustration in the last week. This is a real problem dealing with the ongoing American-American families. The lack of critical media coverage in the first 48 hours has been recorded by a recent study. Law enforcement, including local, state and federal, is also complicit. What is the purpose of promoting this subject? Inevitably, television can almost exclude any matter. It's insulting.Let it be together or do not explore the next time.
