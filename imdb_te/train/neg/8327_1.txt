As well. So low budget "film" (I've used quotes because it was shot in the Hi-8 video). Acting is terrible around the world, make-up is ridiculous (the blood from Sherwin-Williams looks and the more persuasive injuries made from Halloween gray kits), and lighting is common when they use someone's borrowed Toyota pickup to light up. If the movie is attempting to tell a story, If I forgive this low-budget features original content onta. But the collection of video footage can boast any plot, true characters, and momentum. <br /> <br /> There are no spoilers here, nothing to ruin.
