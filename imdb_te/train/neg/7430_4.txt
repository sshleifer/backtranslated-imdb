It is interesting to see how Pearce Brosnan's career is before the Bond scene. In this "time" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the role of a gentle Patrick who works with the famous Ghetto children on "faith courses." He loved a woman with a boog-stamp mold-top top 90 kid called Eric. The woman's drinking ex-husband comes in the scene soon and worries Peirce. <br /> <br /> Pierce is innocently doing "vegeburgers". The husband enters. Pierce vegeburgers restarts made. The husband attacks Pierce. Pierce is half eaten vegeburger call from the mouth of the little parts of the fall. This fight ends without showing the result. <br /> <br /> The movie gets better. <br /> <br />
