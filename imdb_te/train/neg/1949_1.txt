Animation looks like it happens in 30 seconds, and looks more sophisticated than the characters. I was a fan of Scooby Doo since 1969 when I first appeared. I do not think a lot about Scooby Doo animated films (not about the TV series, not about full-length movies), but some of them are very good, and I think most people scrappy do have an irritability, but this series is pure rubbish. I saw the animation, and immediately after listening to the characters, (and I'd have that word loose), I was crushed. Also, the Mystery Inc., a team, and the whole staff to each other to praise, it just seems like someone has already found ate them and opening a box of chocolates, and the only thing nobody none of them. What is a new Scooby Doo? If you want a Scooby Doo TV series, the series will have a long time tolerable items. Total cast roles, and quality animation. They need to come back from behind this rock from coming.
