The film has an IMDB rating of 8.1, and I have a lot more to expect from it. It starts out funny and lovely with a force that feels random. But before the picture is half way, it will begin to drag and everything will be sinkly predictable. The characters in the office are happy in the first trimester, but we understand them well. They are not real people, sarcastically. This is the only story I have seen hundreds of times, which is just a little different here. <br /> All those characters are absurd and unreliable inspirations, and unfortunately the Dead Letter Office case. Hopefully this movie will soon end in Dead Movie Office.
