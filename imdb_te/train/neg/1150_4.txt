In contrast to many snippets from those who think they are more illegal, . Most of the war's waste and money waste, and for that it deserves some appreciation, in this documentary almost all of the reasons for the war against those who have just illegal drugs - and when asked by drug warriors, they would like to solve the drug war. For example, in 80 minutes crack cocaine has spent several minutes in increasing violence with increasing popularity, at any time, this practice also laws that are designed to suppress breaking cocaine will force pharmaceutical sellers to enter into their contracts and business arrangements in legal courts to keep violence in business.

It was in the 20th century, the United States, marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and aksikatin of such drugs is an interesting neutral. But there is an important element of the opinions of different people regarding drug laws and most of it (but not all) in favor of the psychoanalysts, especially drugs other than cannabis. <br /> <br /> The criminal justice system is not the answer or the correct answer to every single social problem, including penalties for breaking its often tough life, but unfortunately there is an epidemic in this country that is an unnamed disease, whose primary qualities relate to social policy regarding social policy, Lack of compassion for fellow humans, drugs that are not approved by government A misconception that can be used against the people, prison / police vested interest in the growth of the industry, and a terrible indifference with regard to human dignity.
