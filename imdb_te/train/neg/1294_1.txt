The main theme of the film is confusing, relationships, alignment, acting, and social issues all of the same: confusion. Harvey Keitel also gets out of his element, and his simple impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. He is a man named Kay, whose name is 'Che', and as we say (via direct, narrator), to make matters worse. The relationships of the family are unclear until the end of the film and once defined, the family is divided - to the younger generation of America. So cliche. Other reviews discuss how to illustrate the impact of the revolution in a boy's family; However, the political attitude of the director is rare, and he is responsible for bloodshed. So they lost their property (gambling gains) - hence? When filming about the Cuban Revolution, refusing to take a political perspective, an odd and cowardly choice. This movie is in English! Why are these Cubans spoken in English? They were not allowed to film in Cuba. And if family life is very important to see where it is, it's great that we can recognize - we are all in the beginning 'contact' - a cheap way to make clear relationships throughout the film! Acting is largely unpleasant, woody, and unreliable, timing is far from everything. 'Special' visual effects are confusing and disorganized. In American films references - and black character like the Greek chorus - absolutely grateful, intellectual festivals, and consistently from space. I saw only the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity or some point for everything. It never happened.
