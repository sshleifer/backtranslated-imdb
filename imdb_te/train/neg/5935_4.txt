The most horrific thing about this "tribute" is that almost all singers (other than the most talented Nick Cave) seem to have lost the whole point of Lyne's lying: Coleman transfers the full range by giving him almost all his desperate lines <br / Some of these singers are experiencing experienced traumas and patent efforts Nt efforts, "I am singer!" A real pain. Many of you have the same idea of ​​listening to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs like Lennon "Imagine". Nothing is close to the original original simplicity and directness. If artwork is a form of art that does not require, this is the art of Cohen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> The sarcasm of the master and, if the truth says, many of these singers think they are hired in some sheltered talents. Cohen sings them without singing his things and singing things around him: whether they are friends or his daughter, he is very soft and in a mood for the gift. </ p> <p> Fortunately, but in the end, Cohen has demonstrated his majestic "Song of the Tower", but the flower itself is completely incongruous <br /> <br /> If you really love Cohen really is a tragic show really, and sad is.
