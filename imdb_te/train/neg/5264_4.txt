Traveling to the majestic desert like Jim (Harry Hamlin) & Patty Henley (Susan Day) and their two children Katie (Bashia Ehren) & Matt (Jeremy Lellit), along with the family's friend Ethan (Jamie Croft) And ask about an old deserted mining town on the map of Weaver. No one has heard it's arguments but it's perfect & the family decides to take a break from checking it & taking some pictures. Once in town they take some pictures & look around but not when it comes time to leave their car & they will spend the night there. As they look around, they will find camcorder video tape, which plays only for finding the footage of a scary woman. Her friends disappeared and disappeared the following morning and their car took a bad turn. What is the secret of Weaver? <br /> <br /> I wrote, co-executive writer who wrote and directed by Walter Kleinhardt, was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. The first 85 minutes was a pretty mysterious mix of thriller & horror film, but we are always considered one of the worst finishes in film history. The script suggests lots of different things but it never explains or confirms that I am genuinely disloyal about Ethan's disappearance of Families car, the four recent tombs, the abandoned mines thing, the supernatural sandy storm, suddenly sitting there genuinely unconscious about what's going on & her just inexplicable reappearance, sheriff The wickedness of Intentions, a compass going crazy in the car, the plane crash, the worst effects of Weaver Weaver refuse towns and near the neutron bomb dropped at Weaver. But all of them were thrown out of the window & all that we knew were totally different random events. Everything was coming along nicely & arranged for a big twist revelation but no one was coming & instead I was very disappointing, strange, surreal & clear disappointing finish. If there is nothing else, it is quite contrary to the previous one and leaves the viewer with more questions than the viewer. The makers have these great ideas but it's not like what they do with & just like finishing off on the spot. I felt like putting too much effort into looking at the film that is pretty pretty slow without any sort of gift & actually felt like a kick with more teeth or a good two-finger salute across the end <br /> <br /> Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost The town has a specific climate & big desert desert positions give a good sense of being alone. But what are they thinking about that end? Nothing fits, nothing makes sense & it's a huge frustrating mess that you want to learn more about confusion & more after you're sitting through an almost half an hour & a half-leaves thing. There are one or two creepy moments here, but there is no blood or gore in the horror film. The film is actually reminiscent of The Hills Hey Eyes (2006), as well as nothing to shut the film before the film breaks down. <br /> <te / technically this image is good with good product values, good special effects, sets, positions and cinematography. Set in America but filmed in South Australia. Acting from a good cast is good. <br /> <br /> The disappearance is a really odd film for a long time creating a small little horror mystery thriller. Throws more questions than answers. I can not really see the head or tail of this head making, I'm not really.
