CHUNG is funny and funny for the scene of Mr. Chong's literary Roach: A chaotic kitchen cockroach mashes, the chunk is perfectly fine for his pipe's bowl, lights up, blows and hacks for a visible eternity, then perfect experimentation and a beat can not be skipping, The bowl will properly reload, back lights, back toks. End spanier. However, through my inquiries, I lost less than half way. It happened to me that the awkward duo way is less than bad and relatable. I came to congratulate contemporary stoner's, relative complexity of Harold and Kumar. I like the bright company. Furthermore, the film is probably perfectly suited for viewers who are weak-minded as baked frat bros or outwitted by a stoner - the former are smarter. Leading guest role by Paul Rubens with pre-conclusions in the P-V-form.
