Weissmuller Tarzan films finale is very weak. <br /> <br /> At first, Tarzan spent a lot of floppy slippers. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, and sometimes even sandals or boots, will take away from the character of civilization and the pro-jungle character. <br /> Second, the character is completely out of comic film as Benji, as mentioned in the previous post. <br /> <br /> While vicemiller still cuts a commanding figure called Tarzan, it is clear that he is not in his shape. <br /> <br /> The Octopus War is a wonderful idea, but I thought he had previously acted in the film Wasimuller. His physical peak. Similarly, if Tarzan and his colleague are drawn from 2 seconds and 90 seconds, such as the classic giant crocodile battle, the battle to take only 30 seconds is more exciting. <br /> <br /> Brand Joyce Jane and Lynda are very happy to become Christian, which did not manage to protect this last Weissmuller film - it was a disappointing disappointment.
