I have never seen Cinderella II ever since, (Peter Pan 2, and The Lion King 2 and some other sequels like Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). These films are designed with a similar idea; Because the film does not have any plot, they try to do it by filling it out. I am telling you joking, but they make a lot of film. The first time I saw the film, I gave it 1/10. But now I think about it, so many kids do not care how good the movie is, they are fun for the movie. I still think this movie is a bad sequel, but it's not terrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
