The film has a weak plot, weak classification, really weak special effects, and I'm losing valuable life by watching it. It seems to be the director of the director's intentions to earn random roles and to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots were sad and the main "hero" boat was launched by a huge knife switch. If the film is not so bad it is ridiculous, but nothing about it is not funny. The main villain was one of the same ransom, he was killed. It is sad when he is the source for the bad guy, because he is one of the best to cheer. When all is said and done, this film is fine on the cutting room floor, or never funding at all.
