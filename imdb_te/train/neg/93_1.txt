A woman sees the mystery secret in the intercontinental town, listening to the two horror stories from the local wardrobe and the zombie of both. But perhaps the fate is something nasty in the store for her too <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact I agree, it's too bad to be forwarded by a lot of rubbish. And there is much, believe me. It runs just 69 minutes, and the tons of fill still exists. <br /> <br /> Some of you may have done a lot of flower-ups, Goofy Teenage (that cut, tee hee) and some of the actors are never seen as good examples. <br /> <br /> For title characters, they also have a footnote on the film. Why, you get more undead action of intro than you have before the feature! <br /> <br /> How can a blind eye reverse from the sockets and how to eat the sequences of the brain (in other 'delights') may be a blessing in disguise. <br /> It is filmed on one's mobile phone for broadcast on YouTube. Jerky camera work, scratches on print, dazzling lights ... I just rub my eyes when I learned to make it in 2001, and not in 1971. Even clothes and fashion look even for over three decades! <br /> <br /> If you think that I do not want to review the chronicles of the whole movie, then go ahead. You can not try to sit by it, you can not even make the first look of the blue-smoky colorful wick on your excuses and depart. It's really ridiculous that anyone chooses to release it, and honestly you get your DVD resting on your disc rather than teasing your DVD player out of the horror. In fact, it's not surprising if the bags and leaves are packed in the morning and you will leave the VHS tapes in your rest of life. You were warned ... <br /> <br /> PS 18-Rated Horror Which type of female scene involves a woman in a sports sports baza? Look, the film can not even get the right part ...
