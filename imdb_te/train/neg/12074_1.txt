A wealthy man (John Carradine) is a horror horror movie about the need to leave his four children, his servants and his servants equally split. One condition - they spend a week on his estate to earn money. And if any of them die, there will be more to others. <br /> <br /> I saw a new print of this film on cable. The colors are bright and bright and the house is also beautiful. This is about all the good things I say. <br /> Let's list some of the problems with the film: the killer is clearly visible shouting; Servants are called Igor and Elga - come; Some of the sound recording I could not get out of the conversation (so great loss I'm sure); Gore was short and very low; Other murders are just boring, stupid or impossible and this film has some really unpleasant acting - so bad you stare on the screen with disbelief. Even Pro Jeff Moro is terrible! Just a very good acting Jupiter's Faith Domager (better than this) and John Caradine (who looks old and weak with tears here). <br /> <br /> Why rename this name as "Blood Legacy Off" - there is another 1978 horror film with my name! <br /> Despite its name, this is a bad image. Avoided at all costs.
