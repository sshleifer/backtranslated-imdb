Probably could not find the DVD menu option for the PLOT: OFF. Obviously, default is off. When the roll starts rolling final credits, I can not believe it. <br /> <br /> The characters have been filmed in a wide range of strokes and the author's distaste for wealthy Theatres is clearly visible. I thought it was "Roosevelt Democrat," but it would make me feel a little more sensitive. <br /> <br /> But the problem is with me. I see that many people in this movie have found meaning or message. <br /> The only thing that saved me from giving this "1" is a good sight, man and plant.
