<br /> <br /> "Beauty of loneliness" I was twice as disappointed in the week. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> I am unsure how people are called "realistic" coverage of this year's "real" coverage of "Thatcher" years - okay as play, but I think the award-winning book is still better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will follow up with us and follow the next part of the next drama and then come with the fact that "2006 Things Only Get Better" and we are still waiting! With that claim from a government which is full of sleaze.
