Yes, unfortunately I saw this DVD and found it very awful. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the characters suck. If some of these guys can come for a role if they are some of the darkest creative ideas in an orange hat called 'Orange Sherbert' then they should not be exactly in the film-shoot scene. Poor "clothing", bad "interviews", and not primarily a "wrestler" on this entire disc. Idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. <br /> <br /> In reality, the Rampage Wrestling is a wonderfully beautiful backyard wrestling clone. <br /> <br /> Wrestling Fan or not, avoid this DVD, instead of blood, weapons, mayhem, and frustrated children, tripolin, tripolin, terrible audio and terrible audio. It is painful.
