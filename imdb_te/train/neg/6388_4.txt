The Brothers Quay Directors, by judging by traditional thinking, must adhere to creating small films. I really really liked their first feature, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore endeavor, the piano tuner of the earthquakes, I'm ready to agree that they do not come close to their last intellectual equals with the feature length. The piano tuner, without doubt, is a beautiful picture to watch, and often hear. Unfortunately, the boundaries are painful to keep up with its improved narrative and glacier pace. Reading the plot compilation, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the brothers fail miserably to bring it life. One thing that you want to avoid completely in the future: dialogue. My God, here's terrible. Heavy fall.
