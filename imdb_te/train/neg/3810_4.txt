When I was young, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This performance is smooth, badly written, rarely funny. The three leads are all better than all the good actors and funny men (Saget Stand Up is much better than the stuff that came up with this show, Coulier is a good stand up, and Stamos is better than the average actor). Shortly afterward, Stomos wanted to be on the show because it wanted to do more dangerous things (who could blame him?). <br /> <br /> The program was canceled when most actors requested more money in this program. Catch frames - how is a person 'tired', 'need dood', 'nidabba', 'cut it out' and 24 hours? <br /> <br /> Kimi Gibber - The most unpleasant character written for television. Orio cookie and oldest. There is a good clich√© and bad writing work. <br /> <br /> All three people living in San Francisco - have said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. The dubious thing- very recall. <br /> <br /> 6. Advanced Children - Girls have all mall fashion and they can see posters of advanced recording artists. <br /> <br /> Now this program is in Nick @ Knight. I rarely make a classic call. I can not tell you about the people I've been involved because I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just sugar sweet, I was not able to stand up shortly after.
