Alert. This film is such a mess. This is a disaster. Do not waste your time. <br /> Acting, story, dialogue, music ... Mainly everything is topped, it is completely annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw me (if I do not have the conversation / acting / story, if it is filthy). You think you're watching comedy. The problem is that the components that are supposedly supposedly funny are not even funny. Acting, story, cinematography, you can feel everything is just too hard on WAAAAY - but it will not succeed. Practically every shot can be canceled, but what? The film feels like a student film. <br /> <br /> They have been filmed in HD because of the waste to spend more money on the film. <br /> <br /> If you're smiling easily or do poorly acting, writing, editing, directing, everything that's been forced into your face, Oh and I know about poor performance? <br /> <br /> I think I like this movie. <br /> I'm looking for a class. If I could, I would immediately stop it. If you can not yet tell, I have hated this movie. It'd throw me and get my time back ... at least I do not have to pay this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldberg, Did you know ... Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in the film but he definitely goes downstream - the characters accepting such disaster films.
