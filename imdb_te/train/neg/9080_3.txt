Well, I ordered it at my pay-per-view at home because I was frustrated and needed a laugh. I have to confess, I have done it a few times, but I do not even remember what parts I have. I do not know why this film was made. It's a comedy but seriously, I can not find the singing penis, or a naked 70-year-old woman very funny. The film attempts to fit into 'grass-out' comedy films in recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it has just failed miserably. This has led to a lot of space, it's comedy. Also, why is Cameron Diaz telling his name on the ground? When Dave and Angela were in the pool I was the only thing I liked about this film. I wanted sexy and fun and well done. In addition, avoid this film. 3/10
