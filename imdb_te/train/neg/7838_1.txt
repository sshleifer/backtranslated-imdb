The film is basically a velvet goldmine, with five party writers holding it and a TV. Image. Velvet Goldmini has good acting, writing and mainly everything else. I have some of the worst writing I saw from the movie Wild Wild West. It must be absolutely interesting. I know that I have their surname behind VH music shows. This is good if you're behind the music episode, but it's not flat on and on the face.
