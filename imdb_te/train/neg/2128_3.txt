Unneeded remake, and it does not come close to capturing the charm of the original. Extreme length can cause more than some accented inspired parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film does not have style, does not have more talent than acting, but is directed, sets, sets, and so on. This is a blatant denial for a long period of time. Vanessa Williams is the only cast that shows the cast, and Tyne Dal√≠ is not too bad. They should be left alone enough. Singing is good (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (for everyone). See original 1963 version and skip this one. The recommendation is not much here.
