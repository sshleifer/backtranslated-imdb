This is one of the most boring horror films I've seen since it's a completely horrific god, John Caradine, with a very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see two turns at the end of the next few miles! The great arrangement and the creepy house certainly helped if it was not so boring, and there was not a role to root, and we hope that it will lead to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there. Eventually, John Corridrin is a good scene, but it's already too late, and only one other screen time in the past, plus in the film's only gary scene Bey's chaos, it's gear. I call it a DVD horror set and call it back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's lucky to have included in a set of purchases if I chucked this window! It's a completely horrific horror movie, John Caradine has a very limited screen time, and I avoid it as a plague, I do not want you to go through violence, which is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. The direction is totally terrible! Carl Manson makes a terrible thing! The job is here, every thing look cheap, wasting his ability to make creepy atmosphere and just placing the image at a very dull speed. Acting is just bad. John Caradine is good in his scene, but after the rest of the scenes in the film he is rare. (Caradine Rouge !!). Merry Anders Lora is terrible like overacts here, as she does not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune Okay, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she had a creepy smile at the end though. For the rest of the cast, I could not pay much attention, because I was struggling with a lot of trouble, but they were very bad. Avoid it altogether, it's not worth the pain! BOMB from 5
