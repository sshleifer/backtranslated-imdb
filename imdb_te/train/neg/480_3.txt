2 stars for Ke Francis - she is awesome! Warner Bros. She does not deserve this terrible trip to throw her! <br /> <br /> The two audience companions based on the film are seriously ridiculous and reliable. Kay is a small town wife and mother yearns for something big: she wants an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to Town and invites him to talk about the possibilities, she goes to the movies and tells her husband. A mother hubby's biddy hubby puts a mistake in the ear, which is not true and he is looking for her. He sees his actor (they only speak!) In the hotel and he is a railing in a pond (lake?), A man who faced lands, and slugs into the person who dies. <br /> <br /> The judge judges the jury, if the man decides to die. * Before heading into the water, they must cut the first degree murder offender. (Whaaaaa ?????) I'm devastating a man who fits a rage. Calculate the manslaughter or murder 2, the first DEGREE is not a murder. Give me a break but convicted in the murder case. <br /> 2) The hubby attorney, sentenced and After the verdict, Kenny tells her that she is a mistake. If the actor is unable to go to the room, his argument is that her husband should go after her and kill him and kill him. She is not her husband, she tells her that she is a faulty person and she accepts and accepts. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is trying to make her husband's reputation and money to release her from jail, and the right thing that caused him to kill the actor in the first place. <br /> <br /> I do not even go with this review. The picture is very painful. Four years ago, in the pre-coded days, you'd never caught a Wim Play Kay! In true Kay Francis fashion, however, she made her best to believe in us that this woman is a trustworthy character. I give her a lot of credit to breathe some life and loyalty to this anxiety role. This character is far from the early-code ka characters and case frames spirited ke francs. <br /> Get to know this fact! There are so many good gay franchises! (From personal experience, I'm sure Dr. Mary Monica and One Way Passage are also very good that may recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Exploitation. I'm sure the other great Kay Flix is ​​as well, but I only can I recommend and recommend.)
