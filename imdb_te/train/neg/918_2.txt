However, "MacArthur" did the same producer and the same composer did the same, praying parallels, as well as the two films that were screened with generals for cadets at the West Point. It is clear to me that filmmakers are looking to mimic the Oscar winning film a few years ago. <br /> <br /> "MacArthur's next career is peek in a story that plays less dramatic than Wikipedia."
