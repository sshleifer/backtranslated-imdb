Video quality is great. The sound quality is curious. Acting is terrible. The dialog is painful. Lighting is tough. Editing is ridiculous. I have gone, but that does not mean it. Snitch'd is a movie rated enthusiastic video being issued as a movie. This store is better to collect dust in the video store bargain bin.
