One of the worst films I have ever seen. Curiosity action scene and really bad performance. Gary Bussey's episodes are only a good point but this film does not lift too much. It lives up to its B film ranking and passes the test with flying colors. While waste my money I found it fun to start with with some annoying gets its annoying. I do not recommend this movie unless you are free or looking for a gift. <br /> You can ask for a receipt and send it back for a refund. <br /> <br /> <br
