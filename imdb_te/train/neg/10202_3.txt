Murder by Numbers is one of those movies that you have made for TV-but not as expected. If Michael Pitt is moving on bigger and better things, considering the only actor of any note, the film is not surprising to replace the more important stuff from the memory. Like this ... remember to lock your front door when you go out. <br /> <br /> Bullock's personal problems (they're not all) take on the role of Cassie Mayweard. With her new partner (the damp found Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Perpes there is nothing unusual except that they have a definite murder plan and a couple of young students who think they've been executed. With the trial going on, Will's War begins between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Heywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> On both sides, the two leaders are disappointing. Bullock, though she's good to see, is certainly believable in a hard-capped cop role as Rodney Dangererfield (in fact, he'd be good!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I want to keep the film in his CV in an attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, like suspicious sneering suspects, release themselves adequately. <br /> <br /> If Dodge Leeds is not adequate, a story that shoots the picture before anyone can sleep and find the most imaginative (but real) story in the film. <br /> <br /> "Murder By Numbers" This is not entirely done, and does not rely on naked scenery even by Bullock. Well, just a little but still save it enough. Unforgettable, predictable and repetitive - a film that does not move the character that goes forward. As Cassy probably said in his next case, there is nothing to see people here. Move along, keep moving ...
