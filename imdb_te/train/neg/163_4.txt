The film is not pleasing to the front but ultimately it has become soft. Although I am a Tarturo as an actor in general, his Luzhinnen often resembles a bad Rhine Man seal and is a part of the intellectual character as a partial-autistic man. The film looks hard to try and ends with enthusiasm despite much fine performances.
