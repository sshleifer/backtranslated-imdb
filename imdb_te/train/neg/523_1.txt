It's fun to be fun today. Maybe I'm not a dinosaur from the Fifties, I'm very close to today's film, and this is obvious because most people like this movie. I found foul and obscene. I do not mention many movies in my life but it's enough for the bill. Humor is sophomoric and raw. I'm not politically correct person, and I found only homophobic (not gay) that I was not fun but confusing. The main character in the film is not just a will, but a person who likes it. Even though the film was finally disappointed in what I heard, they just looked to pay good money.
