I really mean, how could not the entire stink-ball like Charles Band Full Moon's head DEMONICUS. I mean I never got the green light to get started. The story repeats, the characters are the weakest, and there is no real story on Trinasus, then he is a bad man. Then the author or director goes his way for a bad end. It's a bad end, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes in a deadly cave, then the image of Chimera comes to life, cheap i can add her and chase her. Then she will walk home at home. A monument that was destroyed centuries ago just returned to her for no reason to collapse. I mean, it does not make sense. What a hell allowing Charles to make this pile, four different film companies disappointed the movies. When they asked me, I had good ideas then DEMONICUS. Thanks turkey.
