Eleven "great" filmmakers, eleven pieces are the worst. Eleven minutes each, sophistry, capitulation, self-joy. It deals with people of all nations. Yusuf Chahain of Egypt "hip hip hooray!" For Terrorism in his amateur section. In the green line we have an Israeli Amos Gita, his eleven minutes to show the terrorist activity and focus on the Jersey newspaper. Mexico's Alejandro Gonzalez concentrated on the twin towers of the Inner, but he forgot to turn his camera on. Seen Penn does not know that there are no buildings in the shadow of the commercial center on 9-11. Japan's Shohi Imamura will ignore the whole thing. Claude Lelch focuses on a trivial and extravagant love affair. The UK's Ken Loach focuses on Chile. Etc.
