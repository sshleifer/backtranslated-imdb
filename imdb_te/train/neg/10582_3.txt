Firstly I believe it is a TV movie produced for this movie, it is not suitable for primetime. But after a few minutes of dumb-boredom, I realized there was at least the comic value of over-the-top stunt and c-movie acting. The film earned 1 if my wife and I did not get too laddy that the actors were surprised that they could have a simple face. It is like the low-fi funny spy version of The Big Hit (I've really bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. After Nick Hagging and Highfives, we chose you to marry Elna, and not Jim. Some rum and cucklines will help to easily go down and help.
