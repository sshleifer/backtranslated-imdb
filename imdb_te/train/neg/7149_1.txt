Whoever wrote "redline" as a great car film must be paid by Daniel Sedek to promote these ultra crappy flares, pumping the pulp of enthusiastic garbage. Easily worst automotive picture or any image ever made. These showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every cheesy cliche from the 80s episode TV series, with some really great special effects and slippery characters without any relevance and Daniel Sadek to continue in the real estate business, do not. <br /> <br /> This is such a dull plot, with a lot of deterministic action sequences. The makers of this film are not called idiots but they are not criminal enough to be idiots publicly public enough to come for this trash.
