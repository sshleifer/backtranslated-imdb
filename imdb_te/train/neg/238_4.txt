Cinderella story for adults living in dreamland. Romance is very spurious, mysterious, loving dog, perfect. Cinderella storyline is very much and Shahid Kapoor is the only cause for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy love with a twist, this is exactly what you're in the movie, but the rest of us are the real world people, I'd highly recommend saving your three-hour watch time. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie amongst the five people who have seen the film with me. Spending too much time on unrealistic scenes. Maybe I did not have something .. I can not believe that a movie like this can hit the classic like HDDCS!
