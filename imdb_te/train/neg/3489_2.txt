This is my first ever, probably the last Angeloopolis film. Because I had one of my favorite actors, Maestroani, I was a movie by Theo, I heard a lot of it. First, the Albanian-Greek border had a long shot of soldiers. As well! But everything. Nothing. The film has big holes, and I do not know what to say first. The main storyline of this story is revealed to an old woman journalist. In a long hike. It's like a 15 minute monologue, killing the action and the audience's tolerance, there's nothing on screen for 15 or 20 minutes, the old lady tells a story. All that is thought to be shown by action, just the old woman is told to the camera. In a moment, the TV's preparations go to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately begin to winter! Perhaps, shot on different days, continuation revealed. The story-telling had many problems, which went from abusive to a style, asking questions to the viewers never answered. Poor masstroi, integrity or charm gave a lost character. On the other hand, many Greeks or Albanians or Balkan people agree, showing films as historical, ethnic or politically ineffective, to redraw in another review of "humanity". Most of the time, but there is no time to lose on the poor movie, it's not a movie, but a man's duplicates are impressed on the movie and pay with state money.
