Why did not they get Ed Anner but why did not the other actors instead of those who are the producers of the same church? Why did the protagonist Knoweranjan dismiss the old Sage character when he was never in danger? It makes the old guy feel murdered out of the pride of the pride and thus feel guilty to leave him with life imprisonment for a lifespan. Why I do not like the main work role and why the old guy works like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. If the D-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is a distant lover then why is no soldier any good. She has a good reason to be jealous, her hometown and protective, good reason to control her manipulative father. Not all characters intended to be loved and 'bad' boyfriend for everyone. How have they met anyway, wine broker and sal mill worker?
