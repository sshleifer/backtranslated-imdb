I'm in Iraq and is now doing the job to watch movies. We also have access to plenty of pirated films, this gem came along with 11 other movies, and this is the worst I have seen in a long time. I have seen some other reviews of the claim that this film does not take too seriously, but really, I think it's a cover up for its terrible reality. It's not the tongue in the cheek, the authors really thought they were getting better with the blade image. The film is a line on Vampire Assassin, if you do not see, I recommend. At least that movie is very unbelievable and bad, you are struggling more than you think. This is exactly the dose of any ugly properties. From bad acting, visual visualization (ie early credits), for Adobe Premier special effects. They were not able to get space for guns, but it was where the movie was to be shot, but if you want to use the effects, make them perfect. They went to the Tai Bo class and appeared to cast for the first ugly chick coming out. Once again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, the stunt does not let the folk act, they are not. Moreover, it is the comment of "Old Vampire Movies Return" ... it's not. This is exactly what new Vampire movies are about. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, are about Vampires' fighting superstar. It's new vampire style, bad blood, fake crying and cheesy on acting. Someone who has written a good review about this clearly connects the image of the cast, or friends. But what am I going to do, I paid 33 cents for it. Anytime, to shut this up, the filmmaker decided to make a film in their first semester, and I'll credit them because it's better than I could. I actually do not try so I know that I can not do movies. I know how I watch movies. I worked 12 hours a day and 6 days, I've been here for thousands of people and I'm so hoping for half an hour to mortar attack.
