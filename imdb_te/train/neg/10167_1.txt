These TV movie bad movies exist. This is one reason I have seen that it is covered on KTMA MST3K. There is a Super Bowl at Super Dome in New Orleans. Nevertheless, no football has ever played and we can not see anything if we look behind the scenes. There are many stars in this movie, it's no different. I'm not really sure why I saw this.
