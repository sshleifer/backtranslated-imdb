It was made in 2007 and is bad for a film designed in CG 1998. There is a dinosaur's stop motion shot that actually looks good on an episode of the film, but it does have a lot of interest in the CG stuff. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing, and the rest are just terrible. It may not be worse than the Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... the worst trash! Again, like other movies, it's actually only a scary part of the film and it's now being broadcast by science fiction channel. <br /> They still do not understand how they get people who have some acting skills to act in these actors and then somehow make them look like a panic in the movie. <br /> <br /> Among the people you do not know, another poster is absolutely sarcastic in his review ... or he is one of those who worked on the film.
