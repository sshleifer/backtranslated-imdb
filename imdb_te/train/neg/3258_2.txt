Dawn Savage: Browne's Man (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible film ... Based on the Pulp Magazine / Paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... Super Heroic Adventure Hero '30 and his five Helpers, all experts endeavor to allow them to combat evil. It's a beautiful hokey series ... but it's a lot fun to read when I'm a teenager. Ron (Tarzan) I know they've made a movie version of '70s' Ely ... but I do not have the chance to see it. It never played in the theaters I lived and did not show on TV. Why do I understand why I saw the movie? Plots and characters have never been treated seriously ... all kinds of tongue-in-cheek and campie ... like the old Batman TV series ... without the purpose of being funny ... flair. Carney Dialog, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, krimi action sequences and bad, bad acting. Actually, I'll find it so lovely in its evil ... what do they think? Arnold Schwarzenegger is rumored to be featured in a modern-day remake ... but I do not expect myself to be improved.
