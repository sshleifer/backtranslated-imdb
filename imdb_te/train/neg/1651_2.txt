A poor written script with no favorite characters. As it was comedy, I forgot to laugh. This is about scandalous friends who are considered to be the most important person, although it is sometimes scams (women's sex scenes) and another friend (semi-disastrous) sometimes scams. 3 friends come and meet the same woman (Amanda Peet). Something this really happens without any romance. 3 guys stop being friends as they are separately dating her. They mistaken their friendship. - A bad image
