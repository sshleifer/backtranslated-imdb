As a horror-film fan, I try to see all the important novelies of this genre, especially my local cinematic products. And I can say that "Fear of Power" (or Russian title "Wedda") is one of the weakest of them. First of all, it's not too afraid of a little boy, it's slow and predictable that there is no real horror. Why the goofy plot is bad in all points, as it is clear all the points I did not know why the Russian producers / director decided to transform the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into some dull and ridiculous modern-day thriller.The previous reviewer did not make it a bit thrill) and terrible and cheesy actors' work . All actors, including well-known celebrity veil Nikolayev and Avenzia Kruvahavas in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that and they speak their English lines without any expression, and they do not suffer from all the games. Why they shot this film in English with Russian actors in the end? I think that's their wrong turn. At least some of the Americans or English actors became more prominent in terms of convincing them. I can say about the "small American town backgrounds" shot in estonia. The only positive moment I found in "Fear Power" is Visual Effects. They are not spectacular but good for Russian film. And the music is okay, at least it does not irritate me. That is why I give two stars. Overall, if you want to see a good horror movie? This boring image does not waste your time and money. And if you're looking for a Russian horror argument I advise you to find a copy of "Spirit of Viy or Evil". It's really fantastic movie based on the same novel "Fear Power" but very, very good.
