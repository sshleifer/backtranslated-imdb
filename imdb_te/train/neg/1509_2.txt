I really like this movie rating issues. It's obviously money, brilliantly directed. Gear and Danes are serious (although her screen personality may be used a bit more defining and spicing), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it can be a yes, a help, help but the director wonder if he likes the particular screen stage, and one of those really really unhealthy movies to wonder how many copycats will inspire a movie. <br /> <br /> In totally artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really want to ask myself who these people are paying their money to produce an image ....
