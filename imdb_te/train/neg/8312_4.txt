Thumb thought was not a second time round winner. ThumbTanic is not as good as the Thumb Wars for many reasons. Mainly, I think, Mr. Oedekerk is very little to work in Titanic Send. <br /> <br /> Apart from Star Wars, the Titanic film (still?) has become a cultural myth and there are very few reflections that resonate with the audience. <br /> <br /> In thumbTanic, jokes that seem to have nothing to do with the holes really nothing. For example, the insinuation of the hero that the heroine is not clean in the "jump off of the ship" - it's not funny. Besides, you think yourself, "Do I miss something in the original film?". <br /> <br /> In contrast, the sender of the Supreme Ship designer is understandable and funny. Even the most funny demand was to send a bloke on the film that wanted to go "faster" like a maniac running around the ship * "Everything was fast" including the ship "sinking" and being the first to die himself.This kind of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and gave meaningful humor to the Dharmatik. <br /> <br /> Thumb "media", faces and voices are still entertaining. CG animation are valued and appreciated. Overall, thambtanik nirupistunnappatiki does not prove that, from time to time you can still enjoy the art, the end of the cikkipotundi.
