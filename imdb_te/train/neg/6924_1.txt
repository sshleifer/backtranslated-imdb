If the film is not at all worse, it will be directed by Vove Bol. This staggering mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. There was some time since I saw this steam pile, but I wanted to do all the woeful bodily harm to all those involved. Nobody can give this movie because everyone who watched this trip surprised everyone. I will give you a star because the rating is not low. All copies of the film should be burned with salted soil and allocated as waste toxic waste area. No need to put a copy in ultra high securities and the filmmakers should only show how to do it.
