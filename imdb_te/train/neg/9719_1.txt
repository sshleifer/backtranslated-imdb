Mommy, please forgive me, but not more than half? In the original novel, Valjean bread was a man who was imprisoned for 19 years for stealing bread and then tried several times to escape. He breaks the parole and keeps it strictly by the police inspector Javert. There are many characters that are not included in this version. Some are valued by Fantay, Cassette, M & Mme. Thanardier, Ipone, Marius, Gawwitch and Enzolras. The only alphabet with the same name is Javert. Let's see how Viktor Hugo's epic novel is about, I was confused and disappointed throughout the whole film.
