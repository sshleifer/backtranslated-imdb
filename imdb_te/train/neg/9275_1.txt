Oman IV (1991) was bad for T.V. Image. Since 80 years, since I have no reason to explain this authority, I am assuming that the officers have experimented with meeth (the choice of the 90s). Why are they embarrassed? A t.v. Movie? What do they choose when this idea comes into the board? Did they even think for a second that it would catch like this film. Perhaps they thought it could be a series? We never know. But I know one thing. This movie is the main reason why I bought the Omen trio. <br /> <br /> Oman IV is primarily an American film remake. Instead of a panther nose punk kid, we get the spooky girl who bratts the whole brace for everyone around her. If the family has stronger parenting skills, none of the demonic events that have been broadcasted in the past films. These parents need to put on their feet and do some real discipline! <br /> Do not recommend, it's best to avoid all costs!
