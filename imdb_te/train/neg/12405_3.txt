It's shame! There I am, a bag of beer and popcorn, a comfortable Muppet night in the hopping chair with the hope of a fun one. What am I doing? Disappointed! How can Muppets go from this Muppet Christmas Carol? Humor is scary, the songs are much worse than songs and Western (and say something) and the plot is confusing and poor as blind blinds. I think the main issue is that they are far off bit in an attempt to Treasure Island. The short story, like the Christmas Carol, is perfect because it is possible to weave the muppet high zinc around you .... The need to drag the plot here has stopped all the fun. Where will the Muppets go next? How about the Muppets Wizard of Oz?
