I was surprised to see that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States. It's unfortunate to see I'm correcting the shroud. I adore M. C. Beaton's books about the fabulous Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and well written. The forces responsible for this mish-mash are not explicitly mentioned in one of the Betan books. Only "Hamish Macbeth" is just a series of series. In the absence of familiar characters, I find the whole presentation accidentally loud. The actors seem to feel they should shout their lines and scream at each other. You are M.C. If you love Beaton's adorable Hamish Macbeth, you do not waste your time on this garbage.
