If you want to see a secret, do not see it. Although Elmore Leonard's elements are straight out, it is closer to an episode of "Dynasty", as the filmmaker focuses on the "development of character" - a long, boring debate between stupid and un-involved characters. Some can make lovely films without real action (see "Exoticca"), but this is not. Avoid this, especially if you like to participate in these actors.
