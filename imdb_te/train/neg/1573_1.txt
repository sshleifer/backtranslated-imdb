How the worst piece is put in this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The only actor I like is Rinehold, a accomplished actor, whose justification is justification for production. <br /> <br /> When I get nominal nomination rotten Tomato Award, this film will really feel a movie with B movies. <br /> <br /> This car should be written behind the cigarette carton. Prepared for TV movies are very painful, but it redefines the term. Check bridge operator's performance skills of pure Oscar material.
