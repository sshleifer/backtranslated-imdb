I am less generous compared to this film. The depiction of this century has always been a totally bizarre, like the different species. Their antics are not entirely fictional. Napoleon or other historical person. Or they have a fascination with chickens. They are made or beating each other. What can I do without the meaning of insight or mental illness as the script writer says? See the amazing human character in the "Cuckoo's Nest on One Flew Over", where the illnesses are reliable and true. I once worked at State Mental Hospital. I did not see these guys. These are very smart and calculate them to come to life.
