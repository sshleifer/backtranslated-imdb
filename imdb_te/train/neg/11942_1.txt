One of the worst films I've seen in a long time is definitely one! It starts badly and just degrades. Katherine Heigl is satisfied with a lolita character, and Leo Grillo is fighting a manually cardboard cutout role. With no enthusiasm only cast-mate Tom Sizemore, it hams as a villain and his character goes overboard altogether. The script is terrible, acting terrible and there are large plot holes enough to drive a double-decker bus through it! This is also the most romantic movie I have ever seen! Catherine Heigl's role is not entirely insulting. She was seen as a nasty, vicious seductor who cheated on a woman who was poor and innocent. It is her youngest film, and the message of the plot-strand refers only to the beggar's conviction! In the end, she was ridiculed (hey!), He was confused with anger and guilt, but the script allows him to kill him, thereby redeeming himself in men's eyes everywhere. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
