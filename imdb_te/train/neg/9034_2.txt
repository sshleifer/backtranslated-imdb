The story is a little slow and slightly stupid. Gret Garbo is not very good and I can not understand half the things I mentioned because of her exaggerated voice. Melvin Douglas once again plays a role that does not play a normal role, and Constance Bennett is just funny, except for a couple of funny songs. <br /> <br /> The plus side, Roland Young plays the best part in the film. He disappeared in the second half of the story and he wants to have more lines. Also, Ruth Gordon is interesting to look very young. I saw only those crazy characters from the 60s to the 80s and 80s who played a young woman. By story-telling, a stuntman performing stunning scenes in Stills, lasting a few minutes, dulles pretends to act as a walking slop. <br /> <br /> Gabbo Last movie - not box office success. It's just too drunk, about it and about cheating. It's an annoying story. Garbo also knows, and that it quit.
