I rented (yes! Paid money to see!) This movie. Oh god. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. As another reviewer says, Mrs. Kalagande, get out of the movies, please! Please do not ever appear or appear in another movie! There is an attraction of the cantelope. No, it's not fair, cantaloupe, which is probably going to get more. She does not know how to work; She influenced an annoying look all the time (remembering a lot in my always-frustrated young sisters-in-law from Europe). She is not lovely; She is not beautiful. There is no true story. And editing! Nothing, I could see! When you look at an image, it's very bad, to get through it, press "Forward Forward" in your remote and STILL will not occur! I mean! ..... shouting unconsciously, "cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and get paid to make love on the screen! Good deal for them; A pretty raw deal for the viewer! I think I'll throw it now ....
