No terrible writing and acting. No personality. With no single character you can not make a good movie? <br /> This child goes on a tour to see his father. Kid, Jason, takes up an airplane and the pilot dies of heart attack and the middle flight. So the kid was crashed in a lake and lived. He lives in the wilderness until he is protected. <br /> At the time, he fights two bear. For the first time he fights in the lake. The second time he puts a knife and a bear with a knife. The two shots of fake blood from Bear's chest remind me of Monty Python's "The Holy Grail". <br /> <br /> The kid decides to abandon a piglet to bring obesity results. Gag.
