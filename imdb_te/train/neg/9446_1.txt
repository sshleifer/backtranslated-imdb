A completely outrageous adaptation of the wonderful children's book. The book (3-8) yr old age makes for a sickening side story about the crude and inappropriate humor, some scary episodes, and a sickening side story about the boy's boyfriend who wants to send him to a military school to get him out. Do not waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
