The second attempt by a New York intellectual, less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - is the first of Susan Sondag's "Brother Karl" results (built in Swedish, lesser Swedish actors!)? The Oscar Wilde's "Old Curiosity Shop", in reference to Dickens, says the best: "One Little Nell would have a stone heart not scream at death." Here's a good thing. "Interiors" Chok, who works at full range of serious spies. ("I'm afraid of my anger": "I'm not changing.") The quotes in the director's direction (in a civilized term) are close to parody from Bergman. Most self-involved family members turn to remember us of how clever and skilled they are. ("Oh I'm an old verse, which I've worked for.") This is not about people, however, I found them very happy. The dialogue is pretty much like funny stuff from Allen's previous Bond films - because he's directed his actors lines play directly. He did not star in the film, but poor Mary Beth copied all of these theses tags, intonations and narrative habits and changed her as an awkward surrogate (as Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> Basic plot - quietly domineering mother dysfunctional family - Existential angst has been much more or less from the Bergmann's "Winter Light," as the basic family dumped up the play-off. It comes in the shop scene / aural trick: scratches the pencil of the pencil on the paper and the surfacing surfacing people walking on the beach. <br /> <br /> Allen's subsequent "serious" films are very awkward, but very fun. I'll take "Interiors." Woody is rarely a ridiculous movie.
