The film can be a good horror movie. The main character is decently done and I feel sorry for him and has a good amount. However, the rest sucks. Director Immanuel is very inefficient in film production. <br /> <br /> - random sequences of random images are dispersed across the couple. I do not know if he tried deep and brilliant and poetic but he was not. It's stupid. Random shots of the trailer are driven by the main character, random buildings, random pan shots of buildings, random cat. WTF? And the clouds. <br /> <br /> He really liked this technique to cut a scene into a different shots rather than just a continuous shot. EX: The guy is trying to light his brace and camera rings around him. Instead of just one shot, he edits like 10 different shots so he really is EDGY! And hip! And smart! Stupid. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrific but the movie is very fun. And the scarecrow he revolves and spins and turns all the time a gymnast. And some deaths are good. You'd expect the main row to have a long-built death. A simple corn in the ear. Love is hot. Luxury. Why this picture gets a 2.
