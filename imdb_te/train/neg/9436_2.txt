The general plot of the early 80s slasher trend follows unhinged. Pretty Young Girls in Peril. I have to give it for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for early road-trip shots, and you really think it's the second time that the product is quality. Seeing "Allied" is like watching an amateur acting class warm. Some of the most awkward, ill-fired, overlapping scenes are played with the pleasure of a high volume dose. Thinking of why do not they just put the camera cue-cards so actresses are not constantly switching their gaze. Two mainstream girls have clearly chosen for their T & a talented instead. The main chic is as wonderful as watching Laurel Monson's Perry powder. Two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill. The crazy / creepy daughter and mother chicks like Janet Penner and Virginia Settle have found themselves to compete for the worst acting. Long interruptions, bizarre expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, we all enjoy it for those who love everything and those who love it. The scenes suddenly change with blacks, you can drive through a mock truck. The cartoon lightning crashes across the shots without difficulty to show the sky. Eight eyeshadow will attack the viewer. But I know, it grew to me. I'm sorry. I wanted to embrace it, it's better to kiss the Bo-Bois. The finish is not made for the damage caused to it but I grinned anyway. I have my own theories about the whole "banned" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film will have considerable material misuse and humor. Otherwise pass.
