I am a lover of B movies, give me genetically modified bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for your movies to keep thinking about what's happening in your world. Even a Stupid B movie usually makes me laugh and I still consider it a good thing. I then warned others because I had to register with IMMB. The first was the science of creating shark-man, the film was just touching. They concluded that they had blood every few minutes to make the audience more interested. At the time of the attack, the camera took off from the attack but you threw a bucket of blood clear to you to tell you that the attacks were bloodthirsty and that the person was probably dead (special effects). Returning to science, I felt that the woman was naked in examination and I needed to have the test equipment supervised by their breast tissue. Anyway, this film is a poor plot development, terrible story, and pretty bad acting. Even William Farsie, Hunter Tyle or Jeffrey Combs can not save this sticker.
