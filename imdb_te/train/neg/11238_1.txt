Reading the box at the video store will make you unhappy with this film. You know the type .... funny but you are supposed to intimidate .... This is not funny or horrific. The writing is sluggish ... jokes have failed to laugh at me on a tremendous foundation .... They predicted. Actors did not do much with such a good script ... At least I think it's not their best. I see this film at your own risk .... I will give you negative 3 stars
