I think Cliff Robertson is definitely one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics for his credit. He's fine here as heavy, but the direction is too bad and maximum wave, it's never marked off. The story begins to wonder how my wife will be able to hang him. Yet he carries along well mugs and things. Two times the death heel. First of all, if you have to take the time to walk from one room to another to another, you will eat three times in the movie. Add to that, Robertson's character can sit on the couch in blue light and add another part of the chaos. I agree with a half hour bang and said that it made the small film even though it's very beautiful. The biggest weakness is just an improved plot, when all is said and done, leaves excellent questions. I'm not putting it in spoilers, but it ends, do not think so much. I can come up with ten watts without a sweater. It's fine if it's a ghost story.
