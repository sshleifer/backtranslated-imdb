Give the quick summer of the film: A rotten, cruel kid stuck in a radio called Kaz on the radio: a rapping genie. Like all genes, he grants 3 best wishes, but he is good-natured, helps Max with his personal life, he has to deal with harassment and a murdered father. At all times, Kazam has been occasionally raps (exhibiting shock's tough rap skills). <br /> <br /> This film proves that we know everyone: athletes must adhere to sports. I have never been seen as an Oscar-worthy film, but everything about this waste is terrible. The characters are incomplete or stupid, the plot is not even valuable, the dialogue is a joke, and just a piece of shock problem. Although Hell, Denzel Washington has played a casual, the film is still joking. At that time the shock was too big (because no Panmaina) was because he knew where the movie was. I honestly can not think of a single positive thing to tell about these waste of time. Shock should use the time used to make this movie free of charge.
