This is still good even though it is "better" than the first Mulva (which I can not say anyway, I would rather watch the paint dry). Please help with anything from these low budget pictures guys. I'm buying some DVDs that support some indie filmmakers and I do not regret it. Some have officially been "released" (and not bailed out from filmmakers) and they can not even list all badly. They avoid popping up in other small indie movies as they avoid teen aph or bonejack. If you are friends of these guys, you have opportunities in their movies and make them fun. But for those who have to see them? There is no chance. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad storyline ... etc. These are not even funny. I've given it a 2 because Debbie is in Rochen. Maybe 2 is not even eligible. If you want a good budget movie, choose something from LBP's "Friends" while on the Freak Productions or stocks like Mark Jenkins, which is really good.
