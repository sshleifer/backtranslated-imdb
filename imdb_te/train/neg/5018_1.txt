I rented the film to see Amber Benson after reading the movie, but I thought it was a good story ... but the first problem is not actually a story ... or actually a story but it is not completely understandable. The second problem was not set for these characters ... Yes, they all went to school together, but in the first three minutes they realized that they were not normal and did not like each other ... why they did not keep getting together. Error number 3 ... The director has long been inches and tight camera shots are suspense equal (especially dubbed with remarkable suspense music) ... he sinned. It's sad that trying to bring back the life of an amazing actress like Amber Binson. The money she made here is to produce her own film.
