It's funny. I saw a group of fussbinder films and I found some to be very creative and interesting, others are repulsive and self-fulfilling - like this film. For me, it will be in the middle of the great trash - for the most part in the middle. I know he has many fans in "sophisticated", but I can not help but feel his appeal is a very pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I'll get a lot of negative ratings for this), he has made so many movies very quickly and is very self-indulgent. His homosexual or gender-bending images (such as) are very bad - sometimes very boring (such as Querlle and Petra van Cantor's Bitter Tutors) and sometimes just bulky (like this film). Is not it better than having a person's gender-confusion approval in his message? Then, perhaps, I'd care about the pictures - show some sensitivity for the subject and make your characters more human and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I am honest after watching this film, I may not be faced with the fanbinder films - good - good.
