I am an environmentalist for years and really looking forward to this program. I set up to record the episodes because I thought I had learned some great new things. <br /> I'm sure this looks like a reality show and will appeal to the viewer's class. <br /> <br /> This program is called nagging with Rachel. <br /> <br /> Since Ed is a great font of information, perhaps a really serious second impression about the weather is a good idea. Dirt down things do not need some of us. <br /> <br /> I can not see episodes or episodes anymore, but let me know if it's true green show.
