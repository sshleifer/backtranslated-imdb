Jason Lee deals with his best to make fun of a crazy situation, but the film failed to connect just one. <br /> <br /> Julia Styles is characterized by cousin and sexy looks awkward. <br /> <br /> She and Selma Blair's characters must act in opposite directions. <br /> <br /> The film is another Hollywood trivalization to capture the real world situation (with your trousers without snooping into your bachelor party) <br /> <br /> Some laughs are perfect and the cast (unfortunately) is their best Doing the job, this is its indelible factor. Instead of getting a successful Ranch Fest (ie on the Animal House or American), we remain part of the humor and part of the stupid middle class (Alma Meatballs 2 or something).
