I often thought that Ludlum's work and covert-a big fan of the book, and how much they would be made in the film. Imagine my enthusiasm knowing that such a film is actually in existence! The series first appeared to be a clear place to start the 'Hades Factor'. <br /> <br /> From the beginning the picture is frustrating. Common features from the film like Griffin's first meeting with Smith are different from the book and are much cheerful. Most characters are very cast. For starters Dorff is as painful as Smith. A bad actor, he was very soft, and failed to demonstrate John Smith's deterministic many features. <br /> Reusing, re-entering, and exclusion Some characters have further reduced the film. For example, the removal of Victor Tr√©mont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of Waxham, is somewhat hazy. Marty Zelberg is a big part of the book, and another big mistake in the seat is that he does not have much to do with the back seat (no matter what the character does not play in the role of the book). <br /> Rachel Russell can be thought of in this book by Randy Russell. She was not the sister of Sophie Olds (sister Sophia Russell), but she also had to work from the CIA, NOT "Covert-One". It brings me to my ultimate point, and I think it is one of the most important. COVERT-ONE is not at this time! The second book of this sequence is not the same as the preventive measure against biological terrorism, the Covert-One, which was created by the President. <br /> I'm going to go all day long to be honest. In short - if you like books and want to see a good follow up, you will be discouraged. It is very low as an action movie, lacking too little and poor effects. The tale of the tumultuous tales in the movie's cheaper coffin and the slush last nails in the slum-water.
