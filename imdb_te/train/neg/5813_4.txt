Tearney is an authentic tough guy, but it usually has a bad effect from the talented RKO, which reduces its effect on every turn. This script is credited as OJ Simpson at a ten summers dinner. Tyurny's unbelievable car mates calculate times slippery lame after another for his escape and violent actions. The old clich√© about it is "only in movies" where spades are applied. Then there was the man playing the watchman, who will be wandered from a powdery WC Fields comedy, destroying terrible mood on the show. Do not help steady a room sets either, and there is no clear lack of feel for the director Feist's material. Then do not add the final car chase to two fantasies and pay-off and flat out the results. In fact, the film was cut only in the scenes of the station house, where the hard-faced cops were found to have the hidden conclusions of the innocent-looking gas station attendants. Tieney's career was never really gelled too bad. I have been heavily gifted as a Guys of Screen and the other is being collected in a morothy afterwards. Lee Marvin reminded me at times at his tough-guy best in his icy manner and emotional clarity. However, this project may work as a radio play, but as a film with a good Nair title, this is a disappointment.
