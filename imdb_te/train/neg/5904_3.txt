With the marvelous success of "God's Army", every mammon with a camera is now trying to make a movie. In the case of "Other Side of Heaven" recently, this is not a bad thing. That movie, not great, is very good. "Singles Ward", not like. <br /> <br /> The story of a teenage, divorced Mormon guy is a "Singles Ward" story of Telling's single "Singles Ward" and a style of shooting is akin to the 80s, similar to the comedy "Ferris Bueller Day Off". However, the similarities end there. "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original, and well-played (though not quite as stupid as ever), the singles ward is entirely opposite. It's very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags come in stereotypes and jokes are flat or you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% will be thrown in to fill the time. <br /> <br /> Mormon culture is very familiar, or if you do not have much Mormon, you do not have anything. At all. "The Army of God" and "The Other Side of Heaven" are appealing to a wide spectator in the Mormon Church and beyond, the film is definitely a big joke, and if you get it, that is not funny.
