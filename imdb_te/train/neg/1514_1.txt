<br /> <br /> My girlfriend Richard Gear wanted to see only this. <br /> I think my time and money are wasted. Let's look at the movie, because some of the actors / actresses. I hope I learned her lesson, because she is in her seat. Since I have already paid, I want to see at least the end, I will do some good things with hope, but I can not keep my breath and luckily I'm the victim of this movie <br /> It's not black and white, it is black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as her registrars, and has been portrayed as hard-line criminals not recognizing all sexual criminals, and bad people are really bad. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's performance is good but elegant girl who wants to be replaced is the best of luck. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a dubious, cheap, dramatic and sensational turn. They use sex offenders as an excuse to sink into murders, vigilante beating, rape and harassment - almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In this movie, no one in America can go out and direct to the DVD. It could have been in other countries, but they had to show it because of Hollywood and Richard Gears. Believe me, without the gear, the image itself is not worth the B-series.
