This film is going to be misinterpreted by the life of man. His business was unsuccessful, and he could not influence his wife despite many trials. <br /> <br /> Plots are full of chaos. It just does not make sense. Of course, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is very small, I can not understand. This is a shame, because the sets and clothes are going well, and visually impulsive. The shots are well shot. However, these ransom features are still not designed to tell bad storyline and poor story. I am surprised by the big names that have been accepted for the film. This is their talent is such a waste. This image is very bad. Avoid this !!
