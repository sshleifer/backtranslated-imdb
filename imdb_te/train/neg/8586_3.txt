What a disappointment ... The acceptance of the prequels is fine, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realized and tacked together enthusiastically. There are many persistent deficiencies that have been appreciated by the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader is a legendary moment in modern films that has been a terrible thing that has been ridiculed for many years now. I do not complain about the bizarre conversation like Star Wars ... The original three films have style, fiction and cracking stories, and added a strange dialogue appeal. The prequels are shallow efforts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. It's totally frustrating.
