I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started making some of the most amazing boring cartoons I've ever seen. I laugh at you all this little one, it's bugs bunny cartoon for Christ! Bugs Bunny is not boring, cartoons are not always funny! This smallest is combined with Bugs Bunny as Good Night Elmer (another exciting boring jones). <br /> <br /> Remember the first warning of a dull cartoon is not always a gag payment. Good Night Elmer was boring because it never pulled the same two gags ever with predictable payment. On the other hand, this cartoon is plagued by a second warning sign of a disappointing cartoon: There are so many conversations. The cartoon has its sleeve up to at least two gags, but most of them seem more than they are dialog's immense padding thanks. At one time, Elmer feasted dinner and commented, "It's just owl good," perhaps a very exaggerated conversation I had heard in the cartoon (in the latter time Woody Woodpecker cartoons were not counted in my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes, 20 thanks to this recurring dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> Elmer Pet Rabbit is not a fun cartoon for me, but if you sell your soul to cheek, Jones and he can not accept some clunkers in his career, you may have fun.
