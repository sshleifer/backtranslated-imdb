<br /> <br /> After watching "Paris, G TAIIM", the film was very promising and I had a lot of expectations, but I was disappointed for many reasons. I'm looking forward to the same rebuilding of 'Paris' in New York. I break the neighborhoods about 'Paris'. You understand the style of each directors and the story they should tell. In NY, the stories in this film are not clearly separated, the characters from different stories led each other, and I was confused about what I was seeing and what exactly was going on. <br /> <br /> Another thing I loved about the film 'Paris' was different on love. It's not all romantic. There is love between parents and their children, unrequited love, the love of a lonely and middle-aged women for love, which explores several layers of love complexity among humans. 'NY' went for an experimental, over-the-top sexuality. There are some rewriting stories (Julie Christie's tiny span of life with the old couple), but the overall 'my' film does not induce me any emotion. I did not connect with any characters like I did with 'Paris'. I see 'Paris' and a deep sadness, loneliness, anxiety, anxiety, and a surprise ... I have a lot of soul. <br /> <br /> If the 'Pors' goes beyond my brain, I can not think that it has gone. I was more optimistic, but I was disappointed as 'self-titled' by Paris, Jay T'm.
