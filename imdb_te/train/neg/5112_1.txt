El Al .... Yes, it's heartfelt and some unfortunate families are adopted by ABC / Sears and have "renewed their home." Manual appeal ends. <br /> <br /> The ten essential families with lots of goodies are given relatively luxurious homes for each family that is involved in each episode in this exhibition. . Humanity for humanity should shake heads with disbelief. For example, does a healthy sixteen year old boy need to have Jacuzzi in his bedroom or cheat his bed with "less rider" hydraulics? Mom really did not need her wrecked, but running and old pickup truck was restored and "pimped" by some of the best customizers in California? A new job was very graceful, and possibly a third of the price. Do people really need sixty-five inch plasma screen in every living room? And then there is a problem who will pay the increased asset taxes and utility bills. After "makeover" zaniacs on vacation, someone still earn a living. <br /> <br /> This performance is not more than grabber for ABC, a soft commercial trade for its sponsors.
