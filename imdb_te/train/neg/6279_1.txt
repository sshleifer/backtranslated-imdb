<br /> <br /> Usually something your looking does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Today, women walk on a daily routine everyday routine everyday. She is her own car. She followed her and had many incidents during her and her family. <br /> <br /> I have been seriously criticized about this film. Acting was great, the events were great, but this story brought it somewhere - it was superbly added and changed to a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure the heroine is trying to make this attempt by answering your questions but this film is what you have asked, just what happened 1 hour 20 minutes. /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> They have this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind glass) that come into our world and kill us. It does not elaborate everything in the picture, you never know how it will happen or you never know when and when it happened. Nothing was mentioned during the film. The main character is not even the main character. At the end of the cinema it is finally out and runs away (her sisters lover) to be the main character but the sin will last 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, but you did not waste your time. I feel like this again.
