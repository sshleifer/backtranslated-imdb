There is nothing to know about the movie or the best selling book. Based on anticipated from the earliest scenes, I learned from the best estimate, buried wealth and mortality list. The film is doubtful. You do not like how bad the plot and acting are, but those who have given more than two stars must work with filmmakers. I saw the hospital until his way to the Corvette. He was hospitalized in his suit, shirt and tie jeans and hospital. Not even continuity. When I got the Christian theme, it's hard to miss.
