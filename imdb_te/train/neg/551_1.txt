I'm going through a list of top 100 comedy AFIs, and this must be one of the worst ones. Not 90 films in the list I have not seen, but not any movie I've seen. Drunks are sometimes not funny, dudley. Liza has done something worthwhile, but oh ... if you want to see her better if she wants to get an arrested development watch. Seriously, dudley laughs, drinking is funny I would recommend almost any other film on AFI's top 100 comedians to do more than this. If you want to see a ridiculous "drunk", try The Sun Man. Fannier film is usually a movie of the Marx Brothers kills (especially if you drunk as Arthur).
