Let's start by saying I try not to put too much spoilers in this. Usually I enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this gem is not one of them. This is a breathtaking thriller. The night listener is anything but. The first day of the theater to be obscure was 6 people, 2 went out for good reason. The film is poorly written and directed in my opinion. Acting is good but there is nothing to work again. The film is a movie storyteller who reads a good book for the dead boy. * Enter the spooky here * No one can verify the presence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin and finds the author and finds all the boys that he has taken from the child caretaker's head and excuses. It's there, everything. You wait about one and a half hours and the movie ends. It has a lot of thrills and chills as the Dentist's Office tour. Homosexuals, or overtones, have not really done anything with this story, and the film has a slight obscenity, but it certainly seems to be thrown there for no reason. In the end, I can not write a good review because it is not as attractive as looking at the paint powder. I gave it to 2 because it's nice to be worth it and it's not directed by Uwe Boll.
