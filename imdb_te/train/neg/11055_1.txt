I saw this movie in High Definition on Television. <br /> <br /> I am in a wheelchair due to neuropsychiatric disorder and want to see some images of people with physical disabilities. <br /> At first I realized that the main character was somewhat noble and attractive. His message and lifetime about disabled people were to identify the disabled and to join the mainstream community job market. And my problem is not the real person who made these things. He is a great man. <br /> <br /> The film is utterly hypocritical and it is dramatically contradictory to the message in the campaign, which I found to be insulting. <br /> First, no one is the actual physical disability. They are absolutely genuine to teach about the actors, but the disabled appointment and are not actually disabled hashing for anything in the film. When a person sees a scene in the picture, a person appears to have only one leg, which runs towards the podium on crutches. But in this scene CGI is so obvious that it's shy. What? Can not find any real entrepreneur anywhere for the film? Is there more financial sound to do CGI effects than just a ACTUAL anomaly for a 5 second shot? <br /> <br /> In that film, I found it to be fraudulent and totally against the message, I said I came here for insurrection and I hate the curiosity.
