I think it's a "mountain" propaganda "Lord Motion Picture"? When the "dinosaurs" costume was dressed up and I hugged the song "Hard Rock Hallows" I hate the song. When the "Dark Flores" is out of the hospital, there is a young autistic girl who has discovered her when she saves the rest of the people in the special elevator, and she is surprised to find out that there is nobody on their floor. The hospital is empty ... Except the many monsters that seem to be hunted for the obvious cause ... They are run by hallways and stairs, all band members of the heavy metal band have their unusual, shock-rock dress ... here's the most difficult, lace acting, gore / The lack of nudity and the totally shameless promotional edge, "KISS Meet the the Phantom of the Park" reminds me very much. Yes, remember that daddy? I Wish Not ... I recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House movies like a fungus and they can not hear the Lord from a Gwar ripoff band!
