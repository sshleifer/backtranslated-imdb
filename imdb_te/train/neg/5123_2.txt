It's 90% of the high-profile reviews all have "* random username *" from "United States" (any state of pride ??), all of which are more or less accurate with the same grammar style as all the movies lack the complete completion of the taste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> I'm a Christian and true true movie fan. It's good to say that good films, from good to bad, and that Giant Facing is actually not a good movie. It has good intentions, but I fail to meet many (any) basic standards associated with a quality film experience. <br /> Acting: The most terrible, the best is the best. <br /> <br /> The Dialogue: Clumsy, Cheesy, Script, comes as the longest version of some Cheesy Skeet performed on Sunday School or Youth. Group function. Rave Review Robots are praised by the lack of "meaningless words", but the coldest truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and it's a complete lack of touch. Let's just have a lot more to say than a team's average ol 'head coach in a state championship game "oh NO!" When things are not going his way. <br /> Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. Commented that the film was not "Hollywood Cliche", and pulled straight from the underdog sports movie making for dummies (including a quasi-romantic subdomain for ladies) and cut it off the paint coat just as Christian background. When I say that I have almost every major part of both the plot and the sublet, I'm not lying or bothering. <br /> Direction / Editing: It is almost the same after simple underdog sports. Cinematic template. <br /> <br /> The message: Ask Jesus and He will grant you all the best wishes. Some part of me hopes that this will end in the team's final defeat to finish the film, "in the real world, because if you fail at one point or another, if we lose, we praise you" overall and it's good for it to prepare. But in the world of giants, if you fail, clearly someone is screwed up or cheated. Another interesting question is, if the Eagles get into another group of religions? Are they trapped in an endless loop of sublime plays and last minute saving, or the universe just exploded? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: Hardcore Conservative Christian parenting is a movie-building that will be another average-at-best Christian film holding a stage as the preferred model for the Giants faced, for a group lamenting the evils of Hollywood. For everyone else, looking at something from boredom to a red wish. And a warning: Any attempt to show it to non-Christians is not for conversion, but mockery. I give two stars, one eye is not my eyes, and one for the basic technical skills in a lower budget.
