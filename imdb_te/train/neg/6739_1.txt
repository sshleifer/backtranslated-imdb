Will anyone try to reconstruct the successful movie plots already seen in the film? "Wedding Date" is the best example of why not try to remake a new story in the pursuit of a new story, which separates it alone. If such a project goes ahead with the big hancos approval, all the big stars and glossy product values ​​go, so people come to the stars. <br /> <br /> The comedy takes this misleading effort. The problem is that the screen writers seem to change the story to London for the story, primarily as a normal American situation, which is also not corrected. Then there is a problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney? <br /> <br /> Without any controversy at the start of Kate and Nick, the director was not as well portrayed as their creator. This imaginable story comes for Cat Nick, and feels for vice versa. Amy Adams, the best property in the "jubug", appears to be a bad girl who is ready to tell her that she is lying and that she does not clean up the person she loves and is going to marry her. <br /> For those who are interested, credit for up to seven minutes at the end of the film!
