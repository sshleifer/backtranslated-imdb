With a title like this, you know that you can not expect a great horror movie. But it also has very low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped culprit wears a Halloween mask, so he thinks he's the other for everyone around him. This joke may actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not in the whole movie! The actors are not that bad, but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and clear stupid. No suspense, no excitement and a little gore (very cheap). Satan attempts to combine a little assistant horror (...) comedy and dramatically fail. It was very boring at the end, and I was really late 10 minutes ago. I can not see what happened. Amanda Plummer is great in Pulp Fiction, but she has not been good since 13 years ago. Wonder that she would sink less like this piece of garbage .. Avoid or be warned ..
