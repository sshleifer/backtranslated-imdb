This film sucks. Acting sucks, the script sucks, and the whole picture sucks. <br /> <br /> The film did not develop two threads and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was going on. <br /> I'm not saying that you will find things that are happening and you're told what they're like. Examples: <br /> The hero's negative comments about the hero. The audience does not know what he knows about whom and how she is related to her future death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> We did not think we wanted our time because we gave it to 3. It was fun in the bad-mouth movie while looking at it, which at least entertained us. ;-)
