<br /> <br /> The film is a special type of sausage with big basses, big dialogues and drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " They are very stupid scenes when the Kenyans show Jokers, especially Sharath. <br /> <p> Rajiv Roy is okay job is good music, only 1 song is working and it's good last hurricane camera-work <br /> <br /> Like Sunny Deol The scenes are ridiculous, Nazir alright heroines pure maestro Amrish Puri is not even half as horrible as he is on TRIDEV,
