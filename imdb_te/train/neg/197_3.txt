While a great James Arness is Western, this film has gone down as the worst Alamo film ever made. The story is terrible, erroneous, and just blurred with lies! The sequel is broadcasted to four winds. Will anyone catch the artillery line? Mexicans have enough superstitions to fire the hulls, which mud and pipes still come out of the tubes. Come on! Then Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Costumer is away or something. Or from their minds!
