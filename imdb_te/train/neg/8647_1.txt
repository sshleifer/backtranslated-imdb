Amateur in depths. The camera work is particularly tired - the documentary camera operator does not need to spin around all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really inane, and the acting is even worse. On top of that, the story is confusing and mending - with some gaping holes in logic. On one occasion, he wants to throw in the prison to rub the shoulders with suspected Al Qaeda operatives, so get an interview with Osama. As a result of many errors, the story is totally unbelievable. "Filmmaker" / The main character really depicts a bush, idiot frat boy. Actually, the only thing interested in is that the filmmakers are actually in the film. <br /> Who raised funds for this trash?
