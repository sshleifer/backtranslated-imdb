Because the story is not acceptable, the film is no more than 10 out of 5 stars because it is behind George Lucas, and its title includes "Star" and "Wars". Those who made clear films with the best story, writing and acting were insulting and credible to the filmmakers who were interested there. This is a mockery. <br /> First things first. Story. Anakin's evolution? Nothing. There is nothing but a slight odor, not a little around the eyes. He becomes Darth Vader, a young, stupid, confusing Anakin skyscooler in a blow. What is consistent about Darth Vader in the original series is his intelligence, everything he did, planning, fighting, and how good you name it. His constant stupidity is the only constant thing about Anakin who realized in the prequel trilogy. <br /> <br /> Which part of the Pulpatine Emperor who claims to be his legend of the Sipai does not refer to the emperor as Sith? <br /> <br /> Many digital doubles have been used in this movie. Everyone is flying in a doll house to choose a doll like Teddy bears. <br /> <br /> In a special fighting sequence, Op-Van and Anakin, both in the Climatic War, both actually rebecci, inches, sometimes spin out their pruning, stopping between parameters and cracks. <br /> <br /> "All conversations are of great quality, like Ivan McGregor and Natalie Portman I can not say good things about this film, but there are no special effects, the story holes and the characters that are bigger than the center of the universe. <br /> <br /> We know Lucka and Leah's brother and sister, we know that we have lost the limbs. We know Luca Anakin's son, we know that Obi-Wan and Yoda go to exile, we know everything, nothing new in this movie. <br /> <br /> But Ankon is eventually Darth Vader Will, and then he asks Padma, and when she died, he returns to the awkwardness of his hands and shouted "Nooooooooooooooooooooo." B- picture the scene screamed all the way, and I have no time, "Robinson Dancer, Danger," is expecting to go to Darth Vader. This is the same. A B-film disguised with a huge budget and the basis of an ultra-loyal fan base that resolves anything now that the first two films have reduced their criteria to Earth's pits.
