The Collagen course is even worse than the typical "bad white man corporate capitalism" of the week. The film is less fun than a tooth. Jay Leno can work. He was a good face in his infamous first film, The Silverbars, in which he gave the performance of his character's demands. This film is a very bad Leno character, a sacred buffoon, is less annoying than Morita's character, a sacred fool.
