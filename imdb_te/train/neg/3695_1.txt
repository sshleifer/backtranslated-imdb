The actors' films are not the best. The director is concentrated on the actor's actor, rather than a good actor. He can enjoy himself as a hero, his family and his honest fans. But it's not worth it for neutral audiences. Combat sequences are a total comedy. Dance movements are curious in the song sequences. Music average. The film is the biggest failure of the actor. Despite the film's hype created on the film, the film has failed miserably. Do not even think of looking at this move if you want to kill time. You can see some cartoon instead. Good cinema buff 2/2 hours is not the worst digestion.
