No, I'm not kidding. If they ever proposed a movie idea, they should be removed from the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same and they just travel to foreign locations, they have a problem that they can easily solve, getting new buddies, hoping to get popular. Think about it. If you see a movie with a different story, please contact me and tell me its name. These "movies" are poor to go on TV and go to other countries. Because movies never go to theaters. I'm sure when I was really young and made some O.K In movies, some studio owners purchased their rights for 15 years or so, so they can now make films in other countries when they use studio money for 17 years. Stay away from Mary-Kate and Ashley! Your own good!
