Bela Lugosi is a crazy mad scientist who uses bricks to steal the essence of life for elderly wife. Midget is happy in this film !! Very strange, plus a lot of padding and no plot will make this film watching a nightmare. I liked how all the pieces were eventually integrated into the typical Hollywood fashion. <br /> In general I'd like to score bore bricks like this one less, but added just enough self-esteem and entertainment to get a couple more points in the midget.
