"In 1955, Tobias Sherebroum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. A year later he walked out of the forest ... naked, it took 45 years to go back." Supposedly, "Keep the river on your right" "There is a modern cannibalism story". In fact, anyone looking for some sense of cannibalism is sadly disappointed. The first half of the film is like a log of the New Guinea, which is largely referring to local art. The second half depends on the photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but it really is about it. Except for the course, you are introducing a Jewish wedding images, or Sinkirbaum, to his former male lovers. I will give it. Big disappointment and really "the story of modern cannibals." - MERK
