A very silly movie, Stupid is filled with a linear and Jewish references. It was a serious film but did not take seriously. Known movie ... being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A deadly subplot involving Kim Bosinzer. Very robotic and very regiment. I saw that Al Pacino's performance abilities are going downhill. The troubleshooter is troubled, but nothing more awkward than the Pacinos terrible Atlanta voice. Damaged control is required to fix the damage of this image. Okay, my liners are bad, but not as bad as it is in this film. This film is not only boring but rebellious. A rebel movie is usually viewable for wrong reasons. This movie is not worth watching. I've been sitting and managed by this. If the plot is a tad bit better, perhaps a slightly better performance and a ridiculous subpoot, and even jokes jokes, this thriller can pull out of the stagnation. What we are left is a dull, silly movie made sure that drunk into our heads that Eli Varman is Jewish. Everywhere there is good Jewish folk.
