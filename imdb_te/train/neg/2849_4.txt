Comparison between the film and 'The Last Dribble' is made by some, but 'Chasers' varies depending on the narrative of the Interstate Highway in western Texas. And the scenery in the desert is nothing more to separate, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts at this time. No one in the cast did not come well; This is not surprising with the lip scripts. Dennis Hopper, director, does not give much space in this regard if he ever wrote a history, I do not think.
