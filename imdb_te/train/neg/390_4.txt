I liked Apprentice in the first two seasons. <br /> Now with Season 5? <br /> <br /> I like the show, but it has become Donald Trumps own ego fes. You are granting its company to work, but come! <br /> <br /> When I saw this program, I would not want to work for him. He is not proud, papomas or similar. This is unrealistic and the move moves me in the way he handles things. Good entertainment? YES, but gets tired so tiring as stabbed back .. its team work, its not personal, its just business. See Jack behind you.
