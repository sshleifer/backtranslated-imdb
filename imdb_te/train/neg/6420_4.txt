Well, I can not agree that it was a very happy and good start, but it just dropped down, I could not even believe that the script was about 5 minutes later in Sarah Michelle Geller's movie, the only reason I really sat in the whole movie, I want to see the twist at the napkin, and my surprise If you are one of the folks, you can also confuse you Paragraph leaves, and then the role of credit, which is what the hell I am? It does not deserve a theater run, I'm sorry, but it's not terrible, it just gave me some reasso 4 because it has some jumpy parts ... it's! You can see it, not you're saying, hey you may or even love it! But if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
