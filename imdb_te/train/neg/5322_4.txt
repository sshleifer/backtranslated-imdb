There were two types of music in the 1950s. First you have glossy MGM productions with big names and great music. And then you have a small league with less popular cast, less popular music and second rated directors. 'The girl can help it' belongs to the second category. No Tom Evell or Edmund O'Brien is not famous and Jane Mansfield is famous for her ... well, never minded. Every decade has a share of Bo Derek's or Pamela Andersson. The plot is also a razzarbad, and it is suspected that most of the Fouts Domino, Little Richard, or an attempt to sell the records appearing in rock films in the 1950s. If you appeal to the music, it's worth watching. If not, do not bother.
