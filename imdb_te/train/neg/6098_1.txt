Scotty (Grant Kramer, who will star in the great B-film "Killer Cloves Outdoors") agrees to help the three middle-aged boys learn how to learn the dialog in this 'bad' 80s comedy. 'It's not as bad as in the 80s, it's good. Badly bad. The favorite characters like "Friday 13th Part 2", a freakist who is looking, but not limited, is a girl that drives men, then she touches herself, and the tokens fat slab, after all, a '80s romantic comedy is without a fat slob ? Well this is both. The film is good for the 80s sex comedy barrel. <br /> <br /> Where am I seeing: Comcast musical
