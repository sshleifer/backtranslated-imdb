I saw this sluggish waste in HBO's comedy channel, so I thought it was very innocently and clearly this comedy. But funny is not exactly here. A good cast was mainly wiped out in a script that was written with my left butt-cheek - which was infamous for 15th century incisional abuses. The first half is particularly bad, because I've seen it a very slick and meaningless conversation for a while and zero comma to talk to zero plot. Stars like Ivan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little picture, and the movie still has less than 1000 votes on this site and everything should be told to you. <br /> People who wrote it are lying around good connections (family connections, up to) and / or plenty of cash.
