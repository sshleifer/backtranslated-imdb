Looking at its popularity, this film was very disappointing to me. Perhaps I look forward to much more from this film. After all, it is one of the most famous martial arts of the 1970s, but I never recognize why. The story is uncertain. This is a very talkie movie with occasional action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie is that the story I did not give to the hero, so the intended hero was an idiot. Director Chong does not have the style and can not hide the obvious flaws in the story. I'm not in this artwork, but I found the film boring. Definitely this is not the best example of a very beloved style. Its cult status escapes me. I recommend you skip it.
