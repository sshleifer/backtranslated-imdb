I never read about what I read about Bradbury's novel, it's interesting from what I've collected (I've read it and I'll do it). My commentary is entirely based on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer I had to see it and was very excited but finally I was finally disappointed. Because this film is considered too absurd. Actors did not perform well (although Robards and Pryce were both good actors - not just here). Kid actors, it appeared, just wanted to show, get in the characters' clothes, make lines and faces. The set and clues are cheap and unrealistic. The direction is surprisingly bad. I was surprised at it's awful I had to go online and check out the direction to see what kind of work he did. Editing cut and paste and plot (screenplay) is the same (even though the writer himself involved himself, sarcastic?). <br /> I have read comments on this film and believe that people really like it. It is. What hurts the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It has a lot of energy. Unfortunately, this film is technically bad.
