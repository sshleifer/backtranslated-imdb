"The Malkom program in FOX is really a murder ... did we not make our own version?" I guess and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it is true, and the only thing that NBC 'Malcom' metric attached is sex. And, boy, they do not add sex <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers with his skate. Tucker accidentally walked in the shower in her aunt and looked at her and beat her and blamed her. He spy on a beautiful girl at home from his bedroom window, and he knows he's going to be without her but knows she knows she teases him by laughing and closing the window. <br /> <br /> This is all there is in the pilot. <br /> Get up from a grown man. The boy's teenage sex-crazy and leads testicles. It is impossible to make the main audience funny. You can only calculate them on any side, anytime when you come back to the movies. So "Tucker" has a strip-club bathroom's warmth and attraction. Do we actually know that the kids are looking to grapple with puberty? Is this the way people go to jail? If you suspect this deprivation of the show: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled 4 episodes after it was broadcast; They broadcast unprecedented motion by broadcasting the rest of episodes "Midnight", so no children can see them. Children are originally from target audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Tucker is the voice-over of the flesh from the fictitious text from the main character, rather than its general stupidity. In 2000, it also had a terrible date, which included suddenly music and super sarcasm. I did not like any of the letters enough to laugh at jokes and jokes did not get a mile a minute ... disgrace on NBC for ripping this dirty ... they're better than <br /> <br /> Grad: C-
