With a cast that includes generally credible names such as Wal-Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland makes a deep sense of the film. It just brushes the surface of the events of July night in 1981. John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are hopefully unlikely that Kimmer simply moves through the two main characters; Holmes' wife and age girlfriend respectively. The remaining cast consists of such small characters, which are impossible to measure any dimensions. The film also featured a guest appearance from Carrie Fisher, Ted Levin, Frankie G, MC Gainy, Dylan McCormoth and Paris Hilton.
