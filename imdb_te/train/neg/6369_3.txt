The only reason I rented was due to an article in Fargoria Magazine. The article made this film interesting. Well, that's not it. This is a very boring, enthusiastic, written and directed movie. All the actors in the film are always happy to see, except Fayey Doye. But most of the time Gwen Phillips and Ravens and Duelioo mario focused on her rude encounters. Marjio has a thick Argentine accent, and every couple can understand the words you say. Nicholas Pals is also handmade, and ultra-blonde love interest to Jena Phillips. Bottom Line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and the last five to ten minutes of the film. I gave this one star, but I gave it three times so I liked Faye Dukey. But she is not great in this regard.
