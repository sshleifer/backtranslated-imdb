A male-male villain that appears to escape from the WWF has a terrible target with a gun that has a staggering effect (the first person she is the first man to hold fire but they just disappear when she shoots anyone) and a deer pets. Then you got objectionable characters, 30-year-old college students, a surprise ending and a laughing attempt with us. Avoid all costs.
