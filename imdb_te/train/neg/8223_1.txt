Sure, the worst image I have seen so far, have asked any questions! Contradictors of this view argue that this title can not be judged as already the same standard since it is an independent, low-budget film. <br /> <br /> When you agree with everything that is said about the film, for example, mind naked weak acting (this is bad when you shoot the scene), the thing I found most annoying is the lack of general feeling in the script, the thing that existed at the time of production. The obvious lack of a conversation with the respect of the audience, the girls have changed personalities many times and they do not let any rationality or brains completely - five relatively well-balanced girls in a mild female psychology? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered a success for the title is that the camera does not leave the van at any time, <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>? oh and by the way, is the film Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera? It's not the effect and the trait! Cleverly it is breathtaking, but in this case it is not an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
