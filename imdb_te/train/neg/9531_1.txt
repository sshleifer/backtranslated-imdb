This is a deadly picture. Two young men have come and murdered a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away with regard to a plot or "spoiler". I just comment that the end is the most innocent part of that movie. Most of the movie is locked and locked cackling effortlessly, and laughs emotionally at the camera all the time. Add to the soundtrack that repeats again, including a "dude old father" about a wudewood song, which represents an abusive quality that the viewer can never see. The music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting a torture worse viewer than being shot on the screen. The theme here is Amok to run young people, meaning in response to 60s, but with little imagination or full of style. Avoid this!
