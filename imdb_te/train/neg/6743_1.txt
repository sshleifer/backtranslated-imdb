How many times do we need to see bad horror movies with a killer in a screaming-repo? The plot of Bleed is very original but the film is also a complete failure. The dialogue for one thing has grown poorly, it's a lot of time boring and trivial details waste, acting bad, et cetera. I want my money back, this rental is worse than a scam.
