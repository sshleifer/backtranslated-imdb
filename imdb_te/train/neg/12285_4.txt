The storyline is incomplete and lame, even breathing shows and dialogues, it is difficult to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a caffeine-engine friend to wake you up for a couple gore-effects. Why are they taking alcatraz? In this case, swallowing is very difficult. In all the films, who am I worried about who the target is? The full scandal of the scandal is the US Army Captain, which is low-level in every aspect. BTW This film is forbidden in Germany!
