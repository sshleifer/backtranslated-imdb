He was always hard to hear, but he had no jokes. I complained that some fobby Asian guy Yo Mamma jokes are more ridiculous than Leary's worst. (Perhaps a couple minutes maybe funny but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary mentioned that he stopped taking drugs at one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still somehow; He has some drugs related to drugs. One of his jokes, 'I can not use cracking, especially if I have the same name between my ass' - oh man, how did he do that? The only person I have to close f ** k is called Denis Liar. Thanks to God, I can not see him. <br /> <br /> If you're gaining momentum, and "jokes" you can come with you easily, then waste this waste your time.
