Do not waste your time in this movie. It may be good, but the end is one of the lamesties I've ever seen. I saw the last scene for people with the making of this film and said, "Yes, now it's out!" I thought. And he set it back on. I found it more like they just ran out of ideas! They have a cool twist and built final scenes, but instead let's just flat up the build to build on the face of it. The last shot was black and I was in shock when I started credit music - I could not believe what I saw and I would call one end. The best thing anyone can do with this film will eventually overwrite and give some material. Really, I'd really like to see and say to the face to get whoever comes with one in one room - WTF ?? !!!!
