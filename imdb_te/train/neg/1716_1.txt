Although it is made for a TV product, there is no need for rock bottom results of the final product. The movie DID has a budget and it has a casting department so if you want to make a film about a real life story, you can actually put in the "real story" title, do some effort and try to capture some originality? First, the film is insulting. These actors are not in the daytime television soaps, or movies on that ludicrous lifelong channel, and the real life gangster / criminal story. About 90s of everything from their appearance, everything's screaming of the Mall-All-Rock-Rock-Listening generation. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again it has 90 sounds too. I never real Crowd Borrowed "I'm out of here." The "Black News on the Black" crowd came together and decided to really make "Kew Flack" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know it was completely Rod and Rockin. Well, this sticker did not even rank in the Rod and Rockin Scale. This is where everything is wrong with any kind of cinema, from cast and editing and acting to music. Every thing is very bad .... And the parties responsible for this deadly turkey spit with nerve to keep the "true story" in the title. It's certainly not true story, but worse, it's not even remotely entertaining as a vacuum popcorn film that has been accepted in its own terms. As I mentioned in my head, it's just terrible at every level of imaginative words. Believe me or look at your own risk.
