This film is one of the most awful I've ever seen. The conversation is not only terrible, it ends. You think it's over, but it's not. How much, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I'll never see it again. As someone took a romantic comedy, he took a comedy and then decided to show less love, and left us with the worst pile that could come off the screen. But do not take my word for it, find out how terrible it is.
