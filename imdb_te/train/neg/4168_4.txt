Well, this movie started funny but it quickly deteriorated. I thought it was more 'adult oriented comedy' based on the first few moments, but that movie was badly made for the Disney Channel type mode, especially the go-kart racing scene. Alana de la Garza is a gorgeous but really fake Italian accent. The film has seen a lot of independent and low budget and alerted. There's a beautiful moment, I'll just call the scene scene, but overall it's one. The laughs are very low and far between. The closing surprise for "Mr. Fix It's" is so ridiculous that it leaves me more mad than anything else. If you can get it for free or on TV, you may not be able to buy or rent a movie.
