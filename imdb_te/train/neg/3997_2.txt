After finding a high rating on IMDb, I decided to watch this movie. Out of that high rating, I deliberately avoided reading any of the reviews. <br /> You can see that I am disappointed after giving my rating. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager talked to me in the hotel room. By the time Enceline entered the room, I was ready for some frightening things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper folds. Enslin responds reliably. He freaked out. I'm encouraged and I think it's good. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of the lesser one. </ P> <p> Imagine replacing the predictable shotgun approach ... Hope every one of the Hollywood horror tricks in the book will blow up the audience and work out something. Let's see, a clock radio turns through it? Good, it's always scary. Moving objects in the room? Good, you can not complain about it. Blood from the walls and sinking blood Great. Ghosts That Suicide? Good. What else? About how big sounds, shaking, fire, more shaking, stirring up the room, more blood, etc .. It's all good. And it happened before. <br /> <br /> "And what do you know? When I watch a horror movie on a theater, one of the spectators who are scared of horrific moves <br /> <br /> The audience is silent and frustrated, not spraying my spine. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best horror movies S Who is the director of the Friends? Sorry, I do not get it.
