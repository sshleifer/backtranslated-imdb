Amateur, no budget films are surprisingly good ... it's not one of them. <br /> Ah, another Brad Sikes rape. Except Emmy Smith, except for a few promises, this act is nasty. Camera "direction" requires a radical reconstruction. No longer "holding the camera" and not running. That does not work. Special effects are unexpected, there is a problem when the effect is realized in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please do not let us see the true ear of the actor under the blood. The scenery is a cross between the mourning and embarrassing (like the other shows of Mr. Sikes), and the music is a cross between motel romantic and really bad guitar driven metal (see scenery comment). <br /> What is the real plot, or lack of character development? <br /> <br /> All the funds for this person ... please stop. I saw some of his other "home movies" (which I did not plug) and they were just bad. Usually, a "director" grows from his previous efforts and learns ... this person is not. One thing that is an enthusiastic filmmaker, but someone may be hacked. <br /> <br /> Surely a popcorn film ... chewing on popcorn kernels is less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Award: The worst ever in a movie military push-ups.
