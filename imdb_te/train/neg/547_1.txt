The full title of the film is "Vote: Race Against Time". No one is a race that can never succeed, but you can not waste your precious "cut" in these boks by cutting your valuable margin. The K3G look is honest and the film is clumsy and fraudulent. This has hurt my loyalty too much. <br /> <br /> It is not as bad as the Bagban or Black, but it is not recommended for this film. Stupid, literally with the funniest OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another evil example of a drastic manipulation campaign that influences most "family" BW films. My father raised me and I loved him and I liked Big B Akshay killed me. To say nothing about the children of terminal illness.
