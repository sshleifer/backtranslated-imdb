It's hard to say what's the worst thing about this presentation: bad acting, different parts of the bad sound, bad CGI, inaccurate sets, and poor script. It may be good if the script follows a bit closer to the original story - there is enough tension and good feel in Beowulf to provide better material than the upcoming bureau with scroll writers. <br /> <br /> Why does the explosive bolts introduce a strange new weapon like a crossover to fires? <br /> <br /> I see this movie "only" made in 21 days. It shows the lack of quality. <br /> <br /> In the last few years, I began to think of a simple (poor) attitude taken by science fiction channel (and others) when it comes to making films from classics. <br /> <br />
