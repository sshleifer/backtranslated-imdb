I do not know why rebuilding has become a trend. Every remake I've seen is awful, it's no exception. If no one among you looks at the quote from Ben Jones, it is "the cemetery" that is the worst piece, he is very appropriate. Why would I take a wonderful television program, I loved it, never lost episode, and DVDs on the DVD 1-4, and destroy it, I never knew. Despite a family performance of the television program, and Daisy's body, it was really flaunted, or saved in the dress, addressed at the event. A family performance has been turned into a dirty piece of garbage, and I can not recommend anyone going to see it. The other thing I do not like is that John Schneider and Tom Vopat are amazing actors (along with the original cast), and they are very beautiful. The new Bo and Luke are also not a little cute. This is one of the drawers for the show. Casting is terrible. They may have at least gotten a brunette for daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified boss hog, Every role he has ever played is entirely against this role. Moreover, they portrayed half a good role as Willie Nelson Uncle Jesse, but this does not match. Denver Pyle is an actor his own, and that character made him perfect. I think that casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all a wonderful performance has ruined and turned into a dirty, horrible movie. I do not recommend anyone can see. I saw only curiosity, and a free ticket on Season 4 DVD. I never pay to see this movie, but it's free. Do not pay to see this movie.
