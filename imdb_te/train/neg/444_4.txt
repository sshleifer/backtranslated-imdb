<br /> <br /> "Rosenstra√üe" is a film about heroic women during the German Nazi. But it is too long, it's not touching and sometimes boring! <br /> <br /> The storyline storyline is bad. An elderly woman in James Cameron's Titanic reminds her of the events. Good, now we have a perspective. Who introduces another woman? They are reminiscent of both the lives of other people's lives! Come on! This is the lack of knowledge of the basic story ... how does Riemann know about the fate of the little girl and for example her questioning? <br /> <br /> Scenes are shown in the wrong order and rarely know when it happens. For example, the scene when Riemann suggested to Fabian. When did it happen? <br /> <br /> Remakes character is a talented pianist, well, she is also a baroness! Wow. Her brother returns from the Eastern Front, receiving "RitterCourse", which he shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero, and a good man who saves his conscience. And he got acquainted with the genocide by the Germans. He also did some photographs! <br /> <br /> Usually one tropa is a good film that has done a chic film. And finally all is very simple. Riemann finds a way to bring Marbels into bed - and it! - free to everyone. Although it was initially a "true story", the historical fact is not pure fiction. <br /> <br /> As with "saas" this is unclear about the real incident. <br /> <br /> It is sad but true, it is a typical German movie these days. It's bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
