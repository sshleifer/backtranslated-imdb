I said what happened, I thought it would be nice for some people with money to destroy one of the best programs on TV. Do we need to rebuild a large screen? Are they asking fans? I am surprised that all fans have gained any admiration if they remake with Ashton Kr√ºcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Sauerlane if they reconstruct the "Rocky Horror Picture Show". You think they like it! This is not the same as the original. The original was always a bit muddy, but Bo and Luke were always good, as they got into trouble, they got into trouble because their main goal was to help those who went through town. There is nothing for the people who made the film and they never see the original show. My big question is what will they do next?
