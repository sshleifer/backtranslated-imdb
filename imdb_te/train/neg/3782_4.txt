The first good news is here. "Spirit" is the most visually amazement of the current home theater release. Art and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you view the movie only through visuals. <br /> Now for the bad news. This really meant when I said that animation is only for this film. Keep in mind that the "soul" suffered severely by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. Disney became the first person to argue that he could write a four-page article entitled "Lilo and Stitch's Script Do Not Stink" <br /> For all the incredible new animation technologies displayed in "Spirit", the story is almost * surprisingly * dull. There is a lesson here, and (no need to say) that does not apply to animated films. You may have very foolish visual effects, and always thanks to a dead eye, but if your story is boring and, especially, if you do not care about your characters, it's bad. It's easy to do. The animation is still stupid; I can not wait to see what anyone else is doing with it.
