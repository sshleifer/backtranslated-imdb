OK to tell the correct location. We have five recent college graduates (priority in the F word) to leave on a weekend camping trip. They rushed to the person who needed help, but instead of helping him, they shot him down. Good of the people. After some of them start going ill - those in the cabin must have something in the water. But the neighbors are okay. Oh well, when things get really bad, they get their help instead of getting help (try the neighborhood by the way). Some locals do not like them. They run at high speed with many miles of forests until trucks break down. One day after ten minutes he shows up in the cabin (how he finds and how to show a secret about how to travel at the speed of light). Somehow the brain surgeon in the cabin hides in a cave to tell this mistake, something is wrong. He then decides to come back to Kabe after a few days statue. He's relieved of his revelation (he must be a 24-hour bug). He is perplexed with very friendly police officers. Another couple having sex have been eating its magic of meat eating bug, and then realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of disease skin with cream shaving). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing here does not mean. I want to be with five friends. I was rooting for meat eating bacteria. Other roles have been introduced as some fun but not completely. 90 years of good life is ruined here.
