The writing of the screen it pains me shut up for 2 hours in my life I will never return (I heard this before). Acting is very early. Things are often waiting for you to keep looking and something gruesome to happen. However, there is no real thing in this movie. The first cube is a glamorous horror film, which did not make the entire episode, the Cube Zero picked up and tries to turn the same story correctly, except for this time a bad spot trying to spoon-feed explanations for every detail of the first film. The comic thing is that the director is somewhat unrealistic and tries to explain the exact scenes of the first film. But the scenes were just copied, no comparison. This script is smooth. I can imagine that I have written a half-wit with a 15-year-old baseball cap and a beer pack for class planning. At the end of the best episode, they ignore the 'good' scandal, and he will be retarded in the first film and see him in Cube in 1997 ('This room is green ..'). Goody gooodie, knock clap, what a twist. First of all, if you do not see the first one, it does not make you feel like a director. Oh, another great idea: instead of identifying numbers of x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it's 3 letters, each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, ideas. Directors / writers should have some talent.
