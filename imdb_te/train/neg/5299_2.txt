I really like slasher movies, but this is really awful. Acting is lame, the script is bad, and the weather remains unchanged. The plot is as follows: An optional gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American town. This is true - it's very original, ech! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not even enough Gary - even if the movie is not scary, at least they need to change it to blood. You should not waste your precious time with this precious time if you want to see some good slaser flicks - "Manman", "Burning", "The Pavlar", "Just Before Dawn" or "Hangoans". The worst piece.
