'Sherry Baby' is a young mother's story that emerges from prison in a probe after a very painful and ugly drama, a drug-related faith and struggles in Jersey, a place for her in life and especially her daughter's daughter who took care of her brother's daughter. The only reason to be seen in the film is Maggie Gyllenhall, the best actress in her career, she is well-liked in her role and has a whole film on her shoulders. The story was very simple and predictable, and emotional emphasis was placed in the wrong place, but it was not enough, I was asking myself throughout the film whether I was sorry about the former and maybe future future drugs, or about the innocent kid in the middle. I do not believe that Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting should not give me more attention to children.
