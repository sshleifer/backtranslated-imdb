I hoped that this film would be at least viewable. The plot is weak to say the least. I'd like to consider the cast line (I wonder if any of them have any of them on their CVs). At least it did not pay rent. The best part of the film is definitely Danny Behr, but the rest of the film is finished and full pants.
