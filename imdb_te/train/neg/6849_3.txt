J-horror movie followed a young woman when she returned to her childhood village on Chicago's island to sell this family and meet old friends. She learns that the daughter of the village priest was drowned years earlier. She and Femio (another child friend) then Seiori's mother tries to bring her back to magic. The bonds between already dead and life are weak and friends and villagers are looking for demons. Nothing about this film is unusual or not very good. Unlike the stellar J-Horror imagery, suspense can not really be built, resulting in excessive intimidation and lack of edge limits. <br /> <br /> The film is plain white rice for a long time. In some cases you can come to Asian restaurants and cook your own white rice. You end up eating because you need a meal because it is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it's almost all of the glue and goi food that is ruined by food. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
