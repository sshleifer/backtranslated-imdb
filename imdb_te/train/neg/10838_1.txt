The minute you give an 'art picture' 1/10, you have baying people for your childlike, half-ass ed, artfully retarded blood. I do not try and justify how a '10 / 10 cult classic would not retard a beautiful challenge through the 'Art House Cinema' list of all likes or mentions how some unknown 'cult classic offered. <br /> <br /> How do I explain the film: The opening of the montage of three unrelated urban legends is almost the absurd level coexistence. Following is the following (to save you briefly for 3 hours) - a children's play performer who dies with lung cancer attempts to do things with his coke-addiction daughter, attracted by a male police officer with a child, and problems associated with it, but the star of the game show's star He should not be a failed child prodigy The show is another damaged in the game performance. Competitors from the 60s, we see now, are involved in love with the brazender with bracts and need money for 'correct mouth surgery', but the producer of the game show dies with lung cancer, his male nurse with a son And hence a stroke The second wife of a man who died rini aparadhabhaganiki snaps defrauding Mr. Producer. And oh, in the end, it rains frogs (you read it right). And I am going to lead a long and nonsense, literally transmitted monologue with each letter, to confirm that the film is over 3 hours and a modern epic '. <br /> <br /> You probably want to make a thorough examination of the film (I'm not confused) if I write a little bit of narrative, probably written in some sentences. Instead of just one ... well, now how do I feel.
