The film has everything; The hard act of 'hot', the explosion of a gerry bukkemer movie, the intriguing conversation of a Tarantino script and the theme of 'The Godfather', <br /> <br /> Judge Reinhold character exhibits a fiery temperammeat and a real emotional Shows depth and intensity. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are really breathtaking, because the Bullitt movie features such high-octane and stylish car scenes. Special effects increase technology and filmmaking to their limitations. <br /> <br /> In the whole list, (like an Oscar night party invitation list!), classy locations, gripping action, and a tight script.
