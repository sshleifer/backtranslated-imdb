"Murder, Shee Rott" is filled with an irregularity that is infinitely superior, and it is totally surprising that this poorly-written trash lasted for eight years. I've seen in these sixties and seventies many of those who have seen this unchallenged garbage and are sure to remember its star from the old Dick Van Dyke show, because they're not good at nothing. Van Dyke, who has a good career in the 1960s, has never been an actor (by his own entry) and when he started in 1993 he was too old to play a doctor. The chain is the result of smokers and heavy drinking years. Barry, in his untrammeled real life, is a rare wooden actor who does not relate to his father, his son in this series.
