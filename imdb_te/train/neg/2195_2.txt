No Brain is a terrible part of the film that stinks from opening credits. It came with all the classic codes of evil: disbelief plotline, terrible acting, low grade sets and lighting. The storyline goes on: When a physician and his fianc√©e are caught in an accident, she is guilty of taking off her head and takes her head to her laboratory. Alive. Virinina Leath, who played the head in the pan I had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squat under a table. Anyway, the doctor then seeks to find her a new body, and hires two strips so she can choose one that has her new body. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 is all the way down to slip into pieces.
