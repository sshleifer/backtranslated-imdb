Okay .. I was not the worst movie I ever had, but I heard good about it and I was very disappointed. I could see where filmmakers came from, and I see trying to express the fact that the two fighters in this war are losing their fight and are not different from each other. <br /> <br /> Any kind of cinema was bored with me. I've seen a lot of movies too long, but this just seemed to pull on and on and on because I'm bringing no attention to the characters. I kept thinking .. who cares ??? I found myself acting rather than dead pan and dialogue. I understand that this is 1800 and all, but most conversations seemed just unnatural. <br /> <br /> In this story, "Romance" is "I am a man and I am a girl", I believe that I do not consider a very romantic sense, and these people are in love. Oh well .. I guess the whole "all these horrors around us, we have each other" typing thing, or whatever. I am also hoping for some sort of adventures between two good friends (both of them are interested in the first girl), but it just fell. Maybe a clich√© love avoiding triangle. <br /> <br /> Oh well. Daniel Holt is the only role I really like. And Sue Lee is correct. I absolutely did not like Jake, but he seemed a bit ... spineless, I guess. Jack Bull I do not care for it all. I'm pretty, I just hated all about, I have reduced the left and right part, excluding the poor people. It's pretty graphic and that whole "down panic" thing is down, but I've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, better done. (I enjoyed the patriot very much, for example, even though it was a bit emotionally manipulated), but, as I have already said, I'm a hatred. What can i say :)
