The case is the best part of the film, but the only purchase price is worth. I imagined a movie based on the "true story" film only to find a shot at the home video Hodge-Podz of poor shot clips, combined with curiosity and unrelated slaughterhouse scenes. Video sequences have caused many rewind conditions, which are used to extend the length of the feature rather than effects. I started this review in the movie half an hour and it was wait until the end of it, it was short and it just deteriorated. If I could be less recognizable, it was ten negative. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time.
