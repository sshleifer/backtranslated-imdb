Sorry for first giving a rating of 1 image (which is not available). The film will fail in each section like screenplay, direction, classification or acting. <br />) 1) Initially, the name of the film is really C class (the movie itself is fitting). 2) Amitabh Bachchan makes his best effort to play his role, but in the poor direction the weak script transforms him into a ridiculous character. 3) Gabbar Singh gives him 50,000 prizes in Shola (which is convincing). There are only bikes to travel to Babbar (100 crores for Amitabh Bachchan, but poor man our hero) and some men (all automatic guns). A shola movie in modern times 4) Nisha Kothari needs someone to tell her that she does not act . Why is Ram Gopal Varma again starring? 5) Mohan Lal is good but nothing can be done to him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav are great actors in the film. 7) The role of Legendry played by Leila Mishra (Basanti's Mausi) in Shola is somewhat low by some gum mummy. Please be aware that Ram will have some intelligence in your movie. Stupid characters fit in your movie like Shiva and Aag. <br /> Do not say anything about the modern Jaya and these. <br /> <br /> In order to summarize, I was surprised to see the film because it was a cheap and comic translation of the original classics. Do not waste money and time in this movie. I think Aap Ka Surror (which I thought would be the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and painful direction. <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
