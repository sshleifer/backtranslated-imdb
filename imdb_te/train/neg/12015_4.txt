Alfred Hitchcock can imagine what he can do as my favorite director! This plot has a lot of energy for suspense. John Garfield is almost always amazing and has a cast against Raymond Massey. Nancy Coleman is not a very good woman but an assistant cast is big and very capable. <br /> Yes it starts very quickly. There are too many randomizations. <br /> <br /> It is great to watch for Garfield, Massey and journalists. But this is not good.
