I hate to mourn in the procession (it is also small) but from the very first scene, you can say that this film will be a complete shit. I'm really a shame like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was curious about how to mix in a movie together, but my worry, they did not even scene together! I think this is a repetition - there's a scene together with two main actors (standing side by side on ad posters and DVD covers) !!!! They did not speak to each other and at the same time did not appear on the screen. Not just this poorly needed image. <br /> <br /> This conversation is painful, every single character in the film is irrelevant and un-huh. Freeman tried very hard (and played the role of Tim in the office), no one disliked and everyone was bad, some characters <br /> This low budget stinker is an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could inject some humor and charm into this, but to bless, he tried. <br /> <br /> 'Ten stars' is beyond me how to lose this movie. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I would not give ten stars to some of the ten stars, indicating that an image is perfect. <br /> <br /> The film is so perfect that it is almost opposite, which means it is totally terrible. <br /> If you look at what you like, but watch many movies, <br /> <br />
