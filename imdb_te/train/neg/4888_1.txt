Nick Millard Nick Philips need to be left alone, he has "criminals insane", 10 years before the release of this awful waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminal Insane" length is less than an hour he must have clued into the fact that he probably participated in this story for all to go out of it ... but instead of the original opening footage sequence recycling he also tries to get the footage from the original! Unfortunately, rapid aging brought back Priscilla Alden, which did not protect it. The original footage of the film is as low as it has been filmed with a rented camcorder! I would be very surprised if this picture cost more than $ 100 and I would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that sum! Avoid this and watch the original instead!
