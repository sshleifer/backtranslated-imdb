Shiva dash dash at the end of the rope with no side effects until the rope ended. <br /> <br /> When they go to loot a bank (in the flashback), they are on the street for a break <br /> <br /> Poor editing - a battery pack under that shirt and it is clear, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The whole image is rubbish.
