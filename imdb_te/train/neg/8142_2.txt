After a melt in a cave, John Beck, a physician, develops a rapidly transformation into a man-bat creature. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, the local police officer thinks that only rabies or anti-ibis drugs are responsible for Japan's most brutal murders The "Bat People" is the hell of an awful movie by Jerry Jameson. The script is deadly fog and does not have gore or nudity. So mind-numbingly boring that you scratch your head in total infidelity after suffering through it. Even a young Stan Winston designing a man-bat creature is utterly curious and unmemorable. Avoid this stinker like plague 2 in 10.
