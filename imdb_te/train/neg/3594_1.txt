It's not a horror movie, boring sex movie. No bad movie, avoided by any serious horror fan. What a plot, awful acting and annoying music. If you see only the trailer you will know enough ... It is available in VHS or video when there are not many good movies available. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian gothic instead from Mario Bava and Antonio Margherita. These are artworks if you compare this trash. Rating = also "1" too! I believe, I am not alone with this opinion.
