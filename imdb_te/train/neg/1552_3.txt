The film is well known. I saw the movie director of the interested film and the previews of the movie for the month. I have some doubts about how this film actually works, and my friends feel great about it and have made me public. Then I went and saw, I was drowning in my seat as long as I remembered that I paid for this movie. I saw a lot of things in the film, I feel bad and ruined a good mood, and I respect my monies in this film! I'm not always going to go into an image with an open mind, trying to go into them with most expectations, but this movie is not that funny. Now it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely waiting for HBO. If you do not see too many pictures for the movie or you can enjoy it very slowly and blandly jokingly, but I'll pass to true comedy fans. Maybe again check the Kings of Comedy. Some say I want to meet my parents!
