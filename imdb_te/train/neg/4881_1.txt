This is the worst boring piece I've ever wasted an hour in my life. All I can say is thanks to God for only an hour. The footage from the original "Criminal Insince" is half of the film. Too little, I could see highlights from rare robbery classics, some of my video store "Criminal Insane II" (which is "Crazy Fat Ethel II") due to some reality-defining. But the rest of the film is the perfect garbled home-video acting and the film of the backyard you see. Why does my video store have this and not the original? Why would such event actually end in video stores? Why do people rent it after seeing the rental horror and does not immediately copy the copy? <br /> <br /> When you are suffering, you are slowly eating the whole candy bar in the scene, or if you're not enjoying the annoying fruits, or the poisoning of a person's wife and the brain cell killing monologues are often left out of the monologues and all the teaks are one of their own tea chilled, Or mentally retarded eating fly soup, or just a crazy cat with a bloody knife in a garden Ethel dance: I do not see this movie. Repeat: Do not see this movie. Do not rent this movie. As far as possible, you can not walk on a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie. You can still save it, but now it's too late for me. . .
