My sweetheart was seen by the movie and was disappointed, the first fan of me. This movie sucks down right! It is not the first magic. The mice that you understand every word, the animation crappy, the palace is quite different from the first image, never mentioned before and are terrible, fortunately the prince does not have many lines which keep him from stupid sound. Generally its The Lion King 1 1/2 all rats except its various stories. I am giving you 10 out of 2 because the songs sung by the characters are very pleasant.
