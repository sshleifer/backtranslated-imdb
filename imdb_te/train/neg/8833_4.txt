With no fault of the actors (they all gave great performances), the whole story is not well executed. The movie opens with a great zinger: a crazy old man car a young Aboriginal girl car forces. But we're compelled to combine the 40 minute character characters with completely new grouping ... 40 minutes why we do not know. They eventually come out of the girl's body and come out of it ... and the story goes from there. <br /> <br /> When this story is taking place at the time, it's not really anywhere. After 2 hours, I asked: Is there a point in this regard, or how did they find it to fight those allegations against racism and stupidity? The story is ultimately unsatisfactory and is incomplete. Although it is well-played, there is not a strong enough backbone to recommend in the film.
