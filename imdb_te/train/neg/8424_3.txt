As a fictional thriller, history is the essence of Amin: the film can be judged from three perspectives. <br /> If history fails, it says Oboat Asians have conquered the conspiracy, and the backdrop of Entebbe has the most advanced jack, but no chronological constant occurs. <br /> <br /> By Amin's profile it is interesting, because Forest Whitaker may be very good, and if this is a good image, he will get an Oscar. (He has got it - Oscar voters do not watch movies they vote.) It does not ignore the relevant historical parts of the novel, which is observed in the history of Amin and Uganda from the perspective of the doctor. It instead tells of his impossible love life from Scott's fictional story and Amine's view. But the story told Amin was an incident that was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to catch up with. Initially there is Tat - it takes the movie freedom with the novel, but sets the story. Doctor Character Dr Kampala decides why to be explained badly, but suffers from the result will be lost in the second half of the film -. Why is he so stupid? It's a ridiculous entanglement that Amin does not seem to be confident enough to show close ferocity, but allows the authors of the film - the role of a friend in the novel in the case of Black Doctor instead of Scotsman. Eventually the man is called a horse-bit. <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda ran on the left, not right, the number plates three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the equator teeth? <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of Amin, you will spend two hours watching this film to greet the performance of Forest Whittaker, but the last hour you will be confused. If you know Uganda or read the book - do not look at the picture - you are only discouraged. Doctor so why do you want to know Foolhardy - he is not.
