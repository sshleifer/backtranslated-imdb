When looking at this movie, I gave the script for a movie called "The Making of 10 Matter or Less": <br /> Producer: I've got great news and bad news. Good news, Morgan Freeman can get! <br /> <br /> Writer: It's good! <br /> <br /> Producer: We hire him one day. <br /> <br /> Writer: So one day we will appoint him. The film will last an hour and a half. Eight hours of working day. <br /> <br /> The author: We have played a part in him. <br /> <br /> <br /> The producer: <br /> Author: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: It's ridiculous. ! But fine, at least Morgan Freeman will be in our film. <br /> <br /> Writer: <br /> <br /> Producer: This script loads the worst. We want to make this money well. Morgan Freeman's role is to have the plug-in Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so anyone wants to sell at least DVDs. <br /> <br /> The author: sure thing! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait for the second ... What about a small bag of 10 "or less" express lane? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I'm pretty disgusted. <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script is actually very similar to reality, but "10 items or less" did not. It's a good acting case, but bad writing, and I hate to see what's happening. When you see an independent image, you expect to try to give you some sort of message. I feel that the message that they die of "" worries "is much better in movies than they get tired old. In any case, with the "10 Elements or Less", the only message I have ever seen is "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
