Midsize-Dickson line of all the Dukes of Hazzard line is both north and south of the Mens-Dickson line, with the makers of the old TV programs in Hollywood today, but this is a disrespect, toilet comedy, your-kiss-mie-mom-mouth foul language. Uncle Jessie's governor Georgia (Uncle Jesse's moral compass despite his previous moon hitting paths) is an open face insult to the film because of the opening of the movie for Uncle Jesse (as well as the parole violation of the jail in Sharau). In the first 15 minutes from the theater I saw the first parent's children I saw after they realized that they were terribly deceived. The original Dukes of Hazzard is a family performance with basic moral values. Hazard's original Duke's parents are fun to be concerned that their children do not have to worry about teaching George Carlin's seven words, and Hemi Powell is safe. I've reviewed the reviews and the film reviews racism. Those scenes may be correct about the film. These mistakes about the exhibitions are incorrect. The show, if any, is about being together and being friends. Hollywood has finally opened up their frustration for those of us who work properly, even though we are, among them, anki, rebel, or respect, loyalty, belief, family, and trustworthy. Hollywood has finally brought us the belief that stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul of us in the heart and worst that they are buying any piece of garbage that are ready to sell. Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong. Do not see this movie. Expulsion of sponsors Fill out Warner Bros. Email and Snail Mail boxes with complaints, the great T.V. We can not appreciate the destruction of the shows. Save your money and buy the original presentation of the DVD, but what do you do ?? Do not see this movie
