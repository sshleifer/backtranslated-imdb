It is possible that a man was called irreparable damage on the floor building of the building. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to make spaghetti money in the Western market, bringing many Americans into the cast to complete the cast. Out. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akkins, John Marley. <br /> <br /> We have a Vick Morrow, who wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Garner is always like the rogues he loves because he is very good at playing. But he played badly and did well in films like The Children's Hour and Gun of Honey. He and his regular stereotypes successfully broke off. <br /> He earned the title role in Luther Sledge, a brutal illegal character with a big price on his head. Partner Tony Young is killed in a salon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style, coming from a saloon by John Marley. <br /> <br /> The time spent in Marley in the neighboring territorial jail and the golden shipments lock and key there for a rest stop for those who ship stuff in a simple run. <br /> <br /> The film goes back to the back of the wall. Most hysterical projects are generally underway for Hasty Films. It was precisely done in The War Wagon, quoted by other commentator. But this one Garner decides to cause a jailbreak at any time the fake US Marshall Dennis Weaver is broken into prison as a prisoner and robbed of gold. <br /> It is too much to swallow. If you put gold, it should be easy. <br /> <br /> During the culmination of the prisoner, I fits three films for those who love the Italian and Western nations of the Italian West. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is not, actually the bandits fall off, another gore fest before the picture ends. But by that time the overall picture lost a lot of reasonability. <br /> <br /> The thirties' greatest film singer Allen Jones is listed on credits. But in my life I could not find him in the film. <br /> <br /> The chorus of the Donkey Serenade may have a better job. <br /> <br /> There is no injury.
