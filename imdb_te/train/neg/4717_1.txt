That's how it surprises me. The main character is a bad show off who is not at least bit funny. I can not keep up the role. He has a mute ass for nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> In the last 10 years, there is the worst cartoon on the surface, no joke. The storyline was written two poorly executed. Jokes in Disney's Sweet Life of Jack and the Jokes are very bad. I do not like this presentation, it's terrible and should be canceled. Theme song is also bad. <br /> <br /> I think the show is based on their role at the age of 15 and they are really hot and there are not. Creativity as well as humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, away and go away faster!
