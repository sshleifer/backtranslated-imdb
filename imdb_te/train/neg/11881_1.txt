The film is not like "office space" except in the premise. Office space is happy. I did not recommend this film because I did not even laughed at the whole movie. Min Cornellet's self-sensitive reactions quickly became more and more aggressive than the 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or look at someone else's home so you can leave if necessary.
