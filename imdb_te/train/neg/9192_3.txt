I found this movie in the 'Horror' section of my video store. It has become so meaningful that there are so many zombie movies there. '28 days after Romero's' Dead' trilogy. <br /> <br /> This is a music video that is really fast. It is very fast and more scratched. Here's the horror. Just a few half way decently demonstrate the action scenes which are tiresome grow, but this film is really how they really picture, because they last ... and last ... and last ... and eventually you get the feel that the DVD player might be undone 3 minutes back . It's pity. I feel that I can use this movie for $ 7 million in film industry. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> I am playing the game. It sucks. Why are they placed here? Oh it's not right, it's not a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at it. <br /> <br /> Rated: Many violence / gore, and obscenity
