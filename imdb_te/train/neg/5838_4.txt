With an absolutely stunning cast and crew, this can be a classic. Instead it was paraphrasing the repetition of all conspiracy theories in 1979, instability of the JFK assassination, instead of inexplicably, to a vague abstract plot about the murder of fictional president Kegon in the 1960s. They either gave up enough to waste many fantastic character actors either - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or they asked to go gently above - John Huston. <br /> <br /> Photography is gorgeous, but an hour and half of your life is not justified, or buy a price DVD.
