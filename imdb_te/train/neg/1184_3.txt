The film has good sound, but the paste is very slow ... it's actually very slow. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks this is a classic classic, I think it will look very good in the era. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not awesome, but it's not the worst. Sounds OK. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it will be good either. <br /> <br /> There are no hits here, leave this frustrating. I trust me badly, but it's just a waste of time, I can not get good reviews here. Especially high ratings ...
