There is no award in this film. Well, it does not even qualify for the audience. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. Each frame is thought to have you "full picture", and someone else cuts your impression "from the edges." The story is tragic. Well, I'm honest, I can not see the whole movie. When most of the suckers saw the parting of parties in their camps, and one of the soldiers helped to drink alcohol. This and many other scenes remind me of Steven Seagal too. <br /> Get my advice, stay away from this piece of garbage.
