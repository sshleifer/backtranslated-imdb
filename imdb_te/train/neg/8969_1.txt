The plot does not offer any new stimuli that starts with Cube I too. The cube machine has no other improvements at this time, but it is very cautious, except to have extra protection. In the first episode the characters were not well elaborated, they were just "flat" in the soap opera. <br /> If someone does this for a normal departure, does anyone really "believe creatively?" Asking questions like, its creativity or not original, especially in my opinion it fit into the cube mystery with traps. There is nothing much to say about it.
