I've enjoyed it easily. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many sequels, even though most people could not bear it. I also enjoyed a lot of poly shore movies. There is only one film I've seen honestly bad ... it's it. It's been a while since I watched, but I should remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a dumb movie, why am I seeing this?" I am honestly the only film I can not recommend.
