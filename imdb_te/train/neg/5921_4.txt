<br /> What happens when World War II in New Zealand is there when American troops are there? <br /> <br /> 4 sisters This really awful story is really worth watching. Do you act as a sister who is a sister to sister Zone? Fontaine looked like her mother. <br /> <br /> Piper Larry and Paul Newman, who have done so great in the screen chemistry in "The Hustler" 4 years later, have no sequences in this movie. While Larry is married to her, she goes to Wellington and plays another sister. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons gets romance with the widow and very weak Paul Newman. Here is love for young Miss Dee. <br /> <br /> It does not matter in this movie. Are they trying to say that they are all in love and justice in battle? <br /> <br /> Interested by Newman and Simmons is controversial. This is done quickly for this horrible disappointment of 1957.
