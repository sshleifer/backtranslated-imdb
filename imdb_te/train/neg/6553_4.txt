In the years following the final collapse of the great corporations, the world has fallen to a new dark age that cyborgs produce for their skin. Cash, a female cyborg, travels with a barren woman to receive news that she is pregnant. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (last & lastest) run from recyclers (hunters who are hunting off cyborgs), cyborg entries in the Sibberg trilogy. The first film was originally intended to be a continuation of the Universe's Masters, but soon became a classic post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest which became something of a traditional classic due to its cheesy action sequences. CearBurg 2: GLASS SHADOW was originally developed after its predecessor, but did not appear to be widespread (some were considered as cheap animal feed). <br /> <br /> This film, for one thing, is a combination of the first two films (the first is a cheesy action movie, the story of a smart cyberpunk) but unfortunately it gets smaller on both sides. Barry has a lot less than Ceyerberg 2, a film featuring desert wasters (such as most post-action films in the 90s), to preserve the costs of old industrial buildings. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is a pregnant cyborg, which is interesting for the absurd (the film is not the first to make that effort; the anime OVA Series Orderation III uses it to the highest extent). But very low budget science fiction action films come to the victims, as well as snags (artificial creatures) are not more than Androids. There are no visual effects than prosthetic hands and decorative effects. <br /> <br /> Acting for this type of film is very beautiful and the only actress in the lead actress (Khairstein Haj). Instead of being happy with the news of her pregnancy, she is frail and mourning. Her co-stars are much better, and Malcolm McDowell is a regular gangster, and he launches scenes featuring Richard Lynch, which is very fun as the main villain. In particular, Note, Andrew Biniarski, as Lynch's right hand man, he later appeared in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake & its prequel.
