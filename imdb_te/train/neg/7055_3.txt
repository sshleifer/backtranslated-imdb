Start saying "Jawani Diwani" is a curiosity movie. I agree with the last person who says, "I'm glad I did." LOL. <br /> <br /> Jokes are just terrible. Average of shows. Something went wrong with the movie. Emraan deserve something completely good. All Selina Jaitley has revealed. Hrishitha bot Okay. <br /> <br /> Mann (Emran Hashmi) is a desperate person who wants to be famous. Therefore, he uses RADHA and pretends that she loves her, because her father is only a musician and the only reason he can be known (because the father ordered his daughter). One day, MANN and his friends go to the GAA. Where he meets Roma (Celina Jaitley) and comes complete with her appearance and tries to mock her with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> Then, that night he could not open the door to his room, and MANN decided to help him. Seeing that he is not also, Roma goes to ask for help. When she's gone, MANN decides to open the door and come in and sit in her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes and they have a night stand. However, that night, Roma falls in love with him. In the morning, they see the underworld don (Mahesh). Don prefers ROMA and does not stand to see what he is doing. He directs them to marry and feared that the MANN will obey Order and Merry's ROMA. Then, their wedding news ends in the newspaper. MANN later learns that he loves ROMA after they make a music video together. He is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> This film is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" is excellent and remix version is also great. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also excellent. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
