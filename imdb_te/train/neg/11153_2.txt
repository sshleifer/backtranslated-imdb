Learning how to work a camera is one of the long lines of people who think like a story telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire campus is placed in just a few ways, so there is no secret of removing the whole section of the suspense. Half-way efficient actor dies for 10 minutes into the film, so we are doing stupid characters with stupid characters. Low-budget films do not get expensive special effects, so CGI components are unclear, at least a valid attempt. This creature suit is terrible, as it is seen as a footbut, and the director is emphasizing the eyes that are not reddish in the mirror shots. Conversations are contradictory and uninteresting, reminding some lines of Aliens or Terminator. The final action sequence takes place at a police station, and a rip-off from the terminator, a dark glass wrapper with each glass cover, declares that it will not collapse. In the end, the girl called the hero "a good protector", but he did not tell a dozen police, his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, all without murder, silver bullets and a machine gun arsenal without getting a good shot off. But here is the real doctor for the bad writing: after the initial credits they would have killed the beast when they caught a stripper when they glisten red eyes. Instead, they were detained ?!
