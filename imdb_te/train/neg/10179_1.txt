The film is insulting to the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not believe they are rejected by Cleveland. (Yes, true Indians realized in good time and the twins were taken to their position at the bottom of the American League, but still stable.) I loved the first Major League and secondly, and always looked at the third side when Indians finally went to the line. After completing the second film you can not say it is not a plan. What happened? However, if your true fan of the original Major League is helping you and you do not see this waste.
