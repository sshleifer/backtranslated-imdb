The screenwriter who wrote the film did not consult any book about her autobiography specifically about Lucille Ball. I have never seen any errors in biographical history, and she has never seen her since the early years of Celron and Jamestown in her later years. I have to write the entire list of actual errors, but it will go to the pages. In all, I believe Lucille Ball is one of the unparalleled people who just can not play anyone other than themselves. I am frustrated that Lucy Arnaz and Desi, Jr., how many mistakes have been made in this film. Motion picture producers tried hard, but this film was very bad for me.
