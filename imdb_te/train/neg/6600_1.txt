Yowza! You can feel good about this movie and for anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy, you're a better person than me! This film, however, is a great effort at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy by performing, sound and simple, revealing them, or being a picture of any substance comes too small. I blame Larry Harman. The dialogue is maddled by the other unwanted co-actors useless classification of the plot torn from dubious old L + H movies, the pin quote's oddity is strange for Stan, and while Sartain is an excellent job with the accent of Ali, he hardly create the incredible mix that Mr. Hardy tried most . Where is (good) musical number? Editing, choppy acting stiff lines are horrid-physics -implausable- (though they're trying to give that feel to cheap sets?), And the whole witness is a terrible thing. It's more painful to watch than the Atoll K, where the legendary duo did the late film in the late 1950s writing and photography. Make yourself a favor and watch a lot of ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies you can, and learn how things are. Do you know what a magnet is, do not you? <br /> <br /> "Where's the classics theme song?!? Why is the destructive 'another good mess here'? Why 'no wise man'? Why the nonsense move of classmates? Why Miss Gulch from OZ 's winner? Why should Larry Harmon be? Why Bajo! <br /> I mean, really. <br /> < br> For God,
