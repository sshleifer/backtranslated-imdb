I see a lot of movies. It was like watching the original battles of the past years. <br /> <br /> Many of us and many are "big mystery" computers in their own way. <br /> <br /> However, this is a low budget on Wednesday night. <br /> <br /> This story is very weak and you can not trust until you see the movie (which I will not recommend in the first place). Actually, I can not highlight the actor who has done a good job in this film. But hey, I'll be surprised if someone with that script is acting a good job. Lots of clich√© scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is the smallest to watch the worst movies and waste it.
