The plot of this horrific film is the twists I've put up the spoiler alert because I'm not sure if I'm giving anything away. One hundred years ago Jack the Ripper Grab sees the first person in an old man in an old age in murder. Then we're up to the modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. We gave this home an unbelievable long trip and the husband sees a man in an old mirror. There lived about 105 years. There are large iron plates on the den wall. The old restored straight-sword is when they are restored and the husband keeps it. He predicts he will have to be through the razor because he has impatient dreams. Oh, husband spaces do not have a baby because of the gunfire. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, <br /> <br /> "Delay in the story is about big cache of money & a husband body guard & a co-worker has killed and steals money, his wife is suddenly pregnant.

The only enjoyable item of this story is not just a husband who is running around in his boxer shorts for quite some time, but also this muddled, reflexious mess.
