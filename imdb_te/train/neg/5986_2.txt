Thunderbirds can not say enough to say that it's painful, forcing, your face, ugly looking, listening and reading. There are two reasons why you want to see this movie: 1; When you look at Thunderbirds, when you're younger (as I did) and how interesting it is, but you're really looking to see how hard they are. Or, 2; You see it with a person aged ten. <br /> <br /> Thanberts is conducting everything that Thanbourg is trying to do. The list goes on and on but there are more subtle, insulting things when you think about it. From Off, Thunderbirds are wrong, wrong, wrong. Jeff Tracy (a new low for Bill Paxton) tells his youngest son Alan that he has yet to be a Thunderbird and then decided to go down into Stupid: the moral message of the whole moral message and the goal of the 'island' to trigger the intestines of Thunderbird. <br /> <br /> The whole film is a series of events and mini-fires that Thunderbird is trying to prove themselves to his father and other brothers in five. Picture: A 16 year old Alan Tracy (Corbett), a 16-year-old Tin Tin (Hudgens) and 14-year-old Fermat (Fulton), the son of Bryce. There is a general description to say that watching 'adventures' is painful. Often dealing and using the script often acts as entertainment in the film duration of the ridiculously unfunny and hammy paths of evil 'hood' (Kingsley) fighting; This is different when everyone else is in a different place. In addition, the whole 'mind control' thing is very tiresome and primarily depicted and provided a way for our leaders to see the weakness in the hood. Forced and abrupt. <br /> <br /> Today, children try to integrate some kind of items for adults, but in Thunderbirds it makes fairy tales to Lady Penelope. Sofia Miles plays Penelope and is not it any coincidence that she is a little old compared to the rest of the children? At the age of 24, it is very good to be true. Her scenes are often grossly charged and a romantic push. We saw her in the bathroom, bubbles until she saw her neck TV; Her butler comes and shifts her wet, bare and bubble cups. Filling the screen in various scenes, shots on behalf of her huge, bright pink high-haired shoes: This is the first time when she's second time when a fist with another woman is fighting! It is good that her bright pink costumes are just enough, and she's moving and talking with that crazy, dominant, and English accent. The whole thing is ridiculous but the editing kids are so quick not to notice but the hell is definitely there as a commanding mistress (well, she's LADY Penelope after all ?? <br /> <br /> The original plot of the hood is that he is doing some robber banks, he's very strange, very strange to his bodyguard roles. Are we laughing at this? What about combat scenes? What is hell with poorly choreographed adventures and hellfire sounds? It's totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This list will continue. Bill Paxton plays very seriously, as they say it is on the way, and the Ford Motor Company cut off its logo everywhere. News Bulletin: Sponsored by Ford, the camera moves to approve Ford many times when the card is shot, is the way CGI finds something from a computer game video clip? This is an annoyance. The fact that a 16-year-old girl is confident that she can swim in the present terrible Thames, is a monorail (Monorail on the Thames! Save the day of his breathing It's a perfect bull and makers? <br /> <br /> Small: Avoid, Avoid The Thunderbolt is vicious, unfunny, poorly written and also taken by Rolls Royce and a flying eye Has been replaced? Everything that could be wrong is wrong.
