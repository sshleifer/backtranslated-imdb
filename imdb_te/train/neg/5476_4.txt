I do not know if this is one of the original movies on Cyfi Channel, but that's exactly what it feels like. Perhaps a quick, low-budget action film that is made very quickly, has a ridiculous effect, a dull star and a blurred star to give some brand name recognition (how many kids are affordable TV movies from 90210). <br /> <br /> Ian Zeying plays the role of Cortes, we know as a wiped out explorer of the entire population of the local people in the daring areas of North America. Here, he has not acted as a leader or sympathetic, but a thicker opportunist; If it does not rely on a historic person, his character is probably killed. In this story, Cortes is on a brief surveying mission, trying to prove he deserves financing to explore America. <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Rios, the real leader of the story, is an honorable, efficient, and clever man. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, he puts him with the opposite of Cortes, as well as the young, enthusiastic Aztec shaman. In fact, rushing to the local girl Rios, who wants to marry a heartwarming wife, increases her anger towards Spanish outsiders. So it's pretty cliche. Dinosaurs are dispatched with relative comfort. Although in the area that seems wide, the story is pretty much woods, or 95% takes place in the Aztec village, so this is not the most spectacular sight. <br /> <br /> I do not even recognize Ian Jering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an incredible accent, and somehow he disappeared. He does not appear to Spanish for the second time or make noise, but casting in every way is bad. If the film is theoretically released, he is alone without Razzie's question. <br /> <br /> Overall, unforgettable.
