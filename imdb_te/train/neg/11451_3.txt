Alright, Friends, watching all kinds of cinema, bad as well as good looks is a serious cinema hub, and the film put me in check. I can not mince words. This image is bad. The story is bad. Acting is bad. Always amazing Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this film better. Why did I really bother to see this rotten movie? Why did not I waste my time and money as anything bad I suspected? The answer is, of course, I would not be an image buff and avoid what otherwise escaped. I do not waste your time explaining what exactly is wrong in this amateur film, unless the quality of acting is polite and flat. A serious film may be willing to take responsibility for watching this film. Otherwise. Stay home, do not waste your time, read a book, get things done or have a good sandwich.
