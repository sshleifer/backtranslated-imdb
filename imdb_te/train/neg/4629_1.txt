Apparently the 1950s sriper Misty Ayers made to show "talent" talent. <br /> <br /> The fable about the sweet, innocent Sally Down (Iyer) is a little bit of storyline. Then she meets her favorite Tommy Cole, who instantly falls in love with her. He wanted to help him escape but could he? You really do not care. <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers just slow down her (twice) slowly. Other bad acting, melee "comedy" (adultery does not feel funny, but what do I know?) And a tiny short story of fierce post-doo dialogues. I did not see that I was a twist in the end but it was not enough to sit through this. Ayer's efforts are also silly in acting! The real bomb. Avoid.
