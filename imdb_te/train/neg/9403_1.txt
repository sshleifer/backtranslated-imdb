This film should not be classified as a film. Now it's over for 10 years and it has never been funded and is a blaze on the Australian Film Industry, now producing amazing images like "The Dish" <br /> <br /> Music is obscure To be, not to music, the storyline is absolutely unbearable and the struggle to sit. <br /> Do not watch this movie. It's just waste your time.
