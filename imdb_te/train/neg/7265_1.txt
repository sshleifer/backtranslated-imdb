It has seen it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid all the costs except sleep problems. This is a feature-filled movie - it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mo amour" and from there to downhill. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story Line - Smokey Robinson and the Mirlles' "The Love I In You In You Was Just a Mirage" extended from 3 minutes to 2 hours but was filled with repetition. It was like a parent when my parent was a kid for the buttless pain with the Bullsee in the Church of the Church. I'd like to pay 2+ hours in my life. Julian Hernandez's promoter commented that the film was "controversial" and only applies to the drug's influence.
