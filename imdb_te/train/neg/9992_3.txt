Ah, another unpleasant movie produced by Science Fiction Channel. As I've been shooting at least a dozen fires, as I searched for uplifting matches after the crash, especially after the crash? Without any obvious reason In different places of ruins. The fire seemed to be dominant throughout. They searched for dead bodies for lighters and matches, eventually a box fired every day, apparently, 12, but no one was collecting wood. When vegan (huh) bodies were burned, what was she used for speeding up? I mean these guys are frozen? Not good. Whatever eating, despite the clear low temperatures, blade. Perhaps it became more acceptable to me, but in totally unbelievable story (none of the survivors so far until a Himalayas, or a damned snowman, until the very end), you take care of small things. Oh, what about Progazenz (1972) related to the rest of the film? And the revolver is not enough heat, frozen and fire to hold in his hand. Gimme break. Well, at least we are Carly Pope, another greatly lavish Canadian lux. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now it's a squirrel (or rat), but it's still chicken. And the authors have lost a real chance of seeing someone else "it just tastes ..."
