Young and glamorous Japanese are again turning to some fault of curse, this time it will be mobile phones. <br /> <br /> Many people die from the disgruntled spirit behind you, so if you see 2 recent Japanese horror films, the film can be plotted in the movie that is tied to your hands. <br /> <br /> Here is the takashi mike behind the camera. So far I was more impressed with his low-key works like Lost Souls City, but I'm anxious for his renowned armor to push for Dead or Alive or overly fake-Cronemburg audition, aside from being a missed call. His films are like a blank, at least something like that, or like Thandopu Aseno, in your jerky sap like a Johnny Depp. There is no one in a missed call; <br /> <br /> But there is very little credit: acting is bland and boring in the mean, horror or suspense way too little (no, no honest) and places. Listening to jokes by Myac's glacier-like ridiculous commercial concept; Essentially, TV show intentionally dared to die, and TV programmer girls were more concerned about her ratings than her own lives. But this does not necessarily mean that the camera is behind the camera; Especially his typical visual flair has been disappeared without a trace (and his famous gore), although he has no enthusiasm for the project, but I can understand why. A missed call is not bad at all. It's just frustrating average. <br /> <br /> Mike is direct directed. With his huge annual production he is clear 100% worry about his projects. But in this regard in mind, he thought he was just a missed call for bills.
