It made a great cast with low-name-names, with big-name stars and tiny characters such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Dunloy. <br /> <br /> Now, the bad news is ....... I can not say much positive to the story. It portrays James boys in a completely positive light ... and Hollywood has since done it. It is beyond me why these criminals are always "men". The film made them glamor and their enemies - the railroad people - turned into malicious beings. The second was exaggerated. Well, the picture for you is the world: bad is good; <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a Flash - James Boys Criminals! Really - look at it!
