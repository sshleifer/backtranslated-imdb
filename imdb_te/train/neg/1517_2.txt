I'm ridiculous in this title. <br /> <br /> I explained, in my humble opinion, that the film was ruined. <br /> <br /> When Gear and Danes do their jobs, their best is not their job, it's okay. The rest of the cast is doing really poor job. Mind you, it's not entirely wrong with the actors. The problem is that Gear and Danes are the only ones that have characters that really have the slightest room in the picture to give any depth. All other characters have a very small room in the film to create any depth, or it is not such a clue that the role of the actors is difficult. <br /> <br /> Director is a bit Se7en complex, but looking just in the direction, I think he does a OK job. <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in both ways. The first is a bad movie script. The characters are deep (except Garees and Danes characters), villains cliches and characters are completely reliable. In addition to this, the writers have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics for over a hundred years. Some criminals still claim to be criminals, even though they paid the price paid by the community to them. There is also a film that says that each form of sexual abuse should be punished without trial, judge or jury. <br /> <br /> According to the film, everything that is not sexually replaced by a married couple is sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a movie, a bad script, or if you want to write scripts yourself and boost an ego. Look at this. For everybody, I recommend another film.
