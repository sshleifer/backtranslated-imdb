In this movie Science Fiction 50-Pack comes to my friend for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozill movie and features scenes for a real scene with American actors, as the film. An interesting fact about the embedded scenes is the Cold War tension filmed between America and Russia. Gazeera is close to Tokyo as in Godzla, gazier is awakened by a nuclear eruption and destruction around the world, because no big monster is completed if Tokyo does not move. All in all, this is ok film. Some scenes with gabera, especially the scenes in Tolley, are very spectacular and have special effects that are pretty good at that time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you'll really get a kick out of this. I give it to 4 to 10. This was a Japanese version that I did not see, which probably got 5.
