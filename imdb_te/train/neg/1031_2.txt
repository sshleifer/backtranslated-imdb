This film is the longest chic after another. Although they first made their stake, there is a dubious visual scene where Yod adds as an idiot. Bullets and accents are terrible. They sounded older beetle cartoons worse. John Dusty, Envy, Room Homosexual, Slave to Yoko He is portrayed as a notable Albert Goldman book. They often have song titles in the conversation, "it's only two of us"! John does not understand his fans like this. If he's anything like his death, it's great. A mute Beatle fan only recognizes John and a funny scene where Paul asks him to sing on Friday. The insulted John "I'm certain and I'm falling on your knees, putting on your wife's wig and laughing my lignin with me". It laughs for me days. Really funny is how funny it tries when it comes off ridiculous. John and Paul do not even sit in pontificating throughout the day, they are also funny lightly cheerful boys who break even during the Beatles filmed here more personality. Forget this.
