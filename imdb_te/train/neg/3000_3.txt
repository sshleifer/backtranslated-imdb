The school drunkard Marty (Simon Scudamore) is sexually exploited by some classmates and his face is in a laboratory blast scarred by acid. A few years later, all the geras are re-invited to high school (after closing) for a reunion. They do not know that Marty is inviting them to kill them. Then a storm begins, they are locked up in school and Marty gets a vengeance. <br /> Pretty crazy. There are murders innovation and some creepy weather shots of the school of ghrey and desert - but about it. Spurgeon's loss of insults is cruel (he is removed, his head sinks and burns in a toilet) and is just uncomfortable to watch. A few days after this release, it is impossible to view them as suspected of suicide. Also the film will lead to nudity. Skudgare (what a surprise to the movie) is full before but a girl decides to bathe alone ... after learning that a killer is turning around after them! And then there is a couple having sex. This is the type of movie where the killer goes to everybody. It ends with my eyes closed and rolling twist, then I want to throw something into the twist on something else! Acting is bearable - not good but bearable. Caroline Munro is also in this. <br /> <br /> She is a very beautiful lady but not many actresses. Otherwise it is a mill and can not be forgotten. Scuddamor's tragic suicide has given more attention to the film.
