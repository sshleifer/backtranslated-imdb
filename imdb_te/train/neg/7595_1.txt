"Ask Dust" looked mystery from the trailer, and we especially liked all of the actors. Unfortunately, this film is not perfect enough to be considered a drama, it is not as fun as comedy. It's practically sarcastic, not entertaining. Seventy minutes after waiting to improve this stuff, my wife and I went out and did not waste some time during such nonsense. It's not just curious, moving, funny or artistic. It is written, directed and directed by a high school kid; Worse yet, it's an insulting waste of exceptional talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
