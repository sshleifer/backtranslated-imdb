I'm a fan of Nightmare series but this one is terrible. Deaths are sophisticated. After 20 years you will go through the entire Nintendo scene. I did as a flashback. I think he should have done the prequel about when he's still alive. More interesting. This is an image you can take or leave. Depending on how much space you have.
