... deliberately badly bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem MST3k was shot directly on the big screen. While this is clear, the film is not trying to take too seriously (hopefully their goal, anyway ...), the film is still bad. Hell, it makes Leprechaun big budget in space ... <br /> <br /> Smallest: My Muscle car hay painted in color!
