What is this I have never heard of a Zombie film produced by the Canadian. A dead young man recently works on the body of a deceased boy. This allows for an extended past showing how the guy got there. Generally, he and his friends went to Friday cemetery on Friday 13th and died for his death. Our dead body comes back to life and kills the dying and the owner (his eyes will pop). The last WTF? The shot is directly the owner of the funeral home in the jacket and is tight, "I'm not crazy!" <br /> When running a younger 58 minutes, it's definitely a fantasy in the zombie cinema. It's too long, but keep me in some kind of trance that I can not stop seeing. The film also says, "If you see this picture, turn it off from the screen". It is an old man's image of sick in a theater (prophetic?) And when he begins to flow out (just twice) out of blood. The scenes are beautiful at times. When a zombie pulls a fake hand into the frame to chomp on - a great gaffe, where a zombie with a shovel right hand chops - it's left hand.
