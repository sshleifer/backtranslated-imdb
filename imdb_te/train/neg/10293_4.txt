My wife and I have seen the movie every Friday. There are tons of patience for the films I'm slow to blossom. My wife doubled the attention I made. All that is said - this picture is just empty space and boring! It did not go anywhere. Never blossomed. It started very strong with a good plot ... then she bakes her cookies ... goes to Spain .... she sulks, she stares .... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, unfolding & dead ends. We looked off into the FF'd just by space through the very stretched sequences. The artificial depth she was playing with her mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a pretty shot chic-flick playing a deep or artist. You never know or can not understand mororn. You do not care about just half of yourself. We want to see at least one of the plot lines. Do not waste your time at this time. I've scored scores too.
