After coming up, I came to a conclusion: Director and screenwriter JB Harold woke up with the intention of laughing at the audience, the simplest fact is that the film is filled with humorous content. Wavek has plots of holes, and the ridiculous and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform uses the sense of the main character ... a doctor's devil left on the floor?) The concept behind the film is a little bit intelligent but with all the plots holes and absurd things make this stupid and crappy image . With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors bring bad shows. Hayden Christensen is for zero expressions and for Jessica Alba. The outstanding actor Terence Howard makes a smile to a very wasted spectator. It is impossible to take up the most ridiculous and absurd completeness. My Recommendation: Skip this bad image.
