There are two points I need to get clear clearance at the outset. First of all we all know about this year's Oscar's all this year. The Academy's way of showing people is not racist, and never had. They wanted to clear all their previous feelings. Secondly, it is highly desirable to make comments about the show, because, what is the difference? But, writing about it is fun. This year I became the Oscar's soft! I do not see the show again. Every year they do something. Before achieving Crowe achievements for "Gloddieter" when the real winner for "Sunshine" was Ralph Fiennes. If you do not see this movie yet, just watch it and you will agree. Nominations did not receive "Ice Wide Shut" when released. And this year's going, well, bad options are all over the place! Baj Lurman's "Best Director" Nomination Not Available! Are you joking Has "Beautiful Mind" Nominated "Training Day" for "Best Makeup"? The picture is awful, and Washington also seemed like to turn in a show, all he has proven, he knows how to use four letter words! That award was won! Remove the language and bet he's almost playing! I liked "Gassord Park", I really did, but why not the 7 nominations? And how on earth they could not give too much alman! I mean, what about Altman if you want to give people an award to get rid of any bad feelings? The man is now 32 years old and there is no Oscar in public view! There are a lot of things that make me feel very sad about this year's Oscars, but if I do not want to see the show again, I'll live with me! The show's high point (and only one) when the first performance of the Woody Allen Award was presented. He will go down as one of the greatest moments in show history.
