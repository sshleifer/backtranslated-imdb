SNL is pretty funny but a little dumb minded for people like watching a small skit in the SNL. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Header, but fails. Jon Hayder in Napoleon Dynamite Andy makes his hardest effort though he is funny and he feels funny. <br /> <br /> The funny people in this movie are Danny McBride and Bill Hodder. <br /> <br /> If they do not scene the shot for 3 minutes, they will do well "Quiet Area". <Br /> <br /> He becomes more and more repetitive for his H's. They are going too long and he appears half an hour when Andy plays ... He is not a desperate star and deserves to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is for the general minded people with a joke and a brain 10 year old's level of comedy. Nearly half of the United States.
