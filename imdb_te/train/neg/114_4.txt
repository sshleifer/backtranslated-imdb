Its not a cast. A good group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, we are all there! Vada Allen has not improved what Boddodovich did here. If you fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is a place to go. No problem with the picture, no problem. Nothing. Actors are falling in love at first glance, words are unnecessary. What happens when the director's own experience in Hollywood is going to work in the set. It is true to him, and his colleagues, but for many of us in the real world it's a fantasy. So, finally, the image is empty, and shallow, and message-less.
