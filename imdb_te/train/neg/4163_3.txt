Some people who participated in this interruption have written reviews to share the story, and helped me to understand what they wrote. The fact that they have basically given excuses - will rewrite, budget restrictions, product formats, etc. - indicates how the film is bad. And it's not that I have personally directed my criticisms of panning, but it's just a warning that this warning is not cut. <br /> It's worth watching, but just doing that. Each corner has plots of holes, boundaries on the dialogue boundaries, far from a mile. The simplest interesting feature of a hologram that communicates with a recon team sinks in a silly conversation, making it a mid-meal meal that feels like a long and deadly combination of an unknown enemy. Some of us will have to hug us up with hamburger helper Sally, to kill this automated carpet sweepers among us? There is no access to the MREs with this giant elite team, which has the latest gizmos and strange shield with red plastic tubes. They enter in the final rooms once they see a four-star motel than a deadly encounter zone. <br /> <br /> The principle for the encounter with the fearsome rock is not the same one. A scene ago, in that case, the hero left the king to do the job correctly. Huh? Vivian woo was attractive and lost the best acting role in the film. But do not tell too much.
