There are no questions of spoilers for the film, the director defeated us all and damaged the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> The frightening of such things as critics and gremlins is a lot of levels to recover the humor and horror of improved films. This is a time when bad actors, idiot directors deliver a bad conversation before them and occasionally eat toys on them. Old Tarzan films that use rubber crocodiles, as well as throwing toys, threw them out and threw them out and made their best efforts to intimidate them. <br /> <br /> In general, some silly small aliens trapped in an old age security guard in the film will eventually be liberated after years of detention, and begins with telepathic talk to people's minds. Guards are a new candidate, despite repeated warnings, idiot gets together with his gang of 80's friends and they have little adventures to go off trying to take over Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, a dirty head joke, a friend of his 80's, a caterpillar of the hero and a prince's girlfriend, and a young hero, who is unfaithful and wants his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The first off-the-military military joke comes with the infamous Rick Combat scene, where he shows how he trained an army that is a bully, poking an attractive leader with a ruck wrong conclusion for what seems like hours. Then some people walk around, with the comedy hand-grenade in a subtle nightclub ending in a true top-fight style, all of which blown up all the way to the right side. Then the picture ends with the sarta, and all ends well. <br /> This is not the case. It's like looking at the ruins of the train, your eyes can not be removed, it's very bad. Perfect fare for mystery science theater, but god-awful you should try to see it alone and not cut. Fashion Police still has many unusual warrants for casting, and I dare anyone to ridicule ridicules ridiculed in rack fight. These scores are very good in 10 days and 2.
