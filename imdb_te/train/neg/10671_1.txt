MST 3000 should make this film. It's the worst movie I have ever seen. Initially, the shooter went out of the Army in 1993 and knew that he did not have any bank account paying his rent. There is no way in hell, such a person can finally get to the president. Also, the head of security for POTHUS is not so emotional that he will begin to drink into a fog if the president is shot. This film sucks. I can not express extremte that movie. Every actor is terrible. Even at the trailer park chic. I'm ruining this trash. What time is vain?
