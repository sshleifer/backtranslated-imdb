There are plenty of unknown movies or films that gave me bad reviews that I really liked. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> It used camera techniques that I enjoyed just like watching a soap opera. It was ludicrously predictable and left asking you what took a very picture to get going "it?". I decided that I should not take the film very hard, and I saw it was totally enjoyable. This is still a picture wound on the MST3000.
