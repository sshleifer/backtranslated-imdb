This film is ridiculous. It is great for anyone to say acting and the cast is amazing, and it has never seen normal movies. Acting in the first 5 characters you met is apparently terrible. Lame. I feel like all other "alongside" comments are made by people involved with filmmakers. I'm not too impressed by the storyline, but just want to look at some pretty Oregon rural, and there's some good cinematography - but casting is anything but inspiration. This film of the superior instruction is usually also that the deeper thing in Amerindian culture is lost and perhaps lost and it is worthwhile and possible to restore. It's wrong and puts jokes at all very clear places, and makes me think it's written by the State Department or something. Back drawing board. The film also suggests that it can have the same place in classics such as Harold and Madd, and the movie is dominant and begging and vengeance and "joking" is similar.
