Generally I was not motivated to write reviews. But this film is a painful feeling I feel. I was surprised by the sudden speculative plot, dumb and laughed over time. Indeed, many viewers seem pretty bored and chatty even at the moment of the film "a long time". Molly Ringwold became the only performer of Merit in the production of torture. At the end is not "twist" itself. I said that I did not get the film seriously. But I did not find small testimonies in this film. <br /> <br /> Cutting room should be cut in the floor. Help yourself and spend your time and money on a different one!
