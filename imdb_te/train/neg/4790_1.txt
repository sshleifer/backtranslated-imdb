I hate this movie. The original fantasy has amazing atmosphere and mystery. As many as 70 horror flicks, it looked and looked like some creepy, incomplete documentary. From the late 80s, Phantas II pumped the action, but maintained this good look to the mood. Sadly, Phantas III is just awful. It describes all the strange events in previous movies which are frustrating, which can decrease their power and expansion. It is the easiest way to remove the image from the first phantom, like the original cheap restructuring. The film has a lot of flying planets, which are more likely to be home pests than death orbits. Christmas balls in the draft hang hundreds from the roof. Is not anyone - Prop Master, DP, editor, director - have they seen crummy so notice or care? Even worse, Phantom III offers a bland and intrusive joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantom death used humor to relieve its relentless focus. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about the horniness of Reggie: See the "flying balls" ha-ha of many film, oh, I get the balls. Perhaps the band came out of these jokes, but they were us.
