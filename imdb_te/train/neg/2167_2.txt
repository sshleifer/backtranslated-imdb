Die For (1989) is just another d.t.v. In the early nineties, a feature found in cable ad nauseum. The last film featuring Dunne Jones is the only thing to note about this feature. There is no one to watch this Vampire Flick unless you like the fake chick flicks of this horror movie. A tired Vampire long love for love and L.A. Will search the streets behind. <br /> Does he succeed in the last century or Vlad is hanging again? <br /> <br /> This image should be too large. They're so bad to make this one look like a classic. <br /> <br /> I know this is a film about vampires, but I know that filmmakers have been able to use lighting. <br /> I do not recommend myself because I do not like it.
