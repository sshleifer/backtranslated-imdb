Five-year-old Michael dies after his serial killer's father "The Highway", dies and then suicide. Seven of his friends invited her friends after "20 years" from Mike (Gyodon Carrie, Puppet Masters 4 and 5). Morty, a life-size wooden toy placed in the attic through an Indian handicraft, has the soul of the dead father and kills them using their fears. The letters are thrown in a window, sunk in the toilet, mice eat, blast, etc. Walking around the morpheter morals into the father and the tree, stupid gnanikarks do. <br /> <br /> Mordie design is great and surprisingly joyful as the grandmother of Betsy Palmer (from Mrs. Vurius) is the grandmother of the 13th), but the subject is more odd and confusing than the original, and the worst fears, bad acting, brain-dead characters , Replay flashback footage and unpleasant twisted camera-work. Plus only two minority characters (Indian and a half black girl) are the first to die. Blah!
