Some Gorehound-Friends recommended me "Live Feed", mainly because I can not really complain because this film will definitely make up the gross smoothes and buckets, but this is not a good movie. Ryan Nicholson, who is known as Torture Porn, tries to overcome every other movie in this subgenre rather than explicitly participating in the latest trends in horror film (and roll modeles of "Hostel" and "Saw" novel co-eds and distorted make-up effects The shots, trying to bother and begging for their life I do not know why they have chosen Asian origins but instead of Kenkan, they are not interested in the culture of continents and they also have a serious scene when they see a cute puppy dog ​​native butchering in the market Dead night after Quintet A girl is breasting her breast and another poor bite has also shoved her throat off a poisonous serpent; Oh, no. "Live feed" is surprisingly boring though it's hard to ignore all the bloodshed and amateur product values, even though you're used to looking at such a fan-boss movie. The fat smoke drawn on the cover, an oriental S & M hangover, is very good and he is the most talented of the whole bunch, because he keeps at least the whole mouth shut his mouth. I certainly do not recommend this pile of subduction, but hey, if you like loud and bizarre metal music, disgusting torture footage and dimmer lasers, right forward and watch!
