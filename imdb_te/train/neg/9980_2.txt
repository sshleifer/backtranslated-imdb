Do not waste your time 90 minutes in "Fast Food, Fast Women". The annoyingly episodic script with three story lines gone together is laughably bad due to the fictional writing, horrific acting, and bad music. Anorexic main character was perplexed to see every time I was on the screen. She needs fast food. <br /> You can spend 90 minutes with this turkey. You have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Lewis Laser is the only ransom for the film. <br /> <br /> She is acting as a big lawyer in the film. <br /> Watch out for the viewer!
