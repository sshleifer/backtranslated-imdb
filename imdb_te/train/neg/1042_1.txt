First of all, write the script on a handkerchief. Who needs more than that? After all we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> Then get amateur actors. It will be good for festive hype. After all, who need people who spent years honing their craft? Then, do not know how to light a cinematographer to take. If you light up, it's not "real" and festive people do not like it. Who should have professional level photography anyway? You should never appoint your 10-year-old camera as your operator. Festival screens for the "reality" make mistakes and a little thick "intellectual" shouts of real people, critics and audiences. <br /> <br /> When you're done, buy your ticket for Bad Movies or Sundance Festival. <br /> <br /> The sad waste.
