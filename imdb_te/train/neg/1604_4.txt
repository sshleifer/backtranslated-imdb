You should remember the picture that you have seen in the past, which does not fit the same feelings as an adult. What happened to me when I went to school? National lampoon class reunion. There is a perfect opportunity to laugh at the film, but when it finds the bizarre collection of characters, he can sell his soul to the devil, shoot fire flames from her mouth, a vampire, and a lunatic wearer as a woman and wearing socks on his head. You have a classmate president who believes that you are the best from the sliced ​​bread (but as we see in the film, he is a coward and joke) and a pair of pat smokers, they do not even know that they are in their own class reunion, and that even a guy named Gary knows I know (no one can recognize his name .. this is a joke that I enjoy). A bumper, deaf and blind woman who liked to catch women in unwanted places, and Cook (who you call her from "Goesy" and "Mama Throw from the Train") liked to put food on the plates of the people with her hands when she called for her dog! They talked about a nutkus (or at least trying to) retaliate on his companions, and they talked about him (they were set to sleep with his own twin sister). The film kills the darkness and follows the characters to search for the killer in the old high school's trash hall. As he says of the killer by his psychologist, he is a little bit nasty. The film has some good clothes (pretty early), but the film slowly gets worse every passing minute. The real problem of the film is that it does not know where to go. The film is a joke place for everyone, which is really in the right direction. If it's really in any direction. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but they do not just have the interest to make it funny. It has a Curio for fans of the early 80s comedy relics forgotten (this one is herself).
