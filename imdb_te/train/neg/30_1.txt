Since 1987 I did not like the idea of ​​a female turtle, their teacher splinter and four brothers with their enemies and four of the four brothers did not play any meaning or any significant part of Venus or Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello and I think the old TMNT series is Venus more than new Believing a male turtle we can not add any action to the story we love story of TMNT There's a good point to have some action to know in 1987 to have new enemies in the episode but it is a very weak point to have some action with a female turtle, we want to see the TMNT series more new in 1987 that same roles that we know without the turtle of that woman.
