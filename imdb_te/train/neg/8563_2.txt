This is what the title of this thread says. The only role that I got from that movie was ever angry, so cynical, and pathetic. Her character's first date with William Hurst was dumb that they were dancing. For all, I tried to finish watching the film four times, four times I fell asleep. In order to overcome my problem with insomnia, I will continue to watch the movie with a picture because it makes sleeping. Sweet dream.
