Not only do they get all the dirty with the letters, only the scripts are really raw, the authors seriously get only the boyfriends, but it seems like it was primarily created for ages 1-6, not only suck. This episode I've seen as "A Mother of Family" seen in this program because I liked the role of Robin. And sometimes I feel like a simple copy of the Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, are you friends with Bruce Harvey Dent, yes? Over two episodes, he becomes two villains and villains. Friends with Bruce Euthan Guy in "The Show", and in the two episode stories, he translates in the unleavened villain cliffface. This is a small example (it may not even be true), but in short, it's the worst attempt in the Batman series. And it says something.
