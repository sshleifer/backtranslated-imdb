"The HAZing" is one of the films I want to see only based on an illustrated cover image in the IMDB. Yes, how deep it is! I do not care if it's a worst picture for ten million people, and I'll have to see it because the poster looks great. Now, "The Having" is somewhat described as its alternate title: interesting! The poster and title camp set a true horror movie and it sounds no good dealing with bad start rituals, but this film is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. First of all, it's very wrong with the tagline in the old VHS box I've seen. It says: He's good grades, a good girl and good friends ?? The director Gilbert Louise is finally accepted by the campus acclaimed by Athletics scholarship. His friend is back home and "Buddy" he is very attractive with Charles Martin Smith (still with the hair in the film), both of whom are the prestigious "delt's" brotherhood To be members, but they themselves Barney will fall on a cliff and break his leg when the mountain passes through the tumultuous test during the tests. When Lewis returns with other frat boys, Barney is already frozen with death.Barney's body cafeteria has to cover him in the freezer, so Barney's absence No doubt, "the heyday" set up too The original tune is a black color for the comedy film, but there is no proper effort to thrill a suspense or thrill.The soundtrack is full of delightful and light-headed tunes, But this film is not enough to make comedy. For about an hour in the film, the plot also comes out of steam and ideas, and there is no substitute for manufacturers to fill vacuum with biking with his outsider girlfriend biking through Lewis' sex workshops and rural areas. I did not like the last twist because it was very fatal and because it was done several times before and after (though after approval). "The Hayzing" is not a complete waste of time, but I'm still glad I found a rent tape at a friend's house instead of spending any money on a recent release DVD.
