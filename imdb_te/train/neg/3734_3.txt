A really muddled incomprehensible mess. Most of the films in the movie appear to be more or less like 1987, but then we have thrown strange things like police guns. And that car! The director appeared in love with colorful lights. The only girl who plays Valerie is really popular, but I do not know the actress, because there is no cast. This is a missing value. Grade: F
