Bill Maher's religiousism is not an attack on organized religion. Christianity and Islam. In addition to deceiving a group of Rabbis, he does not really attack Judaism and Rabbi actually challenges when he challenges Israel's presence, revolving around the Sabbath rules. If Bill Maher follows his theory to his logical conclusion, Israel's creation of the Palestinian lands is based on the 'Sacred Scriptures' of organized religion. <br /> <br /> This is evidence that the film is completely absent or focused on the production of the film. <br /> I believe that the man is an atheist or intelligent man. Anyone can go to a religious person, laugh at them and call their beliefs stupid but do you need to give them back? Why does he think he's stupid? What was the "rational" person in his room? <br /> If he is not really true and ends up in the process of being stupid in this process. <br /> How can you really harm the religion's true evil and religion human civilization, Richard Dawkins's "Root of All Evil?" See. <br /> <br /> Bill Mehr's religion is not funny, there is no question of interesting questions or no insight into the controversial issue. It's an old man's novels and Rawes who are dissatisfied with his Catholic repertoire. I almost forgive him.
