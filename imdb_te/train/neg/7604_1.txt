It certainly happens in the West, but the title looks like it's traditional Western. Instead, it is a female sheriff image. It's a bad thing about a woman sheriff but make no mistake. She is the sheriff when her husband is wiped out; The only tad bit she is dissatisfied with. Her main goal is to go after a woman villain, but the villain hires a man to kill her. So it happens, the hero falls in the killer and mutual love. Correctly stupid, thanks to the new sheriff for the dead in the film. She has more than a few chances to keep the killer behind bars, but I guess because she likes because she likes to do it. The killer is also for personal reasons to be mute even after the mayor of the town. This film is really boring and really not worth looking at ... they are not one of the good parts of MST3000. I can not imagine anyone seeing them because it makes it more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but people should come to the same place and come out of the other and he should know better.
