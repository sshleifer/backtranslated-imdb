What is the purpose of this film? I suggest actors and their producers and director have to show some to do a big payday nothing. My favorite actor, Bruce Dern, was unable to keep my interest in this boring movie. A braindead former pugilist comes with an unnatural woman and her relatives. He was a solution to the woman, and was beaten by a man and caught up in kidnapping. I can not even write a good criticism as it is very confusing. If you see this, make sure that my sweetness is dark, so you are right to sleep.
