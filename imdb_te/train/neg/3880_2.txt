I can see a good ghoth picture now and then. I saw some unhealthy things. However, this is one of the few films I find strange and revolving in the film. I love Gore movies when they are fun. I like that they are very creative in them. Gore is not creative in this film. It is sick. It's unpleasant. It's completely unpleasant. Because of this, this film is definitely not entertaining. This film is a horror movie, but it is not afraid. That is why the film is the reason for Gore, but it's rare and ugly in the whole movie, and it says so much. Performance is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and WAY is a very electronic sound. It took me all the film correctly. Pretty much the entire movie is a big long discouraging. This guy has an unnatural accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to find that his skin is melting and melting off. I assume that I eat and eat human flesh to reduce melting process. An old couple has some weird sublates accompanying a dog, some headaches falling upside down, and ends with electrifying a person. There are times when I have tried hard to enjoy it, but the scene in the whole movie is also entertaining, and in the beginning a nurse slowly drives the hospital corridor in motion. If you like ugly, nasty, unpleasant horror movies, it's for you.
