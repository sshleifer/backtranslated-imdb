Um ... Ok, I guess I'm going through the whole moving-cum-gorilla-style shooting technique, but unfortunately I think I can make a gorilla better film ... this thing is just crazy. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story and horror cinematography. I never know how this dirty piece was released, but it is unfortunately I have seen. Greg Swinson and Ryan Thyssen (Harry and Lloyd), portraying the film "Blair Witch" in Tennessee, directed by "Five Across the Eyes", but the small one comes ... it's the nose calf on a hill. These young people were really upset, I promised them Hollywood stardom, but this dung ended up in a pile. The dialogue is ridiculous, and it will aggravate you when you hear it. Another mystery is how this horror movie is. It's nothing remotely scary about it, except for the fact that I've seen it ... try this in size: 5 of you and 1 mile, make her mat and beat her ass ... "The End". <br /> I looked for free, and wanted to get my money back.
