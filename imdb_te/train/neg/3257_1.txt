The first question that arises in my mind after seeing this film: Is it sarcastic or not? After reading a few comments about the character Dac Savage and the comic series, I know that this film is not contradictory. So, the story tells that an American-American super-dock has protected the South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But it comes in a dubious way, it becomes ridiculous. Compulsory end-combat will show the worst performance of martial arts I've ever seen. This film may be a good example for low budget film designers.
