Nothing in this movie is funny. I want to give a randy Ram's libido a man, in the premise, for interesting and some laughs. Wrong! There is nothing funny about the film. For example, the main character making a pass in a goat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it is the obscenity boundary. <br /> <br /> In this film they are parasites in a film, which is just fun. <br /> <br /> We know that dogs can eat at anytime, anytime. The main character doing this everywhere is not funny everywhere. It becomes a cliche. <br /> <br /> I'm in the role of Rob Schneider. This means that he is not a bad actor, but it is difficult to comment on quality with rotten material. However, Kohli Huskel suffers from the rest of the human-romantic leads (the number of animals interested in romantic leads to the main character?), The whole thing suffers, as well as her. She has acted in some kind of vacuum, which seems to be separated from all other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored with unflattering, dull, repetitive material, watch this movie.
