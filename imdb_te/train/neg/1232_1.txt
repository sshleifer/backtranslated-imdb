A girl named Susan Montfort wrote and directed this "movie". She has no other credit for her name in writing or directing. She made a serious professional mistake in choosing her career. This is one of the most deadly humans of the millennium. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you leave her mall, she will reach four piles when she is surrounded by a mall. Tell me, what's the woman who makes a fierce attacker and insult them with words? I did not understand it after the invasion began, and it's totally normal for anyone to fight back. But she drew that guy and pretty much rose to the next level. 1) If you do not have a weapon 2) There is a confidence to know that the backup is very close and is relatively safe from such harm, or 3) she is very beautiful for the attacker, she can take them. Nothing in this situation does not apply, so she acted as someone who wanted to be raped or innocent. And by the way, when the security guard arrives, when he comes inside seeing Kim Basinger distance, why not immediately run to him for help, or scream? <br /> <br /> When she was walking on the security guard's head, she went into a deserted part of town and crashed. As she walked in the direction of the diagonal behind the houses, facing up and running, she began to encounter underneath the hood, receiving her a redbackbox. <br /> <br /> I do not even say whether this is a chronological summary of the film. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ***** Trying to penetrate into the darkness? When she is found, she asks one of the jokers to open a toolbox. At first it prevents her and finally opens it. And it takes a wrench. This scene was filled with complete failure of dramatic effect, which I had to break down, it was one of the scenes that could be played in full movie. When she was asked to open the box, she fought with some of them to open some angers after opening it, and some of the action film had some of the device that the opponent had demanded to tap / push / open / manipulate the person, and once the hero refused to open it, The device is automated As a chemical to render on / face, he is unconscious, the hero's scheme is all in it. It feels like they have tried to work with Kim Basinger, which dramatically opens the toolbox and then runs out with a renewed and reveals one of the thugs and somehow throws him and another three thugs. ** For the rest of the area, the supporter of this suburban house carries her red toolbox, which she uses as a weapon weapon. <br /> <br /> When she flew away, where did she go to the slum? I feel the scene in the radio on the radio that I am paying for a dead man. <br /> Lastly, the whole campus was very weak because she chased her for the first time because the thugs' perspective was a witness to a murder against her predecessor, so they had to kill her. How ridiculous it is. As one of the thugs said, they only reached the left city and they could not turn back any city, but no one saw them, and she probably did not get a license plate. If these opportunities do not work in their favor, how can someone kill them to increase your chances of raising the hell and to improve your chances of staying away from the original murder?
