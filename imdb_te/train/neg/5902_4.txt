I hoped the movie was completely dumb. There is no amusing pleasure to be entertained with such a low expectation. <br /> <br /> There are so many things about singles ward, they are totally annoying. The whole movie was watching poorly when dubbing and listening to their voices was a lot of people bothering. <br /> <br /> The film is well-organized in Mormondom, especially in college communities with singles ward. Nevertheless, there is no hope for the poor losers who have not been able to marry themselves. (The only girls in the Singles ward are married, not fat, ugly, but all vicious men) Finally the whole movie is a statement for LDSSingles.com
