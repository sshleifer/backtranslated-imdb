This film is an example of what can not be done for students. This is a terrible catastrophe breaks the cardinal regime of Bruceheemer's paintings: we all know it, but they have great actions. This image is NO ACTION. This film is boring. Where are the cars? Where is the chase Where is the tension? Where is the suspense? Where's the rush? Where !! ?? It's not really a movie, it's a bad trade. 50 cars in 24 hours? That's wrong. For 3 days to steal them, the statement is wrong. How bad is it? Acting leads, tight wood and forced. The villain, the police, the others ... who cares. They tell their nonsense lines, they provide unmatched plots. "We do not worry that we will make too fast cuts," or "we are loud music" "script" is not really a script at all, it's like a list of clich√©s with an end to the whole ripoff: - ----- Alert - Possible Spoiler ------ 5 ------ 4 ----- 3 ----- 2 ----- 1 ---- - Fugitive. Vinnie Jones is the man's biggest crime .... This pale, nice moufo from Jules in Pulp Fiction. And what do they do! They rarely make a mute in the film! Winnie the main villain and he could save the film. How will they become dull? How? How? Why? The original film finally gets the driver and finally entertaining with the cool trick. The original has a great 40 minute chase! Go find the original. Or if you wish some real car chase action Ronin rented. Running in the rowin bars got up and chased other cars. Could Brookheimer and Cage not come close to matching all the money, all the resources, that experience, and the image they've made 25 years ago for $ 250,000? How will it be? After watching this movie you feel like you emerged. I'm excited to see Coyote once, remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor, and now I say: God helps us all. <br /> <br />
