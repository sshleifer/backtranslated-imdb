Let's see. At the end of the "St Elles Wear" we have found no hospital and every thing is in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended by telling us that it was a dream. And ended with telling us that "Rosenne" was in her mind. Very "creative". The breaking is very high. Yes, it's just a TV program and not actually. It ends up wanting you at least believe that it is "real" when you get caught up in a great movie or TV show. At least the reality is portrayed on the screen. The series finale was made twice this kind and the old hat was disappointing and was not fun to watch. Now "Newhart" all dreams? At least in the creative intent that surpasses expectations with anyone who likes the show. The idea is not too engrossed, but it has been brilliantly ever since it was the best series finale ever. Roosevely betrayed me after becoming such a loyal fan.
