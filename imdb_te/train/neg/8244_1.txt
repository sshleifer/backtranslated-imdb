I wanted to make this film astonishing. But the only way to be so surprised is how does it all come about suddenly? This is a one and a half hours of violence. <br /> <br /> The main characters are sure to get their bloody pieces in a bad way, the film. And I like (usually) horror-imagery. I do not have any problem with these kinds of films. But all the violence in the film works no end. It's no dinner other than just grotesque. It is very dull, it's very boring and really very quick. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is the Blair Witch project about the film by shooting with low hand-held cameras. But (again, this also works) no end. In "Blair Avi", there is definitely an explanation, they are a camera they are looking for for Blair witch. In this movie, there is no other explanation: "We wanted to see this Blair Witch!" The sound in this film is also something to be discouraged about. You can not say that they are talking many times when the girls are rarely screaming. <br /> Finally, there is soundtrack, it's so bad, cheap euro-<br /> <br /> My advice: Do not look at any conditions.
