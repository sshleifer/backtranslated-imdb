I have seen this movie a long time ago ... Fortunately it is free. I must be one of the twenty people who have seen this movie in the theater. I do not remember the whole bunch, but I do not remember too bored, the plot is no sense and the only thing I can say when I come out of the theater is at least now I have never seen what the worst picture is. I just suffered a lot by just one thing: if they were able to reach the low enough sun for survival if they could make the temperature, would they not all refuse it to be a hot temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How do we stupid
