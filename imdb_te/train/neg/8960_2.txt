Writing this review is the only thing I often pop into my head, and I will never back that hour and a half !!! (Air and hyper cube) for other movies! Cube was not great but it was original and created some technical errors! The Hyper Cube lost the benefit of a sequel to reality but came out looking pretty pretty sharp and I also liked better than cube (the story is better)! But the cube zero is actually sh * t! The absence of good fx, too much f * ck * d script and just plain old bad acting does not mix well! Example: I thought it was very stupid all the time in the movie ... it should be done and that may happen, so this is not the case! My suggestion: I miss the lost hour and a half !!!!!!!! Oh and I hope this film crashes and burns !!!!!!!
