The plot seemed absolutely interesting enough. How can the brutal murder of real life become really boring image? <br /> <br /> I heard about Wonderland murders, the film was released and this is some of the interesting stories of honest people who are honest. Unfortunately, the zero character is developed, so it is possible to understand why this has happened or can not get a good sense of interconnections between characters. The speed of the direction is very tedious. <br /> <br /> Don Schiller plays an important role in Holmes' love interest, in which Holmes's wife was a consultant, to get some true insight into the characters.
