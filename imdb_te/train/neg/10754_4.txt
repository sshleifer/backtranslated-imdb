As I waited to go with tickets to my hand, I imagined an interesting science fiction fantasy film about robot-technology, which I was disappointed with every subject, and the effects this year is worse in my opinion is not a boring plot. I was also disappointed by the film, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, and I changed her performance from "Black in Men", which was only successful with my opinion. He was forced to retire, without scattering his name with names such as "I, Robot" and "Black in Men 2". 4/10
