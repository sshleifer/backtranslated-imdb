I have made positive comments about this movie. <br /> There are plenty of cartoon characters - Sue Fowel-Mouthead, Alcoholic, Labout, Irish father is a prime example. None of the characters are distant sympathies - for Sue's Asian boyfriend, briefly, but he also becomes home violence! I do not know that they both are not very attractive and they disagree with Rita and / or Sue, even in a very close crypt like Bob - but what would they do, what would they want me to do? Most reviews are tilted on how "real" is. If that is true, there is no reason to be a reflection of the society but to keep it on the film. <br /> I do not like the movie.
