I do not know what this film is about- director Sam Mraovich something messed up about every little factor in this film. I'm not saying this film should not exist, but this film may be the most important of all time. The film should only be without doubt the 'The Worst Movie Ever Made'. <br /> <br /> I saw evil images in my life, but I thought it was very bad as I thought it was. </ P> <p> <br /> Everything in the film is so happy and is considered a great film. <br /> Oh wait!
