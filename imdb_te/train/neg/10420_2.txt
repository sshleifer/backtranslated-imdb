Well, I know that many people refuse this review because the water is shipping down "classic" and a classic part of many people, but I must admit seeing this film at the age of 18: <br /> <br /> My sister Read, really enjoyed, and many were surprised at the words "water ship down". Children and their emotions have torn at tension - it is recommended. To be honest, I'm not bothered. I gave the purpose of doubt; Normally I do not want to stop watching a movie half way. This is no exception. It really, really, seriously, sickeningly dull. This film is probably the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a dop-up pseudo in the area) and really did not "do it" for me. Art is well; <br /> <br /> "The storyline is the story of a group of rabbits who were primarily infiltrating human beings in the area, a common one about the dangers of human interactions in the environment The moralist story uses humanoid rabbits to keep the message across. I feel like they are a kind of brutal brutal person, but I think they are harder, but the characters are desperate, painful, disappointing <br /> I found that I was looking at the clock at the time of watching the movie, which took 20 minutes before it actually took place and it was a terrible antillimalis. </ P> In any way, the concept of showing children's risks on rural areas and the pride of hopeful humans etc   ిష్కరించిన భావనను బాగా అర్థం చేసుకోవడానికి నేను అంగీకరించాను. బహుశా ఇది సాధారణ పవిత్రమైనది మరియు ప్రీచీ అయి ఉండవచ్చు, కానీ అది బయట పెట్టడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్న సందేశం దాని స్వభావంతో బాగుంది. <br /> <br /> ఈ విధంగా, ఈ సినిమా చాలా పేలవంగా ఉంది. I can not see through the whole way, or I'm probably forced to eat my own legs in my break. Granted, this is not a "torque" bad, but it still does not rate much in my eyes, so I gave it 2/10. <br /> Hope this help.
