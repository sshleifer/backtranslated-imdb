Chan Wook Park is nothing but a discovery. I'm a ciberglass, but there is a shirt between the narrowest tech fragrances, which is sprinkled in the middle of some distinct ideas. Park Embarks in an imaginative, exciting story of radical departure from Mark Caso and Jenet (a city that loses children, delicateness), and a radical departure from his normal morbid fare. <br /> While I am a sierbg, it seems surprisingly stunned. Also its parts are different from the total and withdraw from it. The audience is assured, gorgeous copious and offbeat humor but failing to create any meaningful connection with all the audience. <br /> <br /> Those characters are playing with cute and aggressive and starring, but I tried, and I could not get any work done. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY for Lady Vengeance is a misplaced, the park itself has been going on for a while, but it is still forgiven on the director's unique flame and in the face of the impressive filmography. There is no guarantee that MR is a joint security area or SYMPATHY. VENGEANCE is obvious here. I'm a sibberg, but I have never left me wrong. I'm constantly moving forward (more gradually the film progresses). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, it probably needed more than a 3. For the old age, I'm generous: 4/10
