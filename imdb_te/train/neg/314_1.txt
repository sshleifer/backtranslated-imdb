I've taken this book at a discounted bookstore for $ 5 dollars, Adam Sandler is a fantastic actor and I've found that I'm a good movie, not that. Not all stories are accurate, bad jokes, and every other word that the other comedian says "F-Word", generally not abusing me, but it is at the top. When Sandler started to speak in the random parts of the film, the story is worse than the lack of the story line, they remind me of Dora Explorer and look on the screen and ask questions. And lastly when they put the girls bikini shots at random times at random. In my opinion, this film does not buy, waste its money
