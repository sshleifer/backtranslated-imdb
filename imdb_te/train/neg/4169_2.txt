<br /> <br /> In this movie, Natsia Malcol (like Vampireres Quintana) seems to be very sensitive in this movie, so I gave it a 2. <br /> <br /> There is very little logic for this film, but most science fiction is bloodthirsty. The film has tried to break away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far, and the whole story is just unreasonable but not ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are so many gore and very painful scenes for me. A good vampire movie should be more intuitive that you do not need to see too much blood - we know what a vampire can do to make him / her vampire on a man. All that is needed to explain some moans or screams scene (Quintana Rosa sexually endures as it ends, all it needs is some moans, the rest your imagination). Anyway, this is my personal taste.
