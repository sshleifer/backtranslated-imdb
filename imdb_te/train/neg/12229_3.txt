The film looks good, and I felt like watching Seinfeld's adult version. Quickly I started to question the main characters and actions, and there was no answer to what they were doing. All acting is fantastic but some scenes are brief moments where they are really funny. Don Cortese is amazing. I love him in this role. His agent must show the film to the casting agents. Watch the first few scenes and then find the better, or else you will lose the entire mess in this mess. I found this in a bin at a video store. It's a rare reason of this film that I spend two dollars and I think it's like a good price.
