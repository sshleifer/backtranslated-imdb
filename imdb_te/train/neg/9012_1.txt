Yesterday I saw the movie Flyibios and my girlfriend told me the worst picture she saw ... It was the worst movie I ever had ever seen and since it felt so awful when I got to thinking it - unfortunately, Years old, but I'm hardly a murderer of Dean Kain, a pretty boyfriend (pretty boyfriend) Hours) as well). It's cheap dealer with CGI-helicopter is probably cheap for Chapper renting than some CGI-guys take it, but my guess is that they liked to play on his new computer when they found a CAMP like a free CGI program or a free sample for the Producer's son. And how did it look ?? Awful. And then the same shots back and over through the complex corridors collecting the dragon will look very low - back. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really awful ...
