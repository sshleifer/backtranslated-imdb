Its spelling S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I'm happy when the main character flashes her boobs. It's very tight. Before and after that movie pretty much blows. This act is like an E-list and is well documented in the movie. It does not say that the lecturer and Chainsaw Charlie is a low budget being played by the same person. The whole picture appears as it is filmed with a camcorder instead of a better way than the half way. Chainsaw Charlie and Dr. Ripper is the only other reason I liked the film because it's funny. Many silly things that made me laugh at me. If you see this movie on a blockbuster, hide behind the LanMoberman for everyone. 2. Anyone who thinks this film is good should be expected to be mentally.
