The endless rash of supernatural horror movies in the late 80s was set in dark penitrory settings. Rene Harlin's awesome sandy and moody "Prison" came to rolling the whole Haunted Hoisco ball; This was a sudden vertical exercise in John Saxon's delightful worst "Death House", the psyched psycho movie "Destroyer" and the disappointing Comatos Tedium after the "Chair" <br /> <br /> The grim gratuitous college student chowderheads leads through the twerp Alex (the most improbable Nicholas Celologie), suffering from depressing and suddenly going to the island of Alcatlage to investigate the bizarre conditions of the fierce death of the upcoming rock star Sammy Mitchell (" Mickey's "Tony Basile of Fame). Alex's brother is a violent cannibalist who goes through a ghostly ghost of the US Civil War cavalry commandant's ghost and passes through an imaginary killing spin, thus overlooking Alex's habit and standing against this horror audience. <br /> <p> Despite being filmed by Nicolas van Sternberg, some good gore set pieces and a fair amount of scary atmosphere (the film is triggered in the scarce, rusty, rustic ruins of the Alcatraz Island), "Slaughterhouse Rock", however, is simply a great, influential horror not. It was uniformly distorted by the vulgar and different Collegiate Smartlake characters, a vague Smirky bunch, hating its hilarious comic criticism rather than entertaining. A notably bold acting act from the cast, like the "Playboy" playmate and undesirable blonde on top of the hottie Supreme Hope Marie Carlton, specifically the irritant Limca Quigley, as Tunken Ommo Bimbo. Directed by Dimitry Lagotheitis shows the slightest dimension of sensitive visual style, but the tone of horror intensity and goofy, terrifying sophomoric silliness and the most damaging, Ted Laandon's sloppy, staggering, overly complicated and ultimately very confusing pitch in the middle of the script. Internal logic required to make the remote story remote acceptable. In other words, this stinker has succeeded in seeming to be a jailbreak-out film jail for 90 minutes with a low volume of sin.
