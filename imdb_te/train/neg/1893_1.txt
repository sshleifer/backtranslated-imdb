The film was very crazy when these things happened. I did not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was very annoying, and the leading actor (forget his name) also came on my nerves. Many people do not recall how the end was but the whole idea of ​​aliens who have human bodies seemed stupid in the film and things are far apart. My dad told me it was a stupid image ... I should have listened to him.
