I returned from this free screening, this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst thing I've seen this year's hand-down worse than "Catwoman" - it's at least fits the fi rst. <br /> <br /> "Documentary Journalists" in "September Tapes" is a "film crew" headed by Afghanistan - although fully prepared for the tour, and yes, their mental and ridiculous distinction < br> <br> The filmmaker is planning to avenge his wife's death on September 11 to find Osama bin Laden. <br /> They made eight tapes on their journey, and the terrorist leader tries to kill. (This is convenient for "Documentary", eight of which are the most prominent of the heroines, fortunately). <br /> <br /> Psychotique, idiot Hollywood - Learning to look at the long-term, perhaps "macawaver" - he does not care for his own life or his innocent staff, and he takes them more and more risk by a series of mute stops. <br /> <br /> "When the crew put me away," I do not know he could not wear a mark behind him. <br /> <br /> Translator of staff, their intellectual voice-of-reason, and idiot hero becomes baffled as it leads them into doom. <br /> <br /> "Tape 4", I began to grow fingers for terrorists to shoot the film crew. .
