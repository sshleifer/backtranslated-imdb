This film is a good example of the media manipulation that you can sell a movie rather than a very high TV sitcom. The daily newspaper in Puerto Rico constantly wrote about the wonders of the film with extensive coverage, which silences almost all others. Incidentally the second largest circulation newspaper is owned by the same owners. The weekly Clarardad is the only newspaper on the island to analyze the image and content of the film, and all the flaws, clues and bad writings. <br /> <br /> Film a laugher with lively and clear jokes, and one actors and scenery can be identified because it is not an acceptable film.
