It is amazing that this film will become one of my hitlists after all. <br /> The worst image I've ever seen is 1. <br /> <br /> Earlier I was not only frustrated with this (luckily not 1.5 hrs), but that's not too close to getting that feature in adolescent humor before but my mouth bent slightly. After the first very awkward piece, you are hope that the other parts will be at least a little better. <br /> <br /> The heroes of the film have nothing to do with the story, the story repeats three times. Some wonders never lost the remaining copies of the film and Trent Harris could never again put his hands on the camera ...
