This type of picture has now become an old hat, is not it? <br /> It certainly sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, some good clothes and some human dramas. Unfortunately, as in "The Big Chill", there is no central event that combines all of them, this is one of those seminal films painted as a copy. Instead of being short for everyone, you would like to see one or two special people. This creates superficiality is not just annoying, it is maddening. Below average script does not help.
