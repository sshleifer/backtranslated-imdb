"Smokey and the Bandit" is definitely not Shakespeare, but no one wanted it to be. It was a low-slap stick, but it had brains. It features a very smart script with exact characters and a fun wrap-up. People came from the laughing theater. "Hooper" is nothing in this regard. There is no reason to smile. If you want to be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it's a lot of fun, but it's a lot of shocking dance scenes and a lot of unbelievable car-jumps I've ever seen. It all looks fraudulent, deliberately portrayed. Poor Sally Field (a girlfriend who writes her hand beside) has a weak character, a funny or smart line ("if you do that jump, I can not stay here when you come back.) Burt Reynolds is tired of watching the camera, but" Hooper " The joke is for any audience sitting. * **
