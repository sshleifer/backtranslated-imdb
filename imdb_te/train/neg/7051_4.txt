There is a mind about candy for those who like growing up and dealing with the problems being real yourself, like blue juice surfing and cornwall. Sean Pertwei's real actor, Catherine Zeta Jones plays her sweetheart and Evan McGregor plays the role of her drugs. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like surfing or cornwall, it takes a long time to show up before the movie is very interesting. It is slow in the beginning and spends very short time in a few interesting landscapes. Plus most of the main characters leads them to be a dimensional. The plot is a curious idea but you do not know why they work in situations where they are kept because of the depth of characters. <br /> <br /> Evan, Sean, and Catherine have produced the film only on video tape, which was released only in Videotape in the US after joining Evan and Catherine's mainstream reputation.
