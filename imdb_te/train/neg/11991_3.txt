- Bad Stuff: This movie is a real trash. One thing bad stunts, I thought this was a "twilight zone" when they looked fake. The flashbacks are pretty useless. A part of the film takes his anger in a window and enhances her life. I know the casting director and if he's too much acting is too big, it's terrible. A kiss scene also sucks in the film. The film kills the book. The book is great. I do not recommend this movie too much. Not for educational purposes too. <br /> <br /> "There are some suspense parts that you can go on but they are quickly shot dead and acted by bad stunt. <br /> <br / > My judgment: do not see.
