And with that heavy ads, this is getting nickelodean and nick junior and that, my son was bugging us to see it. Between the DVD and the theaters, I looked pretty good (The Wall-E, Brother Bear) from the bad (The Incredibles, Shrek). But this is not the worst picture I have seen, children or children. It's a "this stupid thing is going to end?" Have experience OK, it's the toddlers (or it's good - no one over 3 is intellectual insult), but I've never seen something that is imaginative, recurring, and slow-moving. Then you're finally bored but the relief that the movie is out, this is a disgusting thing to the end that you'd set up for a joke, but it's not one - they're trying to achieve what it's hard to say. 3-D effects ... Yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, they're a big deal, otherwise it will look like the screen (if you look on the screen without glasses). Finally, my son was finally bored. My wife and I both looked at me and finally said "wow". Everything is bad.
