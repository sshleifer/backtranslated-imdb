Many have guessed my reading of my review of Heads, and I'm at some 14 years old when I think of Scam as a "classic" horror. I am 30 years old and this is not the reason for most of my life watching horror movies. But plainly, I'm a Slaughter / Zombie / ghost / cannibalizer, etc ... a child of 80's raised Types of horror films - so I usually do not prefer horrific pictures that are more graphic and faster-paced. Like any other music, painting, or anyone who can appreciate in the film - but not necessarily disliked - why can I appreciate why some people can enjoy such films? > <br /> <br /> The worst home and worst image about school for the wayward girls. Brass handshake with a heavy-handed mistress of school rules (or in some cases whip ...) to keep the girls. She was a younger son who kills the girls (they were a little overnight (?!?) ...), and at the same time, the girls who were murdered were disappeared from school. <br /> <br /> In terms of weather, the interaction between school and girls and their caregivers, compared with SUSPIRIA (it's a picture of an image in my opinion ...) - but this film is so dull and unreal that I just could not just wake up . I'm all for "tension" and "suspense" in horror films - but this movie is not for me. Luckily, I'm going to go to many of these people, so I can not say I'm really disappointed - the fact that I personally can not enjoy the most horrific images individually, rather than the most horrific images 70. It's not a tough and fast rule, but it seems to be absolutely exempt from what I enjoyed. Perhaps "must-see" for horror fans who are more poor and suggestive horror movies - but I do not really know most fans of those items, I can not really recommend it ... 4/10
