How was this repetition "How to be there"? This is proof that people can succeed even if a good and honest man lacks intelligence. They are wrong. Proof that the film is good luck: your friend hope to invest all your money in Apple and not Atari; When your storm is broken up, your shoe is only in the sea; If you're luckily shot on the buttocks and do not come back you feel that shock is not dead; We hope you can not get AIDS from your wife. The film is also politically progressive - those who rebelled against the social convention will lose their legs, drugs, beat their friends or die young. In addition, the production placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotional manipulating image, very empty, too.
