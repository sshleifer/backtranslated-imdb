Tony Scott destroys Richard Kelly's clich√©, scarier, tired screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) became a model and became a bounty hunter. <br /> <br /> The problem with this trash is not a story and everything's distinctive graphic styling makes each distance out of the distance a distant way to make it different from Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> You do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays as a brutal, frustrating brat that does nothing to guarantee our respect. She strangles her unwelcome people and calls her the dress and the barricades, but she's not at least bit real and Knightley does not convince little bit. <br /> <br /> The picture is boring. It's too loud, and one of the most annoying sources I've heard in a long time is broken into one of the music scores. Scott's "True Romance" Clamax, who struggled with Domino's gang for the last twenty minutes, was repetitive poorly. Surprise! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this powerful exciting confrontation is completely scotched by Scott and is a confusing, dominant, nonsense exercise in celluloid craftsmanship. . This is not a brave or experimental piece of art; <br /> <br /> Mickey Rorke looks good as a crumpled bounty hunter, but he's disappearing in the background "narrative" increases. <br /> <br /> Chris Walken is always a great man, changing to another awkward Camello and Dobney Coleman. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface of this image. It's still difficult, but it's hard.
