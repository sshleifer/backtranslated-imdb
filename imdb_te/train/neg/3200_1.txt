Joe Don Baker ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, fist in a stupid cowboy suit who laughed at Roy Rogers, sweaty sweaty off. <br /> <br /> Those living in Texas probably have a badge where they can allow any law enforcement. <br /> <br /> This greasy defeat deputy sheriff near the Texas border. Surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger, but he thought he would make his own personal bouncing ball in his discretion. <br /> <br /> This guy is like saints compared to la cops. <br /> <br /> When his partner roams a couple of Italian murderers, Joe Dawn's character hunts them and kills one of them. Then Mr Wilson ordered Italy to do the orders, who would like to spend big time with Joe Don. During the record, he loses the Italian and bounces a Maltese cab in the process. <br /> <br /> "In the film that arrested our hero, Mattimus Messi's chief says he goes out and gets more trouble, is arrested, police <br /> <br /> Joe Don's ivory ivory pistol with a pistol and you have to do with horror until your hearts are dispersed. <br /> <br /> Joe Don first missed Palermo's escape He is taken by Palermo after he threatens a woman with a coat brochure.Palammo actually believes he will get torture in the cell in the dungeon, but - he strikes the stripper Come on, because her throat was immediately bleeding <br /> <br /> Here you (and another) think you are drowning in the boat, but the ocean does not want him, he's a poor multiple family (what did he do to them any time?) He kills him on a shovel, he returned to the city by arresting the police, by the police chief ... Arugghh An! A female police officer escaping from him leaves him, so they can take the Palermo. Why do you think the brain will die to destroy his career for this great slab? <br /> <br /> They go to the villa where Palermo is hidden, and start shoot out. Joe Dawn is fairly cheats, and kills Palmero. Then he utters the rich and dazzling final line of the film: "The big one is my badge and you are going to get it for me?" Thanks to the immortal line, Mr. Baker. It is said by a character in a movie that has never been so much a literary, fantastic, and brilliant past line in analysis of film history. It definitely comes into line with everything else about the character. Bravo.
