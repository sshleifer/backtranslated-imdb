The Universal Release of a ProSal-MLC product is a boring repetition of the theory that breaks the molecular structure of an object, replicating it as a cell "pure energy" and reverting it to a "target area." That's why it is not necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (Pak-exchanged actor Bryant Holliday, played the role of "Devil Doll") and himself Assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Michel (Chris Mitchell) Ronald Allen). <br /> <br /> Before experiencing the famous Dutch scientist "Lembac" (Gordon Heinz), his engine failed because of the devastation, so he "expected" a revenge for his secretary Sheila (Tracy Crisp). In fact, she goes back and he looks to "people with pork" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> With this newly discovered authority, he is latham (Derrick de Marni) and his lab boss Dr. Cockney, a security guard named Blanchard (Norman Woodland), is killing idiots. He can even break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hill and Michelle attempts to help him, the clown will destroy his equipment and his. Overall, a completely nonsensical image for the message. <br /> One of the most discouraging color pictures you ever see.
