When the film started, the first 4 minutes seemed like a tour of California, and I was surprised when tapes were added. Then I made a relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Larry Smith. It was spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior, so she hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). <br /> <br /> My baby: D +
