I've never seen a huge fan of Mormon movies. Being a Mormon, I always felt that the humorous LDS community was very special to us and seemed like a bunch of obsessive wackos for us. <br /> <br /> "I refused, it was Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson, and Fred Willard (Which is one of my favorites), it's at least a bit fun and besides, church basketball hilariously gags for the plenty of potential and ripe.But all of the whole movie, no one knows what they're doing Each joke is flat and every opportunity is ignored for a genuine funny gag, and the film has some of the worst character development I have ever seen, each character but less than a dimensional of Wilson. It is believed that the film is still missing in the mind My friends and I have been extraordinators in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City and UT, Kurt Hale, the director, and I must say that after the show I have all the contacts with him remove. He's waiting at the door, seemingly ready for look. <br /> <br /> "There are some specific issues that I have: leopard and chubby piano Between the player there is a little love story subplot, but these two characters came out somewhere, and it is impossible to care about, my friends and I constantly have to care about these two lame and unpleasant characters, where each subdomains are popped every now and then <br /> <br /> The film is a major disappointment, and I think it's bad for everybody who is looking forward to the first REAL funny maman movie. True, these are the ones that have a chance to laugh at the audience, but everyone comes in the smoke puff, and you end up with the attention. Jokes in Mormons are not very unique. <br /> <br /> Again, one of my ears is a joke and a big ring <br /> <br /> Do not look at the film, put the phantasy in your mind that this film is happy.
