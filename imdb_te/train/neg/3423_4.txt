It's a 70-strong soft-sex sex rope in the style of Rus Meyer, though fewer than some of Meyer's work. The film has more 'product values' than most contemporaries, which represent a larger budget. While the plot, writing and acting are directly out of B zon, however. Eventually, the film became the main character of B motion channels ("Drive in Classics") in the 500 motion universe. If the soft core is what you do in the mood, as in "B" as anything in this B array. Even though Polans is not expected, Saro is just Surno. Nothing, nothing less. Jennifer Wells's performance as "Mother" is probably the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film did not go to great fame, surprisingly. Confessions of a young American housewife is far from the worst example of this kind. This is a kind of image if it's a picture of you. 30 years ago, it was an avant-garde and dangerous film. Nowadays you can see more or less of a similar kind in the Showtime / HBO series and at the main time.
