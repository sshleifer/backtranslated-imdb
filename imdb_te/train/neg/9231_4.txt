I went to the film thinking that I was the next clerks, but left the concept of left. Humor is weak and the characters are very flat. The idea of ​​dating service in the grocery store seemed like a pretty fertile thing, but the director cliche'd become the focus of "the man who saved the Mom and the Pop Store from the evil corporation". I felt as if he was stuck with dating service plots, he would come out with a more memorable picture. Now, to do justice to the film, I'm from the Rochester area and played the role of Webster. In fact, here Kevin Smith (of Clarks) paid homage to his hometown. Webster, NY A Red Bank, NJ The director cleverly threw at the date of Nick Tahou. Trust me, as long as Rochester is in the trash plate list. It was lucky enough to see the film at Little Rochester, so everyone knew when the Odds came and appreciated them in town.
