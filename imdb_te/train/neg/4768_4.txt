I recently stumbled upon Nine Dead and read the current reviews I was thinking of dealing with the average cinema. However, the film is an average low and it is worth watching. The script was poorly written and acting was a pretty good one for a B-level movie. The plot boundaries on the savway teach people to make a mistake and try to make them more fun, but where the comparison ends. Nine dead people have the heart and purpose behind the new ideas that are not new. The main mistake I found nine dead, slip in the face of the motion picture viewer in 3 minutes and totally unnecessary and totally inadequate ending to see people coming in a bad way. I've seen any spoilers worse of bad movies and they are not exactly this end. Good picture, bad acting and ending ...
