Holi @ #% & This film is still made from pile warm and juicy. I tried to see this heap of festering waste but my wrist slash and laser floor cleaner found easier to slug back into a shooter than end up worst half that was on my screen. I've seen this movie or TV at any time. I saw a cow in a field. I saw the steam pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... it may be moving or something. Well time spent watching that trip. This acting does not exist, and the storyline is no more than this film. I've seen the start of the cut where I managed to escape the plot and saw the start of where a Steven King was riding off the background behind an old pickup truck towards Portland hoping to be the shi77er. Tell me the director's medication, he's very much needed. He is very clear that he needs heavy medication and I like to be ready before his lobotomy is needed to negatively. BAH ... I can not give this review to a punch because this painful thing can do justice to typing without typing. If I see your film a bit longer and you see this chilton on the rack, go to your car and start the engine and rotate your fist on both sides. Your bones will no longer be vibrating. Make sure you're in the pocket of your pocket as you're going to waste cash anyway. <br /> I saw this when I could see a "friend" sent to your friend. She ends, she is too much. What's worried she has to see TWICE in this $% & @ thing! I have just heard their marriage and he has come to visit his balls once a month. I hope because of this film.
