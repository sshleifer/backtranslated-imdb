*** Spoiler *** If you want to watch the movie, it's time to read the waste. (By the way: it does not show any difference if the plot is not read this way) <br /> <br /> Do you think of "Coyote Ugly"? ! It is not worth the money for a ticket or VHS / DVD. A simple "chick feel good-flick", one can say. The protagonist is the American Dream's ridiculous and critical version. A young girl in a small town in New York was a good success. The "tragic" threat to the father, some of the frustrating attempts of "disturbing" the violet relationship with her boyfriend and giving any deep picture in such a film. McNally (director) tries to stimulate audiences and is not likely to succeed because of the evil script and shallow acting. Piper Perabo, in particular, fails to fully persuade the "jersey's" fear of singing before the audience. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, who represents the film's little ray hope, is only good (and very funny) about "Coyote Ugly". <br /> <br /> I have created this film by Jerry Bruckheimer. First "Gone in 60 Seconds" and now what happened to great films like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? <br /> If you're looking for a superficial image with the good evening girls you're helping, you can see "Charlie Angels", which is very funny, entertaining and self-contradictory). <br /> Two thumbs down (3 in 10).
