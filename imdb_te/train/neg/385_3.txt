A poorly written conspiracy play / mystery about the possibility of introduction to the AIDS government. Wlaschiha plays a homogeneous researcher looking for answers - this will be harder for someone to find inside the fog plot. Cinematography is also appreciative, the camera is hungry for real deeper roles instead of sudden and enthusiastic behavior, unfortunately it should be unfortunately notified. Grade: D +
