I believe that anyone can put this film in the same place as Exorist. Exorcist is subtle and creepy, stigmatomic blunt, clumsy and very in principle. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visual films I've seen for a while, but the imagery can lead to an exuberant figure. <br /> <br /> This film has surpassed my interest in comparison with the exosistist. My visit to the official website increased interest. This website contains many stories of "original" stigmatas in history. However, the scene through the scene, the film becomes a joke with its quest for "realism", and it is difficult to see in the end. <br /> When you go here, the Maoists, the Christ (Stigmata) reception and confusing and worrying about the ordeal. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. <br /> <br /> Does Frankie have a vessel for Satan or Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in the film is finally over.
