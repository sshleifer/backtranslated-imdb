Anyone drowning when trying to get back to an old reputation? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you see what you did for a good Star Trek performance, do not see it. <br /> <br /> Writing Hodge-Puddy, the cast of their cast actors are weak, and more than anything, the design work is clearly doggie. <br /> If you look at strong captains, do not see here! Like a strong federation attitude? Forget about it here! <br /> <br /> In two minutes of initial shows credits, the mentally weak Captain Shuffle Shuffle creates an attempt with Encyclical Spyke Engineer. It just decreases from there. No, uniformity does not match for goodness. They are small or very large, with their chest bandages, and season three and DS9 uniforms TNG Seasons One and Two Uniform. Actually no discipline and tradition that treads down in this product! One good thing about this program is that its graphics improves a bit each season. Okay, I'll take it back. Who does not use CG? Designers of this show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not get stuck with it, it will deft your Star Trek concept. <br /> When I saw it, I cried out openly, because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost collapsed. That's bad.
