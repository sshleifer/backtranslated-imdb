This is a very first bit for me, for the first time I was disappointed in Tim Burton's film. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and fantastic performances), but any off-the-shelf Hollywood director can do so. Pacing is very strange, as the last third film was over, I was waiting for me and cast. Tim Roth is awesome, perhaps the only joy in the film. Come back to Tim.
