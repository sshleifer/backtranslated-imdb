Where to Start ... If this movie is a dark comedy, I'd say Fannan-Tastic! Unfortunately for me, and the free time and the rest of a book (remember that the price I paid is from Wal-Mart), the film is intended to be a thriller. The only thrill I had was watching was watching the lousy composition of Kirkland from Anne Wilkes from the Snow Woodland area. If you want a good laugh, I would recommend this movie on a rainy Friday night with some friends. <br /> If you want to see at least half the way, do not be bothered. <br /> <br /> Many of the worst films are good. But Wow ... I Want Me !! As a young child played by Vincent Berry, it does not bother one single person in the whole movie. This is the reason I have given me because I give 3 stars too.
