I decided to read reviews on this picture and give it a shot. I was an open minded person after all and I've given some pretty good flicks good reviews. Closing credits I searched something nice to understand and say as this one rolled over. Here goes: "This film is mercilessly small." <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. The sets and visuals were well made and the music shelter helped the debt to the mood of life but it took away from the good bits of painful and endless dialogue to see the film. I'm laughing at this movie but laughing at your big friend and laughing before the big crowd. <br /> Finally "Chicken Dance" just decided to tuck and roll with the image and let the companies fall where they come. I do not know that I can save this film. Acting is not bad and it has a budget but there is no way to make it look; Also the presence of beautiful bear chest. Perhaps I would have dug a beer or drank a lot in the beer to get the full experience of the film. In any way, I do not see this movie. Then I can say, "At least I'm not a doctor, TORORS TORCHO DUZONE. 'I'm better than them.'
