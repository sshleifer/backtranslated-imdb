Steven Siegel seems to have been dormant through a horrific film that was almost completely hid when the budget and resources were completed. Technical flaws - take from the carrier for the silver F / A-18s and F-14 aircraft strike, and virtually converts the F-16s to the strike - which gives the film more credibility. The most interesting thing in the film is that it is enough to say that Final Cut Pro is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear after a lightning wipe, which is available to all customers. Keeping your creativity into your own credit, Marcel Mandu puts Michael Kishch in the same category.
