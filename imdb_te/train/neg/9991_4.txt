First, I'm not a dog in this movie. I was absolutely enjoyable despite poor product quality. Even if the monster is doing well, the act of hunting the monster is acting as eagle. While he actually appears to be the other-world kind of an alien family that landed in the Himalayas and while the father was receiving a ... Attend to the call of nature, the spot got loose and they just do not have time to hunt him. That, or he is Wacamaster's Caucasian brother. <br /> In fact, it seems anywhere else that it's shot anywhere else than snow, but Canada is nowhere more than anywhere else in China. Trees and Vistas say to me Canada, and the time or feel of the thunder-coolness that the set area will always find in China's Himalayas does not take time. This is a size-fiction channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of position. <br /> Furthermore, clearly (as we have established) the size of the Fijian directors often do not fly, the commercial planes fly up here and the next crash actually does not. <br /> <br /> The film is a science fiction channel. We need to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> In this movie the movie is very beautiful, and the Donner is about the alien in the woods "Alive", "Predator" woods, and no evil wushu image where they fly over the wires. Yeti can clearly recall like Spiderman or Super Mario ... <br /> <br /> At the same time, Yeti missed his teddy bear, who searched high and low, but could not seem to work a cavern.Poor Yeti You can not help but be sorry for it, which is a serious teddy bear He has lived a few thousand years to surrender and he lost his bear or perhaps wants to join it, but that <br /> And again, what is the common Yeti? I do not know, but I do not know, but it 's not a unmated male! It' s superhuman, but it 's not human! He has perfect Michael Meier's quality, it is absolutely perplexed and he has got this amazing way of cleaning his fur Fabulous Dahlink! Sometimes it's spotlessly There upu. He is sensitive superhu - super-Yeti. <br /> All in all this is a lot more fun to watch, there are some great kills and some honest elements of the plot. Terrible, although the style of the production, such as gravel, it is actually very entertaining. Did not I think if they were planning on another? <br /> <br /> It is rated at 6.0 / 10 in the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> This is a rating of 4.4 / 10 in Movie Scale. <br /> <br />
