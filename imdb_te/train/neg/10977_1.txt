I lived in Ottawa, the film was built and I wish it was not really there. This is an awful picture of God. I really try and support independent films, but this stigma is about indie and the stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does not have this curse shed. Actor, writer and director Brett Kelly has contributed to the film and retains clues that are tired from previous movies. I'm really tired of the undesirable characters that are hidden in mysterious shadows and hunters, which is very bad. <br /> <br /> "Now it's some people who think it's the effect of creating mood and tension, but sadly For a movie to be called a movie horror, the viewer will find an unparalleled gore to find other types of corn syrup and red color colors <br /> <br /> The only thing we can do with this film is the lack of pacing and character development, the kidnapping of basic plot children, and the parents to get their children back in time for some time, but this is not wrong for me, Two main characters and children who are missing are not able to find time to do it with each other The good thing happens in such a short period of time, my first priority is to get my daughter back and at least find out the lady before making her up with her. <Br> /> <br /> "I'm the last point ... and I can not hold it against Kelly, but this film is filmed in a completely irritated and unbearable video and has only a style in the film. If the film is given a million dollar makeover, the story and the boring acting and laughter can not be replayed, Brett Kelly will once orchestrated to keep his sequel, reported on his website. <br /> <br /> Help the Lord to all of us.
