I'm suddenly awake, I'm drooling on plastic sofa cover, and a warm Saturday afternoon realize. Why am i sleeping I was on my head Or accidentally swallow my grandma's muscle relaxers? Could this be an adult early narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I paused cheap seats while I was surfing the channel in time, and the lack of humor and talent was me. <br /> Blackhead out my life energy at such a pace. It's head shaking, mouth-open, shoulder-eating bad. But I must give credit to these ethical and boring twins to sell this idea. Perhaps they came to me, and when he / she woke up, there were some horror parts and he had the same effect for his / her hoped ESPN programming mood that no one would be awful now that all viewers are asleep and he / she is $ 425.000 annual salary <br / > <br. /> You've been warned.
