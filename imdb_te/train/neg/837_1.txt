I really saw the first two, and liked it. The second is not the first one trying to do something good. And it's a story standing. You do not need to know about the first film. I also enjoyed "Free Willie" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... third, here's totally worth it! I both liked the first ally because my friend tried with a friend. We have decided to stop after half an hour. The film is OK, it's alright in funny episodes. But what for? The first two films of Timon and Pumbaa are funny creatures. No Lion King 1 1/2 For Me: It's a hard effort to get the first movie more fun than it is already, plus telling the story from their point. But what for? I really want to know. You know, it's really good to sit in the movie where both of them watch the first. But then comes the most unnecessary. I loved many of the Timon and the feminine, and I really did. However, I have made many attempts to be funny in many parts. No chance, it's not funny at least for me, at least for me. Btw. What about this movie anyway? Is it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) trying to get more fun from the first movie? <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like "The Story behind the Story", you can see "Rogen Crants and Guildenstern Dead Are". Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Old Mann. It's really funny and does not try to get more from "Hamlet".
