The film is deeply idiot. A man desires a crime for a crime - but he gets his revenge - where a video camera suggests him all the time. A man with a brain cell on his head sits there and works for a long time before the video camera. <br /> <br /> I am writing the script writers cooking their brain cells and they are thinking that you have some serious habits that make you battalion drive plots holes in armored tanks! <br /> Plot: A man wants to avenge the death of loved ones, but something goes wrong in the middle of the plot and goes unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Writing this story is not so dumb to write these entirely unrealistic plot twists that this has never happened. I tell the authors-get help for your serious psychological problem.
