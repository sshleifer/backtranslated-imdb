Sorry. Someone should say. This is a really / frustrating image. Maybe good, but desperate. When I saw this, I was almost annoyed. Acting is pretty terrible, this narrative and predictable story, score and camera-work is completely authentic and unexpected. It's one of those films that you are not allowed to hate (it's about disabled people) but I suspect everyone is suspect. Critics have worked hard for this film. I think they do not even allow me to target. These awards have been won - which I definitely remember it. But it's not interesting or entertaining. I did not see that the play was comparable.
