Charles Branson plays as a police detective like Lee Crowe, this cynical and stylishly hellm revenge thriller who was sexually abused by Crowe's daughter (Amy Hathaway), daughter of a Japanese businessman who announced the pimps battle of Duke (Juan Fern√°ndez). Kinjite may not be a distorted plot thread for everyone, but it is well-made and entertaining.
