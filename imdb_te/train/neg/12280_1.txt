I saw one of the stage shows in Denver and was never impressed less. The word "vagina" says it all. Body part. Nothing here is shocking. I told my doctor that "I'm a little bit after tennis" or "equal to my vagina after cycling" with a more or more social commentary. All I heard was "trise monologues" for entertainment or radical comments. Monologues were dull but were dramatically distributed, things were so old and I was aloof and frustrated alternately. I think I had laughed but I was not clear when I wanted it. Absolutely not really hit it. Oh, and Spoilers: There is a lesbian! - Oh, wait, maybe, come to think of it. And inappropriate Fondling! And a crack mama! That applies to it.
