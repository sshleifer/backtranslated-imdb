In this case reality is much more entertaining and interesting than do this big, shiny return, and even well done, the substance is much more important than the surface of the Zatoichi movies - these "Star Trek" movies as "Star Trek". I've never seen it, this was a good-looking but empty. Because I had it, I thought it was inadequate and did not fit its content. The idea of ​​reviving the role of a big, corrupt product is good, but there is no point in seeking to earn money; It is a performance that simply fails to capture the world's atmosphere of the character, and completely he has failed to take anywhere else (yet, the actor is not his best) anywhere. I am hoping to see him in the last stages of life, and I have done some fun from his experience, watching him in the story; It makes rehearses of bits and pieces from other films, much more sex and sfx flavored with violence. That's not the same experience.
