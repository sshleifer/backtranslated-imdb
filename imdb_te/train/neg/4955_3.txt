In the light of the recent and most Batman Batman brave and the bold, the time has come for Batman to survive a life-threatening pose. A huge fan from the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to accept the character, dark or campy different tonalities. This is not reliable: too many effects, poor conspiracies and some questions. To say great about Batman, the variation of his skills and his personality are: detective, crime-fighter, playboy, fallopist. Batman only shows him in his karate days. And by the way, how is the penguin such maturation capability when jumping in the air regardless of his ports corpulence? And the Blanca blend of Street Fighter 2 and see the Joker, what kind of betrayal the Batman fan would accept such treason? Me anyway. Batman is better than the "The" article before his name.
