Yes I'm whiter, so I try to walk easily in a sensitive matter ... Whatever ... black people black people = BAD but black people white people = ok (because obviously we deserve it !!). Where did I start? I would like to say goodbye about this film beside the unnecessary comedy scenes: the infamous scene ice cube and co. Some really big, really strong, really frustrating and scary looking Neo-Nazis to fight and win !!! Where the neo nazi is twice the size, and the chase! Chase is priceless ... this is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not deliver ... This clich√© stereotypes a racist image that reassures him the white wimpy guy who reassures him <br /> <br /> Your time and poor writing, Save poorly acting, dull and clear biased feel of a partisan movie. You go into the subject and go to American History X, thats an image now
