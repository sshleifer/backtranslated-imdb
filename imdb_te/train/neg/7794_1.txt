This film is a terrifying god. This film is not a quality. You think gore is good, but it hurts bad. Performance is worse and acting is the worst I've ever seen if you've seen a call. The film is clearly shot in Camcorder and probably runs on a budget of around $ 500. If you want to see a better zombie movie than a dead or dead watch dawn. You want to see a better cheap shot of video zombie movie like this but video better than Watch Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It's unclear and meaningless. You are alerted. I do not have anything else to say about this stupid movie.
