<br /> <br /> Although this ceremony is very beautiful, it is still somewhat boring. I think it's time to look for something new director and producers. It attempted to make the show more 'hip' and was attractive for younger audiences this year, making it clear to Beyonce's conducting and informing P. Diddy and Prince a class. Also presenting Chris Rock presenter celebration to make a new effort and more appealing. <br /> Certainly, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he is not really a good presenter. I really saw him as the person who spoke between different classes of each class. <br /> <br /> His example as an example of Billy Crystal is not really 'big'. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes very soft to give out from these awards. The platform is not just about everyone, it is not strange to give some awards in the theater. <br /> <br /> I can not remember that the award winners are still satisfied. In the last few years, no one in the movies ever really wiped away the awards. So is it a good year for many movies with competitors? I do not think so. I think most films will be forgotten mostly over 20 years from now, except for "Million Dollar Baby" and "Passion of Christ". I do not agree with each award presented this year, for example Caleb Deschannel had to win for the best cinematography, I did not like Robert Richardson's work, he really worked out excellent work for most part of Oliver Stone but I really think Des√°nel Award deserves the way. As well as Jim Miller and Paul Rilley for best music for Best Music and John Debbie. But oh well, there is no way to please everyone of the Academy Awards course, I mean. <br /> <br /> People always complain about the winners. <br /> <br /> Most Award nominees are more nervous than winners and winners. Prince Principal at least once told the names? And comedy humor Sean Penn? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they will miss" are the best presenters of the night of the Iranians. <br /> <br /> Totally unforgettable show but nice winners overall. <br /> <br />
