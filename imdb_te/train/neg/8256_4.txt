<br /> <br /> The storyline about Gary Sinise's suicide role is a funniest place. He could not make life in a profitable pro / golf community because a shock driving golf balls into the sea? I have a river tears. I thought of these issues. I enjoyed Dylan Baker and Sinis but this film is obviously a bad choice or a paycheck for synais. In the small Timmy Price Tournament I was struggling to see the scene of being misled by other club members before his father.
