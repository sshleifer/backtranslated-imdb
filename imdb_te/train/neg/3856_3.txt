"A Guy Thing" is trying to capture the concept of "Mary the Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but it comes as much as the two-pruned cutting room is rejected. Thankfully I rented a 5-day rent because I could not sit and watch for more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and the other guys automatically feel Paul's missteps (checked at Save Mart was great) but the script was completely terrible. The dialog is flattering too much time and you will end up with no good reason, thinking that you are finally going to see some reasons. <br /> <br /> Slapstick comedy is great when you laugh at all the other movies I mentioned, but this film just misses the mark. I was very bad to love Julia Styles (ten great things I hate about you) but also helped me sit through this horrible movie. Save your dollars and go to rent "Once again there's something about Mary".
