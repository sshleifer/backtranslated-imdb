In his 1966 film "Blow Up", Antonio had his questionable truth in the face of British youth protesters. By setting up such questions on the clothes of hippie youth movements, Antonioni questioned whether the impact of these organizations was deliberate or not. Can you actually be a liar if you suspect the truth? In the flip side, this is a picture of what we are seeing and fights actively challenging others by deceiving others with false imagery and false truths. Although hippie angles are the most tacky parts of the "blow up", they have created a good image and have given more meaning than the picture. <br /> "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws all the opacity and delicate words of "blow up" and the hippie goes full blown. The result is a picture of bad metaphors, stupid ideas and huge hand story stories. Anyone who has performed such temper and intelligence on someone else throughout his career, so silly make up? <br /> <br /> When looking at a group of radicals that discussed the meaning of the revolution, the film would have a good sequence. Suddenly a man (mark) rises up. He hates the rigid and ordered nature of the revolution. While the revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, building themselves up in such a terrorist fight is to give your freedom effectively away. <br /> <br /> Like "The Passenger" like "Jackie Nicholson", Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> Mark bought a gun and goes into solo. He takes orders from no one. Marc shoots a man when the police marks his university campus. He then flees to a nearby airfield, steals a small private airplane and flies to the desert. The Antonioni desert is considered a peaceful utopia and viciously disagree with their billboards and empty modern equipment with capitalist cities. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Durries and quickly falls in love. Antonioni gives us a ridiculous romantic scene where hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. This tree-huggers and student radicals from the obstacles of modern life now celebrate their personality by humping in the sun. <br /> <br /> Film finishes and Durrani buildings, houses of great investors who killed him. This is the challenge of Antonioni to the audience. Pick up guns, picks and explosives, he said. <br /> <br /> There is no effect on the audience in this film. They identified the "jubrisky point", which was radical as another self-centered commercial venture. A sort of reformed radicalism. It is considered unethical and dull. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically means that if you are not happy in the modern world and the fat cats that exploit you, you run out of the desert or actively fight the system (dora). All is well and good. While artists constantly warn us of such dystopia nightmares, we are unable to show how to effectively manage changes. With the end of the "Fight Club", Neilism and violence did not achieve anything. In the real world, social change is prompted by low-tech experts, which is advanced through advanced technological advancements. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Very bad movie. The problem is, Antonioni really does not believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. An intro to an extraterrestrial film to get more worship from his previous film, "Blow Up". Also, "Jabriceky Point" appears to be the most serious and stupid image. <br /> <br /> There are a number of movies that are encouraged by the audience to fight the "system", but they all fall. One of the four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo Nest" and "Spartacus". Everyone says that the lives of Independence fighters end with all failure, all of which will remain "the spirit of the revolution". This message does not affect the change, but with the death or failure, the optimistic concept of change is survived by martyrdom. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Fight Club", "Jabriceky Point" and "Falling Down" will encourage you to just explode. It all tear down. Blow it all up. Everything is a lie, so you can go out of the guns fiery as well. <br /> <br /> Then you have the "flight rather than the flight" category. Terence Malik and Antonioni masters of this genre. Movies such as "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show human beings that do not like the world and do not make the islands or themselves as peaceful dwellings. <br /> <br /> You have your fourth category. Pictures like Donnersmark's "Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound for Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" lead to artists as a force for changes and rebellion. In these Dystopia worlds, everyone has content of enslavement in the state, an unbridled creativity and free will of the artist / criminal who keeps the system. You can create waves while still outside the flock. Challenge your quotes, actions and complex eye, status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film has novels and artists to reduce Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has painted Alex with artist / criminal Nazi droogs, painting the blood and sperm town.
