I have seen this film in a pre-preview and how bad I felt this film. From the beginning, the audience woke up watching the panicous southern slang of the audience. Poor AL is really really, bizarre, and I can not decide on this as part of his role as a drug trafficker, or perhaps he did not get any sleep before coming to the set. Even worse than Pacino's close ups, there is no need for outrage for a plot. At the beginning of the film we were given instructions that the role of the Pacino character is homosexual and I suspect the screenwriter was originally intended. Later, we will stop our belief and believe that Tea Layon and Kim Basinger (both are sleeping through the slums) believe that this old age is half dead, and close to the ridiculous ownership. The main plot thread for the worst part is that it is not entirely explained with some corporate espionage, and we have never watched any of the smallest ever. Since it's a preview I will reserve my final judgment because it's possible to shoot and edit again, but you can not pay one percent to see it in theaters.
