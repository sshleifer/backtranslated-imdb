This is one of the worst submarine I've ever seen as a former submarine. First of all, an unpredictable rebellion in any US naval ship, specifically a nuclear power trident submarine. These men are the best and dedicated to their mission. The responsibilities they take are excellent and most junior team members from the captain are taken very tightly. I can not see any single ship that breaks their affiliation between captain and executive officers. An executive officer played by Denzel Washington was withdrawing his duties and drumming from the navy. The navy did not refuse to send a technical advisor in making this film. Finally, if any member of a submarine crew made a noise in the ship, they strongly reprimanded. Submanners are as quiet as possible to avoid learning at the beginning of their career. They do not slam doors and speak silently and wear soft pillow shoes while ongoing. I was surprised at how big the crew was when they were running. The loudest music never suffered. I know that I did not actually sell the movie ticket to the submarine life, but it's ridiculous. I will not recommend this movie to anybody.
