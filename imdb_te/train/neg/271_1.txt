I can not believe how popular this performance is. I feel like an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and enjoyed many science fiction films and TV shows. I really do not consider this a real science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is a mini-something that makes every episode I'm a slum, reducing the version of a Star Trek episode, making it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It is basically a few people who stand in ARMY FATEs, which occasionally walk through a stargate and end up on a planet that looks like humans, with people who look like human beings! It seemed a very low budget. All of the characters are unforgettable one-dimensional cutouts, and humor many attempts come flat. It reminds me when you're trying to be commercially funny with a prominent athlete but he's not. <br /> <br /> Film is also awful. By space you will be able to do a lot through the portal, each place where ARMY people are gone Boring! It shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series "Alien Nation" was better from a few years ago (based on Aliens film). The show has good stories and good characters. <br /> <br /> Also, unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, copy the "Stargate" look and feel louder image too close! Some people update their exclusive "toilet flushing" when traveling through Stargate.
