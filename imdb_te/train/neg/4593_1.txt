As a physicist student, I learned many idiot professors, and other so-called experts. As I continue with my studies, I will learn more about real physical experiments and people who do the right things. <br /> <br /> My friends want to see this "physical image". <br /> I do not know anything, I hope the information will be happy. <br /> I've done Rial Quantum Mechanics. <br /> <br /> If this story opens your eyes first, it will cause subtle cells, and it will happen to you. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are somewhere around 10 ^ 30 subtomics. That's a million billion billion cells! The "mysterious" quantum effects of only two molecules have a 50% probability to completely abolish each other. When you add more particles into the mix, it's impossible to have a big net quantum result. <br /> <br /> My friend, even in physics, and I counted 3 realities during the film. . <br /> <br /> Since I have no medical training, I can not say much for the nervous part of the film. <br /> <br /> At least in this film the film has a ransom quality: the dance peptides (or whatever) they are the scene. The priceless plot that leads to this movie is not to be destroyed, but the main character sees the different types of "runable" people through his peptides, and then the movie is cut to the dance floor, CG peptides filled with dance peptides, and the dance of the entire population surrounding CG scene. At that time, the film was trying to tell us how we were "feeling emotional", so we say that the song's song is "accustomed to love". <br /> <br /> This scenario is redeemed, because anyone who can go through that scene, and still takes the film seriously ... Well, you need to "open your eyes".
