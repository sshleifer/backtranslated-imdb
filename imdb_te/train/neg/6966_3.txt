This movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The box art for the video has been marketed as a "fun throwback" for the 1950s heavy films. <br /> <br /> The producers obviously wanted to make a film "ALIEN", but they should not have much money. In fact, they do not seem to have any money in reality. <br /> <br /> Basic plot retention - a group of people separated by creatures - and an earthy area will be included for budget reasons. Instead of setting the picture in space, no one will hear you sore, they are set in the film hospital, everyone can see your budget laid laid. The amusing about "Blue Monkey" (and the only thing about it) is that the filmmakers did not abandon the beauty of "ALIEN". Even though we're in a hospital, there is still an incomplete unhealthy affair with science fiction experiments, in this case an honorable "growth hormone" plot device. The appendix also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we need to give an explanation to the monster asking for warmth. The boiler room is too big, filled with multi-level steel cats, which is perfect to allow a point between slam slots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the greenhouse the attacker fires from a rare import factory growing in exotic imports. He touched it and said, "O", so we know he was injured. He cut on his finger causes him to fall into consciousness in a matter of minutes, and in the hospital he gave birth to white worm through his mouth (I guess this is a "ALIEN" picture known as "mouth mute"). The worm is separated, but some naughty little children (leukemia patients) can inscribe and "accidentally" give some experimental growth hormones. Some vulnerable hospital crews know that everyone is in trouble when workers strike a crane, and soon some of the handling fences will find some compulsory relatives before joining a semi-persuasion insect hands. The rest of the film is dominated by semi-off-screen monster and semi-obscure by semi-dark. <br /> <br /> You will be brought back to "ALIEN". How do you ask a movie made in a hospital with all the flashing strobe lights in "Alain" movies? There is no problem ... Power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go through, which apparently causes strobe lights in the room and mosaic film continuously throughout the hospital. It doubles for less than special effects for special effects (although the bugs look pretty well, they do not move very well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a funy toy). <br /> <br /> OK, so "ALIEN" bases we can not cover ... Oh, dripping down water walls! Check out ... We'll divide a huge hospital in two parts, then send some of the characters by wet, drippy basement to get to the other side. To solve the problem, we now have the possibility of many "foreboding tunnel" shots. And do not forget the smoke ... well, you never really have a need for this in horror movies, are you? Well, maybe you're in the hospital, so we create the smoke by lift and burn things. <br /> What kind of script I follow, not giving up acting. I thought "blue monkey" was cheerful and fun, and that would be a good effort, but the pieces would not come together and the movie would be a real drag. "Right of the Aliens: The Deadly Span" If you want to see this movie, it's right, and with less money and more marginal performing skills. This will be flat in its ALIEN.
