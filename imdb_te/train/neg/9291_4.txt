I can not believe that the official reviews of this movie will warn people that both NONE people have too upsetting sexual assault scenes. This is whereas our culture accepts this kind of behavior not just sexual but sexual. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to be counter to these attacks - the woman who has been repeatedly attacked, does not take responsibility for their actions and makes anyone to anyone. When someone threw him with a dagger, a man was stopped, but "you can not force the woman sexually," he said. In a woman's opinion, the film is a let down. This "throws a bone" for women to inform them both skillful warriors and leaders, but this film is largely defined by romance - the concept of human sexuality having the inequality of power, a woman who loves men with men's dominance. This magnificent martial arts fighter does not use his fighting skills to try to escape his attack. She does not apologize to them - instead, she does not apologize. Overall, some great cinematography and some cool fighting scenes are frustrating and disappointing cinema, but it's not as good as a hero through a long shot.
