The film failed to explore the humanity of animals, which broke with empty feeling. [Spooler forward] I'm not convinced that Dr. D really has a compelling reason to relinquish a big purchase deal to help his furry friends. Babe changed the trend of big budget successes by focusing on animal maneuvers, but all animals in the film were happily meat-grinder (more so if Bubble did not understand them). Without Eddie Murphy's Zen behavior, the film becomes a flop.
