<br /> <br /> There are only two things that interest me in this film: I waited for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> This is basically a women's program. Catherine Zeta Jones is just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in the film. Like Jones, he has no role. The film is all Lilly Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). David is the only real character in this dirty script. Well, this was his first and he redeemed himself with a very bad road. <br /> I do not know what the issue of director John de Bont. He did a great job with speed and twister. He really fell into the job here. Perhaps he gets back from the disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for the Wild Wild West, or else it will be the worst film of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
