<br /> <br /> Silent Night is the last of the Deadly Night 5 Series, and Part 4 is not the first of the three, except the title and the theme of the Christmas background horror film. <br /> <br /> There are a few obvious things here ... Mickey Rooney plays the role of Joe Peto, and his creepy son is named Pino. Has an hour ring? Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door of the day and opened it for him to get home. Although it says "do not open up to Christmas," he starts to open it but disconnects his father, calls him a throat, sends the bed and opens the prize. Inside a small red ball, it succeeds to kill Santa's arms and head, and Dad. Oops, maybe he must be alone. <br /> <br /> Derek suffers seriously from the incident, but he can not grow up as a killer santa, who stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a secret stranger around, who knows Joe Peto is very interested in toys. Derek's mother is taking him to a shop when he's got him as a gift to get him out of his wound. And what exactly does this person do? Well, we're not perfect but it does not seem to take these dolls apart to see him make them play. He promises him to pay his boss the next day, delivering him with his "Larry the Larva" doll, but "Larry" is not a good toy and from him <br /> However, it seems that Joe Peto and Pino are going to be With the story, Pino is a "true boy". Pino is probably more alarming and mischievous because he suffers "kontatielia" (a soft plastic coach) so it can cause his bad path. And the identity of the lurking stranger is very exposed, and kind of happy is also kind. <br /> <br /> One step from Part 4, but not much. Again, Bryan Euseja participates, and mad gorge hurts, some good special effects, but it's not enough to make this great. There are also some leftovers from Part 4, such as Clint Howard and Neeth Hunter. Anyway, I'm looking at the entire series from my system now. Now you can get some part of my brain. 5 to 4.
