First thing first. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need in this genre is good music, Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely pale and ineffective. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Ajay Devon has dismissed the letter from 'A' from his spelling and has done a good job, but there is no use for such a bad acting. <br /> <br /> While she is good as ASIN is a doll, she does not dance in the film, actually she's dancing on rock band and I do not think any rock band has a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> The piece is the worst piece of this image in the nut shell. See if you cheat it.
