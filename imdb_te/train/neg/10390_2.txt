I rented and saw this movie, watching all the fuss about it. Here's my reactions. It is easy to see that it is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main plot of the film is about a woman taking revenge on her rape. If this concept is made right, it would be exactly a provocative image. However, this film does not shock me or disturb me. It's frustrating for me. This image is easily less than 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> ************ ******************************** ************************************************** *************** ******* I find rape scenes quite a tangle. If I see a cut or uncut version, I do not know if that version is actually. I also found several plot holes inside an already badly written plot. <br /> <br /> Why did rape rape Jennifer on the night when she went out of her house to find out the noise. <br /> <br /> Why do not they do some of the abuse of relatives and the long-term extension of Jennifer's difficult test? <br /> It may be very frightening and disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you're willing to do a dirty job for these rapists, they should not make a coward to do the job. /> <br /> Why did Jennifer's police call when the rapists finally gave up? What's the first thing that many people pop in for the people, especially for a writer. <br /> When do they look at Jennifer survival? <br /> <br /> Let's hang the tree that the thin lady like Camille pulls a man up. ************************ Ends Spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But the movie is hi Not without greatness, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I recently go back to the house protest house and get to hear one of the funniest line I recently heard when Jennifer kills `Why me? Why me, I do not even c ^ m!
