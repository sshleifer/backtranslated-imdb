I love the men, the action, the shooting, the shooting, the stuffed police movies. <br /> <br /> When I saw this small and unsatisfying film, I left the boy. The hostages, the bank, and the surrounding ... And yet, 2 bad guys were fired by many officials and innocent people - some Kevlar was not hit due to. <br /> Just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Bad hostages went out safely or into a bank locked out of doors. <br /> <br /> Okay, the shots between the fake documentary are good, but only after seeing the movie came the idea: why did not the police come in? A good shooting course? Why there are so many cops and true long break SWAT there. That's really bad.
