My God, is it a "runaway, lola, running" adaptation of meditation? It's terrible. "Screenwriter" (and I use a very close word) cut and pasted from one character to another, often completely relevant and tedious: but Anne Elliott Wentworth's piece is ultimately unpleasant! Aston should be spinning in his grave. A respected young woman did not act in such a conflict. And actress who played the role of Mary? Horrors. <br /> <br /> If the rest of Aston Reconstructions are bad, they will notice the new generation. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this in an amazing novel, Amanda Root (whose voice can speak volumes alone) and Ciaraan Hands, directed by Roger Mitchell, 1995. It is amazing.
