This review is based on the Duckshock-o-Rama video released in the Unwanted World in 2002. How bad is this It's terrible, which represents the '1' IMDb level - but worse than it is. It is good to imagine that the original German-language printing material improves - the comic English-language dubbing is not everything funny - but actually, it's one of the kind of worst amateur films you'll ever see. Zombies in the film are slow and ever clumsy, and they are not able to talk beyond their next meal or think about anything. However, they are also smart enough to operate Chainsaws to know that West Hamas about births will delight their dinner table. George Romero's Land of the Dead demonstrated a zombie nation that retained a cluster of social cohesion; Here, zombies are not more than a blank canvas for extravagant speculation of director Andreas Snanes. Because zombie '90s is a bad joke for anyone who is waste of money, since it is not completely redefining cultural value, and even worse.
