The idea is amazing, the actors are fantastic, the story could be quite scary, but the writing is poor and no depth. I did not really get into this film. I could feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliff hangers, and the picture just ends quite weirdly. Is not it happy? I do not know. Will it end up with sadness? Again, I do not know. You have left the theater feeling unsatisfied. The film had to give a lot of money but could not. Can you edit, right? I do not really recommend this film because you can not say that you have left the concept of the movie as completed. You will be confused. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movie, maybe thank you. <br /> <br />
