My favorite memoir of the show and the band had a Nabib Haters and a big bonfire with a group of friends and some band members of their songs and movie DVD and film threw them into the fire, singing "Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead" Around the burning compound dancing with a cheerful song. It is the best of the show and the program is stupid with this capitol. I hate so much. Get rid of crappy car. You guys really suck! You've really ruined the entire channel! No crime or anything but you should get a life, I mean, really, who does stupid show with stupid lead singer who can not even sing! You guys should get a life of hobos or something, except really terrific sound and Roselina. She is really beautiful. But still, you guys are back!
