Susan Sedelman seems to have a good career with some top-notch credits under her belt. I was bounced back from this movie that seemed to have her worshipers. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I have done well in high school dramas than I did in Smithness. It is ready to make the world of prestigious music involving Susan Berman in the plot of the young world and ready to do just about anything to get there. <br /> <br /> Rizen contributes to the worst performance of the film, in fact it rejects the honesty of a young artist. The worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is good to capture the familiar East Village locations that portrayed Seidelman's eye for film career. But her live performers do not measure her work. <br /> <br /> If you like rock punk, you may sit through this for soundtrack. I will adhere to Bing Crosby.
