As a person suspected at the remarkable visuals of "hero", it is interesting to see the film, as well as the same sequence, but it is good. This is the actress I love: Gai Zhang. Well, I was disappointed with both things. I bought a DVD that was not seen by the movie and that was wrong. This is not good. <br /> <br /> I understand that these flying-through-martial martial arts films are a pure fantasy but this story is far from distant distinction so far, which is a disappointing disbelief. Is a blind woman losing hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it goes a long way. In addition, the big male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kanshiro) has also ruined the film with his dialogue and stupid look on his face and stupid laugh. <br /> <br /> This film is mine "Hero" - with amazing colors and amazing action sequences, this story - me - just do not have an appeal to make a movie worth owning it!
