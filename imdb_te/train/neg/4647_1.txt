Half reviews are good, so I took the opportunity for $ 10. Priscilla Burns certainly have some sex talk but not quite. After the entire plot she may be the mother of the other actress and it is stretching the documentary maker who is falling for the young lady. It's not funny, it's not raunchy its too much anything but time wasting. Boogie Nights rely on real people in the adult industry who do not rely on anything in the industry. It surprised the elderly in adult movies gaining today's Gonzo videos and the big dancing they had in the early 1970s for what was better and better decades ago in the early 19th century.
