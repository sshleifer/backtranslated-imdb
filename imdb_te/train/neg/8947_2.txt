The book is amazing, this is not a movie. There is no reason to see the future of the book's attention. Hell, the whole recall was released a few years later and it did a good job, and the clockwork Orange released in the 70s made a good job of trying to make a future world. Blake German Expressionistic colors, black and white views from the screens, created in 1984, there is no reason for this process. The main character is in a black collar writing job, yet he works with oil and grease in a garage. The film determines a Mac-Communist approach to setting design, atmosphere and plot, but the novel does not necessarily finalize the Communist, Worship-Humble-Activist theme. This book is needed to get acquainted with the modern content, since the book is much earlier than ever. I could not see this trash more than 20 minutes. Soundtrack is painless and uncomfortable, and the film is made to reject the feel of realism or reliability when the novel's messages are perfectly suited to the hammer.
