The film is Richard Pierre, Rossi Grayer and others. It serves as an interesting WW2 film, and a statement about racism. When problems arise, it is good to understand how the films reflect about how and when they are not about the time it takes to paint. This means 70 pictures are not 40 images (WW2). Also, there are a few good scenes of 7 seven blacks led by a white captain who is trying to capture a dam. These men are soldiers and not just a service company is the captain learning story. A picture from a civil war film and a WW2 movie reflects the film. Black left. A German woman gives an innocent peck on the cheek, and the white captain is upset. I enjoyed the movie from the curiosity standpoint as the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
