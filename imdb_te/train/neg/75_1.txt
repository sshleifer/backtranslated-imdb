Ned Kelly (Ledger), notorious Australian expatriation and myth. Like Billy the Kid's combination of Robin Hood, the Australians love the story of how he stood against English elite oppression, and the integration of lower classes to change Australia forever. The fact that the lowest time around 70% of migrant criminals around the time seems to be wiping around this film. <br /> <br /> There are very few 'facts' reflection in this movie, a tad is irrational. <br /> <br /> In early lending, the film depended on the book 'Our Sunshine'. A sexy version of the truth can be seen in a book in a book. <br /> It is not a historic legend in one of many unrealistic stories of Nar Kelly. <br /> Unfortunately nude Kelly Holman Chanel is the real life historic play! In the surprising manner the story plods alongside two hours after the drivel of the pure plain with the alarm (because the story is never ever plodded slowly) brought the memories of Coststar's awful Wyt Earp all years ago. Simply put, there is nothing in the film, but nothing that takes a long time. The performances are good if it could be a tad more bearable (not sure in the direction of the heck). However, unless you're looking to play a game with the worst Oirish accent spot, then you're gonna be disappointed. Among those, 'Who has the stupidest beard?', 'Clear backstabber spot!' (The clue, they are all giggling for a few reasons) and 'singing in Australia', which is the experience of a huge hangover by Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel and Neighbors. Yup keeps showing wildlife shots meaningless, as the film fills out, much like filing the nature (perhaps the artistically visible effort), and here shows all the local races, here is a circus for a camel and <br <br /> <br /> "There is no good word about this movie, but it's usually an awesome rush here. When one of only two bullets left him and his friend, I had a gun to disperse the memories of this film from my head!
