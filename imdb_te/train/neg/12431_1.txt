I want to say that curiosity got better for me. I saw the trailer, I can tell you the whole story. I managed to save an hour and forty minutes of my whole life, twenty dollars. This is a hassle for Hollywood, the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the obvious ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all the neighborhoods and enters the house. It is also covered with clothes. Do you believe the remote can not air a signal in those scenarios? Hollywood does not clearly believe that. Any concept of general logic and electronics defines opposition; There is also a chance to go home alone through the street car. Another dubious feature is the lack of surveillance that criminals have. Why are these criminals rocket scientists until the age of eight? Did you want a kid to be the most intelligent figure in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please have more reality in the Matrix. Moreover, the leader is suppressing his real gun and "unexpectedly" calls a plastic pistol; Apparently, he did not say the difference. Even with a glove, one should come in. It does not mean they are visible; Other senses are then focused. Traps are unreal; If one of them actually worked, the criminals died. But, Hollywood desires at us "funny" results of "lively" traps. I did not laugh; <br /> <br /> But, I saw this film as a bad film. The film they have seen looks like Citizen Kane. Otherwise, skip this one for your pride. Alone 3 home also raises a question. We all know the stars of Alex D. Linkz, but did he write it as well?
