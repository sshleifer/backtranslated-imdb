I agree with everyone who told me this, but the soundtrack was probably my whole life. There are original voices when you are listening to actors. And a Broadway version of singing Danzig singing, "Dark darkness! Dark, dark forest darkness!" Or something intimidating. The singer has a terrible vibrato and is recorded with some string-up string section and triple-y microphone on fake drum beats. It's terrible !! <br /> Yeah, awful that leads to males. So women. It's a bad case of gender stereotyping - it's so bad! They say they are a male or female, playing a normal thing. He is sick. Sun boring !!! <br /> <br /> Children are in their own form, you can not understand them. And why do female ghost kids always wear cute little bows in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny elegant hair? <br /> <br /> Daddy's face is free and smooth for someone living in a cave. Nice beard and bangs, p. <br /> <br /> Are you sure you cut the knife with a knife or go to town and go to the salon? <br /> Stupid image.
