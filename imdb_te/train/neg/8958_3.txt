I do not really like the first "cube" image. It's a good idea, but the annoying acting and the characters always keep me from getting the best of me. Actually, I did not really have the necessity to watch its sequel but I have heard a movie movie that pretends to be the prequel to the original movie. I was amazed, perhaps because they wanted to solve the real problems and give us a memorable cast of letters. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts at Cube Zero with the introduction of two characters for the never-ending maze of people who have never suffered in Cube. The filmmakers succeeded in understanding the mystery with the establishment of two men. It has created a number of questions, about why the people were sent there and the real nature of those who run the full operation. These are all abandoned to the viewer. This performance was very weak but it went relatively well in the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> In this moving story, two "observers" are raising serious doubts about what he is doing. And then a group of trapped people decides to help and help. <br /> <br /> All the cheesy cheese starts to break up faster. <br /> <br /> We have been introduced to the role of "Jacks" by people who run the cube program. Why the film's failure is the main reason for his two underlings. The "Popular" Glass Eye never covers the "Jaws" and the third rated villain directly taken from a James Bond movie, the first half will destroy only the atmosphere created by relatively good pace. It begins to enjoy more comedy than a more serious comedy. Some striking lines, perhaps the screenwriter bored, ignored. Acting is even smaller when the former "Kavalli" team meets in Cube. <br /> <br /> The weak characters, dialogue and acting "Cube Zero" are nothing but a horror movie.
