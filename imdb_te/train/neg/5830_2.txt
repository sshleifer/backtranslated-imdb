Drawing temperatures 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> How would you know when you're in the midst of a proud picture? Is there just about 8 lines of dialogue in a 140-minute film? Is Bijore wearing a fur-Asian karma like a big fur pita on her head? Perhaps mammoth wounds and spinal columns used in the Whale Blobber experiment. Or, when you're ready to kill a composer to create a minimalist and more annoying version of Philip Glass score? In any case, drawing temper is among the most proud of the 9 modern art films. In 135 minutes, it adds boring to its preference to boot. I called the use of amazing color, and the opening sequence interest, but the rest of it appeared to be filmed for the Discovery Channel documentary. <br /> <br /> In fact, documentary-esquire parts are the best parts of it. Surface plot is about a whale ship, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then there are guests in the form of Bazaar and Matthew Barney, who are welcomed in the ship, who suffer from humiliating skin, passing head hair (fraud boy pills), nicotine patches and giant furry pita tots. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney has stated that "the relationship between self-obedient resistance and creativity." It's almost like saying, "If you do not get it, you can not create your commentary, so it's fine because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, the pat-modern commentary of the sentence and the picture will be if it is post-modern. But it should be modern art. It's about art. <br /> <br /> Let's start the whole commentary bit. <br/> The first half hour started with pearl divers and large ramp construction. Apparently, the ramp is a symbol of the need for self-elevation to any standards you have dear, and pearl divers are looking for pearls of knowledge. Then, on the whale ship, they build a round shape that looks like a whale shaped of a whale. <br /> <br /> In the ship they whale shaped whale, and take a piece of wings. They replace it with a spine column and then with a larger burden. It is thought to be the states of this film. Its fat, its fun but bad for you. When it is a spine column, its "important" components, or spine speak. <br /> <br /> Bizor and Matthew Barney arrive at exclusive ships, which make them weird insulting clothes, or SYMMETRICAL, who suspect they are running out of money and are trying to leave Burney smoking. SO, they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about a ship from a Japanese intelligent man who informs them that the ship is hiding from the hoisting of a different ship; A crash or intersection, if you did. It cuts them out of the bizarque and Barney, which is different from outside, and eat them, thus turning them into a single person. They meet. Oh, have you forgotten to say that Robbie Williams was on the video? Then, Pearl divers come back to their mouth full of knowledge of pearls and let them fall to make a stupid WHEN diagram. Barney made it through 8th class geometry. Or, perhaps some social studies. <br /> Oh, and I forgot Bjöcker's ear-groing to kill what I wanted-did she forget her score? <br /> <br /> The art picture is one thing, but when you discard all kinds of marks in hopes of getting reaction from people, you are hypnotic. , Which becomes a self-destructive joke. When you cross the middle line to become a joke in artistic terms? Dalí and Bunuel have often performed rare delicate pieces, but are more coherent and / or fun than this piece. <br /> <br /> IanChina holds a sense of sympathy for Andaluc. <br /> You only love high ART movies filled with symbolism and flat imagery. <br /> <br />
