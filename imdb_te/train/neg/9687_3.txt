This is a serious image. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is merely degraded by a set of men and women, which are simply described as a collection of oddballs and misfits. Although Felin's film was inspired by "8 1/2", Felin was not the Greenway, even though it was the world's titan. <br /> <br /> He is the most ambitious and divides the film into chapters with a written introduction to everyone, to the viewer to guide the film, For women, Palmira, who only played Polly, can only see two. Watar and Giaconda Nadacha Amal. The rest of the proletariat <br /> <br /> Green is clearly evident that the live fantasy does not lead to sexual fantasy, and women and men make reality from the rigid light of reality. Women are discouraged because they offer their services instead of money. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of happiness or happiness or love in the film, in fact many scenes are deeply sore: <br /> <br /> John Standing and Matthew Dememarelli refers to the relationship between father and son, Philip and Story Emmantas Starred in the middle row. Gaiakonda is actually pregnant with two men who are carrying her baby, the first fetal miscarriage and the second, she is sent to a destination chosen by men from a flight book. Two men do not have sex with women (half woman in the titles). The animal between the barrel played by Amita Plummer is with a pig called Harthans. The Father and the Son share their women. Sexually beaten women. <br /> <br /> In this scenario no one is sexually exposed, just reference. <br /> <br /> According to the suggestions by women, no one was surprised when the film was first broadcast in Cannes. What's more unusual is that the actresses in the film have risen up to defend it, there is no limit to the simplicity of women and women are being repeatedly exploited by men. Greenway's directional style is very serious, along with the art of success and the art of art in art. <br /> Greenway attempts to achieve the supremacy of surrealism, the relation of human relationships.
