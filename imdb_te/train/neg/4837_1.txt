I went to see what the movie was about the hype, I am surprised at today's 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Catherine Biglow want to win the Best Picture and Best Oscars Award? The totally unnatural 'cowboy' bombing-man story is anyone I could not see? Why did I get mental pictures as a remake of some old Western paintings about cowboy doing "brave things" in the Wild Wide West with these 'evil' red Indians? But is it just set in a different setting at this time? Oscar is given because the director is being Cameron's former, and it shows a nice underdog (Gossiple) Munch on the day-time TV shows? <br /> <br /> It is the sort of emperor's clothes syndrome - many people have learned that junk is not, but others do not say that it is hard to say. <br /> What finally happened? Did the sniper view show a high-resolution-super slow mole dropping shell casing when they say 'deep message' or anything? EOD guys' snipers are suddenly made and they get dirty terrorists at all times. It's just like me that there are too many bits and pieces here and there in the movie in the pressure for the reason for the reason? <br /> If you do not yet see, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait for them to drive in TV in a few years. You can not miss much.
