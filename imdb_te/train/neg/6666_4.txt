I really like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not like to spoil this movie - do not worry from the beginning you know something bad happens - but here is an example of how sloppy this movie is. The Cowboy and "Twig" Ride Up Ride. The cowboy has a handle bar. Cowboy and "Twig" a shootout and race down the half way down the ridge. The cowboy is a clean golden by the rest of the film. For a short time between the gun battles and the ride on the hill, the cowboy came in time to shave, in the back of the horse. <br /> <br /> To be fun, acting through four main characters.
