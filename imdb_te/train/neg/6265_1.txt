I'm the director nephew. It's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can really confirm that it is one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle did not even have a copy of it (I asked). <br /> <br /> In the meantime, IMDb puts only 206 votes in 30 minutes in "Lower 100", but it still does not. <br /> <br /> However, I am giving copies of the film for holiday gifts to family members this year. The best / worst gift
