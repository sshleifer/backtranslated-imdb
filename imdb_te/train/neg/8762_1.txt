One scientist (John Corredrine - sin) finds how to bring the dead back to life. But they will come back with face to face with marble. Eventually this leads to all disaster <br /> The boring, totally speculative 1940s outing. I was scared when I was a kid, but now I have only bores. I struggled to stay awake! With an exception, acting is terrible. Such expressive boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things to say about this: Karadine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are some mildly creepy moments involving the Great Dane's ghost walking through the walls. There is also one of the most outdated knockouts in cinema history. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this. Avoid.
