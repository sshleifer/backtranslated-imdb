This is often the case, there are nothing more impressive and explosive trailers of Asian paintings than cartilage stories. Unlike the Unleashed (which is great), dog bite dog men grew up as horrific brutal dogs to take their masters bidding. We often see the main characters, common heroes and villains who are an emotionally flimsy and innocent killer that is against a equally unstable police officer. In fact, in the end, if you fail to feel even the slightest emotion of men, who will lose track who is supposed to empathize ?? <br /> You are the director's failure or when you decide to make a clear message when trying to do what he says. <br /> <br /> Film was initially intrigued and unpredictable, the way slopped down a tired story of survival and vengeance. The first apparently suspect was disappeared, because it was the most unmatched music score when it was the most influential story. In the end, you can see that the remarkable background information and insight of the main characters are something very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, very different compared to US movies ?? <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with Asian films and dislike the speculation of Hollywood should check it out. <br /> <br /> White balance did not appear throughout the film. When it was set on Tungsten, Florescent was shot on the film. <br /> <br /> Do you play the hypocrites in this film too? An interesting build-up gave me hope for a slow-moving story until a low budget, which led to the chase scene at low speed. And when you feel that you have to get an indelible funeral indie with Shakespeare's tragedy, you will realize that it does not end, and changes in an absurd country-music montage about peace and serenity. <br /> <br /> Some shocking confusing from choke scenes, the moment of redemption was brought back to unexpected brutality, and again in other ways, with a fierce musical score that was as attractive as the Asians and physically absorbed by physical fluids, br> I do not know why every fight scene broke with clips of roaring lions. Did they recognize dogs? Finally, finally, we're reminded of the real murderer. <br /> <br />
