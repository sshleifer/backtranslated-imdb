I would like this movie, yes it's a SAW, Blah Blah Roefeff but I liked those pictures. Well this is not good, excellent, but good image contains all ingredients .... Unfortunately those ingredients have gone off! It was the first time when this acting was terrible, and it was the first time when the hostages were introduced with one of their captives (the hoods were removed), the comments and the one liners were just terrible, yes my bad writing .... Yeah, that's more than bad writing. Two of the hostages have a relationship with each other and most of the film does not yet know ... <br /> Sorry, I'm sorry why I'm struggling to review this issue <br /> <br /> I'm plot with plot holes, plot holes & more Ends with holes! Disappointed!
