The tragic thing is that it has to work with the highest budget "Halstorm Entertainment". All of the joints should be penalized for infiltrations as it is better than filling all celluloid waste. Apart from the terrible writing and jokes, the camera's work and film quality are the best of the amateur. Some guys have a soundtrack created on the laptop PC. The worst part of it is that I really sit through the whole thing. I feel because I'm not actually paid to buy a ticket and I'm confident that I'm actually agreed to show the "movie" in the theater watching.
