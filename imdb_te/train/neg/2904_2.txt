In the first 10 minutes of this film, the main character who wrote a lifetime advisory column, Tables-OH-so-smarter and learning some valuable life lessons, then you're wrong with something. Although the rest of the film is good, it is very imaginative (not possible) to destroy the movie <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between the leads, Steve Karel's incognito-ish behavior is not fun, it is difficult. It is difficult to believe that Binoo's character is interested in him. Then at the end it's all awesome and it's up wrapped up after everyone is never happy. That's not great America!
