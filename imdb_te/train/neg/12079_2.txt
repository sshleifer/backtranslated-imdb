If he could adapt this horrible German-TV adaptation of this classic drama, the poor will go to his grave. It's obvious that it has spent very little money. Pass as a stage racer, a catwalk and some randomly placed vertical set. With the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines, the film is dubbed into the useless English. It's very dark and dull for the whole product. Anyway, where is the picture of the phone? MST3K gave it a qualified treatment for this pardon product. <br /> <br /> Do not have or not? I want this film to be the first place ever.
