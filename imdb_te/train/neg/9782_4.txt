This film is such a promise !! An underdog paintball team struggling for any great idea, recognition and personal reputation loses speed because of just a bad dialogue, poor edit and half-manuscript story. <br /> <br /> If you spend some time in the story and dialogue, the characters in the beginning are interesting. Instead of an almost complete work, a great image.
