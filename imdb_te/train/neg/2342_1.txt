I do not know that I am great about this film. Worse, why should anyone bother looking at this? Not everything first. It is not possible to watch a movie without a story, because it carries a strong feel (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion the film does not. <br /> You're just looking at images at +/- 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film is an experiment and it is daring since it is not mentioned above. But your precious time and 7 money is worth 2 hours in your money? The answer is not for me.
