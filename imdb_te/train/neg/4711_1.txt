I really hate this presentation! I saw an episode, I know this show is really terrible. The story lines are poorly written and executed and jokes are very bad ... I mean a sh ++ ty rip-off of the Duxdor's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, 'a bad man with blind twins with his twin mothers sisters and spoken dogs; A stay-at-home dad and a smart, super busy mom ... oh-my-flippin'- god! Their father is a mother-f ** kin 'crazy home-maker, so is not gay! If my father is a home producer, I will die personally! <br /> I do not have anything in this case. Calculate 3 words to describe it: <br /> · Lem, stupid and more ... · F ** K UP! That's all I can say folks, it's definitely making my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I have one.
