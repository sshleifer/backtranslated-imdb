If I write a review about a movie, perhaps it will stick with me ... but I usually hope I'll forget it. Why trouble Because I saw a low-rated movie that was fun to watch again. <br /> <br /> It's not great, but at least it's unbearable ... it's always comedy and it always makes me feel terrified. It's just sweet soft ... and if you do not, stay in the locker room for boys. <br /> <br /> I agree with those who protect it for those who protect this image because they do not like to target its target population and can not afford the elderly. <br /> Here and there are some good chuckles, but not one side splitter on the side. Certainly it's crazy and just a little fun, but at least it does not suck (as far as it says). Are those folks afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency towards grade bell in the bell curve, so 4,5 or 6 okay all-round ratings in my book. It makes sense to give a 4 and it will pillow its rating during this writing. The rating numbers do not mean, as it is done by giving 1 or a 10 people. I can not believe how people feel strongly about this durable soft fur (or even worry about writing about it). Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts Claredycat should note that her character is very convincing. Ariel Kebel is often written in B * ch characters, when her role comes to her is not disappointing. <br /> <br /> The Bruce Spence you play Leonard is also helpful. But if you have a teen girl before in your life, rent this movie for her ... and do not hate it (you can also enjoy it).
