I've seen some bad films (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but the film is terrifying, so Bouring, I walked through the half way and could not bear to see the rest. A painful one. Based on waves like Kenneth Brahrang, Embeth Davits and the story of Robert Duvall and John Grisham, what happened? Brannag is a big-time advocate, one-night sneak with Davids. Her father (Duval) is a mental illness that hangs her cat, and Brunag sends him to a Nathshahah and he immediately escapes. Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hanna, Pham Janssen and Tom Bermaner tie the story together with the complete mix of the story. I like it and I've read all about this film because it's a huge grisham fan and I thought (something) interesting. This is honestly the worst picture I say and I wish I could return my money. * Out of *****.
