Cartoon Network is disappointing for ratings. The network began with the abolition of samurai jack, and the network was seen as eliminating all programs such as Powerful Girls, Dexter Lab, Dragon Ball Z etc., when ratings started to rise, CN was some beautiful medium performances. Although the entire drama island / action and chowder stand out due to their brilliant writing and audience-pleasing gestures, there are plenty of terrible remakes (George of the Jungle) or other performances of Ripps, the Marvelous Missadventures Flapjack, the name of Spongebob, and later to Dexter's Laboratory Alternate jana There is a test, but it is much more than anything else. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the show is clear only from the Decker Lab, wherein Johnny suffers his twin sisters, Susan and Mary, who are only in the role of a blonde (or a fiery beau), who is just a mirror from orange hair, . There is also a rival intellectual, Bling Bling Boy or Eugene, who looks for Mandark. <br /> <br /> One of the best cartoons on Dexter's Laboratory Television is its simple, but effective art style, the beloved main character and episodes are not a long drag. Johnny Test is very different. The art style here is almost not attractive to the eye. In fact, it looks absolutely awful. The characters are really annoying or repulsive. There are many series 'parts in Johnny and Dookie's quest for destroying the twins' siege on the door beside Johnny's secret neighbor neighbor Sissy, or a kid. <br /> <br /> Johnny knows that these two geniuses look stupid and do not want to be associated with anyone, there is no real relationship between the viewer and the characters. <br /> <br /> In spite of its massive exploitation, Johnny is Susan and Mary's guinea pig for their experiments. This range from Johnny fat, bizarre, clumsy, and becoming a woman. Twins then help in what scheme Johnny plans to re-plan for his services. The episode involved in this type of "winning / win" deal is always going to be satisfactory without appearing and canceled. <br /> <br /> Writing is mediocre, however terrible. The 'fat' episode is repeated continuously "It's a Phat with PH, you know." This episode should never be repeated, especially when the episode baby promotes obesity, becoming a popular actress with money and videogames with Johnny Family, becoming a candle. </ p> <p> The Decker Lab is not completely separated. The show hosted two men-in-blocks from John and his sisters and super villains Milan Black and Mr. Here, Mr. Frege's Teenage Clone stole ideas for other resources such as a nasty cat with other cats, such as a cats man (like a bad-talking cat from powerpuff girls), a mugger maniac conductor, a trilogy evil skater 'dudes' and a mole man , Which is the most cliche villain in the media. <br /> <br /> It is only plain ear-division (like Johnny, Ducky and every villain in this show), with its ugly animation and unlockable characters, all of them topped (like voices for Black and Mr. White). <br /> <br /> This song is not a good thing for Johnny Test. <br /> Finally, Johnny Test is not good. Cartoon. Its horrific references and jokes about teen culture break up the little children's interest in the show, but its bright colors, the emerging characters and episodes of the episode will destroy the experience for teens. This is one of the worst performances that the cartoon network is promoting to cheat people (like MTV to the rap). If you need a performance that satisfies your kids for a half hour, because Johnny Test is more of a "test" of patience than anything, you'd better stick to Spongebob.
