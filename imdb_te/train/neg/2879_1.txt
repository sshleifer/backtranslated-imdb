It's the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. I do not have a shred of truth at all in the beginning of this film from Kansas. It took the BTK name and did the rest. I just got $ 20 bucks and it looks like someone is on top like someone who made a film and did not have to worry about btk research at all that just made it. No one can see the film seriously. The killing cows and the killing of his victims and eating animal slaughter BTK did none of these things, but the movie never looked at the awful picture of this god for the love of God. The TV is a good way and the path is more accurate
