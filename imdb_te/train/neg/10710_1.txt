Dalf Lundgren as a temporal to New York, when an archaeologist finds a key opposing Christ, the ghost is only a couple miles behind the dolph, and the body is transferred from the body. (Like Fallen without suspense) Lundgren came out of his element and the film was totally unseen. I'm a fan of dolf linggren like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Dumm√©, and I try to see his films whenever they are on TV. I was attracted to Munien and the boy was disappointed. This film is absolutely horrific. Combat sequences are very low and you can just get a more conceivable sense of combat as you work properly. The worst thing is that this film is a bad guy (!) This film is worse than the Fallen (which is good) and End of Days (bad but better than this) The movie is the worst I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. It's literally nothing to recommend it. It's terrible and it is the lowest point in the length of Lundren's career. <br /> 1/2 * 4 off (horror)
