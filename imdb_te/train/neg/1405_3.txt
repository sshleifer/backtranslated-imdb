"Dancing in Theses" is certainly not one of Fred Astier's best musical stories. <br /> <br /> In "Damsell", Astereller, Jerry Holiday, is an American musician, a personal performing tour in London. <br /> <br /> He meets Lady Alice Marsharmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress who is hoping to hide the worshipers from a mob to escape a mob. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jerry Alice is married to his aunt's maternal uncle. She tries to save her from her family's domestic households, but soon finds that the staff of the house crew has wager, which is married to Lady Alice. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the bragging butler and Albert (Harry Watson) gorgeous housewife boyfriends (Reginald Gardiner) to help and alleviate Lady Alice's love with Jerry to make sure they win the race. First, PJ There is a novel based storyline. Vodhouse (co-writer of screenplay). This story is slow, painful, and nervous-hard. When Fred is not dancing, (a) Fred Romancing Zone Fantasy or (b) Cogs and Albert Cnnwowing Again and one with each other. <br /> <br /> Butter and the boy in the house is particularly irritating. They are a dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you want to punch in the mouth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, Joan Fontaine is a poorly popular woman, and a musical mischief. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen, Jerry's publicist and his confused secretary. <br /> <br /> George Stevens is not good at directing the film. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by director George Stevens. At times, cinematography is terrible and offshoot. We have open scenes in many fog streets, we're in London and we try to persuade those in Hollywood. (They used dry ice tones in the film.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin were excellent, and the traditional song standards. Moreover, Dancing is unusual in the film, thanks to Asterer and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the musical and dance numbers are filled with illness and illness. Sometimes, actors start singing and dancing because it's time to sing and dance. Musical numbers are randomly incorporated into sensational plots. (At one point, the Butterrunner grab out of the gap and breaks down in opera solos for obvious reasons.) These numbers are: "I'm dancing and I can not play now" - Fred walks well on a London street filled with fog traffic. He makes some great "cane-triangle" with the injured umbrella - but Fred ends the number of jumps in a passing double-decker bus very quickly. <br /> <br /> Broadway music, "Crazy For You," Harry Gonner made a better version of the band with the band. <br /> <br /> Fred, George and Gracie make a trio tap dance in an English cottage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Fred and Joann Fontaine together with their dancing together. The backyard of the domestic estate. <br /> "Fog Day in London Town" - Fred revolves around the snow-covered moor estate on Friday, when he first met Jon to Jon. <br /> <br /> "Nice work if you can get it" - A great song is in the film abuse. In a social show at Mallor's House, Fred asks the band with slum vocalists singing this song in a horizontal way. Fred meets every time, seeing him as if other singers leave him. (Again, Harry Gonner did good dance number for the song in "Crazy For You") ï‚· "Drum Dancing Number" - Fred and Jon fled, Fred stopped a last bag dance number and a group of drums. As always, it's a great dance number. <br /> <br /> When fred decides to hit a large stone balcony at the country estate to prove his love, the film comes with the most contrived moment. For Zone Fontine. When he jumped from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze - that's right, * trapeze * - hanging from the nearby tree. Fred (or a stuntman in Fred's clothes) trapezes and swings from the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is only for dance numbers, but you owe it to the person and find the fast forward button on your remote. >> FF button allows you to bypass other boring scenes of the image to get the dance numbers.
