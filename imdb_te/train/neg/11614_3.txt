A lady in cement is a real course in social anthropology at the end of the 60s. Acting is not in the middle stage. I said - a pure camp! Prepare you will suffer if you are as a woman or gay. Brad and Dame standard regulations and homosexuals and bashings are suggested (camp-wise) in the day. Some very amazing character actors have thrown off too many lines despite amazing performances. Action scenes are mundane but Don Blackber is fun to watch the tough guy who loves bashing toughs. And Lani Kazan and Rocky Welsh are at their luxurious peak of their careers. They both were 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. Concert, wait. . . Is there a score Well, you get the point. See friends who want good laugh. It's full of them.
