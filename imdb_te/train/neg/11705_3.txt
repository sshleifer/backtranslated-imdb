This stuffy play is the worst film featuring Ingrid Bergman that I've seen so easily. <br /> <br /> Her bright screen presence can not save this inexpensive slow and shaky film, it is almost impossible to sit without being sent too fast. <br /> <br /> For Die-Hard Bergman fans only; Others are more likely to fall asleep. Instead you see "For Whom to Be Bell Homes".
