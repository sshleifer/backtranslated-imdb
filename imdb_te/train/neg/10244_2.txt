I work as a hotel janitor in Washington DC and take my position, there is nothing remotely accurate about the role played by Michael J. Fox. # 1 We do not just walk through our pockets with theater tickets and $ 100 bills burst! # 2 I'd fired on the spot if I was able to use a room for someone's afternoon pleasure time! The company I belong to (Les Cleves d'Or) has a definite standard of morality and behavior that we take seriously. Doog removed his golden key logo and made it to some other employee - we earned those keys and the badge of respect and wisdom to wear them. There is a whole application and the veting process to join our company. <br /> <br /> The film does not have to pay an unpleasant feeling to a soldier. In short it makes us disagree with our company. I will do any comments.
