It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only feature I can give is this film, when I look at the worst vampire film for the next time, I have the right answer. <br /> I think it's shot on 35mm, so it's already like hell. I'm not worried to comment but some fans (probably connected with the movie) have seen that the film is the best after the Matrix. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the film. Everything yells yelling. Actress Ugly. Combat choreography is the worst I have ever seen. Fight scenes are unbelievable. Imagine a girl who is weakly knocking her arms around a circle and giving her a weak kicks that do not hurt a kitten. <br /> <br /> I do not know the director has too much budget, but I know that in the earlier small budget, better movies were made. Unforgivable.
