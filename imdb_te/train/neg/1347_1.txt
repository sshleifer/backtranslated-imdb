Inspector Gadget is probably my all-time favorite of 80 cartoons. I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's Christmas Special "Inspector Gadget Saving". Some Gadget fans criticized the show's second season (1985), but they did not have the D.C. of "Inspector Gadgets Last Case: Class's Revenge" In 2002, I was unable to prevent the chance to see an animated inspector gadget in something Gadget Fan, Gadget Boy-related, but something in the second season. I bought the movie and I agree that I am aiming. I know that from the original series sometimes artistic freedom can be taken. <br /> <br /> * "The penny and the brain (actually the gadget There are almost equal parts in the series) Fifteen is not in action for twenty minutes. <br /> * There is no original music of Saban & Levi, and the score is sub-par. (Saban now has his own production company Gadget-coat, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which was actually used but it was not even called the same) ), As well as his other standard hat and hand gadgets Teliskopikga pringsku there instead. I hate that kind of stuff, and change the appearance of the real fans are not needed. <br /> <br /> gadjetmobail from the original series, talking faster now, "hip" is called convertible. All fans of the original line have changed into a gadget van to change the gadget van. <br /> * Chief Qimbe is now too short-tempered and also means gadget. <br /> * Penny is no longer a computer book. <br /> <br /> Are there any positives for this movie? ? <br /> <br /> * Marius Lamar does a good job for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> In one scene, the chief queens from the cartoon series to the true villain: in the Great Season (Classic Classic "from the second season," the villain Louis New "). <br /> <br /> Looking for more rife factors for this movie? Well, you're not lucky. Life is selected by these options and lives. Many of life's conditions teach a lesson also have a purpose. The lesson learned here: Put the original formula! "If it's not broken, do not fix it." True gadget fans should be clear from this movie; You will surely be disappointed. <br /> Hopefully, DC and shout! The factory will continue releasing the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true gadget fan, 80 animation and D.C. Lover of programs, "I inspired me to buy" Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1 "and" Inspector Gadget RS Christmas "DVDs. Good memories.
