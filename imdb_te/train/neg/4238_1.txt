This film is awful. Finally you will realize that you have been stolen from your life for many hours. "Twist" is very good. The role that leads to the end does not conform to their final actions at the end of development. Ninety-minute preparation - Rob Lowe character dies on Christmas Eve premise - literally described in ninety seconds "No we are tricking you." Then Rob Low's character is not even worried about it! "If you can forgive me, I will forgive you." If someone takes me a couple of weeks to convince me, I will die and "No, sorry, let's run you" I will raise some serious hell. I want to be able to save some people from there because I do not feel bad about giving a spoiler. Please save yourself and do not see this movie.
