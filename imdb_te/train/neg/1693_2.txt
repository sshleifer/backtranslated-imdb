My husband and I have gone to see this movie, we are fans of that horror movie. Two hours later I wish I could return my money and time. I was disappointed. Teasers for this film basically have the best points of the film. There is nothing quite scary about the film other than surprise entrants better time, etc. I find 'scary' episodes much more ridiculous than anything. After seeing other movies based on Japanese writers' writings, I feel threatened in Japan is not a threat to America. My advice: If you're a fan of true horror movies, keep your sigh of pain in yourself. I can not say that I would recommend that you rent, unless you have a free rental.
