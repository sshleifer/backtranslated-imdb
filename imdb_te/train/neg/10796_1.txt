The movie "commercial" film or Hollywood movies prove to be in serious crisis. This film must have been produced as anyone would have expected the success of Shakyi's name. The value of plot is worth: It is worse than a little more than.What? The screen is somewhat dimmer, O'Neill is a bad actor but Frances Kapra is worse. <br /> Rating: 1/10.
