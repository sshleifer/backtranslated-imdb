Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality was pleasantly surprising, and I decided to give Murder by Numbers Shot. Mrs. Bullock's performance (see Hope Flots, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) is essential in plucky, self-influenced roles, "serious" characters. Her character is uncommon, confusing, and sexually occurring (Sandra's last subdirectory is an undesirable filler that she has already made so little to develop a shallow character). Two teenage boys have performed well, but their forensics expertise and the catch-men-a-ka-wine attitude were rejected by stupid defects and "we did!" Ben Chaplin's token partner / love interest role is the most obvious suspect that Chris Penn is ruined here. <br /> *** Spellers forward *** Main acting aside, the biggest disadvantages can be traced to a TV-of-week weekly plot that you do not buy completely into the murdered intentions in the first place, and as mentioned, stupid errors (murder The scene was a rare food up vomiting, all very convenient and framing school conveyor, two boys openly meeting, Favorable love interest that can cause reproof), bored by the murderers and cause a view of frustrated conspiracy. The end is definitely "by numbers" and is probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. At the beginning of the film, using a click-through strategy to show almost the clickdict scenes, the filling of the audience as we arrived at that time, no one was surprised at the final scenes and the movie called Intelligence. Somewhat hopeful feeling, but poorly executed and weak in almost every way. * Out of ****.
