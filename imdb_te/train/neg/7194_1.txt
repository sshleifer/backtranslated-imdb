To steal Disney's very popular achievements .. I mean .. buying familiar features and hurting them, this live-action version of the respectable cartoon class will make the worst returns in bad years. I grew up in the original cartoon TV series. The episode of the original cartoon series will make you smile more than this whole movie. Not cool penny's cool computer book right now. Furthermore, the chief does not have a gag with the directions of self-destructive departures. The newest soft spoken gadget convertible (the original cartoon is a van or a cool car that can be car) and the element of a typical, dubious Hollywood romance. Fill out boxes for Disney executives and their _ex_executives - do not watch this movie. <br />
