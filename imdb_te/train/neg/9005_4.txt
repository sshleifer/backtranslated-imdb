Foreign, Jurassic Park and countless other science Fear horror movies have your cup of tea and a lot of sugar and you will come down to this. The film begins around 1100AD in Jilli, which starts in Old England and flies to California today. Our Hero Carver (Dean Cain) is a new science chief and military advisor for a science lab 400 feet underground. With a major scientist he (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) and will soon find a cloning experiment and find new clones. Is this a dinosaur or not? Like all of the above movies, all hell is broken and our characters are selected. Special effects on the monster are "live to the video" are very good and Dean Cain will do what he will pay for. But we found that we never saw the rest of them. Again, do not go with high expectations and you'll be okay.
