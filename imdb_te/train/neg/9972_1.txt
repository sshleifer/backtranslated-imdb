The problem is one of the worst films I've seen in the last end! It's a bad movie about a savage boy who has been adopted by two parents, but later comes into trouble. That junior grandfather can drive the car. He can scare a bear people. He can put a room in the room! This is a bad movie like the Battleley Earth. The sequel is very bad. Take a chicken RUN instead. <br /> **** of * 1/2 I will give.
