The movie was motionless. The characters are weak, the plot is weak. I have Christopher Wacken because I guess it's not bad, okay. He must have done this because he needs boredom and money. The characters are considered Irish, but have Irish Irish accent. I tried to find out about this stuff in despair, and I have done a good job with a wooden character. Find out anything to read or to discover, never watch this movie.
