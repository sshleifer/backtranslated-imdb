When I see that this film is shown on TV, I'm really looking forward to it. In the 1980s I grew up and looked at every 80 teen and summer camp movie, like everyone grew up in that era. So I could not wait to see this movie. No disappointment !! There is nothing in this movie, really bad jokes and gags and rarely without any plot and substance. And the filmmakers have failed completely in dark humor-some of which are not known to be so cruel and offensive. The only good thing about this film is the wardrobe, music, and acting. It's good to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer dresses from the 80s, and go to the same music. And acting is top notch throughout: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians. Too bad people do not have a better thing to do.
