The class idea is bad idea to let this be seen in English. Images with intense and more educated images have an impact, but it did not have any effect on the class - when the teacher left, the conversations started quickly - and I was using "Shakespeare" or "Tempest". And if you look at this, why it's easy to look. Acting is not unique - everyone is bored to bits, just reading from a defenseless page in the world. Shakespeare always prefer the exposed dialogue for action and death, but I did not understand a word telling anyone. Clothing is not very bad and unique - class may not like this movie, but they do not properly take p * s. But it is hard to joke at a film that does not have any kind of inspiration or pleasure. At the beginning of the film the scenes in the ship did not make it too bad - although the rain was a bit unrealistic, everything was good and good. But where are the broken heads and explosive pillars? Where is death Where is the inspiration? Ariel's character was as bad as he was wearing clothes - but he was another pretext for a joke on all the shows. The film is not sexy. There is no romance or comedy that women and girls enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that many men and boys put on. The tempest did not do badly, but the producers wanted to make it. And lack of simple boredom and inspiration. 3/10
