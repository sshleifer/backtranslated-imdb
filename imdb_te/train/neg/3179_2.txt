In the film yesterday I saw the film in danger. I really like it based on Spoorloos (Vanishing) and the book because I really have some hopes for the movie. The film starts with the first, so it's a good thriller. The film does not care about the rare stories, erroneous characters and nobody (like Marjok) and terrible compilation. The film switches to the longest black bits, which is a confusing confusing seasonal past and confusing scenes that can not be added and easily removed. After suffering through the story you'll get treatment with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It should also mention that if you watch too many Dutch movies there is a lot of clear sexual scenes which you will probably use. It's hard to say anything good about this movie. One-third of the audience walked halfway through the theater from the theater and I did not hear a word after the film ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. It really ruined any faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
