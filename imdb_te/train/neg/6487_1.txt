Well then, having my fame favorite film I thank SO very Disney to eradicate the poignant memories I've used. When I came to the original film, I was about 5 years old and it was one of the first films I had seen. So, now I am 16 years old, and feeling enough masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. In this way, I forgot to forgive this for a movie and held all my memories of the original film with poison. <br /> <br /> Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter Melody in the film and go to show her. Everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the music breaks out, in minutes, the sea witch Morgana shows and Melito threatens to kill if Triton does not give Trusk. Therefore, he also gives it without a fight. Eric says about using Ariel knife and how to save Melody, but Eric is right there. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide not to stay at the melody sea until Morgana is caught. <br /> <br /> Okay, the note is really nothing. Eric is the whole. He can not really do anything. Arial sort does something. Melody handles things up. Plus, animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics come into conflict with the backgrounds. Ever wasted single opportunity for character development. Singing songs. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure that even the younger kids are getting frustrated out of their skulls, even nothing is even remotely exciting from anything. They do not want to sing songs. If you catch this copy, throw it into the ocean and hope that no one can find it. Ever.
