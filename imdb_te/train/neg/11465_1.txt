It's one of the worst bad things you've ever paid to watch the movie - it's good to choose disappointment in the mall's cinemas on Christmas days, but in the beginning you are always good but still set to watch a movie! <br /> <br /> In the better part of the three decades, I can still catch the bread that occupies this story. Unbelievable story - a killer whale retaliates against a man of the sea - is ridiculous. Moreover, the ending of a movie without a love story, "love of the background" is totally out of reach. At least Charlottetta Rampling is lovely (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris bowls to the scene. He is not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and is not "Jaws". Better, I'm very much in mind and I'm going to go on the television air when I run it. "Danger, Will Robinson!" Current t.v. Commercial and wife Wale-Watched ("Orca - I love Orca" ...) - at least in sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes in my life, and I will never come back again.
