Ram Gopal Verma proved himself to be an innovative and competent director. He remade The Godfather's remake / rewriting with Sarkar and was a marvelous success. <br /> <br /> Ditto for Lolita, who made him laugh. <br /> <br /> She says that Shola has inspired him many times. Unfortunately, he was frustrated and finally able to remake the boring. <br /> <br /> This acting is good from being good, and Amitabh Bachchan acted as villain Baban. The songs are awful and forgetful. <br /> <br /> Mehbooba Mehbooba's song is the second highest quality music video. <br /> The worst, and conversations - forgetful. , I'm looking forward to a break, and then for the end. Some viewers should not have to wait, and the cinematic period is left out. Finally, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Varma.
