The great thing about the film is its title only. In this case, the "Snake on a Plane" book is an example of not being judged by its cover, and there is no title on the film. When I went to the theater, Citizen Kane did not expect, I was looking for an independent day, a film with pure popcorn, but instead I got a terrific Roy Leota film called "awful". The SOAP is only the title of its title. And it's not even an apporiate title for the movie, "snake" or "plane" into the picture is not even a glimpse of 40 minutes! What a false statement! If it's not for its title, SOAP will have another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer image. And R rating? It must be a very unjust R rated movie all the time! The makers of the film put all the violence pg-13 level, to add some F word to make this one R. What is really R? R rated super star edge! Instead of wasting your money on a snake, see him in a salwar!
