It's on the 30th anniversary DVD for the fantastic saddle, which is amazing, but it's not. Somewhere I've seen the name of Mel Brook here and I can imagine why he got a lot more sense to be involved with this pilot. My gad, who will find this funny. Certainly there may be a race problem but for me it is not just funny, it's just not funny. The writers did not even try to make it funny, just do not want to make money to get involved with blazing saddles. When did this show go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they did not care. It is quick cash cow. I can only serve for historical purposes, or prove how the Hollywood writers are stupid and haeminive.
