I took a young pastor's wife and some youths to see this film. We spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not get it, and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept implemented by the world's main religions (the code of the Bible code, the Torah code and the Qur'an) and is very questionable to be ridiculous. This is a step for those who believe that Christians who are in the arts do not come up with a single step and inspect our brains at the door.
