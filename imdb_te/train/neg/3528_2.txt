There are too many comments on this image, and I found them to be misleading. In a corner cutting, over-used scenario, a common man becomes a partner of the opposite sex for any obvious reason. The boy meets the girl. The girl holds the boy pointing gun for something ludicrous. The boy is interested. <br /> <br /> You know about the drill: the villain is a wild, freak instead of a sokobati ... In a few words of wisdom from Alice drummond there is a recipe for toss and love. Sheidi's 'she's crazy or does she need a hug?' The character played a major role from the Breakfast Club. And all the remaining one image is really deadly turkey.
