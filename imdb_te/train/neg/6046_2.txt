This film is basically drinking the nature of the two-hour Bopho - almost literally - death. Surprise in this movie is that there is not enough evidence or character knowledge that you may be surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is a wonderful actor. Peter Stormy is a wonderful actor. But this film just sucks. Slow picture is not bad, it's just bad. The sketch plot combined with artistic ramblings of the anamorphic details can not draw together in meaningful way for a plot unless cohesively highlighted some gore that are cohesively highlighted from the many perspectives, at the end. I really appreciated artistic attention, but as fun, it made me sleep. <br /> <br /> When I was asleep and re-watching the movie - more frustrating. <br /> <br /> I usually want to make negative comments or reviews on other works, they suck, but this film is a guarantee. It is very bad that these great actors are ashamed with this ultimate result.
