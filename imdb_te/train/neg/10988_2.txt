If I read the book, I said it is a good movie. But I have read the book. Who has ever destroyed the script written by the screen. There are so many changes, which really is not worth the title. Character changes, plot changes, time changes <br /> <br /> Who is Henry and the investigator? They are not in the story. Henry Mitch's personality has some degree, but Mitch is not a cop. Not that you did Roz, his body was used as Zenia blackmail against 'sink' and Roz. The so-called blackmail Zenia wanted her to sleep with her son and wanted to stay away from her. Her son was also blackmailed because she hid herself from her mother. Her son is not really mentioned in this story. <br /> <br /> Tony and West are not in the beginning. He was first in Geneva while in college. The black painted apartment is their idea, Toni just went to visit. Get together with Geneva and Tony, get fast friends. Tony hides her love for the West. Then Zenia came together with Western, Tony, Cash, West and Tony. At the end of marriage, at some point in the West some time left Zenia for Tony again. The heart should be shattered again. Go back to Tony. Jenia Blackmail for Tony, who wrote a test paper for Tony Zenia. She was not allowed to be a professor at college now. <br /> <br /> Charles's character is not really elegant. When Augusta was alive she did not betray Geneaya about cancer. She was not there when she was a lover named Charis Berry. Agasta's father, he was a draft cheat in the Vietnam War. Eventually, Charis Zenia looked carefully and eventually looked like drug withdrawal. If you carefully look at both Jeania and Billy, there's an affair under the nose of Charis. Then Zenia turns Billy to the government, and goes with him on the ferry. Not with Augustus, Charis is pregnant with her pregnant. <br /> <br /> Genie was not partially cut to herself ... she fell down or possibly in the balcony (probably we do not know) and landed in a fountain. She had virtually pure grade heroin in her blood, and she did not know some of it and she fell to OD'd. <br /> <br /> It does not show childhood memories or anything that fascinates roles for the reader. The book broke into its bones. Then someone will look at it. Why not write your own story about what you did in the movie. It's different enough, and I'm sure it's been done so much more.
