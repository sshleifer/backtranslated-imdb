This film is disgusting. Some brutal evil author must be a warning that he is trying to make a name for him before they have been hostage for the worst looking for an hour and a half. What's the worst Misuse of people's time, misuse of power, teaching and writing waste of any kind of education system. Talia lost you with a sick loser. Your psychiatrist needs to indicate stronger medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> Acting and plotting did not give me any choice to go in the worst center. I did not ask in one scene. If you want to learn how to shock how people see Larry Clark's picture. I have lost all respect for the entire cast in this film "I do not have much support from me." Actors or actresses may sit in a set, but such gross descriptions of mental behavior are clearly visible from Psycho's mind? I'm sorry for all the actors involved in that scene. I think the devil who is the author of this film now knows; Congratulations you won his attention.
