Do not worry with this movie, it's not bad when it's decided on own profits, but it's exactly scary compared to the original 1972 original. And BTW, as anyone commented, was bad compared to the 1972 film. It should not make movies on crazy, movies made from movies. They are completely different forms of art (which should be shown but clearly made). If you use this standard for all the movies, then "2001" absorbs and "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
