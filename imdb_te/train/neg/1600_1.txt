The largest National Lampoon hit "Animal House", and is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of each other National Lampoon movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by Stephen Furst ("Flourder") from "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this mixed mess. This reunion is a root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> One star, and it's generous. Then again, many of my older colleagues wanted to be demons, vampires, and serial killers.
