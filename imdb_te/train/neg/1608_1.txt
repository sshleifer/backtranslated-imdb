The question is not why this pet project was made, but how long it took them. "They" refers to the "mystery" love of the left-wing Hollywood and Marxist rebels (Lenin, Castro ... its choice). I'm sure it finally took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to take up such an irresistible bias promotion campaign. Where's Oliver Stone? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Flan? George Clooney? Also barbra streisand? It's a secret. These overtered "artists" often drowned in one-sided projects in the same, politically, although Chewa Guevara, although the most popular and well-known Communist, is still not their image. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> "Guerrilla" has the characteristics of an American epic-tale of an epic story; There's almost nothing in the other hollywood big-budget political fairytale bio-bikes, such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi". Famous actor del Toro is the famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, this person's actions are controversial and criminals, no one can stay away from him: he only delivers the intellectual manipulator-del Toro bill from a great family. Del Toro may be an interesting, attractive actor and he is physically similar to Guevara, but he does not have intellectual qualities, so he makes Guevara very old. Brat tells only the lack of directors' sound judgment to the mediocrity, such as Philips and Franca and Comptonantent. <br /> <br /> The film is slowly slow (there is no surprise), and an uncanny sight. Kubrick would have been considering releasing a film beyond the 3 hour mark carefully, so it is up to his overseas grandmother's work that has made only one or two solid films and this Soderbergh, who has started in his career. If you think that the length of the film and the bulk of Che's life has shown here, then think again. Soderbergh focuses at the last stage of Soder, and most of the film is notoriously unsatisfactory jungle nonsense by Guevara's alleged ideology. (Psychologists have no ideals.) I do not think that this great dignified director should ignore some of the previous life of Che's. Did he really consider it a very unpleasant? The massacre of 600 people is not interested in the viewer, huh? Amazing. A slightly better movie than this over-acclaimed Charlton is not easy to have two full biographies in a 4-hour film. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a sense, the dark side - more than 90% - of Guevara. Soderbergh himself up to the truth (God must taint the sacred image of himself), this kind of historical flawed - but the opposite: he cares only about ideas - a fake movie which is quite a lot of Hollywood and pop musicians all struggling with their careers , Always about these people (like guinea pigs) people who have been tested. Soderbergh and the worst kind like Elitist; <br /> <br /> The total number of students all over the world wear a picture of their red and orange shirts, but never know why. Clueless, unknown, very often became a prominent figure for young people, somehow "experimental", intellectual, hip or curious that they have the face of this person on their chest. In fact, wearing a shirt shirt and giving a total amount of frustration and total disappointment in self-education. (Would you like to know more about a person before promoting his face to the world?) Become a Bart Simpson Coffee Cup dressed in the ear's now clich√© image. <br /> <br /> Everything done under the name of Mark, "Che-wearer" is probably more familiar with Marge's blue hair. This moncler is considered to be "ideal" in the end. Mankind has never learned to learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Maloswick, Sues, the Iron Curtain, 100 million dead, more than one billion physically and / or mentally degraded by this system ... so why not one of those matters? <br /> <br /> The fact that winning the del Toro Cannes award should be completely clueless about how the Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote. Hint: Sean Pen long ago headed the jury. <br /> <br /> For my music-related fields, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
