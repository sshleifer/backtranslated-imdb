I've got this DVD from a friend from others (and probably keep doing it ..) The cover of the DVD is very low, and the whole picture. Delaying guns and fist fights with noise effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple storyline, which laughs to hurt my stomach! With very little financial resources, I have to admit that it looks very professional. As a feature film, which does not wait for a dozen 13 gangsta songs. So: If you want tired and cheap smile, look at this picture. Otherwise, throw out the window.
