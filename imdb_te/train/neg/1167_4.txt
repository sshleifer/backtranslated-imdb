I really like this movie but in the end it did not work for me. I've seen quite a lot of Kitimura's output and found it very variable. All of its movies have an interesting plot, some nifty scenes and a fair amount of creativity. However, these symptoms are present in poorly supplied supply. It's not the original and the plots made for Ace Film are cool. Unfortunately, the pace is slowly slow and takes an age to go, before the film can reach very predictable places. The action is just acceptable, the final fight is pretty cool, and it's okay. Earlier camera work, making less cooperation. Some fine visual effects and some interesting ideas float around in the conversation, but the film still drastically violates. The characters are well flattened or well cast and the setting and simple color scheme is wheat and boring. The film is not entirely terrible and has some interest, perhaps the forward-forward button's legal use improves. It can be a very good science fiction thriller with twenty minutes of time taken from run time. But the full length picture is dull. Recommended for most patient and kithumura fans only.
