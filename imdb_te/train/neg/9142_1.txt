After seeing how bad it was, I saw and wanted to see for myself. Really, even if you read negative comments here, you'll ever realize how awkward this movie actually is, although it should be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen! Never worry about posting a comment earlier, but this bad band really appreciated it. <br /> <br /> The first total plot is ridiculous and frivolous. The brother of the main character (Ben or Arthur, I do not forget it, and clearly never quite clear) wants to stop gay marriage by killing everyone - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but obviously mass murder. Then there was some other rubbish thrown about the gay couple's ex-wife who was trying to force her to reconsider her pointing gun. This will lead to nothing, but it gives us one of the melodic lines of dialogue in the whole "movie" - "I'm not meant to make sense! <br /> Then acting is just worse. Stoned civil rights advocate woman, apparently read her lines, still managing to confuse them. The couple is not less convincing, his boyfriend who looks like a small, cartoon and dow boy in bizarre advertisements, is bold and low skill. <br /> "The movie" can not even capture the camera and camera The whole thing is that the shoes are paired with a pair of shoes <br /> <br /> However, we know how terrible this is, so I want to highlight the most prized comedy moments of "cinema." The person puts a church in the fire and parasens when fleeing a six-year-old girl in a hospital. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mildred! She does not know what the main characters are like - sometimes she knows, sometimes they do not, but she has popped up in some scenes. <br /> <br /> - The lawyer's lawyer. <br /> <br /> - Cats of the evil brother. <br /> <br /> - In the end, I do not give away <br /> <br /> In general, Ben and Arthur are indescribable bad, But inadvertently you will see for a very long time  ాస్య విషయం. సాహిత్యపరంగా, ఒక చిత్రం కోసం ఈ క్షమాపణ గురించి ఏమీ మంచిది కాదు, డైరెక్టర్ గోన్ కూడా 15 సార్లు తన సొంత పేరును వ్రాస్తూ ఒక జోక్లో ప్రారంభ క్రెడిట్లను సంపాదించడానికి దోహదపడుతుంది.
