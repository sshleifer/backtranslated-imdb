I hate this presentation when I was a child. The children were originally returned in the day that the characters were actually composed, the general, the usual, the usual American dialect. Jack Wild is a British voice and south of Punstuff. However, I never understood the agreement with the witch, who was one of the others mentioned. The flute always seemed contrary to me, because the flute blew me up and I could not get any trouble to take it! <br /> <br /> Pufnstuf is just one comment on the similarity to the McDonald's advertisements at the beginning of the 70s. Others have claimed: Pufnstuf is the ubiquitous McDonald's. At the height of the importance of McDonald's, the TV show (or their creators) sought to license McDonald's characters for their performance, but when McDonald's refused, the TV program changed the characters a little bit and made them their own. They hired McDonald's Ad agencies' former employees and voice actors for TV shows. McDonald's sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland suit and you'll get plenty of articles about it.
