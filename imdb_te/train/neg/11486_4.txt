Some people like to know everything about me, like me, and plan to see everything, including everything. However, here I can remember it because I can not be more than 8 years old when I see the first and only time on TV. But I said yes, I scared the little boy, and I thought about it a few days later, and still remain in my mind today, although some details are unclear. Is Abbey Vogoda in the film? I do not remember that! I did not even remember that there was Olein Barnabas in this movie, and I liked the Dark Shadows. In the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Judge (Joseph Cotton, I'm guessing he's an old family doctor or something like a juror, I'm guessing, fades?) To the wedding seat, is I in a cave which is a kind of one? Maybe I'm wrong. And Shelley Winters are laughing there, and the judge has a cape, and the camera angle looks at him and he is dressed up again and he has goat legs, and he is actually her father, the devil, and she ("I guess Robert Fox Worth" ) Satan is also a man who wants to marry her, with the yellow ice cream, and Y EP, sure enough, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes yellow glow. The last few minutes of the film are very close. Everyone is happy and happy, except Belinda Montgomery, very happy, and cries or chatter or something, and that end. Bad guys win.
