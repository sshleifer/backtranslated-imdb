Siskel & Ebert created their own professional opinions of real controversy, whether you concluded with them or not. Roper took the show for a song or two because he was not really a film critic and because he substituted a snude for the impression. Now, when Ben Lions arrives I feel like watching "Teen News" - do you know the children's children's hosted children's children? Mankitz is not good. It is clear that they have suffered sustained food only for their whole lives in major films. The idea that these two rank enthusiasts have any interest or consequence to tell about movies is ridiculous. If they review a formula image, they will lose completely. Show them something original and intelligent - they just find "confusing". Wait - I think I've got it ... ABC Disney is under control ... Disney makes movies in movies. Although Siskel, Ebert and Roper have promoted independent films and hit-miss-miss only with huge budget studio productions, the two people loved the big studio skull and were able to withstand some indices. Plus everyone knows that group ages targeted TV advertisers. There is icing on the blatant bonding cake. In which alternate universe are these people eligible for film critics?
