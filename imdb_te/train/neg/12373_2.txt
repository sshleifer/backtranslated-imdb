The script is so ridiculous ... It does not mean that the lines of the actors are strong and unrealistic. "My sweet little daughter" and small lines in mind ... and it redefines the phrases of the soap opera dialog. <br /> Still amazingly, the music is not so bad! Plus, the main bluesy "theme" is terrible quaint and this is totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Even though the emotional context of the scene, the instrumentation, design and layout of this theme changes from time to time. <br /> <br /> In the following period, it is transmitted from one scene to another with a sore toe. <br /> <br /> If the music of wheat, and the writer is writing music for soap or sitcom - this is a Canadian sitcom of low budget 80 <br /> <br /> It's pretty bad, it's too much and many of these characters One type NY assent - thick Bronx assent. <br /> It does not matter when I question the capability of the actors who know only * a * NY accent or question the director's ability to notice it as such a flashing disorder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, it is the enthusiastic script with the led lines of this whole "film" Any foundation is inconsistent and unstable when it is impossible to build on its more damaging and vague paths without their defects.
