"Prom Night" is the only remake of the 1980 Slaser film, starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. The film takes place in the town of Oregon, where Donna (Brittany Snow) goes to her senior and gives her some pleasure through the most painful events of the past few years. She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a great hotel, and try and enjoy their lives the most pleasant night. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the original "Prom Night", I have tried to keep the hope in the film, but "Prom Night" is a horror film that suffers terrible suffering, and that is imaginative.It is definitely no surprise here, the dozens of the previous ones in the movie are good and I have seen earlier. Of course the majority of the audience will be able to guess almost everything that happens.The plot is simple, but the whole script is no wonder of the surprise, twist, atmosphere or anything, and this really That really hurts the movie because it really is into the audience anything Ari sink teeth. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film's PG-13 slasher movie, and I understand what they are saying, but I think that it is impossible to make a short film, Gore slaijar good. Carpenter's "Halloween" Take For Example - a little less of the violence on the screen, but still a very horrible and efficient image. You do not need the gore to make the movie scary, but the "Prom Night" is unsatisfactoryly violent (not that it is very spots), it still is low on the cinema because the script is build with the launch. The tension and suspense here is better, and I expect the results of the situation in most cases, and 99% of the time is correct. <br /> <br /> Our characters are not well written because the audience has no connection, and their number is constantly and vulgar. <br /> <br /> Some of the things I liked about this film, because it's not totally useless - cinematography is really cool, and everything is well shot and very beautiful. Among the "jump" scares (most of the most predictable), some kind of intelligent. The sets for the image are very nice and the hotel can be predictable while unfolding a neat place for the plot unfold. For acting, it is average at best. Brittany's ice plays a prominent role, but the rest of the cast really does not perform much of the talent. Jeanette Schneck plays the villain and has a very experienced actor here, but he is not impressed. However, I did the role that played the character, which is great from the masked-stalker 'type killer. Until the end of the film, the last fifteen minutes of the film finally got frustrating to my knowledge and it was very much resistant. <br /> <br /> The whole "Prom Night" is upset. All-many-numbers, simple, and predictable, it's somewhat discreet, it's likely to be a good sharp film. There are some nicely moments, but the film does not have any suspense or atmosphere, and has little plot development, or reliable characters. I'm here without a surprise, because I love to save money and wait for it to end up in the video or give the original rent. Some may get some entertainment, but it will have a lot of my tastes. I guess, the theater was very disappointed. 3/10.
