First of all, I want to say to everyone who has seen this movie, one of my friends, who played the role of "transvestite", his name is Robert Dagdale, is a wonderful actor, but it does not say much about his filmography, he is in many plays and music. He is currently at Terrace B.C. Living in I'm no where not, it's not a movie worth looking at, it's not a film I'm not seeing, it's a bad movie, the main reason it never seems to be in place Keeps bouncing, so it's hard to follow at some points, and second, its really boring * smiling * acting Oppa, however, when compared to the movie.
