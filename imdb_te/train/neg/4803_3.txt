Adrianine, Mr. "Brady" really need to get a life. She disappoints me, and one of the main reasons I'm tuning in the program. This is a very stupid appearance, and every minor argument or disagreement is placed under the scope and death is evaluated. This is they / they are ready for marriage but anything they see sound / sound, and yet, I know all these part of life with these disagreements. I guess some people who are fun. If this happens in the next season, I can not do anything in their life, sorry to see this trash. I was not terribly surprised. Can not even retain commercial ads for this show! I hope they get enough money to keep them busy for a week before the camera week. However, "A" girl is one heck of great butt!
