"The Dream Child" was the fifth in the "Nightmare" series in 1989 (usually overtime), and at this time the whole series became even worse. In 1984 Wes Craven's 1984 original and third part of "The Dream Warriors" series included only good films. The second episode is frustrating and frustrated, which in the past faintly insane Freddy Krueger with constant idiot humor. There is nothing except a flashback sequence on how the fifth entry to the series came with no (exclusively great) visuals, and a creepy scene, Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film dreams because our Razor-Gold Maniac turned-joister stupid one-liners, and an old formula of a group of teenage jackassas, especially try to avoid sleeping, good old Freddie dreams. Lisa Wilcox is included in the role of Alice Johnson, and a rare dumb, such as a super dumb 'strange' children, a bunch will be included for the reason other than to have some justification to make this superfluous and boring sequel. In short: no realism, old formula is just over a decline, and painfully annoying jokes load over one. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals and especially the terrible subsequent sequel to emphasize the difference between "Freddies Dead", which is awesome beyond belief. You're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, "The Dream Child" should be avoided, and you'll be disappointed.
