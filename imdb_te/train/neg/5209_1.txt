Well, I was frustrated and I saw it all the way. <br /> <br /> The film is lightweight, alert and poor. This story paints your teeth in most open titles. The two 'wounded' children who have come to know about the 'fairy tale' about the 'God' have stayed away. It uses Irish 'Blarney' in such a stereotypical manner, believing that the real Irish has never seen it. The first attempt at the 'OIRISH' accent was aimed at apparently exposed children. And why are they going to share this?
