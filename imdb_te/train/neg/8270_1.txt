But what's the end of it? -> What's the end of this? -> A group of law enforcement executives who have committed a vandalism of the snipers / tons of world-renowned marksman's carnival shooting gallery? Technical errors (how many bullets can you have in a magazine with a glock? Re guns firing without the need to reload). Senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) I realized this was a good 100 minutes wasted. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of my life this is not so bad for watching this movie. Hopefully the director will either make films stop, or learn more for his next film.
