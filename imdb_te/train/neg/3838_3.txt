The film is good for Terry West. He does not just thru meat. The running time of the film is never ending in the pad and there are endless shots of the creepy looking school's exit. There are only 2 students in this school. Missy Munde is as good as it is, but the film is always Ruby Laaroka (the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). If the script focuses on her interesting role, we have movies we see. She's very good !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's previous (and improved) film "The Muse Blood for the Muse" is a special feature. One thing I can say is that it's very similar to the fact that someone at the end of this film is not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke. Again, look at this for Ruby laroca.
