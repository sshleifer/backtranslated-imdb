Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still suffering and seeing it. It's very bad, you have to be surprised at how to write this trip, which is very small in the general population. Sleeping acting, a prominent figure in his sleep, and Alison Eastwood bothers him. This action indicates a low budget film making, which means it is painful and bad. The plot? Well, if you are at the age of 6, then you wrote the film. Simple, idealistic, and just plain lame.
