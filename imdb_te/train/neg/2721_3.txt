I'm a big fan of 50 science fiction, but this is not one of my favorites. Though the concept of the film is a natural vehicle for a traditional teen baber science fiction film, the director is counted so much to take the film. It's clear that it's working with the whole money, because the whole movie is continuously loading with a bloated dialogue. <br /> <br /> The whole picture contains less than 60 seconds of "second blue footage", while others are engaged in a very poorly written, dialogue. Steve M. and Anita C. It was fun to watch together, but good skies ... cast, what would anyone believe in their right minds as teenagers?
