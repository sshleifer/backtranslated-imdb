This is one of the worst films ever seen in my life. I watched it an hour later and woke me a lot of hours. Acting was terrible and almost no plot. My opinion began with a strange shape of an animal that started a story around it. Some ideas are borrowed from movies such as Resident Evil and Aliens, not a film result. If this is a top Korean movie, I do not want to bother to see a Korean movie trailer <br /> <br /> By the way, these films believe that good reason is guaranteed film means a high rating. I've rated this image for over 8 everybody for gaming about online, yet there is no evidence to support it.
