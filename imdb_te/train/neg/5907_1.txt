Yes, it will. This film is horrific. In two minutes I wanted to get my eyes out. It was praised as a "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not good for those church members! <br /> <br /> I do not think any human being should be such a victim in the film. <br /> <br /> First, you can say that you did not make any effort in this movie. The terrible mess, the glab, the usual plot seems to have been thrown together with two silly visas, filled with a somewhat coherent gift (at least partial-coherent). Then, acting is, which is * tedious from everyone involved. <br /> And the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk with a belief that we can change it, but that road is full of disgusting bad conversations, bizarre "gags" and someone in their right mind, LDS or not, is full of stupid * "In Jokes"! This is one of the worst films I've ever seen!
