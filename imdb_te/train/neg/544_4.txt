Pros: Akshay Kumar's performance (right now it makes their boys Embroided Embroided anytime in their movies?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> Cons: Total 1 hour (jokes are flat to say the least). Each scene involving Rajpal Yadav. AB is the main stupidity in decision making. This way I will stand, and literally take the responsibility of the son of his son to be humiliating insult in every possible way (which can ruin the relationship that can not be repaired), and Akshay finally takes some responsibility to tell him the truth. WTF? Akshay feels too old to bear the fact that his old father is soon dying of cancer, but insulting him will force him. I'm the only one who did not see logic here? <br /> <br /> <br /> Akshay is a stuntman. Smile We ended up in college in the 1st place and the degree in MBA. But when the time comes to justify himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How to actually apply for a regular job in the field of ur? Or where the heck, where the hanging life is not in danger? <br /> <br /> "I hate this kind of dirty trick and left our throat to feel sorry for AB's role, and I can not." The whole thing is very small for me in KHNH (which I hate "I'm sorry for the person with illness" The worst has implemented its course: I felt more puking than sympathy for the old man, eventually 20 or more <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Very dumb, known as Vakt's good film, whose clear director Vipul Shah is less emotional about the story that understands this emotionally fragile chicus and It is aimed at older people. 'Em has some good song pictures, fancy costumes, glycerin filled scenes and Give plenty of star power and the like, they'll be happy to lap up the garbage.
