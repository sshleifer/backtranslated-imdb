What happened to RGV? He repeats himself in every film. Is he out of creative ideas? If he is, it's time to take a rear seat. Great anticipation went to watch the film - of course I did not expect to be anywhere near the original. I know I'm not, promos says it all. But I also thought it was a great RGV treat, when it was not the only one who was direct and direct to the company? Or he? After seeing it, there are my doubts. I'm not going to talk about this story or story, it's mostly taken from the original, if you really go and die to see this thing, you can play a fun game with friends: find original scenes and give your own rating! So they will be hoar (how cool is it?), Imagine that it's not that great noise. A lot of disaster, such as Ajay Devgan Heero, comedy is badly damaged and fake debate that works effectively in the company feels fake. There is no chemistry between hero and Gunagao (Nisha Kothari). In fact the lovely Nisha tries her more frustrating. It finally peaks into the peak. Raj is actually not as bad compared to others, he is a person to see in the future. I was ashamed of Baba with Amitabh Bachchan, who looks like Gabbar Singh's sarcastic film. He has a scene from a cup of drinking from a bowl, fearing to be like a beggar with his shoulders. Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha is the only person who really is standing. I'm not afraid to write more.
