Man oh man! Make any film pieces! But even if I hate to accept it, it's a pleasure to offend my childhood. They showed this movie on my basic cable system. I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Capertino border) we called the G channel in our cable system. And they are basically a single movie and are shown again and again. Wanda Nevada is one of those films. I was loyal and in love with the young Brook Shields, and in the 1940s, I enjoyed her doping adventures in the Grand Canyon. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, some highlights Henry Fonda makes a performance, the dialogue that is very good is very good and played a good Carol song end credits. Perhaps you have to be rocked to be truly happy in the film. And hey, all know gold is not in the Grand Canyon!
