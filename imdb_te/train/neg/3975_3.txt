12/7/2002 - 10 to 3 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Mary Kate & Ashley Fare Price with a few more kisses. It seems to me that the girls are very tired of this matter, and they are curious to know what is going on if they decide to split up and go in their own ways. In their episode of their adventures, they are an Interfilks designer in Rome, who are placed right into the mail room to know their performance (I guess). Nothing except Rome's scenario along with distinct flirtations with boys were finally re-hired, then re-rented, then re-hired, again when they were finally revealed. This is definitively defined by people who do not understand the corporate world and it shows in its commentary. Perhaps the real world is their next adventure (if one). Even my kids do not seem to care for this boring `adventure 'that is believed to be made. Let's see that they have only a few years to their legal adult. Then we will see what happens.
