I rented this DVD when looking for something else. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the title on the jacket. I read a book of Yolam a year ago and I loved it, and in fact I worship the Yolam's works. (I am a clinical psychologist.) I have seen 30 minutes of this film and I have to stop it. I'm not sure if I take too much. At a surface level, others are just as distracted at the vapid at the best and boring and worst, just commenting on faux voices. Acting to be serious and funny when it's serious is acting dull. Lou Salome is quite simple to play the role, and Proudfood is a little more than a school. The spirit of the book is so short. I hoped to recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will mention them in the book. Imagine that.
