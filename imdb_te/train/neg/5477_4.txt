Take a suspicious original movie and mix in a short alternative / revision history, and you get "Aztec Rex". Hernande Curtis was apparently the first to win the Tyranosaurus Rex and her companion before conquering the Aztec Empire. The thrust of this movie. If the plot is given, it really sucks; The fact that it only sucks the kind of writers hat's tip. There are some problems. For starters, the Koreans play by Ian Zeying. Even with a black wig, it is convinced that the casting as a kurtis is Gandhi as Oxela Rose. And the Cortes captured Mexico's indigenous peoples, where Aztecs are played with all-Hawaii combination. Aside from the cast, T-Rex (s) seem reasonable, but once they burn them once, it just throws CGI. And they die very easily; If I were in real life with T-Rex they would probably have been injured or at least wounded by sharp, 16th-century armies. But it takes away something from the movie. There are some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is awesome, but in this case I thought I would work well. There are plenty of activities, and the whole colonial perspective is dominant, but recent recent SciFi original dinosaurs do not kill the dinosaur angle, rather than the "Warcraft". Overall, is common (but good by SCIFI Original Standards), which portrays a modest 4 rates.
