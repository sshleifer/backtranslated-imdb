While I definitely consider the Exorcist to be a horrific classic, I have to admit that I do not hold much of it too with regard to so much like other horror fans. As a consequence, I do not see a lot of exorcist rip-offs and if there is anything to go through Exorisimo, I would say that it's a good thing because the movie is boring and definitely not worth the cost! That's ninety minutes! Simply to other exorcist rip-offs, it is often considered one of the worst, so this is not the best place to launch. It is not difficult to predict what the plot is: basically it is one of the exorcist and a girl demonic spirit of demon (she is the soul of the deceased father). The village priest is then called to do exorcism. Like many Spanish horror movies, this actor Paul Nussyree is a great thing about the film. Juan Bosch, directed by Exorisimo, has previously directed the Spanish gioolo 'The Killer Vo Gloves'. I did not see any of his other films, but based on these two sources: I believe that reality is not one of his strong points. There are a lot of good things to say about the film. It is not worth to wait along the stems too much and the exorcism of the exorcism. I definitely do not recommend it!
