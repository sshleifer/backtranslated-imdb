I did not like when the Bill Murray was actually released in the 80s, so my troubles for the film dropped to my film in the 80s, or "grooves" just a bad image. <br /> Now, "strips" can be an innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it can appeal to people who have gone through basic training. Or Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> Why is it bad? Most "strips" are considered comedy but this is not just funny. There are some laughs, but they are fewer. Most of this image is used by the dramatic storyline, which is very cumbersome and not very interesting. <br /> <br /> If you use more contemporary comics like "Uncorman" trying to laugh every part of the film, it is noteworthy that the lack of comedy. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" More Ram's lack of Bill Murray and Harold acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he is not a very compelling dramatist at this time in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. <br /> Lastly, the humor in "strips" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alike. If you can not find the role of a boy child (I do not) you will not find any "comic" funny find comedy. <br /> <br /> "Strips" is a long time film of its time, it is not very old and is not worth looking at. If you want to see an early 80's "buddy" comedy I "crazy crazy." Humor like "Stripes" is not as fast as contemporary humor in "Stair Crazy", but unlike "Stripes", it is much better at age and as a result is still visible.
