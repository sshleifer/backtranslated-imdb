After seeing the credits with the same name I found, I was a teacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and I was disappointed. One man kills his new wife, believes that she is mad and wants to live her life. The absence of the husband is that the plastic skull he uses is, in contrast, a woman's devil is his first deceased wife who has a reputation in her mind and uses the real skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony to the end. If you are late tired and need sleep, it will help you sleep that sleep.
