The first one is mainly large rats, but some were wasps and even a big chicken. This one, however, is just big mice long, well giant mice and a really young boy growing up. This is a growing boy and a scientist who is trying to help him that he accidentally creates a huge killer rats ... how do you do it. The film has some murders and movements, but I realized that it is the same with the original, and I like some of my favorite movies in my big crew. Well, that's not true ... I was really like "Ants of Empire", perhaps I did not work for big rats. Although all in the peach film all have a rather odd turn of events in this dream combination that is really bizarre. I can not recommend this.
