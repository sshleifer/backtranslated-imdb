The only thing that surprises me than the people who love this film is the direction of Clint Eastwood, which I am very proud of. Leeds is definitely not chemistry. I believe that neither of them, nor less than the lust for sexual intercourse. This story is not true. That stilted dialogue, simple tons, and basically add a very slow plot that leads somewhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. Cave Lange's nude scenes can be worthwhile for some modest fare, but this is a huge waste of time. I saw the movie with my thoughts the name "cheesy".
