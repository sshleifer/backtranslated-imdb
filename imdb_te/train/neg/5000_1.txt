This is probably not the worst for televised programming from, oh, I do not know, WHAT HAPPING WHAT? Nothing has ever happened in this ridiculous "series". Although it is mostly portrayed by Britney and Kevin, you can not get any good details for their personal lives. It's just like stupid, jockey little talk and acting like white trash is more likely. See, I love Britney's music as the next toddler, but this program is just pure refinement for a country that has become accustomed to Britney's, to see her clip on her toes (yes, it might be a real part). They both are thankful to God because they are drowsy. This show is toxic!
