Perfect pile of any pants. <br /> <br /> When I read Chris Brookmeier's books religiously since I came across "I'm very ugly ..." I was delighted to learn that this drama started. <br /> I'm absolutely confident. <br /> <br /> Nesbeit is probably the best of the show - and he is not exactly fit. <br /> If anybody reads this book, it goes beyond me. <br /> <br /> The whole characters change, the conditions are reduced, and the paleblock's dramatic brake-quick beard up and sliding open a bay window ... which brought my eyes tears. <br /> <br /> If you have this benchmark, I'm afraid of what's going to happen with the "blind country" <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
