Warner Bros. has done many patriilers in the 1930s, and most of them are fast, economical and more entertaining. I really like how to use studio less attractive in our everyday life. This is one of the few harsh-edged melodramas of Warner's unmatched work. Edward G. Robinson played the undisputed editor of the newspaper, reiterating a 20-year-old story with a dirty man with tragic consequences. Robinson gave a live performance but he was surrounded by actors who did not cut it down. H.B. Warner, Alain McComman and Boris Carlof are good, but the bad acting of Francis Starr and Anthony Buschella in the Second Leeds really hurts the film. At the end of the film, Starr is particularly bad in her big dramatic scene. In addition, the film's moral tone is ridiculous in the context of the pre-code Hollywood scenario. Leroy's direction is full of innovative visuals, but he can not avoid bad acting and unexpectedly funny situations. Soul Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of drip is an Oscar nomination for best image (we gave us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
