Everyone involved (and the audience) seek "The Candidate" to see how good the film is. What happened to the South American story? Julie Christie and Kate Kaposha are thinking of allowing their characters to be cardboard cutouts. Until now I have loved each Jean Hackman performance and / or movie. He's bored (I rarely believe it) or terribly wrong. I also liked it and justified Richard Gere (and insulted for it). But here he does not have "power". He is only intimidated and convinced only occasionally. In all I was very disappointed. I guess I was too much from this director and cast. If you can not see "The Candidate", make "BugWorth" or "Wag the Dog" again.
