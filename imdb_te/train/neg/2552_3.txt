This is not listed as a documentary, but it is portrayed as a documentary, but I suspect they are away with a moving camera and Daddy shoot. <br /> <br /> It was just released as a "American Pie Style Comedy" DVD in the UK. <br /> <br /> They went to Mexico for cheap fungi and ended up with a teens team in the spring break and a virgin friend who was searching there. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a joke without a joke, if you have brain cells, might be. Can i stay away
