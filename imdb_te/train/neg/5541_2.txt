Since the introduction of cinema-loving universe George A. Romero, the term "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-soaked horror films and non stop action sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" zombie movie was created as it is now known. Nevertheless, in the early years, the campus of rebuilt corpses were used slowly, almost in action-less mental thrillers. Jacques Tournier's "I Walk With a Zombie" is a perfect example and "White Zombie", starring Bela Lugoshy. This may be another example of "The Rebellion of Zombies" but unfortunately it is a failure on the entire line and is one of the most troubled movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, playing very poorly written screen and full absence of atmosphere and tension! The film continues for 65 minutes, and the first half hour is completely ruined in stupid love-story schemes and monotonous monolagues. The arrangement in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor might be in a more inspiring story, but all the inner shots we see. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, curly hair and textbook with an ugly nose) is very boring and I hope that suddenly she will come out somewhere to suddenly swallow her to come. Misfortune again ?? If you manage to fight yourself through 60 emotional minutes, you will be rewarded with a very good end. Nevertheless, the film is too small to give a positive rating, let's recommend. Avoid! The image you want to see only in case you've already seen everything.
