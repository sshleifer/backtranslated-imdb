This image is choppy, absurd and contrived. This is the most average-most exciting role of women. I rented it because it's listed as a comedy (it's a story), and covered because Andy McDowell says it's acting up a storm. She is not. I'm a gasp, I saw two guys watching this movie, and how much time has passed for an hour of confusion. <br /> Warning: Plot sari! <br /> <br /> The film starts with a young man who starts with a very hacked plot about an old woman who is deeply disgusted by her two Erzie single girlfriends. They want to marry a boring person who is in love with him. But she is very happy with her overseed puppy that you're rooting them out to stick out, and absolutely enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her adulterous friend, a desperate person, helps a plot to deceive her by thinking that our heroine is fraudulent. It works. She had a fight with him, went out of the house and crashed a truck (to remember the title of the movie?). Now he dies, and about two-thirds of the picture dies. <br /> <br /> Even though our heroine is a school headmistress who spends time with the girls, she forgot to use her birth control. <br /> <br /> She already had ties with her friends and they were unnecessary. Being alone and pitiful, she decides to marry a boring guy. Did I know that the kind of boring guy I was a sponsor? She asked her to marry her (nice, huh?), But now she tells him to marry him, and thus he has no objections. But her friends protect her at the altar and take her home, where they are not more responsible for the love of her life. She is the kid. In the final scene, they leave in a manger inside their home, where they go to driveway, drink and smoke to drink. I'm not a child, it's bad. I quit cancerous red herring and the ridiculous Lesbian moment of Hospice.
