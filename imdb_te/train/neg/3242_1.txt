Review of people like me. This film sucks from beginning to end. I threw the popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining me a la MSF2000. This plot relies on stupidity from people who are suddenly staying away. The main drops for a con man and she does not get conned she does ??? And she was great ??? And she is a well-known psychologist ??? People come, When she meets everyone to talk to her, she just enters the bar at a very convenient moment. It is thought to be a slap in the face of half-intellectual filmmakers. The Rainman would have insulted. I also acknowledge that for some meat-eating, war-starters, and for those wearing fur, I can hate a matematical conversation. My hatred is too early, it explains reasoning. But I give a shot. It's fine not to sound real. I do not care. Everyone speaks the same. Mamet characters can not create; He can suppress his voice on us through different actors what he can do. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confusing about the same character for everyone. (However, his next films are improving.)
