Smythhrannik: Manggar, another example is what happens when you come together to make a "extraordinary" horror movie. Go out of the window in an attempt to create "shock-value", what kind of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc. Do not make me wrong now - I think of all of the "shock" films, and the Schweizer / Gorrer / Nastier is better - but it is still nice to see some talents from some people. <br /> <br /> "He goes to some sprees killing hookers and other random people, and he hoo-uhs "(New York-ese does not speak of you" who's "for that), how strongly they want to rape a donkey, some weak nicrophilia scenes, too small gore, and some nudity to mix up a bit - but you have not seen in a better picture <br /> <br /> I can see that our main character in this retarded movie is Harry's most often (accidentally) screaming, he wants to kill everyone and do them on the donkey and on and on-on and on, And it is a little bit ridiculous after a while, in fact, Harry has all the donkey debate with her dong hongin and With all the honesty, the Joker is still a bit smaller and some chicks showing some T-and-A (and some full-frontal, good measure), with all the honesty. ShigiPorrencecic is very fun with a 1-hour use, but I can really recommend it to those who say that I've seen a movie called the Smizoprenic. To be honest - the title, too far - this is a great thing about the worst ... a generous 3.5 / 10
