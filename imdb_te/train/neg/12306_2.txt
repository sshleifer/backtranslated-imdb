This film is a pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but he can not save the tired thinking and Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply for a military simulation. <br /> <br /> It is very misleading (and correctly deserved) comments from other users who represent the poor rating of the film. <br /> <br /> I've marked $ 3.00 in this grocery store and now I am sure why. <br /> If you can recover my 90 minutes ...
