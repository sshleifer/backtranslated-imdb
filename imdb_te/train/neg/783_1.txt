I saw this presentation and I found it fun. This may be the first episode. Recently I find ABC stupid performances playing for several days and are going down as a station. All the characters in the show are pretty bad actors, but they are good but the jokes and the script are pretty terrible and still present. I believe this show is canceled, but if they make the ABC look pretty terribly on the quality of the performances they are performing, they can just put it simply because they are average compared to them.
