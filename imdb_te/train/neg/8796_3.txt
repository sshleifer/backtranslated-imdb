Perhaps the average audience looking for any concept of intrinsic integrity in a movie should probably give this pass. <br /> <br /> It produces the same feeling in the interesting line of individual images that seem to have a relationship with each other, but it's perfectly agreeable. <br /> <br /> A kind of movie montage can appeal to some students or critics in the inner language of contemporary filmmaking, which is frustrating and irritating to the common people who have fallen from Havvagan. Accessibility is obviously a deliberate feature of officials such as Car-wai Wang and Tarantino, but I get more than Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> The only attribute I have found is that it is in product values, and not all of them are going to cut them. <br /> <br /> You are not in vain for a thoughtful development of an idea or idea to retain what you see, enthusiasm, and all the amazing and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic credits begin unexpectedly as your interest begins to move. I am very knowledgeable and full of criticism about this film, and it's never really meaningful. <br /> Call me a physicist roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of suey suey.
