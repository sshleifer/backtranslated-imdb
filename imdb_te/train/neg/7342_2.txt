"The Man in the Attic" is a movie set in 1910. It was inspired by a true story. This is unfortunately untrue story. <br /> <br /> If you look at the box, those who are responsible for fixing the film have tried to make this movie look the best and most sexy. They use words like "illegal prose", "prohibitory affair" and "unlimited pleasure". They also show Neil Patrick Harris (Small Doze Hauser, MD) shot gun. <br /> The story is Christa, starring Anne Archer. She did not marry a gentleman who owned her business. Edward (Harris) is her husband's company employee. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The ghost of this film is a part of the "surprising part": Christa's husband learns about the affair and prohibits each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista Edward ends with living on their lobby. Wow! Christa ends up seeing him and Edward is very jealous. <br /> <br /> "The Man in the Attic" does not cover any new territory. This is a showtime original film, a pair of stars B-list actors and why they both look briefly.
