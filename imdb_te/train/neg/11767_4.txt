Since I liked Tim Roth, I have great hopes for it. I was not happy with this film. I liked Hook Ang Lee a few years ago so I could match this a bang for more. At first I was disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. It seems to be re-shaped for its eyebrows. His acting is not convincing. He is not as good as expected. Tim Roth is always cool here. Gamma thing does not really adhere to the original story line I do not think. I guess the best part of the film is the end. It has done some amazing actions. It's too long with the original problem. It's not a long time but at times got quite boring. Some time ago I remembered that Walmart was very cheap to sell this movie and why do I always wondered? Now I know. I'm hoping to fly away, but I'm not.
