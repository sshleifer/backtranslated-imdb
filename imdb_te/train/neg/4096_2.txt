It's a classic case of something that should never be. Gloria is now a single mother, her husband has left her because she did not live with some commune (he wanted to be Riggan and wanting to turn her back on society). Exactly where and then I have had problems with this series - was I, Michael Michael Stevieque of Akbbi Bunker's right wing tactics? The series continued, but it just does not contain any pizzas. Sally strouts from all families were lost. If you give this series another name and are completely independent in All In The Family, perhaps it may work. Ah well, it's a show business.
