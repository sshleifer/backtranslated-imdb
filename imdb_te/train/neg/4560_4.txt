Men in Black 2 real disappointment for me. Actors did a good job, most notably Smith, a cure for a poor script in production. The film has a really "sequel" feel, which plays partial programming of the first film. The story, in a word ... is bad, good. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB company has a kind of "elite" power feel, which seemed very staggering and unstable. You have some special agents, and it has a "secret" type of feel. <br /> <br /> This film is not terrible or anything .. It's just "cool" (the first one's good words). The same old comedy was recycled from the first to second and did not really add any originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> The perfect analogy is the episode 1 of the first 3 movies. Is this good? Yes. Is it worth the title? Not really.
