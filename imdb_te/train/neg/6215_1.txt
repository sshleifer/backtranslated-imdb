It's really time waste ... the film is a weak plot, the story breaks and many loopholes end up very suddenly ... while the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> When this film starts, I try to give the benefit of doubt by saying that I may be curious at the next step. This theme was repeated again, but it became even more sophisticated, which was a story of killing the main storybirds ... The whole concept was made by the author more and more, but he did not have their heart and wanted to close the film as soon as it opened. <br /> <br /> In total, most hype is not able to deliver.
