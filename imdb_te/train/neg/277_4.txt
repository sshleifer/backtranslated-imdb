Dellel Hammett Helmut Helman received a play by Helmut Hellman, an interesting project to get out of Warner Bros. Paul Lucas, a Nazi anti-German leader who struggled with the best actor Oscar-winning fascists, his wife and three in Europe before finding refuge in America Slideshow Llalu pulling (the Mexican border). They are settled in Washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, although a Borinist living in the castle is immediately suspicious, and spends a terrible time when he plays Poker in the German Embassy. It seems that it takes forever for this drama to find its attention, and we look at the heart of the matter (knowledge, honesty, direct-to-learn refugees clueless, direct-to-sand Americans how the world suddenly changed), it looks a little bit encouraging - the viewer put in a very relative space , Addressed. Lucas has a number of speeches in the third-action, which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, and he must enter the exit of the film that he wants to do very little, exit and exit. His wife, Betty Davis, does not like anyone and works for her elaborate eyes for a good purpose, but the character does not allow her color. Their kids (all of the different accents!) Are alternatively comic and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has nothing to do with the wife on a putt (and the unsanctioned structure she brings to the part seems totally wrong). The intention here shows us tasteless and strategically because a (WWII) man can be German, which does not make him Nazi sympathetic. We get that in the first few minutes; The rest of this exciting, tactical image is made up of compelling, defensive clash and ultimately, compassion. It should be a stirring mix, but instead of dry-eyes and inertia. ** from **
