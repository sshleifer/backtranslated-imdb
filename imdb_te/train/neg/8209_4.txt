Acting and other reviews were well done. Brad Pitt leads the role of an annoying, bad Austrian climber. Other acting is good. This story may be inspired, but somehow it misses - one does not really understand or care for the characters shown, so the story is very dramatic, failing to draw in the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' As Brand Pitt fan (I feel like one of the first 5 actors of his generation), I think I would like this love - though it left me cool. I was failing within, but I tend to point towards the creative end of this film - direction, writing, production, editing - something, they lost me. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully portrayed - it should be amazing. It's not. Perhaps worth looking at, make it your own mind - but do not expect too much, and maybe I will not be disappointed as you do. Most likely, it's frustrating for me.
