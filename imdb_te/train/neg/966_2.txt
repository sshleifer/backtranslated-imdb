Films starring children acted from the very beginning to the back of the foot. In spite of some exceptions, many children can do the job even after a few minutes. The children in the paperhouse were able to capture the worst of both worlds, because they were very annoying and there was no ounce with the ability to act between them. In short; They're the worst. This is not good to consider that they are the leads, and it's not good if you consider the fact that this film is seriously impossible because it is the worst actors in particular. This film is a loss to the plot (not entirely). It follows a young girl who wakes up in the fantasy world that she created after her portrait of a house in her notebook. It is clear to her that soon she will be able to make the world through her paintings, so she makes various changes until her dreams turn into a nightmare. <br /> If you look at, this plot line gives you a good basis for a good fantasy horror movie. However, it will collapse with many dangerous errors. First and foremost, despite the premise that the discovery was a wonderful pledge for us; The movie is out of date. The central storyline is rarely played with all, resulting in a completely memorable experience. Another major song error in the film is the absence of tension, as you do not ignore every seven sequences (without thoughts). Thanks to the main roles of it, the movie feels like a children's film across. It is necessary to imagine children as stars, but Bernard Rose should decide the slant that he wants to keep in the story; The horror in the film is the best ridiculous. The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is very scary, and makes for a very painful look. In fact, if I sum up this word as a word, I will choose a painful one. The lesser the paper was, the ridiculously plotted, the whole was so much fun and dull. Keep yourself calm and see something.
