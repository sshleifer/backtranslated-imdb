Hmm, it can get worse. This is very bad. Not in terms of Gore - it's mainly ridiculous CGI - but acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story is terrible - the main character's character is the arc total joke. During the few nights of Vinnie Jones hunting, he became "haunted" during the filming of his girlfriend. Um ... All New York photographers This childish, suggestive and weak? There is absolutely no justification or point to develop his character - and in the end you'll be laughing louder at the utterly predictable, and his character takes a completely absurd twist. <br /> <br /> Gary's moments are all just the weakest, least self-respecting effort on the modern MTV style gore cart - all cgi, blood and no real emotion. These parts are unexpectedly funny - by their self-consciousness - absurd camera angles. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has gained another potential idea. Any atmosphere (to the stupid monsters at the end) 'see me is ruined in favor of self-conscious direction. The film is not made for audiences and audiences - it's designed for a CV - a deeply selfish intention.
