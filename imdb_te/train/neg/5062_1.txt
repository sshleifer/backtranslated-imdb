This film is bizarre. Better put it, it's "weird" strange. I can give you a plot summary or some hottie tatami analysis, but I will waste your time. Two young sisters, an absurd relationship, homicide, post mortem disability, and a really disturbing passion. You are not in a good way like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club", as you read in the end of the film as you read it necessary to take a shower to remove all of you. It's a young man (or a high educator I'm still young) and you have done something: wish you did not, and B: Do not ever get to know the Good Lord of your parent's heaven and earth. And no one likes. My advice is not to ruin your conscience, but waste your time on a little less terrible, and "kajam" (yes, I see "kazam" rather than "murders", what you read).
