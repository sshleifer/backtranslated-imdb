If I took the videos back for free, I chose it. I wish to mention OOPS already out of the given summary. 1: To make this movie a lot of people have a whimsical and unhealthy appeal for food, which is bulky and unnecessary. 2: There is a kind of soundtrack on the entire backdrop of the movie, where I have a whole time and I see that they are in something on the track as I thought it was after the worst days. That or it is just traumatisingly bad or both. Many times you can not tell the author or the director a lot of experience or talent. And do not even ask about acting.
