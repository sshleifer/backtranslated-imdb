It's like a movie about a group that does not like it, but does not like the point where everyone hates, but the audience does not have any redemptions anyhow with sympathy or sympathy with characters. They have a lot of good films (La la Ed Wood or Todd Slater films), and there is just a bad evil (99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). Even though you are a wonderfully talented MSTie refeer, this image is very reasonable (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Thankfully I am skilled in this (how it works my mind all the time), those who are naturally unskilled in the MSTie riffing will ultimately want you to remove your own head in the movie, and you can never get out of it for an hour and twenty minutes after the "Taboo" Can not come back. My MSTie talent also fits for this slow paced, boring waste time. The most vague to the film is that someone * is green-lit and / or financed it ... I rented the "Tabu", usually to the brilliant talent Amber Benson, to be explicitly blocked to do this film. In my rental line, I read and read the lesser known film and reviews of her. Ironically the best thing about the film is its impressive labyrinth building for its internal location.
