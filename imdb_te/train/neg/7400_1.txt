I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this is right up. Any plot to talk about, it's one of those bad coma episodes in a soap-opera. I wanted to smack that little girl because she said well, she is suspicious by cinema. Some wearing some bling is funny monsters running around. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" there. I've done this, or a Finnish metal band lorry. So it's not surprising that this does not make much sense. There is a vehicle that encourages the band and it looks like nothing else. The FX is great, the look of the film, the monsters, and even the acting is also good. But the story and telling it, not just.
