Yes, people are racist. People are also racist in college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been played several times in countless films. <br /> <br /> Learning from the pack is the best thing that can be done in a ham-fiest and predictable way of racism, oh which is also in college. <br /> <br /> The film Frankenstein is a racial discrimination dealing with many problems, which depends on you repeatedly in a brutal and slow manner. The characters are a lot of cartoon, one dimensional, satirical (lesbian feminist, angry black man), reaction to dramatic and possible predictability. Instead of rejecting the usual trend, the film sinks with them. I do not want to give anything away, but if someone in this one seems like shifty loner or a date rapist they probably will not know if black men feel cheating, feminists men, etc. Hate (a feminist also has no sign in reading "Dead Men Rape. You'll behave how you guess them. Changes that go through the characters are clearly visible to everyone in the picture. The big twist on the storyline about whether violent neo-Nazis act as violent neo-Nazis. <br /> <br /> I need another problem with this film to be "gritty" and "hard hitting", but they make the Nazis bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are evil, but that's my opinion. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; We did not break any new ground here. Since the 1930s the Nazis have been portrayed as villains. The image does not challenge any perspectives or bold ads. It just deals with issues we all know about a clumsy, later school special, manner. <br /> <br /> Higher learning is an imaginary, cartoon, and one word stupid. Avoid all costs.
