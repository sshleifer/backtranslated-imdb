Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be shy. This fantasy was created after the "Walking with Dinosaurs" series. Although it is 100% fantasy, it is displayed in a realistic and archaeological way. Mixing the fantasy dragons with the T-rexs and the dinos extraterrestrial. <br /> <br /> The program is included to show on an educational channel instead of the original standardized size. <br /> <br /> The fun will be 7.5 / 10 as entertainment goes on its own. But I should give 1/10 as it provided. I have no problem with fantasy, but they are very wrong to put it this way. <br /> <br /> I really believe that young people and slow adults have found a dragon and that this is true. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased with the fantasy of that little series of "walking with dinosaurs".
