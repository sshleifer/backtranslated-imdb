<br /> "The life of a woman is not more valuable than a man". <br /> <br /> The history of this mantra is politically correct, exhibiting biology. Communities have been able to withdraw their male population from huge losses, sometimes at astonishing speed. The war in 1914 Germany was ready to fight in another war in 1914, killing two million people. In the battle of South America's Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took over three neighboring countries, virtually wiping out her entire male population, but fought against the Bolivia in 1932 in the Battle of Chaco. However, no single community has lost its population number. Only the women were sent to fight when the country's most life. Israel encountered the situation in 1948, but the Israeli girl had never been a collaborative fighting division for the defense forces even though it was a popular image of the soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is Hollywood fluffy.
