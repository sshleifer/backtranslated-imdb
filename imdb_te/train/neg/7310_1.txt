** Under the Spellers! ** <br /> <br /> The cabin fever has my approval for the worst year of the year ... I have seen. This image is GARBAGE directly! The picture that you can not help is very bad, but really surprisingly bad. This film is great, but in the end it did nothing. The characters in a role are foolish; You're asking yourself for the whole movie "Why?" Or "What about you doing this?" ... how these characters are unrealistic and stupid. We get NO background into them, so naturally you do not really give mice as much as their destiny ... you could only laugh their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - 'Fatima' (Marcy) For example ... she is terrified of her sleeping with Paul (Raider Strong)? There is no point in the matter .... If filmmakers do not have a need to give her a virus! UGH. <br /> Who really wants to go into the woods and drink water from the cockpit of the cabin? <br /> <br /> Why did not Bert just shoot a sick person? <br /> <br /> Why did they take time to finally leave the cabin? Walk? <br /> When two of my friends are infected (I'm out of death) I finally choose to go out there. <br /> <br /> If the Hermit comes from a body of contaminated water, and the virus is infected? <br /> <br /> I swear, these are no less a rainbow for the insects. I always end up in the movie. Initially, the hick asks the store cashier what happened to the rifle, and he replied it to the 'nonsense'. At the end of the film, 3 young blacks (wore cloth worn, none of which is one of them) go to the store ... for hunting. <br /> <br /> Okay, what the hell did the point off?!?!?! ?? What's wrong with the film? What are the filmmakers in the film? I am a black man who was initially offended by the 'nigger' comment. It's a sweet, nonsense comment. My question to filmmakers: What is the point that ended with black kids? Do I forget about the first racist comment made earlier? To make matters easier with a black audience, making it a joke? Well, I did not find that curiosity effort, at least for a bit funny humor. The entire film is a pactic effort in a film that can not be given during a joke .... Did Peter Jackson really think this film was good? What is the movie he is looking for? <br /> <br /> * ZERO * from stars * I will do if I want to give a low rating. Please, fellow IMDb'ers, do not waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life looking at this obscene one 'image'. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
