This is a simple low budget 1970's mess. It should be a document about a staff hunting Bigfoot by the Pacific North West. Each character has a stereotype ranging from Native American to cynical cowboy. Acting and narrative full joke. If you want to see the big footage - be hopeful. There is not much, and what can you do with your cheap costume and camcorder at your backyard? It looks better than this film. <br /> <br /> I do not like the low budge charges of the 1970s. I will do it. It is a bad acting, bad characters, lousy story and what thrills you can not enjoy it is a mess. It's not good for the "good looks" category, you can laugh at how bad it is without the help of illegal materials. This is a lot of people boring footage, watching camping, hiking, horse riding, and wild life. There is a totally stupid big attack; Supposedly our friend Sasquatch throwing down the rocks in the camp from above while they fire him with their rifles. At that time, you have to throw a few stones on the heads of the filmmaker for the bigger movies and to distinguish it to stop the whole item.
