Correctly, I die to see this movie. In the horror landscape of the movie, who's who sleeps about "who's, my friend got this rented, brought it up, and we started looking at it. It's a comedy ... I do not even care for it until 40min. <br /> Does it cost the budget? Of course not, of course, such films are all there, they are absolutely nothing, they are fantastic (anyway). Also, when I see the film, I like to read my review of it ("This film will ruin BTW") with a low budget indie, similar to "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" (ie,> It's been done by "Star Power", the stolen plot (the movie's making scenes behind the scenes ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, I think more about this ...) Nni was. A lot of, a lot of the jokes fall flat. Acting is alright for what it is. <br /> <br /> While it's SOOO AWFUL that I will give for this, but it's the only reason.
