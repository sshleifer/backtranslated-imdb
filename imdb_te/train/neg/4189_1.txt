This morning I have two distinct misfortunes on the worst pictures of 2004: the first, the inconsistent CGI-driven vacuum of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the awkward Vanity Project called Gradelale. One cost is multimillionaire and other spending pennies, but both of them are bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Buffalo Springfield (Its Best Recordings Young Compositions) For Rather Never Sleeps, I'm not the World's Neal Young Fan, Harvest, and Mirror Ball, man has written some really great songs . Sadly, great songs in Greendale, and some good ones, and the film around they built is really cringeworthy and simpler political sloganeering. Without merit completely art and scholar merit, Greendale remains the best forgotten. Buy the book if you want to press to contribute to Young's bank account.
