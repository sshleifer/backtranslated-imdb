As in last year, I did not sit through the whole thing. Well, so Chris Rock is a good choice. Or, out of all the bores packed into the theater, he's not at least the top 10 boring. Many of the presenters are in this respectable top 10. I do not know if the whole thing is autonomously (although I know it is written, the actors who do not insist on the expression can see it out of the queue and make the fuzzy words (Natalie Portman and the director missing). It's tedious, Beyonce Knowles has some good lyrics <br /> <br /> My mum, my father, my lawyers, I have a high metabolism and I have a month to help me write this review I'm crying ... thank you.
