Do you sometimes know how to laugh at seeing a picture of a trash with friends and laughing at all the flaws in the picture? Well this is beyond. I bought a DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie you could laugh. It really is less exciting. In a 30-minute film, my friends asked me to stop it. I prayed for about 45 minutes. One hour later, we finally compromised to speed up, so we can see that this conflict has been resolved (we have noticed the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, do not look at this film. It goes beyond traumatic.
