I hate this trash, every Friday is part of the tizzy, and every week they are constantly stupid with big time. If you want to see "No What anTel" starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really fun, and why exactly is it going to go to a good movie career after a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and Bob Sagat always needs to go jump off a bridge for making this crapfest. I've seen shoulder stuff everywhere but here. I wrote 10 lines of AHet writing! To see at least humanity in the arts and entertainment programs, see the 'Full House'.
