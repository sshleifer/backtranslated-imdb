A few months ago, I saw this movie with some friends, and I'm thinking of a lot of stupidity. The first few scenes are only happy. I do not want to spoil anything that I want to see and laugh. I do not need to say the whole time seen in this film. I'm trying to figure out exactly what the characters in the film are. In the end we all got frustrated, this was a movie that was spontaneous and wore like the opening joy and shock. There is no trace of good acting. The characters developed in Kindergarten in the "Kind to Read" book. They also managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
