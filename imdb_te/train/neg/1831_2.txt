I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I do not really get the point of "envy". <br /> While acting is good, the film is not enough to get at least a bit of interest. <br /> If you are hired to comedy, I suggest you do not necessarily go about this. If you do not want to be bored, and I'm not alone in this view, because Jack apologized for apologetics (take a look at the trivia).
