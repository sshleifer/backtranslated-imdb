There is nothing amazing about 'Amazing Mr. Williams'. The film's problem is its main actor, Melvin Douglas. He is a lousy actor and lazy with it. For the most part of his career, he has allowed some good works to have his good looks, a glab approach and (usually not in the movie) acting ability. Douglas did not like me as an actor before I knew anything about him as a person; I learned a lot about him knowing that I hate his politics. <br /> <br /> Melvin Douglas After the film 'NinoTouch', the movie ... Melvin Douglas, in which the film stars. Comedown! 'Amazing Mr Williams' allegations are a comedy, but I never laughed. Douglas plays a plain detective in Kenne Williams' homosexual group. I never heard of a police detective named Kenny, but they called him Kenneth Williams ... well, a carry-on. As a serial killer, killing women, the whole city is in panic. There is no intention to do this. He just likes to kill women. Mayer (better than usual) Jonathan Hale calls Williams on the carpet due to his failure to catch a killer. <br /> <br /> Sparers approved. The cheap, vulgar, unilateral and unattractive Jon Blondell plays the mayor's secretary. <br /> <br /> Blondell and Douglas are not literate enough to write a letter to the controversial cat and dog. > At the lowest point of this film, Melvin decides to draw a killer by dressing up as Douglas a woman. You do not want to see Melvin Douglas in the drag! He is over six feet, and he does not even shave that annoying mustache. Similarly-William Powell is an actor equal to Melvin Douglas (but more talented). When Pavel disguised as a woman in 'love crazy', he is perfect for deteriorating his mustache: a real sacrifice that Powell needs to grow back to his next role. But Melvin Douglas did not bring anything to his role in the film, not a razor. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, 'The Amazing Mr. Williams' has many superb supporters of Hollywood's movies, which he used most of his drag scenes in his career. '30s delightful. Edward Breeffi is a criminal who has received a rare verdict from his life sentence, touching and funny is clever here. The agitator Donald McBride is a policeman mistaken for the killer, and is almost thrown into a group. Ruth Donnelly is awesome: for her, but here she has the chance to show her talent from her ordinary orbit in Warner Bros. Backlot. Jimmy Kenlin, Luis Alberini and smiley Dave Villak are good in small roles. Barbara Pepper (which I usually do not like) is also good. Badly unpleasant Mad Eburn gets some screen time; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The murderer will tell you about the Hollywood character of the 1930s, and the characters they liked to play in the IMDb's cast list. It's a problem with Amazing Mr. Wiliams: everything is very clear. I will rate this movie from 10 to 10 to 2 points.
