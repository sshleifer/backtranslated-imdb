This film is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. And I can not understand this in a good way. We want to see a crappy horror / thriller, so we have a choice that seemed lousiest in the store. For once, the film has everything we'd expect. A lot more! <br /> <br /> The actors appear to read their lines from posters behind the camera. Special effects can be created by putting the camera first red-look plastic to give the impression that we are looking at the killer rats. And the script? Even do not get me started in the script ... and if you just thought it could not get any worse, it turns out that the film is the Oscars-material compared to the end of the first part. <br /> <br> Take this from me, if you are in the lofty horror films, this movie is nice, but if you want a good image, keep watching. This is not for you.
