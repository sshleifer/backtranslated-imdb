I am sorry for this movie fans but the worst thing I have ever seen. Slowly, badly cast and starring this movie is trying to escape the deadbeat romances in recent years and fails! MacDonald and Parker were unable to convey real emotions and were lifeless. They seem to be one of these for getting out for it and for any pay checks because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! I love the next girl great chic movies and this is not! If you get a picture this year ... be it
