Potential film extravaganza set in the 19th century, failed to produce. With the big-name actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, the film does not cause failure. Nevertheless, the film did not end, saying a forgiveness for a plot line, with its continuation. A typical story of a wealthy girl and a poor boy is on the touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father, who was destroyed with love and beauty (or lacking) and unhappiness. The father who played the role of Finny is the person who suffered death in his deaf life as well. He believes that he can ruin his fortune by marrying under his social status without his daughter's form. Actors escaped to save the storyline. The black hole of the Washington Square destroyer and destruction will waste precious time for the grief. I gave the film 1 to the film's efforts completely. Save yourself, be clear of Washington Square.
