Nick Cage Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, sorry ... treasure "protector", ie samsaram) who came from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of the huge treasure that our Founding Fathers, most all Freemasons, decided otherwise to hide because they did not want to finance their independence. <br /> The first clue is on the long-lost ship that is hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Door Riley (immortal "Gigli" Justin Bartha) and the innocent navies, entered the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately kill gunpowder tons on the floor, which is not the most important. Eventually, they found the clue (a skeleton moving on it) and then switched to it by writing on it. Like. <br /> <br /> It is a riddle, and despite the fact that his search did not find the true treasure clearly, Gates wore himself about the meaning of the riddle, and in this frozen cargo hold, the crew seems to be around. I mean, come on. The Arctic, which is not interesting to anyone, should have a little voiced in the upcoming discourse, but when the gates enter their own world they stand there and solve the riddle. The next clue is in the Independent statement. Ian decides to steal it. Gates was scared. Different characters give gratingly clear exposition (get used to it). This leads to Iain's pulling of a gun on all the gates, and the gunpowder goes into a big explosion. Ian and his followers try to escape, and Gates and Movie Dorc Riley try to stop the nine-mile walk in an inuit village. To stop them, Gates concludes after the FBI and the Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) after trying, Gates and Riley should steal them. Riley then tells the details of the threat to the gates because he can not steal the relation later because it is protected by metal and laser eyes and high tech security blades. The Gates then said that Riley had a chance to steal from the reserve room. Did the relay know what the conservation room is, the Gates asks? "Where are they making jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; That's the real line. Barta it's not like a joke, either. So Riley does all this research about the Library of Congress and Archives and Water and Dirt, fercryinoutloud, but does not know what the care room is. <br /> <br /> In order to make these short breaks, Gates is actually a movie that takes place in a ridiculous break-in, with De's I. (I hate hated by rare and inaccessible graphics and fonts that they can use to monitor computer monitor technology.) Abigail chase is for convenience, and a clear "love interest" angle ends with tagging. At one time, three of them walk out of law, and really talk out their ideas in a clothing store around people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Subway builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior Lead Ian of On Wild Goose Chase. Ian is trapped in a kul-d-saak and believes that they are left there. However, after they leave, Riley asks how they go out. Gates ... <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... The button opens and the door opens. No, I'm serious. A button contains a vacuum-flush bag in an office building. He knows where he is good. However, after some knob-twisting, they will find this immense treasure room (which is under Manhattan!) Complete all kinds of prehistoric golden items. The relay gets a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them and arrests Sean Bean and allows two chemistry-Leeds to marry. <br /> <br /> For any viewer, all descriptions, logic, and for a long time are the same characters. There are a lot of good history lessons incorporated into the conversation in random moments. I want more conversations in my life.
