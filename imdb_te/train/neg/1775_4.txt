Horror writer Steffen King is based on the story by horror writer Stephen King and enables the sleepwalkers to retain the animals like the ancient and elite cat out of virgins. 'That is, they disappear and create sublime miracles to cheat people. We are told that they are running for centuries and only one of them has been selected until one of them left. The film starts with a beautiful mother and her son come to a sleeping town that is the last of the sleepwalkers and they are for food for food for the virgins. The mother sends her son to join her high school, so he finds a virgin, who (Madsen Amic) tries to stay alone and is able to absorb her powder. It is not clear why Virgins want more than most young boys to meet a teen older than a young adolescent younger than a teenager in adolescence. However the girl repulsed her fighting, moving the pencil to her ear. The police are called and hunting! The son is ill from his injuries and the mother goes to the right and left rampage killing cops in his hunt for the girl who spouting her son and spouting a leisurely unfunny one among the Gore. Finally the girl killed the dead mother. This movie is the worst! This performance varies from the average Brian Cross to the spectacular Alice Krieg. Special effects show an average and some small computer effects, which is a little interesting. The direction is muddled and the film comes in the camp in the places. The director does not think we are sleepwalkers fearful or sympathetic to them. Stephen King makes a fancy gardener like Mark Hamill, a ludicrous comic, a questionable cop. Alice Krige seems to have worked on the film, her character is depicted and suggests what the film is doing with good screenplay and better direction.
