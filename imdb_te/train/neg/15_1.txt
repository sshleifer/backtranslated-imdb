This is the same. This is one. This is the movie made so far. Ever. It has everything beats. I have never seen any worse. Retire this trophy and give it to these people ... Never before. <br /> After watching for three days (for some reason I still do not know why) this movie is horrendous. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> The question is whether or not humans are really on earth. Do better. As a breed in this universe, I was annoyed by ourselves and our progress. This kind of film honestly hurts us as a community. We should be shy. I can not emphasize that creating people and art here is our global responsibility, and we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's a trouble. I do not know how these stars, writers or sleeping night in the night of discovering that there is a role in making this movie director "lodged". <br /> <br /> I do not know what kind of bored monsters I see in these pictures. <br /> <br /> I love the good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are holy. <br /> <br /> The "bad" line crosses the new size. It's awkward bad. You know, every line, every action, every death, every sequence is going on, <br/> <br/> </ p> <p> After the first 5 minutes before, it is not the second or the second. <br /> Every cheesy compilation "effect" is dirty and sleepy. I do not want to see the "moving" camera effect on "drug buzz rush" or jump cuts or cutting cuts or any fancy cut at any time. <br/> <br/> And let me be unique here, the most weird thing about this film is that when the product is given, it looks a little bit durable money in this exception. I have already seen him and submitting him personally to the director's shoulders, run his home, swallow two gallons of drain-oin or I'll do it for him. If the aliens are needed for a different breach of our war criminals abroad, the film will repeat them again and again. <br /> <br /> Stopping these movies, they are very sad in all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. Now.
