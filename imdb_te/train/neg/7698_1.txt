Can I give it a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most unfortunate film I've ever tried to watch. It's painful. Boring Maximus. This plot (?) Appears in the subdivisions nebulaicity. I rented this movie with a friend and after the expectation that it was good for thirty minutes, we decided to go a little "fast forward" to see things improved. This is not good. This film is interesting for some of the two girls kidnapped, but in fact it is just a bore. The distance is not even interesting. If you ever get to see it, help yourself, instead of "PLAN NINE OUTER SPACE".
