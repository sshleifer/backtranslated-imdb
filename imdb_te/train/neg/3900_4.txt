Anyone who reads the book, can say that the larger American version of Guinnah Paltrow is too small. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, she has shortcomings and is not the easiest person - but the viewer should not begin to hate her. Secondly, Mr. Knightley is wrong. In this version, his parenting and sadness is more suited to BrontÃ« or Gaskel's adaptation than Aston, and the whole affair dismisses the "off" mood. Third, an actress who is expelled from the role of Samantha Morton Harit is very strong; And why did she look sick? Harriet should be blonde and blooming - she can not see if she's going to be handled by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the construction was overwhelming and the scenes were cut. Eventually, Emma decides that she loves Mr Knightley, which comes across as a whole barrier, because this story is not adequately shown and is maintained throughout the film. Fifth, exactly, what happened with Mrs Elton's voice? She initially found that she was an American actress who tried to suppress her own voice, through the American half-way, and then to the English in the end. Lastly, it was dragged at the end. Emma and Mr. Knightley's marriage with the book and the end of the big movie version. <br /> <br /> This celebration will continue to be confusing after truly announcing the marriage without showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, chaotic attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead
