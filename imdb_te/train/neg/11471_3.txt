Orca two years after Jacques was not a coincidence? Orca was not exactly a "jazz of rip" but Jas attempted to gain a success. <br /> <br /> When this plot was primarily seen by the male killer whale (orca), its mate and its unborn bull, the fury that was killed by a fisherman could not stop me watching again. <br /> <br /> The film's directorial venture is very small and the director, producers and writers are almost talented compared to Jaws. <br /> For acting, it is very average and believable, at least not a bit fond of. Alright for the effects of its time and the killer whale's footage looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is not recommended for people who are confusing, bloody, and more sensitive. The music is over and louder, drowning sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated that killer whale (which does not match the killer whales merely a single colleague in Orca). <br /> <br /> The whole picture is bad in my opinion / reasons mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Many people appreciate this movie because I can not bash the movie because of the feeling of vengeance between animals and humans and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but its notion is probably 5/10)
