Acting - Although not all of the other movies in the whole, it is clear that working continuously on the whole is hard work. <br /> <br /> I can say that Plot Writer initially started with a plot but did his best to ignore it. The plot fell rapidly when the computer hit the Chinese <s <br /> <br /> Scrip - Now it's aberration of nature. It flows with any poem or reason. Most of the characters are characterized by impeccably pleasant lines. The script worked hard to make sure any role was considered memorable. <br /> Special effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! I saw other movies. <br /> Directing - You can only make such a set of failures until you can copy your favorite director's style with your own directing ability. <br /> <br /> It is good to know that your friends / family are giving you 10 stars for this movie
