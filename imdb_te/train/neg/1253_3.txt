I read somewhere that Hollywood will rebuild bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake is not a total waste, I wanted to go to the original six DVDs. It's a lot of violence and one of the worst conclusions I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. This only reiterates that Hollywood should leave only good stuff.
