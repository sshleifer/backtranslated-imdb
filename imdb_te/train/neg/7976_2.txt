You do not believe in God or you do not. You do not believe in Jesus or not. You believe that you believe that he is the Son of God. The choice is right for you. <br /> <br /> Director Denis Arcand is truly the only one who can bring Jesus back to life as a historian, social worker, and two sons, the Spirit and Mary, who opened the Heaven again to us. The promotion of the big bang came from a global evolution, instead of the beauty of creation. The film portrays a theorist who brought some "modern results" to the actor who played Jesus in the Paseen play. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Passion Play has a sexual relationship with female players of Passion Play performed in Montreal, which shows Passion Play, and shows his love for God through the supernatural. <br /> <br /> The director tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the Passion Play Actor. This is an excellent effort, but the director suggests how the director thinks about Jesus when showing the resurrection with the conversion of the actors' organs to other organizations. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion, but I do not stand in the director and actors boots when I stand before the throne of Jesus.
