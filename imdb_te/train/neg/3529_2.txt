I heard that the film was much more stylized than the film director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), which was very stylized. Jake Green (Jason Statham) is generally released from prison after seven years, and in two years he saddled his loads. He is ready to take revenge on the casino owner in the violence sent to jail, Dorothy Mr de 'Macha (Ray Leota). In this process, he told Dr Jake that he lived for three days as he died from rare blood disease, oh, and macha hit him. Jake (Vincent Pastor) and they (Andr√© Benjamin) make some odd jobs, demanding that Jane pay their cash. After Jack spent the last three days before a big revelation about Zach and Aavi and Macha, I think what it was like, with Jack commenting on some flashbands. Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Lilly Walker Francis Annies, Angelo Lauren Smith, Dorren and Elena Banish Rachael. Two parts of the animation, in different perspectives, are repeated repeating lines, and the speed for moments, and all of this can make you feel confused and frustrated, turning into a silly crime drama. Pretty poor!
