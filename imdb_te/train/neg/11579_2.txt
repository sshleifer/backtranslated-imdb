I have to admit, I can not remember much about the characters or the story, but I'm not sure, I'm frustrated by this film, it's a difficult time to care for me. How do you name it "Tulsa Kies" and portray it in Texas? The Flat Desert Country around Arlington (I think that area) does not resemble green rolling hills around Tulsa, but a famous dancer in Tulsa has the most neighbor to live. There is no one in the movie Tulsa or any other film. At least anyone saw Rumblefish or Outsiders? I know the picky sounds but I can not help. I love James Spader and I'm generally interested in Eric Stottz, because I've seen this. But the two romantic actors could not make up this curve, and the story of the self-involved people who are not in TULSA. Sorry, it's not too expensive for the film in Oklahoma. If "Live and Die in El" is shot in Toronto? Would you like to suck? Well this does.
