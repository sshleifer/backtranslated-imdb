I do not hate more than self-congratulatory acting. Kevin Smith deserves to hang on his toenails, inspiring every white middle class. I really do not mind the experience and low budget productions but writing this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. This money was actually a real battling filmmaker who had a chance like John Gulager. If you look at the green light of the project, you will soon be recognized as a talented fantastic fighter against the system. Anyone can catch a camera and make a tactivative picture and can not really say anything. When will we be saved from the Smithsite and Wodeonettes of the world? The revolution will not come soon. See the real first time effort by buying desperado or looking for friends with profits. Thanks and good day.
