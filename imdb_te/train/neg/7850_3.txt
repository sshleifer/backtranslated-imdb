Alexander Ajay Remake of The Hills Hey Eyes is one of the brightest places of 2006. It's not just a remake of a classic horror movie, but pretty good. So, about a year later, we're remaking the remake to the sequel. While the original script writer and co-writer is Wes Craven, the film can not reach the level set by the original and remake. A team of military scientists dropped out of the mutant family from some of the scientists in the desert and from the first film (at least some new ones). There is a lot more gore here. What makes me angry about the film is the inability of the character. The viewer does not know what happened to these people. So we can not earn them. Even some of the mutants get out of the past time and this time, nothing. Gore does not mean Gore. This is a reason for it to be interesting. Nothing that happened here was not interesting. What's the rape scenes in movies? We do not have any real cause here. Hopefully this group of hills will not be visited again.
