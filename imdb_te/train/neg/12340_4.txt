"Transylvania 6-5000" is very small but occasionally the funniest laughter between the funny and lovely 80s, the most well-known names in the cast and the written chuckle-written script in chronology. Two Boja journalist of the mess tabloid newspaper, the mad scientist Frankenstein, sent a lot of transylvania to their story to make the story back to accusations. There are some adorable little maneuvers and details to find the left and right in the picture, like a little guillotine for laboratory test tubes that can be used to place in cream and sugar at hard-boiled eggs and breakfast table. However, because the film's perfect is not successful, it moves with jokes and scholarly circumstances. Roger Carman's production "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years later, is very ridiculous and more recommended. The film is particularly ridiculous of the classic Universal Milestones of the 30th century, so if you want to capture all the little bags and references, make sure you look at that. There is a pretty twist to indicate that Frankenstein's role behaves like an insane bad scientist when entering his laboratory. It also reveals the fact that the Messiah's father, Damien, was only concerned with the condition of the deported monsters. Freaky Guy, who plays the role of Kramer in Michael Richards, Seinfeld, has acted as a mindless butler and disappears in the most inappropriate moments. John Turturro's character in "Mr.Dides" is inspired by Richards's role here.
