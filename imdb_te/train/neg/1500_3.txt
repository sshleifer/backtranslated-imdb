Oh, it's so bad, it's funny. The only way to describe something like this is just a romantic party with drugs as a result of clarity to make a film for fun. I mean: you can not see romantic actresses, have a sexual relationship, and then human mutants are killed. "There's plenty of gore including the classic, something wrong with her, oh no, she's half the man she uses" and the accidental murder caused by panic. But you can even get funny stuff like intestines pulling through a person running in the woods finding someone's ass and deeper through a string tied between two trees (which makes a metal doiiing sound like cartoons). There is a market for some of the people who are pornographic, they really need to know what is inside an actress, not just genes. So you can see plenty of autopsy on the bimboos that you killed. No dialog is missing. Jenna and Chesey have really small parts and I wanted Richard GrIo when I accepted a role here. I want to see this film with a button in a form forward and see only the juicy thing to be a symbol of old school c class horror movies.
