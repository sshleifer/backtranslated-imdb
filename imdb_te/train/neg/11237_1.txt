I went to see the low expectations of the film but wanted to be attractive by watching my home town in the movie. Unfortunately, all I got is about. The story describes the familiar landscape (high school reunion), but the plot revolutions and the supernatural element add little to this well-diluted theme. The quality of the acting is good, but the content of the film is scared. The film's sexism is unclear - if they are married, to marry or both (which is imitated as post feminist choice), women are clearly not fulfilled. The worst still racism - the deaf Jewish mother, the black man living at home - and the inaccurate cruelty (suffer the class geek). We must be ashamed of the fact that these characters represent the city residents, and the writers have to worry about bringing widespread and ruthless stereotypes onto the screen.
