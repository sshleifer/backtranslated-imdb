This could be a very good movie if I could see. The hand camera will fly too. From the early credits I was worried. Many of those who have seen it have experienced so much pain in the end. But it's a beautiful and interesting movie because we want to stay up to the end, giving some insight into the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white image made it a sense of art. Acting seemed to be very standard. Some dialogues are very hard to understand, but a theater filled with South Africa or South Africa has proved to be very funny. If at all you are motion sickness, you may seriously consider skipping this image. It is controversial, but nausea is not worth it.
