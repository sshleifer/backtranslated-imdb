When I was a kid and had lived with my sister, she bought every horror film she discovered and was one of them. The VCR'S was just a household thing and we had no more than 150 movies and we had seen hell for all of them. <br /> <br /> I'm in the yard for another day and I know that this is a copy of the VHS Blood Legacy and I purchased any horror movie that I have not and I have known this film. I thought it was the second one and I realized that my sister bought something. <br /> I did not remember anything about it and I saw it the night I bought it and the reflection of my memory was a few scenes. <br /> <br /> "I do not know how I felt about a little boy but I enjoyed it because I was new, but to consider myself" good " <br /> <br /> If you are lucky, the death shots of your choice will use shadow on the wall and you are very fortunate. <br /> <br /> This story is good and I think this is a plot, I think this one should be buried and forgotten.
