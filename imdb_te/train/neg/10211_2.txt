Except for some nice cinematography, I can not say anything positive about this film. The real problem of loneliness is the mess of the protagonist whether the world of difficulties to remain with his childhood friends or leave them and take his own life. The abusive "emotional powerful" scenes do not go with this plot, because bad acting, they also fail to create an intended atmosphere. The director only brings an easy solution to introduce Anthony's confusion. While the characters are difficult to talk about, the characters do not appear to be evident ... perhaps Sony. Along with him, the actors can not play much, and when some of them come in as self-pleasurable enthusiasts. I am wondering what has sung more movies: the surface script, the plot to throw all the probability, or the bad acting, disturb any vow that can be left out.
