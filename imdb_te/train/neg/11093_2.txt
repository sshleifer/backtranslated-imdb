If the film is about a fictional character, the film will stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately, the film is based on "facts" that the film is very unfair to Ruben Carter. Many small facts were abandoned (not the carter number one contender during the murders, there is no evidence to save a friend from child molar in his youth), but some big facts, including those of "racist" judges, have been unable to disgrace the guards, Why Hollywood has to be a hero, a better person, trouble and trouble than a normal person (who has been arrested several times to hit women). Reuben Carter is looking at his actions at the age of 60, the person who can always see when he never talks to his son. Everyone knows, that Jesson is directing, and knows that Washington can work, but why did they choose this story because their vehicle was over me? Hollywood needs a very dark hero and they want to give up the truth to trust their bio jagan? (Dengel is now giving a suggestion that she is going to make a film about her now and is inspirational) Based on all the bugs in this film, I have seen this.
