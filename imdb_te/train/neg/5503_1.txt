In the sixties, I grew up watching the original TV series and I can not say now, no comparison. The film is totally ridiculous with a flying suit alive. Martian taken from different shapes. A special effect on creating a young child. In contrast, the original, the characters were developed and viewers developed a concept for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in the film, yes, was actually one, when it finally appeared at the end of Ray Wallston. He wore dark glasses and suggested living on this planet for over 30 years as loyal to the TV series. But true Uncle Martin did not even save this turkey.
