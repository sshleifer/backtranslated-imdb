Why, oh, why can not they learn? If you've got a nice, juicy exploit gimmick, use it! Do not miss the problem around trying to get all the deep and attentive; <br /> <br /> <br /> The story of Harry Statille when looking back a little more of Santa Claus - Christmas Evil, Mommy kiss (daddy-like-like). As a child. Furthermore, Harry was engaged to Christmas and eventually, when he was too great in his desperation, he dressed as Santa and killed the city by giving toys to small children and killing anyone who brought nonsense. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film "Silent Night, Deadly Night" (after all, how many holiday background horror flicks use the same schtick?) Rather than a "portrait of serial killer." About two-thirds of the film is spending a paper on Harry's slow but inevitable collapse, and I'm ready to buy introductory speeches <br /> <br /> Harry's madman may possibly be in the hands of the executive director, but alas, we are a man named Louis Jackson, apparently, this is his only movie, and it shows. From scene to action scenes or clear scenes, let's see the scenes Let's see, who are called and let us know. </ P> Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and the healing of the nervous behavior did Helpouts treatment. Frightening than disappointing, Christmas Evil is one to avoid.
