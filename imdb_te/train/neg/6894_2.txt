It's very sad that you can see what you're trying to do, which is very clear. Cinema students should take this lesson as a warning and a warning. Graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces and casts his cinematography himself. His concept is generally less than his budget. Normally he writes a full-sized script to come up with every coming line. In general, he is more interested in the story's grand sweep, rather than working with actors on individual scenes. Generally, he ends with an image of weak in an attempt to create wonders on a small budget. Generally, he ends up combining the lines of experience that he thinks is written at the age of 12 (we can not do justice when calling scenes). And usually ends with scenes that are badly seen by the viewer fail to grab. As soon as you look at the judges from this perspective, you can give us regular charges.
