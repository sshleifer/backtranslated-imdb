Personally, I would advise the film to be clear. It is a bored and fighting poorly directed dance to see the whole. It is slow and not quite acceptable. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, then the most valuable thing to hear is the Bey Logan audio commentary. <br /> In any case, looking at it. <br /> <br /> When it comes to movies, I have a Golden Rule: Avoid movies featuring the word 'ninja'.
