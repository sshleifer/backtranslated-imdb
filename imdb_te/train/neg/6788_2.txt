The good idea in the name of the people is that his daughter ends up in an organization and he asks the girl's parents who have killed her daughter. And you do not have actors, especially Scott Bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they will not be able to! People will be the regular Friday night tearjerker in the name. The flashbacks are pretty curious with the murdered girl and you can imagine what the actors say at a certain stage ... If you want to see a good image on this topic, see Dean Man Walking!
