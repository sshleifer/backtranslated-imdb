I'm always proud of the duration of the period, the former artistic form on the BBC. This performance of "Byron" is unbelievable. Unbelievably bad! The script is horrific, acting uninspired, and all the letters are woefully insipid. Apparently Byron is "mad mad and dangerous to know", and ladies' hearts set all-a-flutter. Not in this product. Here he jumps up a long time instead of the fiery hero of females and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron left with a limp. <br /> <br /> This man's character is just ending for everyone. Not a splutter, even a glimmer. <br /> <br /> I believe that nobody can ever make Avon's beard much better, and I believe that Byron's poetry is highly respected. I need to put my mind back on the burner, and this drama of his life should be given to the same treatment. <br /> <br /> The BBC loses its nose with this
