Haunted boat meets 'open water' and sells as 'fog'. This is accurate in many ways. <br /> You are frightening and untidy people for what you like. It shows clear signs that only a group of friends who make horror films are just a group. In all credit they make their potential best. It will be very difficult for you to have special effects when you take a low budget, ghosts look pretty as men with devil masks. <br /> <br /> Many elements of the film are creepy and strange. But it suffers using a lot of turns and turns in a short space of time, which will leave you bored and confused. Keeping in mind, the movie is doing very well. By the end of every 5 seconds, ignoring the absurd twists and the fact that you want to know what's going on. The climax is ready to wait for 1hr 35 minutes. <br /> This is not a Ghost Ship, but T.V.
