My Take: The exhausted formula is a Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> I love the next person as a holidays (although I'm often a bad case for the holiday blues), but it's a dumping ground for a group of bad movies throughout the year, but they are less painful for the season. As we already have enough of Santa Claus films (three and * gulp * and counting), who wants to see the film about his brother? On a platform located at Disney's Santa Clausau franchise (occasionally wearing raw humor and Santa's "Little" helper mini-skirt), Freed Clays is a joke maze of 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly O'Brien is the brother of Saint Nicky, but where do you go from there? <br /> This is really a shame. FRED CLAUS may be a joyous cosmosmama comedy, which will dissolve in the snow, but it is much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snap, but he really believes that he is the long-lost loser of many elderly Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites him to visit his Good Ol 'brother. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant and worse, a skilled expert (Kevin Spacey) arrives to keep a watchful eye on Father Christian and is close to closing him. HAH! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Of course Kathy Bates. Elizabeth Banks is one of Santa's helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins blows, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! SI did not know whether I praised casting or it was evaporated. <br /> <br /> Here's the best thing to come with FRED CLAUS, for Santa's brother probably being a certain joke about his exact opposite and a DJ elf. When Fred came to the brothers' brothers (he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), I attended a group of counselors, but I had some grooves, but the giggles begin and end. Worse still, this film also helps us to feel "good feeling" and to teach us the lesson that "Christmas really means". <br /> <br /> Christmas for Hollywood is the fact that our leftover Christmas shopping is growing. <br /> Rating: ** From 5.
