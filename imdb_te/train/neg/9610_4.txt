In Hollywood, in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can do a Western part, except Warner Bros. (At any time, they probably killed their boots - this is a cavalier western.) I read Humphrey Bogart, who looks at James Cogny on his head with this big cowboy hat and looks like a mushroom. True! Cogni and Bogart is very urban, very popular in the XXe century western film. The story does not have any success, it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I get Bogart and Cognini out of their small guns and put them in a machine gun and get out of the set in a black car in 1930.
