Perhaps my style is but the plot is as terrible as acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role here (when was marijuana? Why is this necessary to be included? This weak plot is substantial). Also Farentino's charac. She had more respect for her. Will you try to tell the movie? Not much.
