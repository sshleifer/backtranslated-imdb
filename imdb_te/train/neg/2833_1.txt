With a Bo Derek film, the audience will get what they have expected. A few shots of any paper narrative plot and Mrs. Derek. 'Ghosts can not do this'. The first fifteen minutes of the regular TV drama, Scott [Anthony Quinn], is still alive. He is a very good actor with many experiences in very different roles, but one actor also sometimes needs to work for money. Bo Derek is opposite, always playing with a young girl who is not beautiful without clothes or costumes. The film is full waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see the naked women or bad performances, rent a romantic image.
