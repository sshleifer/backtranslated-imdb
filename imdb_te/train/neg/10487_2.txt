Oh god! I'm giving this film a 1 instead of 1 because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-box. Moreover, how did this half good cast do such a dirty picture? Perhaps that was a good idea at the time ... no laughs to say, the stereotypes were curious, the cast wasted, the direction was enthusiastic. Now I think about it, so much reproof is probably the director Joel Zwick. But nothing from the participants he brings out brings out flat shows. Do not waste time I did. But I will enjoy good train ruins. Geez, now the system is telling me I need more lines - go to my here: send this image back sender. Okay, now it's ridiculous than anything in the cinema ...
