Oh ho! Another gay image. It shows the black side at this time. Your last dollar wager gonna have a happy ending to it! But why? Less than half a dozen exceptions, all gay movies end up in the death or "adidio" end. 40, 50, 60, and 70 are all European film noir releases. The main ... male or female must die or ride off alone alone. Why should the writers, directors, and producers in God's name leave the feeling of the Detroit Theater in the audience? After all, it's not gay ... bitter. Perhaps the category 'glum' should be changed. Guy ties past a large number and couples ride together into the sunset! Who writes or produces, he only shows down the gay life and gives the wrong impression of gay lifestyle. This picture proves my point. If you rent a DVD, take the antidepressant, where another 'gay image' comes! It's wrong!
