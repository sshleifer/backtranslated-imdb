Tourists travel to Ireland for school tours to learn about droids. <br /> If I want to capture the Evil Breed, this is a low grade gore fest. The film will star in Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn. Note that it has a lot of inconveniences, and that it loses any "fun". The film has a lot of random "horror" nudity ... The film also has four sexy stars, but four, so much more. The breed also displays a good amount of gore. <br /> <br /> The Evil Breed is a terrible start with the humorous dialogue and terrible acting. It is directly given the video horror movie, but it takes this cake. Finally, the main character does not recognize the person, and ultimately the "living" woman is not really in the picture. Talking about the ending, it must be one of the most random and bogas that seem to be in the history of cinema. It does not have any benefit from the rest of the movie and completely changes a scene of the movie. <br /> You have to look to believe this movie because there are some terrible horror scenes. There are two death scenes in my mind, one of which is a lung killer that stimulates the nose from the naked woman through her chest .... Yes, do not ask her chest. The other id, again, peeled out by his ass when the guy gets his intestines. Kill that person? No, the killer continues to stick to the person with his own intestines. These scenes remind me of Dead-Alive, each of which is a perfect comedy. I realize the sense of Evil Dead with horror films and nonsense references of Sam Raimi. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood, when the female role killer attempts to sleep for his life, he is continually trying to sleep. <br /> <br /> However, the quality of the gore and nudity is not enough for poor audio and visuals. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so big and tight and she looks like she wears shoes. Really break up. As well as the continuation in the film, with only one of the following killers? Which dying in any role in the role. I can not say that the breast implant chick Jenny or his sister / relative ... if I can not remember. <br /> <br /> The horror edition has also attracted attention, opening credits are much faster and deteriorating. It's a bad start and good, but the end just brings down the image back to a horrible level. Probably good product values ​​and more confidence in the film, it will not be murdered with horrible death. Stay away from this film, unless you're happy with a good gore budget with a horrible bad image.
