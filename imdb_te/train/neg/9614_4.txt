If you are interested in David Copperfield and I do not want to "complete the set". Some good performances (eg Urea Hepp) and well directed moments (eg beating), but overall it compares with previous versions of the 1999 BBC version. <br /> <br /> Except for the distinction of the story, except for the silent purpose, to remain silent (except for the stolen jewels). The American cast was poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong as Betsy Trottwood, and is better than her cocktail of English accent Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards is selected to play Mr McBrur; He hams it too much, though, and becomes irritating. He goes abnormally and is just shocked. Anthony Andrews deals with Mr. Murdstone, but he feels he wants to build David's mother for a railway line and meet him (partially wrong with Dickens). <br /> I am free with this newspaper. It helped pass on a Sunday afternoon, but I thought it was disappointing over at the end
