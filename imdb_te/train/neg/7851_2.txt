As countless times, "The Hills Have Ice 2" is not a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 original (usually discarded) mid-80s sequel. But this post wants to give the Modern Sequel-to-Remake remixing to the stamp of demining returns, and Craven himself (with his son, double accident with Jonathan) decided that Penn's film was of the same quality - in general English, terrible. Former musical-video director Martin Weisz takes revenge from Alexander Aja and is clearly visible on his head - is it a wonder that anyone can create a film from Cravens' screenplay 101 Scroll. Only the characters (in this case, the men's team of Gopfle National Guards (vo) men who investigate the tunnels of the original remake) are at risk of a completely wicked and really annoying genre (playing without a satirical play), but they are constantly cracked jokes. After seeing their overall inefficienity during a training exercise, their duty against repulsive, roaming cannons is obviously painful. Just this time - in the original 80s - the script is very simple (actually, actually) any potential subtext, disruptive shocks (we are being treated for a combo parenting) an inappropriate rape for those who do not DVD out through the murders, plus midpoint during initial credits!). The mutants in this outing are also the hallmark of any memorable monuments - the awkward, rubber-looking makeup FX appears to be the rest of the movie trying to hide his face from being in trouble. I was really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja 's otherwise magnificent film, and the producers go for the literally broke at the end of "Hills 2" set on stage - very lamely to set up the platform - the third redeeming ... yet Cravens and Weisz 1977/2006 A cynical bastardised movie, which they did in order to find audiences after this insulting motion Will be under pressure.
