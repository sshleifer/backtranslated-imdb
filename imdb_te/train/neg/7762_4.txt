Looking at John Dee, Kyle XY's creator was inspired, and I think its pilot is very interesting. I have very high expectations because I am very disappointed. First they became a freelancer role in a public area, who made crazy thinking of showing his excellent knowledge before the audience. After that scene I was worried that I was fun. But the problem is that it has not yet been introduced to any of the other characters. They paid much attention to John Doe, which made the story a lot less. I was a little disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance, because I did not recognize John belief in the most reliable way. One other issue is the police story. This is really felt like a déjà vu and it's not a pleasant feeling. This leads to the worst problem in the bunch and episodic format. <br /> <br /> I am totally disappointed and not recommended for anyone. I understand now why the show was canceled. In some way I had the impression of missed its goal, developing characters to help the character find his own identity. It is sad because he has the potential, like the people he met at the club. Product quality is very good and casting is correct. Since I do not plan to see the next episode, I do not know if it's not good.
