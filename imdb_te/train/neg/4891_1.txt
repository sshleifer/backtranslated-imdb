I want to clarify some things. I do not know about Ming-Liang Sai movies, and I'm very familiar with art cinema; I grew up with Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolukki and many other seventy times. <br /> Art films are really ART; Like colors. People have expressed their inner feelings and are really concerned if others understand something. They are beyond trade values; <br /> You can understand some old Antonioni (or early Picasso). <br /> <br /> The Tian Bian Yi Du'i Yan (The Weaver Cloud) is not related to it. This is an opportunistic film intended to deceive festive judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything. <br /> The story does not make sense. The lack of water makes the government encourage water to hydrate watermelons. The girl in despair, the WC steals water from outdoor bathrooms. There is also a romantic start (neighbors) who do not feel comfortable trying to make an image with an actress. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star. Many people wonder when confused with a sexual scene (not obscene), but I believe that American or violence is less inspiring than what you can see in history. <br /> <br /> The two main characters always talk. Sometimes, a musical number 60 looks and explains (by a song) what is happening in the minds of the characters. Unlike the people who are looking at each other without dialogue or music, the scene takes 4, 5 or more minutes because these video clips are really welcomed. <br /> <br /> "It's hard to create unwanted sexuality", and there are some bits about "the selfish mind of the porno industry." <br /> <br /> This apparently, the film was intended to deceive the jury and reviewers of the film. It has some fake-shocking scenes (in Taiwan censorship limits) and many things that are open, but nothing can be closed or gone somewhere. <br /> <br /> These dazzling films garnered some (controversial) critical costumes, which became an unusually successful commercial success (I watch cinemas in France and the theater is full). <br /> <br /> Please do not be fooled. The film is new or original, or was not originally or portrayed. It's boring and empty; Really cheating people. Boogie Nights (which I really do not like), the closeness and the 9 songs are very good movies.
