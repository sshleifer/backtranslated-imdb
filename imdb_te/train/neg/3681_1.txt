My goodness is bad for this movie. My local review was completely misleading because this verification was the worst. Yes, yes, good people wear white, bad guys wear black .... And good guys always win. Go home now, feel your daughter and feel how good Hollywood felt. Blech! I can not believe that this brain was made by Wes Craven on a dead film. I do not think I need a little money to pay my mortgage, so he made this dung. <br /> <br /> It is believed that anyone who looks at movies will feel better or feel better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not make a jerk 's bad thing in his daddy to a bad guy or he' s gonna hurt his daddy. But Ms. All American girl-next-door, we know she's the worst to save her day and beat the bad guys ... the end. Girl Power Rocks. <br /> <br /> Now C'mon, this idiot is simply entertaining ... "Roller Coaster Ride, all the" Super-Dupoer "reviews you see on this site make money from this movie, repay the adorable or devil their souls <br /> <br /> McAdams is beautiful ... oh, that's it, not a good performance, it's not terrible ... she's beautiful. <br /> <br /> At the age of 28, Sillian Murphy is at least confused, but here he plays a mute villain who plays a nice guy who runs his donkey by 5'5 "McAdams, Because after all, she's a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she has all the tie boe tapes But she should try to get out of an international terrorist job. <br /> <br /> "Die Hard films Take any rent. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, preferred and believable and bad guys except the characters are WAY more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can continue to make the worst if they ignore the right models they can immediately copy. <br /> <br /> Do not throw in your $ 6 toilet and save yourself for 2 hours of your life. <br /> <br /> SOO, FreddyShoop
