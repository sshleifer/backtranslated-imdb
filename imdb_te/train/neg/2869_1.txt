The story goes on, Netflix finally sent my DVDs, so they know you go to the analog rental space and say "blockbuster video". Real bad, they have 150 copies of fresh dirty movies for your viewing pleasure yet and I never want to see any of that. I saw BTK killer right there on the shelf, by all its lonesome self. I see pictures based on serial killers. I am just a part of humanity that I do not understand, so I must see that kind of stuff. However, I have suddenly and suddenly made this DVD from the first time, and it sucks. I am my b.f. And we say, "What's the worst of this kind?" Unstable camera operation, awful acting, - In the first scene where a woman kills you will be surprised if you make her just a calf instead, then a rat her throat will be stuffed down. I really wonder if the director turned on a hard for this trash. There is nothing better about this "movie". I told the director: "Do you have a freakin pillar?" Each shot is messy. The music is awful. This is one day they decided to make a movie. They will probably show people from WalMart and "react" to them. Just plain terrible. If you make such a film then it's not your favorite - you're not doing it for the sake of life - it should not be for DVD kidney shops for some of the fans. Your friends have good friends in the house and they have left interesting things to share them with entertainment .... Then you split your BTK killer movie and say, "Would you like to see this bad movie I once did?"
