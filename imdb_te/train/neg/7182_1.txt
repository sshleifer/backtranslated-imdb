I could not recommend a Christmas image than this precious piece of disappointment (trust me, double negatives here - it's that bad). The film suffered from early credits when the film was screened as a writer songwriter. Musical numbers are all too long and none of them is good ("thank you so much", but the lyrics are stupid than words). <br /> <br /> In addition to the entertaining episode of the film (not entirely unexpected), Alec Guinness will be involved, and I would be happy to have the scouting chains in the film's immense hell sequence. Jacob Marley. Guinness dressed in a crazy powdery white suit, with his favorite look through his scenes, looks like he is floating like a ghost, or tries to show his bizarre reputation in this horror movie. Albert Finney at the same time, the best of assister sim and Charles Laughton to create a sudden uncomfortable role of Quasimodo / Scoutz. <br /> <br /> The Finnies Scout is a disgust for a person and is unlikely to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Tell the filmmaker at all costs clearly this disgust.
