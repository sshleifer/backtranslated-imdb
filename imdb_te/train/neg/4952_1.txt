Okay, I'm always a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series, and even Beyond Beyond. I read the Batman comic now and then. So as expected - I was happy to hear about this series, and then I was disappointed. This series does not exist. It does not start to compare with the original series. It is a long TOY trade. No depth. And what the heck is with the joker? Who, in my most humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time and they killed him. I can say that his design is the worst part. Actually, I can say that there is anything about this series that is far remotely creative or interesting. In short (I believe I can say too much) do not waste your time on this show, or your money.
