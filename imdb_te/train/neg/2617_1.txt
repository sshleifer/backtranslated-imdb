This film is pure pain. I was wondering when sitting in the theater for a total of x amount of time, the film was going to start. All settings are in place; The distinctive love story, the characters have to overcome their little-creatures, the villain is to emerge, but none of it ever started. By the time these things were happening, I was already bored and the equipment was not fully effective. In the scenes that require heavy tension and preparations, the frames are needed to be cut. The kid's content is not necessarily the same. Children's films are boring and sinking adults. Forgive, "Hey, it's kids," bull. On what day I will take "Stone in the Stone". It's terrible. I'm going to be out of Disney these days. And for the kids, 10 years I saw this saw ... pure garbage.
