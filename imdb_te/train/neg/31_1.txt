This is always the biggest insult to TMNT. Luckily, officially Venus Canon is not in TMNT. A female turtle will never exist, and it is away from the tragic story of the 4th single unique mutant that does not have their own family. The biggest mistake crosses the TMNT over Power Rangers with a terrible piece; The turtle's voices are incorrect and they all starred from the character. They were able to do such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO venezons. <br /> Do not bother with these people ... it's a terrifying substance. The lip flap looks slow and unnatural. They are completely disrespected shredder. The main buddy, some of them draggarded tasteless. Turtles looked wheat with their body hanging, what's around the thigh's thigh? Plucked carnations! <br /> If they appear, they are cast in the role and left Venus, stupid kiddie cartoon sounds are gone ... good writing may be good.
