We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to record the end. After this ended, I saw my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He said. He shook his head no. I said, "So you looked at the end of the film and what happened to me did not happen". <br /> <br /> The cinema body is very good. There is a lot of suspense. It kept you wondering. Then came the end. The end ... well ended. You did not allow what was happening or why. The credits happen right up to what I kept thinking up, but it never happened. So I expect someone to come here and I do not care. Nope. <br /> <br /> Here four years later, I'm clueless as Tom Sayer. <br /> What did I do? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not waste any $ $ to buy because I'm absolutely mad. <br /> <br /> I understand! The end of the movie has disappeared! ROFL
