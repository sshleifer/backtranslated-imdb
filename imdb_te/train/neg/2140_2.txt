Assassin Hauser (John Cusack) is to dismiss the Mission Mid-East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Nakov), which takes place in the country of the Turks, which runs American interests. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a sarcasm can be very annoying, it can be very annoying. Here too much: government, politics, music, war, people are not generally accepted by society and I mention the "war". And, what we have here - the boundaries on a very bad nightmare is bringing life to a very annoying film. I'm still asking why I continue with the DVD. And do not you think that many of the Cusack family members are here or that I'm just a problem for the family of John Cusack? <br /> <br /> It's John Cusack's film, offbeat, and finally, rather good. Not here. It is believed that John Cusack wrote the hand and created this confusion. <br /> <br /> Do you continually shoot guns, bomb attacks, and shout out that you can not really focus or move on the motion with the move? Maybe. It will take a long time to fix the most forgotten hit until the last 15 minutes. At this time we have a meaningful ban on all of the cast. And, is the chemistry between John Cusack and Maurice Tormi? I think so, but you know: boy? Girl thing ???? And they need something to take longer. <br /> Yes, they're good, Duff's performances, (Kingsley and Dabins) are good. But when I saw the character of Don Ayikeyard at the beginning of the show, I knew that sitting on a toilet taking a tamp, the rest of the show would go to the tank. I'm not wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I will sing the praises of this endeavor, but it's very confusing, though pink and pink with any other name. <br /> Remember why I continued with the DVD. I have overcome some of that story and I want to save myself. <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Lead: No Language: Yes.
