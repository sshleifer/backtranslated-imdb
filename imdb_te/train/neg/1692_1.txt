Well, if you see the ring, you will see The Grudge mainly. It's just trying to be scary to have freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it has failed miserably. The plot, if you call it, is weak and unlike holes, for example, how did the Care Center know how Yoko did not show up when the people were not living there? And it is not clear what to do with Bill Pullman's role. He just came out of the plot somewhere ahead of the plot. It will tell you what happened to the original family. Who's hanging in the room, a little boy or a father? And where did her care center guy find her when Yoko is alive or dead? I have a lot of unanswered questions and I think so much about it.
