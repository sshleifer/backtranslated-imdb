The blast of TV channels Randolph should be thankful for the Western production of Scotland, for which one moment must be at least one of the hundreds of Randolph Scott films at a budget station. "Gun Behind the Gun" is a playback of the early 1950s, with WWII production values ​​based on a historically-topical murder mystery plot, a complete failure of character development, and lack of suspense. The role of these films should be made through TV programs about 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza' etc. in the years to come. Randolph Scott is specially seen in this regard, a good man, who is fighting against bad guys against whom he finally succeeds. If you do not think that the ultimate misunderstanding of the female underworld will come out, he goes emotionally than how his horse feels. Music indicates the emotional state of 'characters' than this acting. It's fine if your boat floats; <br /> <br /> The maid, the pedestrian, and the aging rapidly. 3 stars to compete together; For artistic endeavor 0.
