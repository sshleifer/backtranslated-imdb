When I was released in the movie theater, I saw a child and it was very bad, it became the serene of a family joke. If the ranking is zero, this movie will get it. Dinosaurs are awful. The storyline is ridiculous. Acting is not really worth acting. The only reason I remember the movie name is because my family is still talking about how really bad.
