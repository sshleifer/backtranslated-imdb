The film is about a police (Ching van Lou) trying to catch a super-intelligent thief (Ekin Cheng) who is blackmailing the insurance company headed by Kelly Lynn. Initially, they knew beforehand whether they would try a police thief. This film covering the beautiful main actors, beautiful main actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes is really ingredient at all. It all flash, and flash becomes dull quickly. For the third part of the film I lost all the interests, except for cinematography and none has been released again. If you want to make it free, you will only see this movie. Furthermore, taking into account the retention of the movie for 20 minutes, it will eventually be the same: BORING. 6/10
