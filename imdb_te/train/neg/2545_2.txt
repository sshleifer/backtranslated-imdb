There are laughs in this movie, it is perfect. Michael Keaton is a talent and he uses funny (before he decides to be a serious actor). However, it's very difficult for me to see the film, practically all the characters are rare. Unlike the main two leads, everyone has a jerk. I mean, losing this small town is about uncouth as you can get. You should look and think, man, this loser must be unemployed. In addition, the American factory worker was dazzled and ungrateful slab. I'm surprised if the film is made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together in one, but I do not enjoy the trip to get there.
