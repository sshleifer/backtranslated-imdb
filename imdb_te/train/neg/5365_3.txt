"Private Practice" spun from the most successful and well-written "Anatomy of Gray". The cast is amazing. The campus may also work. <br /> <br /> The pilot was my first warning as an anatomy of Grace's disastrous episode. The plot is just blah. I thought it was a big mistake. <br /> I've set the DVR when I look at the pilot. <br /> When I look at the pilot, I'm surprised how to cast an actor with a boring pilot with such a cast. Pilot people need to be able to suck and keep them coming back. The cliffhanger is the excitement of the rest of the season, the flash, the great writing, the secret storyline. Surprisingly, there is no one in this show. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good fortune, and I thought the second part was better. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pass this one.
