This remake remake is terrible. I went to see this tonight .. On the first day and the hype is so much more to handle me. But in the first half of the day we know this is a disaster. It was not created by the hype but also insulted the original blockbuster. This script contains loopholes, editing is very small. Mohan Lal Oke, a magnificent actor, has done a job. Amitabh is very good, but the director has portrayed him as badly but he went with the overboard. This kind of characters are especially frustrated by Ajay. The new person can not even begin to talk about Prasanthi .. It is not proud to start a career with such a life. Rajpal Yadav was unable to laugh at anyone because of his smile and dark voice for a few laughs. Nisha Kothari has proven that we are one of the worst actresses today. Overall, I think one of the most talented and well-known directors in India, RGV, has failed miserably. He has taken such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake the film which is known as the best Hindi film and created confusion.
