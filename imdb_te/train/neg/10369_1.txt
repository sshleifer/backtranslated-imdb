As a writer I found pictures, it was bad, but it was full of face in the face. Talk about insulting. I'm writing stories better than the 8th class. Bad performance, bad writing, bad direction, and everything else is complete and total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be achieved with this movie is to make the unsuspecting customer waste their time. Who makes the green light something poorly written? It's not art, intelligent, intelligent, curious, mysterious, horrific, dramatic. <br /> <br /> The characters are flat and boring without development. This plot will be recycled in aluminum mode. They managed to cast a few well-known actors to either be pretty desperate for work or to expect one of these low-budget independent movies to become the next "Pulp Fiction". This script is not a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and last but not, a 5'2 105 lb feminist fight is the strength to kill both men and women both in her fight and without a single blow. <br /> <br /> Stop this bomb, which will harm you with STD.
