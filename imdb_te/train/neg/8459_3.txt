A story with some very interesting camera work and probability. <br /> <br /> It is not more than student graduate thesis in film school. <br /> There are two main reasons for this. The fist does not have a preferred character, even the villain we might admire for his / her chutzpah. Secondly, all acting is awful - even from the famous Willem DaFoe. The ham is very enormous here, you feel you're on a picnic - but one of the damaged company's picnics is where you can drink a little cheaper beer and get your hangover before stopping to drink. <br /> You can just go on a young director. As I said, the camera work is great. But I feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests that we can see a "modern western", and there are images on which DVD packaging suggests this - but no one actually knows the movie's connecting with the movie they're making. <br /> The betrayal hurts; But without it, we can not like these characters, the actors will suffer, the story is treacherous and we do not care about the past analysis. <br /> <br /> I've taken a half way out of the DVD player. <br /> Now, it really hurts.
