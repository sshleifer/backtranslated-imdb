Below there was a bit of a spoiler, this film could ruin the surprise of an unexpected and really funny scene. <br /> <br /> I took this movie on DVD, which gave me a gift for my roommate. <br /> <br /> It began as a set with the first film in the "Blind Dead" series. <br /> <br /> The film is far worse than the "La Noche del Terror Siergo". In addition, several features of the first image have changed substantially. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the story is the local branch of the Knights Templar in the distant past, participating in the vicious and secret rites. Local farmers who have learned about these crimes can not use their eyes anymore to prevent their retaliation from hell. When we spent some time, some anecdotes had been confused for the first time since the Templars had died. <br /> <br /> The ultimate knights do not have eyes and they can only see their victims when they are sounding. <br /> <br /> The Templars are secret from the 12th century, Crusades. They were only 150 years before Pope and others were suppressed in the early 1300s. As they are secret, there are always rumors about their programs, especially the initiation. Also, because of the way society has been established, you do not need to supervise church officials, so they are not even inner man, but they are deeply affected. And, due to their nature of temptation, they will agree. <br /> <br /> The first movie is a horror movie after all, of course, this is a horror movie, where all the drunken blood and blood of the virgin (and where is the breast shots) drunk blood from the body of the virgin, Their victims attack by eating them and sucking their blood; In this sequel, all of this disappears. You still have the same sequence (not the same footage), they sacrifice the virgin, but they must pour the blood into a bowl and drink it. Therefore, when they come back, they hack their swords or claws to death, what I say will disturb your audience. There is also a problem problem: dating in the first movie is very close to the Templars, where they are now around the 1470s, the 500 anniversary of hunting these relatives at the festival. It is very interesting that the Templars will lose their eyes. Initially, they took them out of the crows. <br /> <br /> "Oh Oh, and it's just me, but there's a lot of people from the first movie that appears again in this movie" ). <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the great man in the movie, he should focus on the child's death while taking a break for the jeep. The child's father has already tried to get this wealthy jeep, so he goes out and tells him to recognize his father. It gets somewhat blue, and the funniest scene in the picture is easy. <br /> <br /> At this time, the child died and was disappointed for the horror fans if he did not die. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this picture to anyone. It's not so bad it turns out to be funny, so it just ends up being a horror movie. Most people in the movie are beautiful in the church, each attempting to escape the dead people around them. The movie ends, you do not have to surprise the result at all; In fact, very disappointing. If you are seeing a Spanish horror movie, see the first movie, which is at least some innovative ideas and unexpected results.
