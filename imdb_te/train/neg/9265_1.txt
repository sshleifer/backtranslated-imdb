I heard and enjoyed Harvey Bernhardt's Woman II commentary, and I was surprised to see that he was behind this absolutely rubbish side. It's like a really bad TV movie you glimpse in the middle of the day when you are flu and when you reach the remote is very ill. I hung at the open in my mouth infidelity that Michael Lerner thinks at the bit I confronts what I only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables. I'm very laughing because my mouth climbed up. Tyr. I do not know why I write at least ten lines, I made my point brief, there is no intelligence about this modern speech.
