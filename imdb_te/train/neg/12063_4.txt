Benny Fields and Blossom Sealy's husband and wife are big stars in Voddleville, and they have made very few movies. Other artists such as their period (George M. Cohen, Fanny Bryce, Gertrude Lawrence) have also been shot by other actors for other films related to Fields and Seale. Betty Hutton's 'Somebody Love Me', and the inappropriate song and dance man Ralph Micker. Their ancestors, fields and seal are very popular - Jesse Black and Eve Sullie - another husband and wife Wadeville Act - almost all of the same action, effectively "second-team" fields and seal. But Stategate is a big difference in couples' living arrangements. Fields and Saille lived in hotel suites, paying room-service rates for each meal they ate, and eventually did not get out of money. Black and Sully lived uninterruptedly and invested their revenue intelligently, comfortably ended in retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of the Vitaphone shorts were occupied by two spades-dressed pianists. Apparently these two men had their short name in the 1930s, but I never heard of them. Finally, start Fields and Seal Rush and Showcase. <br /> <br /> I was angry that the two performers would make movements as they were going into the dance, but they would make three songs in this short song for up to the third. <br /> When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this opportunity to see these two major artists promising them. Now I see, I understand why they never go back to movie musicals. My rating for this: Only 10 to 4, I'll stick with black and sullies.
