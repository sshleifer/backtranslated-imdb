I do not like to comment on a good image but when it comes to bad film, I really worked a lot. Speaking about Viva, this man seems to have lost the entire Suraj Badjataya. Following the success of Hum Aapke Hain Koun, he thought he could make money with cheesy wedding videos. <br /> <br /> " I do not have a single moment in the film. At least this thing is good '. Aloknath plays the role of Shahid Kapoor's son and Shahrukh in the role of a father of a girl, Amrita Rao is looking at the wrong sets, bad clothes, hacked storyline, the most prodigal mother, hard-working actors and cocaine background music <br /> Now spoiler, I warn you when a harmful event happened in the movie Happy note.
