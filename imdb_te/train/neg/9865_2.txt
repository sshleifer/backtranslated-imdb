I picked up this film in the hope that it will be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended by the way). Boy, no disappointment! The film was filmed in this fake documentary style, but it failed. This is partially hard acting but mostly written and directed. True, it is fun to use every player's cliche, it's about playing the characters, but here it becomes very predictable. At the beginning of each scenario already know what you know about "joke". But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is filmed on top. If the movie does not have much difference with the "sensitive smiles" or the low 80-style duplicate-laugh track, there is no sensitivity in the film. Some scenes can not help you to think, "Yeah, I thought this would be funny" but the way it was implemented would take all the speed from the possible joke.
