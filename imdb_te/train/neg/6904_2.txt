It seems to me as a recent film school graduate at this time, when New Zealand film reached new times, as every New Zealand film was public opinion. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely overrated and funny, and has been commented by other users of IMDb's film, which is a 'hilarious'. <br /> <br /> The only really funny thing I found in the film is Derek the Vann√®b black man, but the rest of us Recycled worse is the worst. <br /> <br /> Half Samoan wanted to see how the film would be handled with Polynesian representation. It's full balls - I know this is a comedy assumption, but I do not think there are any new characters to say about Polish identity, I'm in tears in the tongue. I was disappointed with the conclusion of the cinema and the relationship of the character - Mickey, who was only confused with white females, whispered in his ways when the 'Dusky Maiden' came into town, and an epiphany would probably start searching for a steady relationship, then at the last minute he refused and Polynesian playboy for women Accept the location on. <br /> They are more frustrating than anything. I went to see that my whole family had a good laugh, but it was really bitter about paying to see it in the movie. The jokes are fine, acting, especially the sexy girlfriend, the apostle, and honestly if I got my hands on one of the picture's pirated copies to save the ticket price of $ 15. /> <br /> The good thing I have to do with the film is the second stage (behind No. 2, a very high picture for the film) born in the Polynesian film. I find that future Pacific filmmakers do not reflect Polynesia from Sanyus's wedding and have something more meaningful and clever to say. Even if it happens in a funny fashion.
