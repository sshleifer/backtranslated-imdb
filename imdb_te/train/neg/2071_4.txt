There are two reasons why I see this swashbuckler on Danish television today. First of all, I want to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I'm not disappointed. She looked beautiful. Secondly, I thought I would not have found it in Philippe di Brocca's films for reading on the film, but having a lack of humor. But in this account I was disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (unlike some witty comments on the topic of war) and the characters were completely dimensional. In addition, the action scenes are carried out in a fantastically mechanical and enthusiastic manner, there is no understanding of the play. I kept watching until the end, but I got bored very quickly and sat there and waited for Lollobrigida scenes.
