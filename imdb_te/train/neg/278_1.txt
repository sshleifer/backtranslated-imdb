I'm trying to paint the pitch for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of madrix, I'm thinking of bladder, I'm confident in blasphemy and I'll do it without the shiny black leather, dialogue, character, good action or budget, little black leather and big chicks that drive a shiny black leather biker. Fanboy's Big Throwing Shining with bright black leather in bikes, <br /> Fl Sense is an act of direct action, or indeed a life without any action. SF Joy Fanboy is just like this.
