"Hey everybody! I got an idea, we found out the egg shaped thing from the outer space, did we just clear it and open it?" "Yes, I know a scientist's downtime, and it can contaminate bacteria or viruses that do not land and can effectively wipe out the human race, but hey, I want to know what's going on." "And no one says NASA, they will take away from us". "Wow this is going to turn off the vibes!" "Yes, do not touch the ones that are really strong in the contact, but it's OK to cut open". "Beautiful beautiful there, check my nips". (After that day); "Do not open" !!!!! Oh, we have to run all the way up to the lab and tell them not to open them because we have phones or radios or intercoms because we have a gazillion dollars worth other devices here. "I have never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, let's take this stick and cut it off." "I'm not out of here, if I kill 6 billion people on earth, I'm naked!" See, it's friendly aliens from "Abyss"! They want us to come with them. "
