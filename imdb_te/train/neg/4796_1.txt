He likes John Saxa whatsoever. At one point he took the camera, but he directed a movie, "Please watch this movie: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 dollar shock insurance certificate is crazy of the beloved Olen Ray, you spend $ 14 on the dump filmed by the $ 70 cheese legend. Ray is a former man in retrovirism. Charles Band is hotter than a stove in a Ford Falcon by Ray. Now they are both bad and bad, both boring and boring. This is dying of old things, and in some cases it is a public domain like dollar video hackers, but in the case of Zombie Death House ("zombie" sloppily for ownership and interest in the episode) this route is the only way to serve service in the dollar market for wealthy collectors and sunfone fans It is released! If you want to see real Saxon, take Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glow.
