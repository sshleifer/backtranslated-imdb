I've always liked Fred McMurray, and I think it's fun watching Carroll Lombard even though her career is sadly small. Together with these two main and attractive stars, Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, add them to the top supporting players as a romantic script, the leading director Mitchell Leisen team and you get an average picture experience. <br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carol) "meet everyone" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and fall in love for the next few weeks. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a music career, which is an imaginative material in both its growth and fall. During his climb on the musical instrument, he neglected Maggie, and then he started to begin after he hit the bottom of the rock. <br /> <br /> The director of the Stars and the caliber of this caliber must give assurance to the success, but at times it is very imaginative and slow. As they appear to have seen the earliest sequences in Panama, then a sparkling skirt hangs off in New York. Fred and Carroll try their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W direction just do not give them a chance. Maggie is also not true in the final scene that encourages skid from the gray of alcohol and despair. <br /> <br /> This movie will see some early shows from the Stars mock Marri and Lombard. However, I'm assured that I will take 48 hours.
