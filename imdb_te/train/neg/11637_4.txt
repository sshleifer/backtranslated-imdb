Wow boll is impossible: create a game adaptation that is somewhat truthful to the game; He has turned a game full of anti-social and objectionable content into a film filled with solidarity and objectionable content. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Uwe Boll still maintained here, so do not expect this movie to be good. <br /> It will be very relieved to his moment. </ p> <p> <p> The year is the youngest child. The boll appears to be expected to be in unequal proportion to the humorous value: more apocalyptic, ridiculous, and more ridiculous. It appears in a film that is building a new, unmodified new level when it is hit and missed. Yes, some dresses work but it's a good luck. The director is sarcastically portrayed by people, and trucks and other vehicles are hit by a lot of violence. <br /> <br /> When wearing off the initial surprise, the postage is just a bore. Yes, ten minutes of good are ten minutes, but everything else has groups of uncomfortable characters and each one feels eternal. Acting as a small film, but it lasts longer than 90 minutes (although it is twice as long). Nice ideas and nice efforts are there, but they are hopelessly lost and endless action sequences and content that is offensive for it is hopelessly lost 4/10
