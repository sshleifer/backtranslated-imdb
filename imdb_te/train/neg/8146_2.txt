11/7/2002 - 2 to 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in Brooklyn, a lot of four-word words and wants to kill people. The only thing that's interesting is the attempt to show feeds like a gang. This film is the only effort making good. The rest of the film is speculative, and cheaply made. The quality of the photography of some scenes within the bars and floozy joints is because of the bad thing that your DVD player is having trouble and some of the actors are hard to hear because of bad sound times. All of your favorite gangsters are pretty much a lot of radiation from improvised paintings, and the plots are pretty much followed by those patterns, like Winnie 'Knuckles' and Jimmy` Tattoos. So, go see a good gangster image before you put your money for this.
