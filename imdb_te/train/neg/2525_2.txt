The film, Homer Simpson, called it "more boring than the church". Perhaps I can not understand it well, and I thought it was very good, but Hermann Braun was sent to jail and Maria began working with her boss / slumber, just pull it to stay awake. Again, maybe it would suggest something, but at the end the explosion seemed too forced and out of place. (The end of the spoiler). Finally, I can not see why others feel so great, and I find it very boring. By the way, I did not see this film as my own free will, because I had to look for the film class.
