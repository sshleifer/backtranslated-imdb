Movie: IMDb There are many interesting comments about this movie. Its really awful. The film and Spike Lee are not expensive enough to make money, it looks like a mix of indie and an action movie. Characters / Actors: Denzel made "correctly" what he was doing in every movie, there was no surprise. Here is a little mind game for readers. Think of 10 Dengel films quickly. Now he has any police / detective / body guard played by any number, anyway. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a good role on his plate right away. His best performance was "Beyond Borders". Unlike him, he did pretty much the same thing. His tone and speech is equivalent to what he did in "Sin City". Surely this person knows acting, choosing what roles he does not know is a good way. He needs the desperation of a good agent. If you look at her for the first time in your life, Jodie Foster is very intelligent in the film. She did well. She did good roles. It takes place in Hollywood, with the largest stars falling on their knees, and Jody Foster chooses lower class roles as made in the film. Plot: The plot is not confusing, in fact, while dumping after a pretty big Chinese dinner I actually think of the whole story. I mean, **** WAY ON SPOILER ----> I am sick of un-needed Haulocast and racism token. About the movie bank robbers, why put Haulocast and Racism there, people work for anyone, try to play with emotions? I'm not. Police bank robbers let them go thinking of the hostages? Riiiiiight, please, here is talking about American police and security. Nobody can find out where Clive is, and I can not find different things in that room. Who are we funny? Conclusion: Definitely, let's see this movie, if nothing else, you will have a good time with how bad you are talking to the film. You do not think at least that stupid to watch this movie because they think they have gone to see it because they have a big movie cast "Mistake".
