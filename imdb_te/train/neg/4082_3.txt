The film is just painful ... in the dramatic conditions the emotions of the well-developed characters are not in a dramatic way as you fear (yes, I finally went along with the last sentence), but only for a couple of hours. Now, I think you're some unaware reviewer who does not have any respect for all Shakespeare or "Artistic Manufacturing" ... well, you'd be wrong on both sides. I love Shakespeare's writings, especially Romio and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet and I have seen the surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2 "Arthouse" images. But it's lost in over two hours Shakespeare, WAY too nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not every movie in every film! Nothing to the story!), And basically just entertaining film-making. The film has a number of expectations, which is "very artistic" and is said to be a simulator of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but it's just too depressing. Since I have featured movies as films with a lot of movies, the film has only three songs because of Sir John Gielgood's acting existence (exceeding all the names in the film) and the cinematography / set design combination ... However, the film has a Painting will be better. A real disappointment ... If the director gave a chair to Jephyrely, it's very good. But this is a viewer's opinion, many others are much more enjoying than I am. If it does not find any nearby video stores (which is not currently on the DVD), do not try to go far away from your way to find it ... it's not really worth it.
