Betty Davis made a brilliant work like Mildred, and I thought it was not the best film I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> Betty Davis did a perfect job, and she hated me and forgot her. Leslie Howard lover is very good as Philip Carey, and I am forgiven him throughout this film because I am in love with such a terrible dame. This is a sad thing when one finds him / her in love with a bad seed. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone like Philip Carey, who was curious, was particularly curious. The ending scene is very good, but I can not give up. Although others have found this movie better, I have found the person I have ever found. I would like to recommend this film to those who love bad seed. So if you fall in love with that terrible person, you can see what happens to them.
