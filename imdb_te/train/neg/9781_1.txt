I do not think it's too far to be the worst thing I have ever seen. I'm working on my favorite fighter films: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on River Quay," (all black and white) good plot, great characters and great acting. I saw a good conversation and acted in one of the acting plays in a student-written high school. The plot, though not the bad mantle - just run less. It's kind of like a traffic accident, however, I could not seem to stop it! "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifebot" is a good thing if an image does not require big money or great sets ... so the budget is not needed. What are they thinking?
