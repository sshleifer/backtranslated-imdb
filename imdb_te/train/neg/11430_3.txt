Well, here's a new word for me: polyushoomy: fear of polygamy relationships. This is one of the many movies that started by telling the audience about the same type of movie, which is just about one dime and what it's all about and requires a monologic solution to go preachy all about moral matters. Only one person in a thousand understands the happiness that loves more than one person, and this director is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Find my words: For decades now, polyphobia is playing giant, like homosexuality. Perfectly for the first time: the filmmakers. And much like that. Why such ridiculous conservative and old-fashioned films? Depending on the existence of enormous open-mindedness about homosexuals, it completely ignores the fact that we live in an age that is constantly changing monogamy, which is swinging and polygamy. <br /> <br /> It's a frustrating, run-of-milk chic-flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
