Painted by some authentic color and the average act of saving numbers - and a few moments that are amazing and deeper. <br /> <br /> The illness of a good film in this film is a target and is extremely severely imprisoned. Religious strife, controversy over road construction project, sex life of secondary and tertiary characters, a secret man living in forests, a group of racist hooligans, at least three different hierarchies, implications in local church politics, and on and on. And there is also the original central plot, which is not only about two girls (and their entire families) hopes, dreams, and despair at the turn of all their lives. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is dramatic, the point is speculative, the main life changes happen and then about 10 minutes after the forgotten about .. And some of those events are quite irrelevant. The truth is that the most frightening characters are involved in a horrific crime (totally predictable "twist") and then completely forgiven and forgetful of the entire incident. Likewise, the second was introduced only to die after a couple minutes and to provide another "twist". It's all fully mechanical, right up to the end that connects all the bizarre ends (well not all of them, just the ones you think you care about).
