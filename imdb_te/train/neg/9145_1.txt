Let me tell you first time to enjoy watching "bad" films. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than really amazing ones. This film is bad in the threatening harmful way. This vehicle lacks the boundless inconsistency of Sam Marwick's hallucinating ego, which redefined the meaning of the words. It should never be a barometer for bad movies. Sort of Mendoza line for image. Miravich writes and directs, and Arthur Sails struggles with distracting wives as unrealistic and because he and his partner are fighting for the equality of marriage "Ben's eyes are dead". I believe that homosexuals have the right to marry homosexuals. Ben and Arthur have more harm than the homosexual army. The role of all things Christian is very ugly and ham-fist, trademark melavich, you probably can not take any seriously. Arthur's brother Viktor, Jesus Spit Bible, is over-the-top-of-the-top evil / burial gay that you wonder over how he is cast in this role. Sam "Multitasking" Morakote is also a cast director. This is the worst Marmovich himself. When you recall the words of the famous person's words, Blob, and Chubby, Sam also offers Domino's Pizza, cool and generally wrong ways. Final Lal: You suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. It is a quadrant of Ed Wood fourteen. Congratulations to the terrible little man.
