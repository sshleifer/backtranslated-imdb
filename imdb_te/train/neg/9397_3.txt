A few years ago I saw several episodes of RMFTM as a teenager in "Cliffhanger Theater" a few weeks ago at a local station, and then killed it in the early 90s of the Mystery Science Theater. Time is not kindness. <br /> <br /> I can make permissions for the most impressive special effects of low budget 50 serial (IMO Commando's Flying Flows George Reeves / Superman are better than their TV show). And I can also make permissions for haha, "acting", and fighting choreography -. Except the man who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He is very bad. He looks like a man who comes to fix your plumbing and is not an absolutist ruler of an alien race. Even the corny dialogue works all right - everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers, with no impaired time or pauses of things like "thought" or "introspection". Since everyone has done this, the director will be enthralled after a few days, and it is not very sad for my modern sensitivities. <br /> <br /> I am really frustrated with the writing and the plot. I'm not talking about a flying suit on the moon, or a flying suit with baking soda-based rocket ships or "up / down" and "fast / slow" label controls. I'm not even bothered by the cheese of resolutions to cliffhangers that end each chapter. I think our leaders are dumbers than fence posts and have cumulative memory. And even dialogue clips like an express train, the plot is going through the same moves again and again. <br /> It's Dig: Commando hen and his friend is a secret secret of protecting the land (or at least America) against an artificial extraterrestrial invasion of the High Tech Technology Lab. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even locks the front doors. So bad guys walk and Cody and his crew beat the worst out ... once (probably understandable) but different times. They abducted his female assistant in the second attempt. And they do not get any knowledge. To prove my point even more, allow me to point out that the chicken jumps in his flying suit and the way it never seems to succeed in catching flies and catching anyone around getting into trouble. He does this over and over and over. The chicken also flies his ship to the moon (the female assistant will bow), and it lasts for about 30 seconds and is immediately revolving and coming back. The yoke binds one of the Atomic Ray guns ... and he immediately loses it to the wicked, because he can not lock it. <br /> <br /> And if you are the chicken's efforts to protect America from the moon's men, the carbines, some helicopters, and the tank or both have been pulled back to the local police instead of working with the local police. It was considered military operation, but it was another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to stomach. I appreciate that the creators budget and time constraints are seriously restricted in their story range ... and I appreciate a reasonably harder homer of chicken actually (even though he loses half of his fistfights). But I'm "Door! WLOCK Lock" !! Gangsters just walk into his laboratory, or try to blow up the ship and there are NO security measures at the landing site at place ... even a fence (!). <br /> Still, it's OK. In the three Republic Serials I've seen, "Phantom Creeps" has a good plot and "Andersy Kingdom" has a much better hero than more atmosphere (h!) And "radar men", but it's ok with time. <br /> BTW ... why "radar" men? They did not use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Title "Atomic Ray Gun Men from the Moon?"
