Kid (Prince), a singer, wants to become a star by the story of the numbers on his way. He falls in love with Apollonia (Apostérica Cótero). <br /> <br /> I saw a 1984 in a theater. I'm not a big fan of Prince, but he's dealing with his wife's father (Clarence Williams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. I loved three big songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy", and "Droves Cry". The concert scenes in the film are great - filled with energy and enthusiasm. Unfortunately it is a very small part of the movie. </ P> <p> This story is rarely clear and has happened many times - and much better. The subplots are, well kept, badly handled. The love triangle between Kid, Apollonia and Morris Delay is very speculative and tired, I was actually insulted. The father who is playing his wife is needed for the story, but the scenes are so serious (acting and direction) I can not believe. The script is terrible - lousy conversation and some really painful "comedy" routines. Here are the other tones - Kid's mother was beaten; Kid is going to hit Apollonia and (for no reason) goes to the Apollonia strips and a swim in the river. As well as the characters of Williams and Princess are constantly in dire straits for women. <br /> <br /> This film is really a failure. Appollia is sweet and beautiful - but not the actor. And Prince (easy) is the worst actor I have ever seen. His empty face and wood dialog delivery is very bad, I can not believe it. Concerto scenes This movie only comes to life but there are not really many people. The "dramatic" scenes act well and keep the movie in place. They just made a concert film. I'll give this music 2-only.
