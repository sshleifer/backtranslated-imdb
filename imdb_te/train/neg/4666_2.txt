<br /> <br /> In this film, Japanese women sink into the skulls on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely hideous. I can not see any "sensitive" or "romantic" references. The plot converts an old art form into a fetish of pornography. Additionally, scenes filmed in Hong Kong have certainly shot bad parts of Hong Kong, the airport in the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the entire film, I'm thinking of "pillow book" that insults Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "Pillow Book" is a distorted, boring image. Stay away from it seriously.
