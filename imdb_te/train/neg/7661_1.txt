The title of the worst title of all time is one that is quickly and frequently presented. For a long time the truth is exaggerated but I'm welcome in the Alone in the Alone in the list of original candidates: Plan 9 from the Outer Space, Battlefield Land and Pluto Nash 9 <br I found that 90 minutes bore even harder to see when I was trying hard to laugh in the movie . But I'm alone in the dark (I tried to escape tax but I could not resist) as I hoped to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. <br /> You have to give a comedy about this film. Talk about the reaction and effects of being the only positive image of the film. In the film Aliens have Xenos (they call them Xenos), and the evil creatures that are cross between creatures in the pitch block. Can be seen randomly (and I assure you that it is random) and can be wounded by light. Today, the little stables creatures used to control humans to change something like a zombie. All of these were shown in older 1997 songs that were average in 1997. Action scenes are haphazard and impossible to follow. People set the space at random shooting on a blue screen stage or embedded in the post. <br /> <br /> After dark music is dark on the dark screen when it masks in music. <br /> Those high points. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (slater), which is a black-eyed beater shirt with a trench with a trench and is not shaved for 2 days. Not a single archaeologist (read) And a government agent (Dorf) has to sort its lines. Three people are shy in their performances (they really do not always have a good job) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reed and Slater are considered lovers in the movie I expect. <br /> <br /> In the film I had seen between the two films, I had the same awkward romance scene. The components that are silently silent are not interesting. The rest are the best. The plot holes have three star eagos. The voice begins with explaining the text and the back story. This start will last a minute and the viewer already knows for something terrible. After the initial narrative, it was repeated in the awkward dialogue with the rest of the film in a very clumsy and heavily handy fashion film. And the end is not a sense. <br /> <br /> In this film, not only is the understanding of the world, but it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally the direction of Woo boll. Insulting, everything is said. His use of shaking camera to mimic suspense. His directing with actors. Just watch the read in the sights which can not focus on the center of the shot. Special effects for bullet time effects are completely waste of money. <br /> <br /> Finally, choosing to use voice over to describe something to have a painful response to the audience. <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to watch this show at the second show theater. And if I and my friends laughed, it was worth every quarter, and I advise people not to avoid any payments for this film. <br /> <br /> Hold 3 friends and break the rental cost and cut the film freshly. <br /> <br /> Boolean on your side. Tara Reed is disgraceful. You are disgrace on the Christian slaughter. You insult Stephen Dorf. It's insulting to anyone involved with this film.
