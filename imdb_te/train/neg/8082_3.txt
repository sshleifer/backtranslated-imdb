It was one night late at night "it was" I saw things. Sometimes they are great. This is an awful, but it can not really be. <br /> <br /> There are good actors in this movie. How do you fail when you have Charleston Heston and Jack Pallons? We're talking about Oscar winning turf here. It has good special effects. It also has some really good tits! And I mean nicely done full breast with full breath and a few fur at a time. A story - but it does not replace it for a missing substance! The plot is ridiculous. The "solar crisis" is not a sun explosive substance, but it is not so bad. Oh so stupid and totally imaginative evil corporation stuff - it's the remaining items. Just a damn man! <br /> <br /> I saw that the cast was good. I saw wonderful science fiction movies. All the differences are in the writing.
