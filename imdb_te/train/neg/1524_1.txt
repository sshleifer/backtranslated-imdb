Words have failed me. It's very hard to see this film and I really wish I did not really do it backwards. Even though I tried to sit up to the last credits, I had to admit that I would not be longer than an hour, so my opinion would be unfair. However, if this is to give a review, the film should be the last of the most influential third of film history. <br /> <br /> Please do not check any part of the picture.
