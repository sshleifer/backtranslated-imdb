On every Christmas I will give my children another presentation of a wonderful life. I also enjoyed Bad Santa completely. So ask me. I agree. I like cheesy and sculmys movies. I like a lot of amazing, intelligent ones, but like many things, the good thing is different. Billy Bob Thornton from Edmund Glenn has all the gestures to Santa's annual film K-ching ka-chilting without Christmas season? Fred Class makes no one forget the Bedford Waterfall, but I do not believe that a Christmas film should exactly reach the iconic stature. "Fred" is perfectly OK holiday movie, adequate humor and admiration for children. Humor is very clear and my wife and I laughed too much while Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamitti is a top-notch Santa, which has helped a lot. A great picture, and whose annual Christmas traditions are not likely to be viewed. But my wife and daughter I enjoyed it, vacation schmaltz spicy small dash. There is nothing wrong with that.
