No awesome movie! Idea of ​​struggling robots with each other is good, but the storyline is ludicrous, the real human action is ridiculous, having unmatched and special effects (this kind of film must be based on). I thought I should be made around '80s' '84 and since 1990 I was surprised to see it. It's 5 years after Aliens! Well, many people say that they have taken a lower budget, but what is 'the point?' I think. It looks completely unreliable. I do not care to see a remake with modern special effects and a fully rewritten story. Because I still love the idea of ​​scrapping huge robots.
