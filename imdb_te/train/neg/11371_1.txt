"Documentary", and we clearly apparently use the term, suggesting that Muslims are trying to take violent worldwide. Then the Muslims who have accepted will not know their faith or lie to your face! Everyone who interviewed in the film has found a market for their ridiculous reality, selling a split to the conservatives who are ready to inform others about their idea. Needless to know Western countries is that this is no more than a campaign aimed at mental midgets. Are you looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East? Try to provide multiple points view from eligible sources.
