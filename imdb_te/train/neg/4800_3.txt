If you create a genre in the 80s, you're basically 50/50 likely to be under water or in jail (unfortunately, we have no underwater jail image). Mafia's owner Martita (Anthony Franciosa), was driven by the murder of Derek Keiller (Dennis Cole), along with Moby's brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.), and ends with the death penalty. But Derek's problems, as the rogue government agent (and Mob Stooly) Colonel Burgess (directing John Saxon), was used as a test for new government officials. This is the only film directed by Saxon in his storyline career. For a man who worked for tons of directors, he looks only the ones he can choose any tips from the cheapest-o Italian ones. Sure, it's low budget, but can not forgive stilted display, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes. With his credit, Saxon makes it a little crystalline and he works in a hilarious naked scenery (our principle sleeps during a jail riot only to fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks more like a more rigid Jan-Michael Vincent, is as good as the main and francioe - a bad rugs player - presents him as all clutch mob boss. The end of Marty McKee's favorite place is at Branson Canyon. Retromedia released on this DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
