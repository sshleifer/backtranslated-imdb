After watching other comments on IMDb, I saw this movie, which convinced my wife that it was a single horror movie. <br /> <br /> "Love story" is good, but the horror factor is very bad. If the story is a young man who fell in love with a parasymptic girl, it was a good film. <br /> <br /> If the defensive center crosses the limits, it is very ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores the privacy laws and career. A nurse goes to a room for a casual lunch (without a safety escort), and the tray drops and screams for the obvious reason goes out of the room. Forensic patient (and film villain) dressed up in a standing position - obviously years? <br /> <br /> The film also has some actors I liked in other things like detectives, but I can not recommend this movie yet.
