Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales seems to be forgetting one of those guys from the past. I thought his appearance was all great. It is the guilty owner of an imaginary character, the most predictable results. If you crash the car and routinely extend the test, there is not much plot development or action. Mafia movies are dull because I do not have respect or interest towards common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, heroes treated these heroes. I saw the movie and I do not remember much about it in a few days. Most of the shooting, innocent audience dying, betrayal, and obedience to that illness. The film is pretty well made and acting is good. But dubbing was very bad (because of not being able to come out of those items), I started looking for a bottle of Godzilla that almost approached.
