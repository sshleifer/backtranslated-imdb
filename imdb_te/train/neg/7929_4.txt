I guess it could be interesting if you were into sci-fi and horror stuff. Acting is good but not great. Two pregnant women have fifteen, but at that time played with twenty-one older actresses. The plot is okay, but the story will jump around a bit, leaving you guessing you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use vertical speed between the two. The Catholic Church was depicted as a secret secret branch to investigate the events faced by this belief. If two girls are protesting? Carried Catholics? So what some contrived. Who knows, maybe even a Catholic church can learn what the Bible teaches. If you do not lose it, you do not want to miss anything.
