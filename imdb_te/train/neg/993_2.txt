I'm going to write about this movie and about "inappropriate" (it's a famous scene). So you have warned you not to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Clever in acting, Rosario Dawson is a good man and portraits a young man nearly a decade (the other is the young man). The villain is good, but eventually loses his "bad" touch. If he never really changed, then why should a woman tie him up? He is not, as long. Then we also have the bartender / 2nd raped dude. Actually I think you should get him. At least not second rape, and then more about it. <br /> <br /> Return to the story again and again. Rosarios character is sexual insecure, may also have lesbian tendencies (see her scene as a female friend). Rosario did not want herself to be mentioned, but there was sexual tension between them. Rozaro's character meets a man, he is a sexual predator, who has all the bad feelings. But he made an impression on her. <br /> <br /> Rosario has commented that his character is in front of a boyfriend. I have tried to resist. Because if she is her first lover, she tells her phone conversation with her phone. Another problem here is to talk about her mother. After the first rape takes place, Rosario did not tell what the role was. She said her relationship with her mother was very close, and nothing was explored after that. If the role of Rosarios no longer call his mother or behave strangely, the mother is worried like crazy. There is a lot of probability here. She's a female friend: We've seen her at the party, there's something happening and she's gone "boom". <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But when you compare to a pinch (rape), it feels like a pinch, which feels like you hit with a heavy weight hammer! After the rape number. 1 We'll get stretched out too many scenes. Threads will be opened (she is a reference she is a lesbian who, like a guy who tried to press her on the job, is a reference to her lesbian), but left in the open. If you go out alcohol, there is no real social relationship, who will participate in the 2nd and last rape scene. It is obvious that he is not a "nice" guy and his character is fleshed out a bit. But when Rosario's character was raped in his class, he did not play his role in the film. We get to the point that Rosarios is no longer in the role, she can go "bad" and hurt people. (Too) has shown many scenes correctly, and she is doing only drugs and other items without emotion. Cheats in a test for Rapid # 1 returns through the role of Rosario, and decide to hang again (really?). Ignorance of those sounds, the man meets us, with another girl (even if she never loses herself, fortunately never luck) and has his football career. Well the career is a stretch and he is a peer to his peers. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it works almost, but there's a lot of cliche to stay with you again. So the role of the Rapist # 1 Rosarios presented ... why exactly? Because she promised, she was her day? Again, really? Such a person does not always lose control with a woman who is particularly raped ... I want to show him how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have been working on his head or hitting, but he was wrong, saying that he was such a subject. <br /> <br /> So the victim strikes # 1 undresses and ties with the eyes and let's tie him on a bed of Rosetta's character .... Seriously, it's just silly! But what comes next, is also very cumbersome. She initially spoke to her, then she "closed" him and enters a body. It is very hard to see rape scene number one. This gyrar is not desirable or not, it's just not serious. And of course what they are aiming for. Now she's done "Bartender Guy comes and raped ... rapport # 1. If you really work as a reality film, then the role of Rosario's character is a" vengeance "for herself. <br /> <br /> It is a hard-watch, art-house which does not need to be entertaining / entertaining. But 10 minutes (I did not count) The end of the rape scene, just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less, looking only what is going on. <br /> <br /> "Rosario is looking at the camera in the end and First of all, it's a bit too late, that's to say after her initial rapture, the second and most importantly, the Art-House movie is to come here after the second rape scene of Rosario's character and how she should face her work. <br /> That is <br /> <br /> When good intentions (worked before Talia and Rosario), but failing to convey many things (if they can see what they mean) , It must be convincing, otherwise it will not work) ... as they are neglected ...
