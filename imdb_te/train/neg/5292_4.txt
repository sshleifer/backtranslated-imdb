I can not recommend this film as the date of the movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiography lived in the South East London estate apparently a violent, becket account of Dante's network. It's Ray Raystone that made this sort of character in the middle, but never does. The film opens with him in the pub bar in the pub bar - it's all - and you'll eventually get trapped with the disappointment, self-esteem and cynicism that exhibit in different ways throughout the image. <br /> In fact, a play like tension and elimination is required in a play and Winston matches with Kathy Burke, his long-term wife, and ultimately refuses his inexplicable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles Fuse-lighting can be done at any time as a bilious son, but he is still thinking about why he allows himself. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, increasing their claustrophobia of the flat square. 4/10
