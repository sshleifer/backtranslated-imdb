I did not see these two, also known as Primal Species in England. <br /> I do not think it will hurt them. <br /> This is an awful movie. Terrible acting, bad conversation, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about it is very nasty. The most sympathetic characters will soon die and leave you with a wonderful joke, especially the so-called parachak. The army did not survive for 5 minutes. I was happy when he last aged but finally got his head chewed off - I had nightmares he was going to survive. Colonel is very worst - all moody pouts and clueless shouting. And Percy went to the doctor and she acted as a romantic outdoors. I look forward to removing her glasses, moving her hair and turning it into a hobby, but she did not. I thought there was no end. <br /> <br /> Does Roger Carman make half good films?
