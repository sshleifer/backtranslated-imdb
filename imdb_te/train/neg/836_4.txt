TLK is a special fan of movies, the first one is a milestone and the second is probably the best sequel Disney produced, the film comes ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice work, music, but it's more than a tymon / pumba screwloose in the TLK environment. It's not bad, it does not add anything. Basically this movie is a big joke ... and it's all about saving. Make true TLK3, Disney! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
