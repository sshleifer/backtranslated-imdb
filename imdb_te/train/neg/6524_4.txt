<br /> <br /> Like "Man from Planet X", this is a fantasy science fiction story from an era where fantasy and science fiction is still the same. Meaning, we are very ridiculous special effects and magical as fake science fiction. <br /> <br /> By Midnight Movies - This is another "classic" released on a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound. <br /> <br /> What is the main reason to watch this film? Oh, it's absolutely the whole time our space crew is Mars. Earlier, you thought "Angry Red Planet" refers to Neptune?) Before they were a vacant space crew on vacant spacecraft, including smoke and a "sin woman" member. It's very harmful by today's standards. But Mars's real thing is we're looking at this thing. This film is usually black and white, but Mars is well, Mars is very strongly bloody red. It is an interesting form of a very interesting red color of this bizarre red plasticy sheen depicted in giving the red planet angry. It's really quite a sight. Hey (aliens) viewers are witnesses. Best "ratbatspider crab." Do you think that's a joke? They're calling in this movie! It's the biggest chimera of a thing (small puppet) that combines features of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs. It scares all puppety boundaries and sh * t from our * heroic staff. Other weird, and poorly imagined, aliens can be seen, but that takes the cake. Eventually, after their worst experience on Mars, the sexiest person will capture their "ship" and return to their planet. <br /> This is not for everyone. Sci-fi movie fans and curious employees and some simple movie buffs. <br /> <br /> The fans of the Mystery Science Theater fans have a field day with 3000 people (if they have never been on the show). <br/> <br/> 2/10 Advanced Score, 6/10 Nostalgia Score, Total 4/10 <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
