Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I also call it, I'm not sure if it read the experimental script's lines. Actors did not appear in their parts and did not appear to be too dead and blind. There is a scene or two with nudity, but the film has not been able to save it from its unwelcome characters. <br /> <br /> To call the main character, a rapper is insulting to those who actually do. Lyrics do not have any rhythm or flow and are more visible on the path of absurdity. <br /> Budget? Does this picture have a budget? It seemed like I used less money than I saw in a home shot YouTube video. Bad lighting, clues, poor sound producing post. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far. If the story is really interested in attracting people, the film does not have any life. <br /> <br /> I've seen some really bad feelings over the last year. Do not waste your time or you'd like to hear this unbiased review. Check out the ratings, you'll see outpacing of 10 fluffed with anything fast in the middle 1. Wish I would have watched a little closer before wasting my time. What a suck fruit!
