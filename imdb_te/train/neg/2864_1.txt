This movie is very bad. The film's best-selling grade curriculum, acting remorse and director should be prohibited from making any form. It's pretty cool and it can not be seen like the comedy of Showgirls. This DVD is the only thing that goes to cover art. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a film for comedy topics, such a trail is more valuable than this trash there.
