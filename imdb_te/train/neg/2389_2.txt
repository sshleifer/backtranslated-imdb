Uma Thurman plays the role of a young woman with the spirit of the GCC (and pure big thumbs), who found her real place in a group of devoted livestock-enlightened cougers to secure the Hochhaus cross-country, eventually protecting the hooping crayon; Rain (bow) Phoenix falls in love with their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jelliebeen, Cassie, thumbs or not. Directed by Gus Van Sant, Tom Robins's book has been adopted, but his irony is not a major goal and is all just Sissy (perhaps his goal, but not related to the audience). The alarmed box-office flop is not overlooked, why it is discarded and why it can be seen: it's a series of sketches in quest, and performances, directional touches and cinematography are all variables. Thurman has a stitch along the road that tries to get off the road, but most of this puts Kibosh on Phoenix's career. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>,
