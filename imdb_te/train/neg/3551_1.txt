This film is just plain terrible !!!! Slow acting, slow down and slow wood falling into the woods. The best part is the performance of singing Iron Maiden in a video on a theater. The value of looking at the end and waiting for it but it is !! The characters in the film almost slept me. Avoid this !!!
