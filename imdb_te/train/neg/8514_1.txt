I give one to this movie because it's really deadly picture. The sound track of the DVD is very bad, it actually hurts my ear. But visually, no matter how confusing, Italian society shows something really fancy. I do not really explain what's really awesome, but different events are totally unusual. So for the kink value, I'll give it. Otherwise, video, photography, and adult actors / actresses are not just people who love foreign films. Roberto, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated as an unbelievable point. The children in the picture are more likely to be 3/4 years old, and they are real and the film provides a compilation of Italian life.
