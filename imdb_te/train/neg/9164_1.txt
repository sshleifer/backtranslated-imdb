This step should be made by saying that I am big romantic. So I really like this film. I'm writing my thoughts to protect you from the rest of your disappointment. Leip Years tells a fate-filled story of Lee-Ann, who makes Jeremy happy and they meet each leap year. A very small story and a romantic mosaic with a cast that you'd see in another Jack Neo movie. Then why oh so bad? First, filmmakers think that they have filmed a music video, because they chose to change the storyline with the storytelling, speculative actions and clich√© lines and what real emotions. I was disappointed and unhappy in the first Singapore to watch the Leap Years, but I agree that the film will speak volumes like the most confused chaos. Forever fever, so far I wanted to see a pornographic film that overcame the best single Singapore porn comedy, and The Leap Years did not come close. Some blogs called it The Crop Years, which is hard but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or your emotions as I did. This film will make you fall in love forever.
