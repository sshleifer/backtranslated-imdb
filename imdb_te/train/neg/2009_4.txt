This is not a completely bad movie. The plot (a new house built next door built) is not bad, the mood is tight enough, and the acting is okay. The biggest problem for me is that I know with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other programs) that she is clearly different from the new and big lips. I'm looking at them. They see her face on her face! <br /> <br /> Marc-Paul Gozeleller sets up architect Kim and creates his heart and soul into the house and makes a good job. And Laura (as Kal) is also good as the owner of the next door (but that's the lips!). Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is the right wood. Different characters that live at home are also good. I especially liked the first people to go home with Pee (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Ammel). <br /> Unfortunately, as other neighbors do not particularly like, we fail to participate in the failure of neighboring areas. <br /> <br /> For some reason director "haunted" house was not particularly ominous. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) are managed to achieve a spooky feel, but it does not happen here. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me was the plot twist with the architect Kim. Initially, he appears to be a victim of a home-like home (which stimulates him as inspiration), but then he seems to have gone into wickedness. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you can get your eyes out of those big lips, the movie for horror fans!
