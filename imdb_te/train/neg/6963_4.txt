Japanese has incredible aspirations in their fantasy films. They are always ready to destroy the huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and other places. The problem is never the money they succeed in persuading special deals. The film was released in France under the name of Les Enviysers de L'Espace, not exempt. Its ambition is to show giant lobsters trying to keep three creatures above humans in giant octopus. It's very awkward and funnier, but a lot more enjoyable. After all, after all of these creatures and these movies, we do not?
