On a cat comes into a fashion designer tours and pool, something floating on the surface hitting her head. Besides the cheesy effects (this is a TV movie) floating from her body. Her orange smoke rises through the sophisticated rings tunnel, and the black rigid numbers tip in her eyes (they look like dolls in her apartment). I thought Jess Franco would watch the movie. Her friends draw her with her wrist, restoring her, and she struggles to remain loose. When she is restored, she remembers everything and her nose has a nasty chassis. Shortly afterward, she was almost damaged by an outside control car coming out on the back foot. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for the holiday. When she comes there, she is surprised to learn that it is a dead day. They are annoyed by another American traveler who has followed them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> Destroyer is encouraged to join a group of people near to death experiences. They all enjoyed the tunnel, but escapes black toys or escape from death. One of them, and he was very anxious. <br /> A doctor tells her of people who call her "Walkers" (based on the novel's name). They were dead as a cause of death, and when examined, they proved to be dead for another reason. <br /> <br /> They continued to walk around after dying until they died again, but he kept it in a poor record. <br /> <br /> In 102 Minutes Video I watched this, it was a long time. I can not imagine that I really had a 192 minute version! If it was to be seen on TV rather than two or more nights, it would be better than one sitting. <br /> <br /> When I read a Gary brander novel, the only floor, his work representative, he was not very original. There is a general plot of the floater: a child who chooses a child kills a vengeance. Even the diversity is pretty simple: years after the kid dies and retaliate from the grave, the people will kill him. In fact, it is a common point in the film, in which the kid is in the astral projection practice, and he is floating from his body when he is drowning. I do not know how closely I learned his novel Walkers from the Dead of the Night. <br /> <br /> It's a very slow film, and special effects and cinematography are really (probably) with low budgets and made -TV errors. There are a lot of easily recognizable character actors. It seems to have long since the late 1980s in the late 1980s. I'm boring. Improved low-budget film with the same thing that did not think I felt as bad as Soul Survivor (1983) (inspired by the 2000 stage final destination films). It was damaged from the night of the night.
