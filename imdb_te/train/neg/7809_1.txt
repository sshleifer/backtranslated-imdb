Is definitely an odd start for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Mo, an alcoholic family man, and his life is all around him. Cecil holds a phone book and sees the name of the teacher, calling him in the middle of the night. He goes to the teacher's home and discusses his problems. Cesel teaches that to respect God's Word and to have Jesus in his heart. It makes everything better. Ah ... if everything in life is only easy. The fact that this "film" appears if it is made with $ 500 is certainly not helpful. 1/10
