If it's the meaning of the film it is a very good picture if it explored something more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship ... It is very predictable to mention that the two girls reflect the Russian group tatu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is no original film to support the film, so they should use something that is already popular. You know the recipe. Other actors ... well, I do not know what their role should be. Most of them are very popular in Romania and some of them are not even actors (eg Mehla Radusque). "O" Band Tatie "+" Actors "Plots That Do not Need Satisfaction / Campaign + Loveless Shock To Love Shock = Unhealthy Love ... Very Bad ... Though the thought is good ... and I'm serious about commenting the title ...
