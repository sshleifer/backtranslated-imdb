When I saw the preview, I thought: It's a great movie. In fact it was. The actress who played the lead role is very trustworthy, and is ineffective of the entertainment of filming. But the dialogues put a dark shadow on the whole picture. The level of language is very familiar to the action taking place in 1610 and is very contemporary and it eliminates the morality of the film. However, I would like to congratulate the translator, and the English subtitles are more pure and have appropriate French signals, and this is a good rating that best describes the rating received in Ibb!
