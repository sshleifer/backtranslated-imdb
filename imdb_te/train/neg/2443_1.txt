It's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst films ever. I realized that it was very enjoyable. Acting, Oh my God, the script, as you read it. You can imagine the author coming up with such things: - fireworks, fireworks SO powerful in school, when a child hit it, a hundred yards went back and blasted. -A girl is trapped in the cellar, the killer is trying to open the door. She gets a drill, but the wire is not enough for a long time. Her first extension makes the cord, Oh horror, and then, when she's done, turns through the door and the head of the killer. Wow - and there are so many examples. Oh, and he's great what happened to George Kennedy (Thunder and Light Fruit / Cool Hand Luke)
