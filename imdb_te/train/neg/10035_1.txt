Absolutely awful movie. <br /> <br /> You can not understand the background music. <br /> If you really listen, you can understand what they talk about. <br /> <br /> Camera work is not bad, no editing, background score comes to headache, action shady, dialogues do not understand, Kareena looks like a wrestler, now she looks like a hungry wrestler. <br /> <br /> I would like to spend three hours in this film, but this film will not allow me to do that pleasure. <br /> If you want to torture yourself, please see it.
