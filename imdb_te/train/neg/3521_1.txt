<br /> <br /> I saw movies, some of them I liked, but it goes to the top. <br /> It is not only the worst male actor (Sleep Stallon) played by the main character, but the story of the movie is stupid (why not exploit when airplane is on the ground? Very easily hell) It is less than the shin number required. <br /> Furthermore, the plot does not have all the real twists, and the three-year-old child can predict what will happen next. It is a set of stories (action genre), which is worse than his other films (if he is portrayed as a comedy rather than a film in Rambo III). Whenever the actor does not act) he was surprised B) sad c) anything else than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I still have two reasons for the fact that the film has two factors. EXPLOSIONS are unusual, but then ... You can see good on July 4th. Landscapes are awesome, but ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so the film can be seen better than the waste time. <br /> <br /> Instead, there are hundreds, thousands of good action movies.
