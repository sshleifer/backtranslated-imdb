A woman working with some scientist puts round metal balls into the mouth of their people, which changes their personality but actually transforms them to crazed, zombie-like killers. The "guinea pigs" are very small for this experiment. This film is awful, deadly, and awesome. This is not the logic of the script. You really have difficulties with what's going on. No special effects. The computer screen that represents a huge scientific development is nothing more than an older Atari screen. Jessica (a prominent "actress") is even worse than a puppet (appearing as a single child in the summer camp) with strings of hair that she thinks of personal servant / confident George. The whole film is subject to the idiotic, sophmoric lectures of this puppet. But wait ... you'll get soft, bizarre, just naked scenes with women with some bar guys. In the background of some kind of spiritual discovery, a very annoying soundtrack takes place in the background. None of the actors were good. There are only different levels of evil. Gore and "horror" elements are not exclusively portrayed in the film. This film really looks like an adult. No coincidence was made by Henry Sala, but the director did not make another film. I was almost frustrated into this stupid, silly, dark looking coma! And how does the boxing end? What happened? If you know me, mysteriously abandoned me because I can not recognize it in my life. I know I've missed the worst time I spent watching this weekend in my weekend.
