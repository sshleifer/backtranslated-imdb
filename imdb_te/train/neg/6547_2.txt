<br /> <br /> Welcome to the world, <br /> <br /> Welcome to the world, <br /> <br /> Welcome to the world at DH Lawrence, the psychologist is supreme, and no one can lead a productive life It's too busy to talk to everyone about how unhappy their lives are. A D.H Lawrence has spent time with characters in the novel, if you meet them at a party, you are locked in a room with your self-absorbed contacts group. When I read "Love in Women", I wanted to kill every single character, but I hoped that even though I could not do it, they were intruding at least for each other. Alas, only one of them dies, will die with the voice, and if you tell the truth about this story or in fact something about these people, I will not spoil it for you. To make his case to director Ken Russell, he makes fun of the painted version of this essentially unassuming novel. He Lawrence worshiped psychological mambo-jumbo of the most throws, and instead of all the naughty parts focuses on, so we have beds and fields, joke, love, getting two buck-naked men, fire, wrestling and Alan featuring a disturbing scene, Bates (again, buck naked again ), shrubs and grass (not the ground) to the ground, making the shoot Two spins. గ్లెడా జాక్సన్ తన నటనకు గాత్రున్ గా ఆస్కార్ అవార్డును గెలుచుకుంది, కథ యొక్క దృష్టిలో ఇద్దరు సోదరీమణులలో మరింత ప్రబలమైనది, మరియు ఈ విషయంతో ఏదో చేయాలని ఆమె కష్టంగా ప్రయత్నిస్తుంది; She wants to have an Oscar just for anyone, giving her the view that Russell gave her decision to her. Oliver Reed has an expression, an extreme glover. The whole thing is written over and directed over, and it is deliriously campy. In fact <br /> <br /> "Mommy Dearest" I have not seen this film, perhaps the most unintentionally silly film I've ever seen. <br /> Grade: D
