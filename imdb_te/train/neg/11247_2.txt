This film is over hyped. To a viewer who thinks it is "magnificent", many people should be in old-school films, the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so I was expecting to dream like lighting on the letters passing, but it's just going. The movie is primarily a film that is trying to combine the future, and with 2 special films, the film does not mix well. You can really see the blue screen working with the actors. There are so many movies, the film is exactly the same way, so there's no reason to hype this film critically "this is a great movie so far". It's just the trash on the stick. It does not help that the story line is sooo crappy. I do not know why Hollywood has built this movie, I do not even know how the actors / actresses are doing this movie. While everyone is reading the script and forget to read the fine print ... it's almost done on a computer. It was in the movie network, nothing about the film was revolutionary. I am very worried about paying for this to see. You can not waste your time and money in the picture today or tomorrow.
