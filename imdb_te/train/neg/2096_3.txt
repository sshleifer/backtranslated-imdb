I hoped that this release brought the franchise back to its original glory, as it had BSG's first 2 seasons and a huge fan of the stand alone standby BSG Razor. I do not usually have a problem with science fiction which is largely driven by the overwhelming effects of visual effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas provided by good actors, CGI can create a deep image of the cost of money. This prequel does not have anything of the above mentioned for it. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist young people is ridiculous & unbelievable. This scene just keeps the release rating out there. That teenage does not love the virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. Its part about the same teens that have intellectual depth and the cause or the political / religious hobby to create such futuristic software or the suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are not exactly from this planet. The film is a soap opera that is only interesting for the last 10 minutes. Eric Stolz gives his cyborg a divine temperament if it is entertaining by student farewell upgrade. But this old feeling is well-liked & very believable in the classic, original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karlov. Its only interesting idea from the old Hollywood horror film is the Caprio Rifles. There is no surprise! Overall, the film has been looking at Bland & Unreal & Cheaply using the Capriya's Recycled CGI from BSG. I suspect I see this place soap when it comes to the size of the fize channel. Of course I'll be absolutely cautious at this presentation at any time that happens when suffering from a bad boxing of insomnia. Zzzzzzzz
