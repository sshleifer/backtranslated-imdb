Just terrible! Why do not you use original actors? Look, this is to stop! Stop using actors! If you have any credibility or any message sent through these low-budget images ... Please use the real actors please for the love of God! Work too free ... get that benefit! Now back to my comment ... Humor is less than bathroom types and at any level is not funny. For quality ... You can see a staff reflection on a scene shot in a public transport bus ... Suppose what? It's a Sony camcorder and probably a man who's not even his. Well, I believe people only with the audience Gore Fetish for this film ... and it's not even a good gore.
