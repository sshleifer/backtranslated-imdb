It was released directly to DVD here in Australia, so far there are no redemption features. The dialogue is hokey, acting, awful and sucks the script! It's a bad idea for anyone to think of a sequel or a good high-profile John Badam film, who thinks the idea of ​​a good idea to follow up from the 80s! Amanda Walsh is good as the eye candy / love interest, Matt Launter is the other leading leader - about it. I can not recommend Wargames: Dead code for anyone, check hackers or original Wargames Image- Better than this piece of two rubbish !!
