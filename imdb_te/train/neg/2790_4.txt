Julia (Christina Copeland) spends a couple of days with her family on their own island, along with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Mann) and their baby son Alex. Couple expects to solve their problems over the weekend on remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven Harbor meet two fortunate men, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beyser) arrives, he explains that the family of Hillbilly Schutterers lives on the island. The negligent Peter night smokes the pat on the truck while driving and the headlight turns off to show; However, he accidentally walks on the son of Savage's family, but in the dark he believes a beast breaks down. Later, the Savage family named Alex as a damages for their lost son. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a low-budget movie, with stupid screenplay, amateur cinematography, and a surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is totally irrelevant, and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how can two men survive the night in a baby with a baby that is disturbed by the baby? The logical approach will take the strength of the continent to save Peter and police force. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven's car leave their home and friends, and no one can chase them? When Peter arrives early in the boat, his sister Julia calls Alex. There are a lot of errors in this movie, and I can spend many lines of writing on this topic. I shot these pictures with scary pictures home camera. Good cast deserves a better way to work. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of Blood")
