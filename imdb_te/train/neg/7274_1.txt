"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981), the most horrible film ever made, is also unclear as "Plan 9 from Space 9". <br /> <br /> The lampoon film is divided into three sections, each of which is suspicious of the traditional film genre, but everyone is burned down by one foot of our feet. <br /> <br /> Another critic of the film writes that good views about the film are nude scenes. Of course, gansel and dashberries make a little flash of the mussel meat, and look good. But the directors do not even realize that they need a good story around the T & A. No one here. <br /> <br /> The worst of all three categories of Robbie Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we have added Balson to a cynical, old-timer, played by VidMark as a young, interested-oven cop. And for just a moment, those of us who are still looking at this bizarre cinematic workout are hopeful about the idea that we look at a ransom story about how a young, idealistic cap brings about a purification change in the old timer's approach. But such luck. As we have mentioned, this film does not have the ransom values. It is sickening all the way to the fade-out fade - which, perversely, it stretches more than the last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing, and wanted to do at least.
