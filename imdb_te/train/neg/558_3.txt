This is approximately 14 years since Sharon Stone celebrated the minds of many people since giving a leg-crossing to the audience. And now, God knows why, she is in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is a sequel to a smack-hit romantic "Basic Instinct" sequel Stone and a malicious Michael Douglas. However, the original fans may not be close to the film because "Instinct 2" is a painting film, because the first director Michael Cotton-Jones murders the first film legacy. <br /> <br /> The story of the film begins when the car breaks off properly. Catherine Trimel (Sharon Stone, who is trying to look sexy) appears to be involved in a suspect and murder. <br /> <br /> "Psychiatrist (a terrible David Morrissey) was appointed to examine her, but eventually she would fall for the intimate game of survival." No one is explained and we should sit through a shameless, c-class romantic movie. Her first role was to star in Sharon Stone, where she turned out for a long time. Because amateur writing, neglect direction, and awful little piece of chemistry. The film was filmed with obscene conversations and more sexuality (a tropos scene removed as it did not receive an NC-17 rating than the first entry in the series). "Instinct" is a compulsory harassment. <br /> <br /> If you remove this film, there is no flawed pleasure in each movie made by the original film. Acting here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some headlines, but here, she gets pretty bad. David Morrissey played the worst role in his life, and has not made more than two expressions in the film - confused and inspired. "Instinct 2" is a terrible way to continue a true series, which is very good in a thrilling film. <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" has never been a good movie and it is not actually. Some movies should not come out of the paper, and feel that after seeing you watching. Now, it's easy to understand why Douglas and David Cronberg was eliminated, and why Sharon Stone is looking for huge cash for this ......- 3/10
