Let me start by saying that I did not see this film at first. It was recommended to me as a mediocre flavorful friend in the movies and pasted "MTV" on the face, so I hoped too. <br /> <br /> This act is my main stomach along with me. The main girl is pretty mediocre, but the rest of the cast compared to her Marl Streep.The main "hero", Heath, is just plain terrible.He can sing good sound clich√©s, but it's about to break the moments of 'laughing' I stirred laughter L's girl is very beautiful, and brother is not just an emotion but is a flat character with an actor who has not been able to perform, and when he tried, it was a bad failure.Neil Patrick was the only good actor to star in Harris Edward, even though it's bad to direct, because I saw him Oh, and my father remember me Arthaniki not half bad, but he was hardly in the film for a short time gurtuncukogaligenta. <br /> <br /> The story is not very good. The brakes are more than you would expect. The predictable story (until the end, which I did not understand). They do not have a real one-on-one single-character characters ... they're not just interesting or perfect, we've never seen anything before and it's not worth looking at here. <br /> You have to be a tearjerker. It did not do anything. The end is not built at all, it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends, when I explained it to myself, when I explained it to myself, "I'll see and when?" Asked. Good sign forever. <br /> <br /> "The film is just rubbish, I'm a sensitive person, when I'm in two parts of Simpsons Really, this movie is not worth your time, if you really want to see a tearjerker.
