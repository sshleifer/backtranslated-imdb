Description: Corn, completely stupid and worthless. It's very cheap and lame, you'll wonder why the extraordinary dumb people also spend the budget (or I'm guessing this) probably more than 700 dollars to make this film. It's just silly without a mystery science theater or watch. <br /> <br /> I do not even forget about whether I will watch this movie. The film is very brown and your face becomes irritated with purple purple. If you have a digit IQ, be my guest and look at this completely whisper image. You really worship it. (As I said earlier, you have one digit IQ) <br /> <br /> You have 12 actors, some tiles and of course cameras and music you bought in a garage sale, you have a little more entertaining home video than this piece of garbage ll.
