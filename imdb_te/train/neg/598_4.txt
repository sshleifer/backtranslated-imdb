Please, be alert: Although this film is a bad storyline, one of the most horrific films I've ever seen ... never. <br /> <br /> So, it begins officially with the party. Your average party but there is some guy there. He's beautiful in Kate ... if you know what I say. Remember his face; <br /> <br /> However, Kate George goes to find Clone (Did not I tell you that the plot is not bad?) and takes the tube. The middle of the night is London underground, but she is just as stupid as that. So timetable is next, and last, the train says it will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, a mute party girl, decides she will have a nap in her 7 minutes. In general, she seems to lose her train and lock in London underground. Alone. <br /> <br /> This image will remain there. The blood, the solutions, the organs, the parts of the body I cut and clot and eventually remove from the body. <br /> If it is small, it's a horror horror; Pretty but thick girls are kind in women and sick, weird mental. <br /> <br /> You're in Saw, Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, we are very grateful for the scream horror.
