Surprisingly enough film does not have some ransom quality when it moves towards its end. The other part of this film is very bad and lame one, with a small budget, insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to get enough money to earn good pictures of Christian circles around all the money. I'm not a religious, so I do not really care less but it makes a new tool for some churches making the film and as a good tool for getting people more readable and interesting for reading the Bible for example. These films always seem to be a waste of opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really cries the film and cuts it down. This makes the film look ridiculous with its effects, and it gives the whole movie a big-film B-movie. <br /> <br /> But this film is more damaging to its writing. What's happening in the film is just insulting to surveillance and I do not complain or speak about the religious aspects of the whole story. The movie is very unlikely, and people in the movie make such highly unlikely tasks as insulting to its viewers. <br /> <br /> How much did the movie hate like a soap opera anytime. They just turned this hard time into a full-time tall and it seemed to me that they added in some characters and dramatic developments to fill things up. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, when the story attracts more attention on its summaries, it is necessary to say that it can be more solid and stable at the end. It is still imaginable but it does not prevent this movie from being full of these movies and because of the concerns of these films, I do not think the film will succeed, there are new sorrows that are so sad to see there. <br /> <br />
