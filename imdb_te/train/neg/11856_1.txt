I watched tonight tonight at the Tribeca Film Festival, and I was surprised to see the pictures before choosing the participants of the festival. The picture is just awful - I can not without hyperbole or mysterious intentions - it's awful. The days of Matthew Modine are over as a leading figure. Gina Gerson played a different and unnecessary English voice - she should be ashamed of her participation in the film. Gloria Reuben has a weird little role in it - she's also shy. The script is horrific and we have absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I'll win a lot, but people in Hollywood have sometimes made mistakes. I really think "Fish's Kettle" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
