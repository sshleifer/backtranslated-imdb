"Show off your boobies!" Not funny, and if you understand where I came from, it is not in the channel that shows cartoons. I do not like my 6 and 7 year old daughters thinking or hearing. I see this sad hype of Nick and that's what we get, stupid little kids acting like stupid adults. I realized that I was joking, but we hope there are sweet little innocent girls in the range K and No. 1 that do not wait to see this. I was frustrated when I saw it. My daughters can not see it. I like to block Nick but I do not have a heart at this time but Nick keeps getting this kind of garbage out.
