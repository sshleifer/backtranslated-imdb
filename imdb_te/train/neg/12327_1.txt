This film was never reviewed. What?!?!?! The film praises child abuse. Oh, but Silvia Crystal is naked, so it's up to 5 stars from 5 stars. Why not complete 10? Filmography is "harassing" because the baby's shock is "dubious" and a fat friend "boring." In criticism somewhere in the review, in 1981, the American film expresses any criticism of having sex scenes with a grown woman. While I was in a hotel with a show, I caught this steaming bread of this film. For me, even though fat friend cast a storm and deserves an Oscar, I still have to give the film only 1 star. Howard Hessman was cast in the same movie at the WKRP on the TV, especially humorous. But do not take my word for it!
