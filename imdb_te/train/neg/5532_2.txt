The rebellion of zombies is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but the list is pretty much down. When traveling to Cambodia to find a trick to make Japanese in World War I, one of the members decides to use knowledge for its own bad aims. And he succeeds at least, at first. A love triangle story makes it a bit complicated. <br /> <br /> This is really tedious film, with dire performances, who are hard to tell who are zombies and who. The dialog is very low and the plot is unbelievable (it is not part of the zombie but parts related to "romance"). Camera work did not help the movie too much when I was not a student or expert in cinematography. <br /> When I see a few more movies, someone. It's bad, and it's not so bad, it's a good way.
