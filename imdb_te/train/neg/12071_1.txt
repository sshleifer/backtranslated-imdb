Terrible ... just terrible. Perhaps the worst picture I have ever seen. And in some years I've seen some beautiful images. The sound does succeed, so that the image quality, direction, acting ... etc. Only special shoots (funny meaning, because they are too bad) have special effects. Overall, there are about 5 minutes of laughing. The rest of the picture will give you damage to the brain.
