When Rodney was on the Dengerfield Row, he was happy. In my 5 wives, he is not in roll. A leaners turn off the time, but they are the best thing to go for the movie. Five women who play wives do not come up with a single actress among them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is too weak; There are a few jokes about multiple wives, but the situation is very low with anything in the film. Most of the film is played by Rodney's role as a single wife, thus appearing as an old man's fantasy than a key piece of comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we have to admit that Rodney's character is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Slayer seems to have been playing a role in a role in a friend's favor, but the rest of the name is not really good for the movie. For those who like their films politically correct, PC-comedy is in the first place, and the forgery that looks for it still can not get the point. For those who hate a movie cave for political correctness, PC add-ins are just annoying degrees. <br /> It is the most soft R-rated movie I have ever seen. There are some race jokes, and bedroom scenes made by shocking TV 40 years ago, but about that. <br /> <br /> The cast members of the film have interviews with DVD features that have found deep and prominent in the film and their roles. I was amazed if they were serious or fun. They look serious, but I keep thinking, "They should be fun!" There is also a peculiar disclaimer referring to the fact that the film is in fact not something from the Mormons or Letter-Day Saints Church names. Remember that the film contains a polygamous religion in Utah and a reference to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> Shortly, my 5 wives were disappointed. I wanted to rolllin for Ronnie, but the best thing I could do for the film, Rodney was good for a person who pushed 80 people at that time.
