If you stop after half an hour, it's good to watch this movie. It starts with funny conversations in a bar and makes a good, funny story to come. Well, I can not say that. It is a movie that challenges your patience in minutes, and you can not bear the humiliating feelings for the actors. <br /> <br /> I have heard that in an interview the director wanted to express the idea of ​​losing identity in this film, according to him in the majority of people in the world. I was amazed to hear. Do I live in the same world where I live? OK Most people walk around the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all, but I do not feel like I'm losing my identity. Do not think Khrzhanosvky, is not more than we worn clothes and movies we watch? <br /> <br /> <br /> My vote: My decision is a good 4 without getting a good start with this movie.
