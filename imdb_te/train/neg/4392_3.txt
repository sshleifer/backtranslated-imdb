A young scientist is trying to keep his dead father's work on limb reproduction. He was disappointed that his mother killed his father and oversees his progress for his own evil purposes. When the creature and his hand are opened comfortably after a few minutes, he stimulates himself with his formula and makes new murders ... Special effects in "Special Tribes" are very good and stupid, but the rest of the film is awful. The severed snake acts as a snake and some people are killed. Big deal. Mediocre performance and silly scene from Silence 10.
