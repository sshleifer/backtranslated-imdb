How Good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right image for her ... she is very bad in the role of the character. I did not read this book by Jane Austen, but I can not believe that it is not up and the characters are not more than sarcastic. It's not easy to cut down on about 600 pages at the 2-page book of the book, but I've seen only old furniture and tea cups. I saw a performance that was relieved every time, and I saw an actor every day (twice) overturned.
