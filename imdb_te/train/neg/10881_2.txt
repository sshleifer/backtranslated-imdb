My friend's mother used to work in a video store and had to preview the movies before they were out, so I could not wait to see the convent and horror movie. It's scary but it's actually confusing, I can say some unnatural way, like this movie. <br /> Yes, the acting is cool, and yes, the cheapest movie I have ever seen, but it is very scary! "WHAT, you CA-Rock Smoking ?!" <br /> <br /> I do not know how to make a film before ... I'm very bad. <br /> Yes, the whole movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> This film is good, but it is good for a laugh ... especially 'disappointed' .. DESPAAAAAIR's DAGGER!
