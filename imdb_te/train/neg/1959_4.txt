Tooth Fairy is an old optional wizard's ghost, taking care of her loose tooth for her home and taking their lives. The first few minutes you introduce to the legend of Tooth Fairy in the beginning of 1949, and today it turns out. Wearing horror plot is saved pretty much by solid performance. They were able to complete without the Hammond Brothers and a few other scenes, but the gross sequences are bloody but quick to slow down. Eye candy is pretty good for both sexes. Camera work is fine. The dialogue is fair but cheesy. The film is very low-holed bones, less budgeted, with fewer ridding factors. I was amazed at the quality of the film.
