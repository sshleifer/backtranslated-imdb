I will give this film 3 because the correct image is worse than 2 fictional cult films. Does not this mean to you? Well, it does not. <br /> <br /> It's a vampire movie with a stupid plot, like me, the Impact plot, many idiot plots, space cowboys (full of cowboy totes), warriors of the Miami Vampires are fighting a race. More than this In this film the finest Nativity malli, with her amazing Norwegian beauty. God, I wish to stop accepting dumb roles in mute movies of Michael Irenside and DeLuise brothers! I mean, at least Sequest is great! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he starred in 164 films at this date! He is rarely in the lead role, but still!
