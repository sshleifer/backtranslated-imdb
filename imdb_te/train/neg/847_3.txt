The film is the same as two brothers and two brothers - but they do not expect anything to be smart - a surgeon and they can write other computer code. <br /> I honestly dislike the style of the film. I have anxiety, confusion and deep blues that it brings for a purpose, but it is so why I believe I can not get it. The film is low in sequences and mainly lacks any human element in the story. It gives the comic book as an experience. However, it keeps the viewer in mind, which in some way brings the blues with small dialogues, monochromatic scenes, dynamic cut, music, and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The storyline is very easy, <br /> <br /> I publicly say that this film can not reach my smallest bit.
