I do not know what Oscar watchers saw in this movie, but they should see some beautiful hard stuff to give them the best picture Oscar. I know, fortunately Jean Kelly was bad in both playing it or I believe it. First of all, I do not think Leslie Coron can play such a role. She is not that talent, she is not a great dancer and she is not good at all. It's a shame that a player or actress Leslie Caron does not have this because it's made a fantastic movie because it can just kill a movie by playing it. The story is clever, directing is not bad, and, as I mentioned, Jean Kelly is great. Now I'm not saying this about the criticism of Leslie Caron, that's what I feel worse in the movie. She was probably a good actress but I did not say because she did not see anything but I think she was pretty wrong in "an American in Paris". If you want to see, go ahead but I say, it's good to see you "Sing in the Rain".
