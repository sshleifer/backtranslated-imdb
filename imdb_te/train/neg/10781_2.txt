In fact it is never. I do not know why Billy Crystal wanted to rebuild a 1940s screwball comedy. What a space sounds! None of these people come closer to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Catherine Hepburn, and anyway, today's audience does not take this easy trash. Writing is small. Hackneyed plot is razor thin and clear. The chemistry does not exist among popular characters. It's interesting that Julia Roberts feels she's a reborn of some big star from "The Hollywood's Golden Age". It tries her and fails to achieve again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
