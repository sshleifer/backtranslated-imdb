Because 'cruel' is the only term to describe the intentions of the filmmakers. Where does it start? In the spine of B * tchiness, I'm going to start with almost everybody's awful performance in the film. Scratch that. Not nearly in that sentence. I can not even imagine a role that has played a role well. However, in all aesthetics, these zero dimensional characters are almost impossible to paint in a successful manner. Still, Katherine (whose name I did not intentionally - she does not act as she plays) Girl is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, obscuring the person who played Sebastian. This story is terrible to God. It tried to reflect brightness that was the first one but in many ways failed. Pretty much every episode is pointless - though I admit that the plot twist is very good in its surprise (grudgingly). And the end is at least a little funny. But I saw this movie. Do not see it. Just do not. It's definitely not worth looking at it. None. It takes only the first experience.
