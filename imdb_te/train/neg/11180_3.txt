The only good thing about "People One No" is that this was essential to avoiding performances in Al Pacino, the way I tried to portray Georgia's piano in the first turn. It is very weak in other areas, sometimes it is weak and unattractive. Dialogue and character interaction with the weak plot is terrible. The supporting cast made a very interesting job in the motion of the film, and within an hour I have not seen any signs of a strong plot yet. <br /> <br /> This story is a true beer, and I have to hang on for a while to stay awake. <br /> <br /> This film will surely lose you ... avoid all costs.
