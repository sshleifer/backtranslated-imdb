Okay, I've seen the movie even though it was last year ... I thought it was a good movie, except it was a stupid and horrific storyline ... First, we never know about living things, what they've seen, they're doing in our world, and really, Are they on Earth in front of them or did they just come from space? Secondly, the butcher's character to handle the order has just been created apparently ... how big is the underground for a sub station? Instead of killing innocent people, they have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe a nuke job. I sounds funny and it is, but I do not see killing people as I need it ... Thirdly, the jumping on the Superman train and the Vinnie Jones fighting is long, long and long. Again, when he encounters a conductor he does nothing and works like a wime, he sees all the abominations. I have to do the conductor creepy help (lol), but if Leon is very daring he's gone all the way ... I first understand he's the losses of his life, then there's absolutely nothing he should have. He may have been a coward who lived as a hero but could be a case ... It may be the case, but after having shown a lot of bravery ... then, the cap comes on ...! I'd bet that a city with this subway would be the other cops except that lady and other police stations, which is really crazy ... all of the great acting by Vinnie Jones, it's not really built at all ... by the way, what the breasts sign means ? Winnie Jones can not make for the rest ...
