How do you spell the fat Italian washed off to pull off a martial arts move without the need for some heart medications? Steven Siegel is looking at his lowest advances in the film - his curiosity on the day-to-day behavior of his career. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ferrucci Alfredo seems to have participated in his training every day in his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slower and old enough to be seen in the film, rarely a martial arts action hero. <br /> <br /> Steven Siegel has time to retire - why the movie is 2 hours. <br /> Plot: A famed Italian man with a big reputation thinks that a crime group would play with military-made medicine to create ultimate warriors response. Although the acting is enthusiastic and ludicrous, it gives some opportunity to the top action scenes that blow through the walls of the comic book. <br /> <br /> Do you know that the film is full of sucks and Steven Seagal? Yes. I did.
