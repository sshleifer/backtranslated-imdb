This story is about a romantic triangle between a nth. <br /> <br /> Like an image, it is subtle, discouraging, and discouraging, snow-filled, winter days or illuminated in, everyone is bathing in a lucky blue lamp. And yes, I do not know it is white balance out there. Everyone is tender and suppressed and bizarre, shabby and dirty. The bodies are unstable and can be filmed in such a closeup, which is very ugly and insecure. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. <br /> <br /> The bad news is that many people are naked or sexually abused in the story of the hero. Well, Stephanie's mother dies. Three characters go back to Stephanie's hometown, where Stephanie is seen as a boy in a deserted rural area and speculative dinghy interior, a boy named Pierre. Mother will die. Well ... and about it, really. As the decline of the story, the character development is kept at least. <br /> I do not feel like the storyline is linear (it describes a lot of non sequisurs) but really, I do not feel like I have to build the film after I paid my seven euros: what is the director taking my money. <br /> <br /> "Epateral Les Bourgeois (i.e. Shock the Styles)" I'm a shoe for the Berlin Film Festival I've seen how, I know why it's got somewhere.
