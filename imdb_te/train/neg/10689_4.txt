Cuba Gooding Jr. was a secret service agent, and I said directly that this role was not a role for this presenter, as he blamed himself for the murder of the American president. <br /> <br /> He makes teams with the constantly news reporter (Anji Harman) to uncover the conspiracy of the president's death, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> James Woods, Cuba Guding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Hormone 'End Game' If you fail to grab your time, plain and simple; Action is some good, acting is not all bad and the story is before and while the story leads to the entertaining and enjoyable image - no it does not! The script's writing and direction is not sure, no time will it suck you into the story or give you any slightest idea of ​​the characters. <br /> It's boring, predictable and dull.
