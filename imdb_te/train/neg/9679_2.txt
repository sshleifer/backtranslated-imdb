The film is terribly awful: you just ignore it. You do not care what happened to this plot; You do not care about the characters. Everyone is heartless. I went out about 45 minutes because I can not do much more with my mind. There is too much sex in the film. Sex may be okay; It can do the movie (hence the Karma Sutra) but here the sex is not beautiful or sexy. It's just ugly. Do not see this movie.
