I found this movie on the shelf under "new releases" and the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie movie was very exciting. How it's billed in the box, however, and I mean, "no great idea!" Plus the cover is also "Welcome to Oakland". How can I prevent it? Unfortunately, the hip-hop episode only lasted long. No hip-hop music or hip-hop culture has played any role in the film. After living in Oakland, I know that there are many interesting hip-hop artists, so there is no need to have a soundtrack to fit this film's low budget. The number of struggling artists allowed the film to contribute. Why did the Quiroz Brothers not get this benefit? <br /> <br /> When the film is rolling, a completely distinct zombie movie with a cast as a whole black and Latino. You may think this is an exceptional film in the film ... but it did not. However, Quirz Brothers fired the attention of "urban culture" and dropped an F-bomb in each line in the film. The fastest use of the word "fuck" is perhaps the most unique features of the film; There are three or four times the sentences at once, and not one line of time. I'm not clear about the swearing in the movie, but because the authors (as well as Quiroz Brothers) are not in the sense of being, and the script is generally poorly understood. This film is generally disappointing. It's interesting to see the real "urban culture" zombie movie, but it's not counting "the hood of the Living Dead". The characters in the movie may be white or eskimo or anything else. There is no special taste for the film. It is a low-budget film with another run-off with bad acting, lousy writing, amateur direction, bland cinematography, a cheap soundtrack, and nothing to recommend it.
