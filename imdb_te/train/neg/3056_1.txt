Before I could see this, I saw some pretty bad Christmas pictures. But once I saw "Jingle All Way" better than "Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a fun movie about Santa to help some children, but it seems almost like a ghost. Santa's pleasant ho-ho-ho is replaced by a bad, devil laugh, and I'm sure many christmas kids have off. The plot of this massacre is very strange, and it fits all the demonstrations and dialogues. Santa lives in the upper place on Earth at the North Pole, where he is ready for children around the world and Christmas. But Santa is the enemy of the pitch, or Satan. The pitch tries to destroy Santa's Christmas, kicking three boys and moving the chimney and making the Dornnob heat. When the pitch causes a dog to be attacked, Santa will have this assistant until Santa's assistant Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get this assistant to Santa. <br /> <br /> There is nothing weird about this film and it is strange. Satan makes a lot of dance and he looks more like Santa than Santa. While Santa is talking about delivering gifts for all boys and girls, he's only seen in 5 homes of children in Mexico. I'm surprised when the reindeer toys, and the reindeer laughs, the tears of the boy's eyes are not getting scared ... scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes will be played by Santa organ when playing the kids. While the pitch is dancing with a lot of pain, a small-cannon is a Santa shooting pitch in the butt and suddenly laughing about it. It is better to tell their parents than to tell their parents who come from parents. <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. If you congratulate the bad movie, it will laugh at you. 85 minutes.
