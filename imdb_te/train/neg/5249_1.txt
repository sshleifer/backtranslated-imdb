I'm 13 years old and I hate this movie. I hated the worst picture on earth I watched it wasted my time and it was disappointing that it was covered on the cover and slow, but it was great. But when I saw Delta she was totally different and bad actress and I did not know how confused the girls were 2 years old. Some parts of the picture were confusing and I did not have fun at all but I watched all the film to see if I was going to get better but it was not, it was boring, dull and I do not think BORING.and I liked many other people as well. Boring boring
