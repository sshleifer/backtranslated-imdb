Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway program have been a long time, but the film will lose its power and attraction in the movie, mostly the director (Richard Attenborough, as opposed to B- as you get it), the main actor (Michael Douglas, director as a sensitive corporate attorney -Philograf's role). Slim story about a Gillige audition for a Broadway performance that turns into a therapy session for actor-dancer-singers, pushes us up, playing loud, brassy talent rafters. Nothing is modulating or subtle, especially a former dancer's theater, and a ridiculous subplot about cutting off the head with Douglas. Over-interest is filled with promises and heart, but their personal stories are quite embarrassing; This is comparable to Attenborough's slow progression, spells disaster, and even now-popular songs can not break through artificial wrapping. **** from * 1/2
