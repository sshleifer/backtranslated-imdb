Well, Montr√©al's Jesus is basically a brilliant image. Actors are really good and the technical part of the movie is okay. But I have a lot of interest in this topic and think about religion and wish to discuss it (I am an atheist), which is not bitter and me to force me to look at the end of the end without knowing something. Why is this film too boring? I do not know. It's just and so it's not recommended.
