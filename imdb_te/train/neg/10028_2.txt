<br /> <br /> Jimmy is conducting a call center. One day he was invited by his master, Lakhan Singh, Pooja Singh to teach in English. . Both fall in love and decide to run away, but Priya tells Jiami, who owes Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhayaji. But they steal money from him and steal it and then find out that Jimmy Bhiyaji's / Lakhan Singh is a dawn. <br /> <br /> Bhiajajaji hires a man to jimmy and pooja. <br /> <br /> Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar are directing the film. Krishna Acharya and Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra are both produced. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her promoted weight loss) is good. But the story is very thin in the story and sometimes it does not mean one from another - so I said about what I expected because I was from Yashraj Production. <br /> <br /> In reference to these songs, the song is not the only song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor has played the role of a laughable move, especially thanks to Akshay Kumar and Saif. But this can not be said of Anil Kapoor - it does not match him as the villain. Finally, Aditya Chopra, who has produced and directed such films as "Mohabbatin", never missed, what did Ash Chopra do by producing such a trash movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, your time is not wasted and my first and last opinion.
