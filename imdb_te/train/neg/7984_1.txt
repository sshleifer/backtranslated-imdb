Most secondary plot without a primary one. Death, divorce, money issues, parental problems, suicide, mental problems, drug abuse: Many hot buttons are pushed without any reason for each play outside. Love, passing problems, sex, generations of misunderstandings, exploitation, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep true love" ?? You may want to do an interesting movie, but do not hell? These events are not fundamental to all. Irritating. At the end of the film, the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture was not all about nonsense. <br /> Oh, I forgot to say: the actors are very good for everyone. That's what kept me off to turn it off. Their talents were badly bad, the film was well illustrated: the light of each episode, the motion and so on - everything else. This is only a lost meaning.
