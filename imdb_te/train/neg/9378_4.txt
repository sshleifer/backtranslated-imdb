This is produced by another North East Florida product, primarily and near by Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. The firm Fernandina Beach was able to capture the main street until it needed to achieve street views. The picture is beautiful, and very bad. Tommy Erin is beautiful, but overacts. Eileen Brennan still does so. Small children, or those who like to flush in large doses are good for them. A 4 from Miller-Movies Formula.
