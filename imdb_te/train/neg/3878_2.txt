In the 1950s, "Astronaut returned to Earth as a mutating monster". Plot the Quarter Mass Experiment is the only science fiction film that uses the idea. So the intention of reconstructing the plot is to return from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that was previously a bad movie. The budget is in single figures and I'm not talking about dollars in lira. There is no cinematography to talk and there are countless editing blunders. For example, the photographer takes his (rarely legal) model for a photo shoot. Cut the sun straight to a shot at the back of the model, then the sun should be cut straight to the photographer's shot straight behind and then cut back to the model of the sun ... <br /> <br /> Budget image also prevents other things. The trivia page budget is very low, as the producers can not get Saturn's stock footage, astronaut Steve West tells everyone how we can see the sun's footage. Since the human actors can not be used by a romantic studio, the original sun gives the most attractive performance in the film. I would not be scared monster titled if I appeared in this - I'd be afraid of splinters from the rest of the cast. We can also apologize for the fact that the actors wear their own clothes because the budget is not clear. For example, a simple general does not wear his fancy dress uniform medals - he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap. <br /> <br /> For this work there is a ban on a movie, but it fails at every level. The tone is in the early nursery from the Melter hospital and moves nasty and escaped murders. Instead of killing a police doctor Nelson just want to look for a missing cat is to determine his own track to his own same as getting the police call instead. It can also bizarrely walk through the road without anyone noticing a completely rotted homicidal monster, but these horny 70-year-olds stop their car on the dark roads for a quickie and forget to tell their pregnant wife nonchalantly <br /> <br /> Reflexive Melting Man Z grade is worse. Rick Baker's sometimes appealing effects are not much more than a bit of confession because it is "good at all"
