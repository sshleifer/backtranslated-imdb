- A new couple moves into a former wife's house, where her husband is dead. It was not long before the new wife had a feeling that she did not feel at home. She looks at the skulls around her house. But when the husband is investigating, he can not find anything. Are you trying to get him back to the shelter? Or, the devil's dead wife who is trying to get a new wife out of his home? <br /> <br /> For the first time, I have seen The Screaming Skull without the help of MST3K staff. Moreover, the last time I see it. Can you say that? I do not speak simple dull - I'm talking about the grass grow up dull. The great stretch of the film is not going to happen. The screen might have been empty and I would have gotten much fun out of it. Letters are characters and lazy letters with very unchangeable conversations. <br /> <br /> - Many of the actors can not help things out. Most of them send a reserved principle for a grade school play. I did not see it, but I'm surprised to see that anyone who is associated with this film has ever been seen in the film's worthy. I can not get into the script I've given to actors. <br /> <br /> You always get the role of a very idiot line in the movie. <br /> You are threatened! At least all the costs or, at least, look for the MST3K version.
