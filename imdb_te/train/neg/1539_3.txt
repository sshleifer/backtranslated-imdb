I'm a big fan of Westerns but this one .... grav, what a stinker! I think there is a disgusting dialogue that has turned me off almost right off the bat. When I was in eighth grade I wrote a better conversation than this. Poor actors! This terrible dialogue did not see anything, but was ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. This is a bit better than some you'd get in an Ed Wood film. <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He's probably the "big" star in this movie, that you're a B-Western, you'd be lavishing praise on it. This is probably called B-minus Western. Patty Sterling Hayden, who appeared alongside Jon Crawford, Betty Davis, Frank Sinatra and other major talents. To be visible in his vehicle, this poor man must have been something that he was trying to discourage. <br /> <br /> An annoying thing about this film is that they are greasy for a week and their faces. I know old West boys are not always well-groomed but a guy makes this a movie that makes you just want to go 'EWWWW!' Really, it's a seamless Western. Denver Pile also got this one down live, especially after performances in the great Westerns. Bad, bad image.
