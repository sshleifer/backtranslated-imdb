OK, I tapped this tv and lost the start. <br /> The 10 or more seconds of the film came into titles (I assume) that's why I missed it. <br /> <br /> I do not see him as Mark Hamille. Clive Barker, John Landis and Stephen King have clearly identified some really horror acting as a murderer. <br /> <br /> Alice Craig has a cat face or a full alien <br /> <br /> The initial titles are well explained by the sleepwalkers or where they came from. From the title sequence I think they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life-energy from humans. <br /> I think they will live a long time and this particular 2 is perhaps the last of their kind. <br /> This is a very large dose (yes! I thought it was a little suspect), killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad story with no real explanation behind the main 2 characters and this is not quite true, <br /> <br /> Avoid.
