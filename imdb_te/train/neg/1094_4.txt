Hard to explain this thing - If you're a fan of movies in the day, you'll be pleased to see the hot haze still hot, but Forry Akmerman is not too good (what else do he do if he does this with my camera?). But it's basically just bad things - its bigger diabetes - it's not the pan for the whole length, and the jokes are your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and Costello your thing). Nevertheless, this film I see is lovely, and has more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still basically the weakest product.
