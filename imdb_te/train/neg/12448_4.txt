Clint Eastwood Bronco Billy, the leader of a Wild West group, is one of six common mafias who participate in a struggling-break-trip show. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's aide, but such women have never been long, and the position is open long. Enter Antoinette Lilly (at that time Sandra Locke's Eastwood Friendly). The Scatman Crothers call her Miss Lilly, if she is married at the age of 30, receives only her long-dead father's estate, so she is hit on that birthday <br /> <br /> What is the story line? It's hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that it is unbelievable when she suddenly half a 'one of the band' by the film for the first half of the film, but the viewers are proud and indifferent. The Wild West has a long-term lack of funding behind the show, but this fact is not really touched upon enough to distill the image razon. Miss Lilly's loneliness in the rural West is discouraging luxury's immense life (she believes her family and newspapers are dead). <br /> <br /> But if you can not get back to New York, if she luck, if she fails, do you think she likes it? <br /> <br /> The film's image is Billy, the leader of a family, a lucrative bunch hanging through a dull and slim. It's a warm, messy picture. Or at least try. <br /> Also, Clint shows his skills with a pistol that stole a bank robbery and went on a relatively non-violent film. One of the gang was arrested in an old draft evasion charge; Billy gives bribes to local sheriff. The tent of the show burns down; A new orphanage makes them new. But many worldly hazards do not make the plot. <br /> <br /> The problem is the acting or lack of compound. From Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite acceptable. Eastwood is not on top of his game, yet he looks good by surrounding such a poor bunch. <br /> <br /> The film is being shot for 116 minutes. What point? Good question <br /> 10 to 4
