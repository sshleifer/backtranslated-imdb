I ended up with this ... "Art piece" possible 10 out of 1 star rating. Because it's harder or impossible to judge objectively. <br /> I do not like the hostel or movie movies that do not mean this like - I think that's disgusting and pretty I would have been the same if I probably gave it 10/10. It's probably 10/10 and it's more than happy with Tarantino (and on the screen on more blood than Kill Bill 3) Killing is here to show that it is possible). But what's about the "historic drama" style is that the sub-genre of "Romash movies" -from the time of the death of John Romero-Emperor-Emperor-and it will automatically rate your default image - are like movies that are bad with the intention of this and you are really comically bad The moment is meant to be, or it does not justify that it's just wrong. It's for people who want to be bad acting, bad screenplay and bad. And by some turn of confidence - I am also one of them. I have a desire to see a really bad movie and look for some garbage and here are the days when you go - save the day! But it's definitely mine's opinion and does not match with someone else 'else'. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some horrible movie - then Feliciani's Casanova is definitely the choice, but do not rate it by default on my advice.
