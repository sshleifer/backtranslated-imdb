The bad words for animals or Eddie Murphy are not remarkable. This film is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's picture? Well, if you're trying to take a nap, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of poor animal lip animation made by some eye-wornens to queens that are not fun. And lip-synchronization makes makes it brilliant by comparison with old Godzilla movies. Meanwhile, Murphy drones with a repressed poorly delivery that is painful to experience Eddie "Pluto Nash". Apparently, he is trying to modify his old manic personality, but what? In short, all the magic and exclamation of the original version of 1967 will be rebuilt, or whatever. A town wants to harass some wild animals and sow them to do bad things. No, really. Pluto Nash is able to make the sentiments with them. There are a few surprises that do not have some surprising tasks. <br /> <br /> Take a photo of '67. Or some old Yogi bear cartoons.
