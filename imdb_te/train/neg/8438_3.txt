I think of Bad Laurel and better than Hardy Laurel and Hardy, but just simply. <br /> <br /> Fox movies have received a big release on DVD and do not introduce much familiarity with L & H instead of their classic comics. With a dumb romance story about the man who found an invisible ray. He hates himself and is in love with a superior daughter who liked some slick person. <br /> <br /> <br /> Without their pancake decoration the boy is tired and old man. Robert Mitchum, the classic Noir Bad Guy, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy's "Insurance" Stan, the only scenes in the film when trying to get out of the bedroom window overnight and out of the scene. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just mess. Forget this and see if you find a copy instead of "a chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sun's Desert".
