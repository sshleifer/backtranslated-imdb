A man wakes up from the nightmare about bats. He and his wife go to the desert for a picnic in their honeymoon. He sounds a strange noise, and she wonders with a bat that crawls across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a cave trip, he does some kind of work, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She says. They will take part in the tour, but leave the group to go out. She drops a slope where she is scattered by insects. He follows her. He will hear a strange noise again, and come to a bat; She gets her, and gets in her hair. <br /> <br /> When they get out of the cave, but when they are on the boat at a ski resort, the hardships he has started are bats or hallucinations that attack people. He is angry when this happens. He could not drink alcohol without spitting it. His wife is concerned about rabies, and he begins to treat it pastor, but reacts seriously to the injection. <br /> <br /> Some people have been killed. Components appear into the bat person of the transition of humans. It's not in his mind. <br /> <br /> The bite bite is not the reason for these transfers, as he has already had some characteristics of the bite. <br /> If the title seems unreasonable, the final thing is another person. Not a very good movie, but I enjoyed desert, cave, and ski-slope locations and some concert scenes. I did not think it was bad as others did, and I did not feel bad about the 1999 film Bates I thought (I gave a 5/10 rating).
