For the first time I saw the film. I liked Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his early films. <br /> <br /> The film is about recent girls (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), which passes from the NYC to the recent spoilsome losses. After going to a person who is falling in love with her, she is apparent that she is a terrible couple = dopelderer, chasing her. <br /> <br /> This film is very poor and lousy. It is not really worth portraying both dialogues and acting. It's just the same for Drew Barrymore's fans.
