Words can not begin to explain how awful the movie is. I said, "It's great," but it's not. It's dull, lifeless, and boring. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne Mary Freagon is not the theme of this film. Bret Kelly is the only attractive person in the cast who plays the lead role as a true statement on arrogance. Two difficulties, like sister and brother. <br /> <br /> Gala, Sherry Thurg, Anne-Mary's complete opposite - attractive. This girl is tall and luxurious, and can work. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially the supporting male mark. I saw little wood in the rainforest, but he was better than Kelly. Why did Kelly cast her actors from acting? Is he really bad that director? Everybody corrected that story - not one. The children were kidnapped and walked in Kelly Poo to solve the crime. <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is the best house found by the director's friends (and if you search for them, those same positive marks will see the same friends).
