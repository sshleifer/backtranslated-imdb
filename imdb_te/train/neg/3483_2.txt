Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gondolphini, Cristina Applegate, Catherine O'Hara, Josh Jackerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Cair, D. Mike Mitchell. The hotshot dumped with his girlfriend does not want him to leave alone in UP's Christmas, so he decides to return to his childhood home, and now bribes his family to run his family in a dysfunctional family. Ablek's vicious and a dimensional performance dealing primarily with an elegant smile, his role is mentally unbalanced creep, but Gondolini and O'Hara breathe in the mess. For prayers, its softness is pungent, and does not quite understand the scene from the scene, and its sentimental messages are fraudulent as Affleck's laughter. 91 minutes, rating PG-13. * Â½
