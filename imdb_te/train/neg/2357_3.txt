Let's hope this is the last nightmare. It's a good thing to be a bad thing. Well, there is still some pleasure, but in a very worldly sense. Rachel Taley was there for this franchise period, production crew and production. <br /> <br /> Tom and Roshan Arnold! <br /> <br /> Tom and Roshan Arnold! I know what she thinks when she writes / writes this bad piece. Instead of having any similarity to the horror with the use of a 3D end of the movie, she made the audience look more like a high-value popcorn film. Are these glasses nifty? And you get to keep them! It's equal, you just make money for me at $ 9.00. Here's 10 cents. Now, you do not feel special! Sorry, but for me, it does not feel special to me. <br /> And Freddie has another face-lift. For this a trash, I think. All beautiful artifacts that went into his "look" in previous films were replaced by an apparently cheaper, less detailed prosthetics set. He looks ... he's supposed to be like a burning victim less, and more that he has skin disorder. Changing the main range is the same as changing the mainstream in a series so far. But wait! They made it, and that was done. So I guess it does not matter. But it is very important to me. Freddie is not scary anymore. He is just another lesser rental monster like Leprechaun. <br /> It is more ... This series guarantees darker comedy than horror classic; You expect the writers only expect a leaner and intelligent representative who is not worried (unfortunately, it's smaller on both accounts). <br /> <br /> As there is no scary or curious moment in the whole movie, there is nothing more to say to be ready to capture popcorn and be ready to laugh. <br /> It rates from a 3.2 / 10.
