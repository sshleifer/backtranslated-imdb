Hold the Eden Formula if you want to see the real 'quality' image. This fantastic film will have to cost $ 50. It is completely ridiculous (sometimes they are a man in rubber suit and / or a hand-glove hand monster - but all are equally horrible), with a layer thin script, patetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion. <br /> All actors speak their songs, but they can never see it before and are reading a telepromer. Special effects are way beyond lousy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We are not going to do anything, <br /> <br /> "
