Worst de Niro Scorsese's collaboration in the violent overwhelming confusion of this horrific harassment. The horror horror was suddenly out of his element in the film, which suddenly shouted to the phone ringing and eats the door of the door, and was so fiercely and intolerable from such master craftsmanship. The cast is absolutely wasted here and southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Nolte plays the longest advocate in history, believing that he can save anyone! De Niro's mental Bowden is no more than 90s psychedelic killer. The scene with De Nero and Louise in the beginning is very frustrating and climax continues and we all have to be more than weary on the mental stalker that dies. One of my most horrible film experiences. The original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
