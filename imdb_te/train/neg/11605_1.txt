I found that I had a good picture in the first form of the plot tagline. Am I ever wrong? At the beginning of the film, some parts of the film came to mind and decided to make a low-budget movie. The first 10 minutes you do not notice cheesy acting, terrific sound and the awful special effects of God, but it will deteriorate further. I'm asking for about 20 minutes in it, "again and again?" That question can be asked when I'm not smiling from the slight laminase of this film. The main actor has a setting for emotions and he sticks across the whole movie, yet he should go to love and hate and everything in between. In the film, the flashback scene almost made me vomit for an extra minute of footage re-live me. Now he struck in the middle of the film, where he is trying to break Morpheus from "The Matrix", who is doing just a terrible job. Talking about the actor's "Star Wars" and the Fortune Cookie Frame is almost unbearable. At the end of the movie you can not realize that this is at the end because the plot is finally developing. The character of "Morpheus" dies, the only good thing about this film. He utters a couple words and credits roll. What is this Any plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it could not get any worse. Please, if you respect human courtesy, do not watch this movie!
