In this film, I was unable to act at my finger: Karisma in the episode of the leading actress. When she shares the screen with her celebrity, it is inevitably translated into the absence of chemistry. Romantic scenes are just actors in dramas. It is a director who misinterpreted what the actors needed. I do not know. <br /> Can it be a screen play? Who is the chef in love? He has a great deal of interest in his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately his and his youthful efforts, anyone or anything else. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in the film. But do not forget to nominate Oscar, so judge for you.
