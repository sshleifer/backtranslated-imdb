This series is just worse and worse. Poorly written and fun plain! The maze is fantastic, but shines through the writer's experience. Nobody ends up being insulting everyone by trying very hard to risk it. Now in the second season, their hands waited for a disappointing cast, and with the laughing script, "Oh, crazy" you go to the rescue act. They will break their eyes and shake their heads. This is not funny Well, no, it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. Except for Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. You want us to be our main station that best displays Canadian talent. Drag the plug into this amateur message.
