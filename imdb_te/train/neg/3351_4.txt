The cause without effect (s) in the real world but in general the Hollywood restructuring is not possible in the world, it is possible, it is necessary. Haanting was once given the courtesy of the 1st class cinematographer-Turner-director's computer treatment shown (John De Bont-Speed) but the big budget worst string from (Twister, Speed ​​2). <Br /> <br /> Actor is in this film a flawless and they seem to realize it. Lim Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones want to be somewhere but in the film. Lily Taylor attempts to add something to the inquiries, but the script does not know something when it thinks there is no half. The events just happen, the good and evil ghosts show up with no poem or cause and then the story ends with a most unsatisfactory event intended to close in the previous 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> There really is reason to see this for effects since we all know that we can now all be on the screen. Why not see the effects of good story service instead of their own desire?
