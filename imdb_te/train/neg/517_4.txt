"The Return of Chanda" is notable, but villain rather than a hero to play the role of Bela Lugosi. <br /> <br /> The story contains the Black Magic Cult of Ubunti, who is trying to capture the last Egyptian princess nudge and uses her as a means of sacrificing herself, just like a nudge to restore their oldest hero. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor is doing his best with his limited resources and extensive stock footage. King Kong fans (1933) recognize the giant doors used to keep the Kong Bay in many lands. Acting is pretty awesome. The actor who plays the main priest (I trust Lucien Pervell), for example, the most common acting in the early talkies uses the coach inspiration. <br /> <br /> It is a secret that Lugosi received parts of his career in his career at this stage, because he was still a wealthy star in the universe at this time. This is probably because in this case he got to play the hero and know the hero, who is the hero. Since his career is dirty down at the end of the 30s, this type of charge is more than just exclusion, but it is legal to Lagos.
