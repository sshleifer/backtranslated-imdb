LOL! This is not a bad way to get started. I thought this was original, but in 1976 I discovered a clone of King Kong's remake. I have never seen King Kong for 15 years. I saw this movie at the age of nine. Funky disco music of the film will be stuck on your head! Not to mention the song of the film by Aitians. These are the worst creature effects I've ever seen. At the same time, the film is a sacred grail of B-movies. Memorable quotations: "Take peace of mind and go to bed." "Keep the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti Power." I saw this movie on MOVIE MACRABE, organized by Elvira. The reverse has a scene similar to King Kong! In King Kong he dislikes the girl and the building goes up, but in this picture he goes up the building and the girl (who has fallen) grabs! Another Kongo clone from the Hong Kong Morley Peking Man (1977) was also the year. There are a lot of travel matte sequences and motor body parts. This movie laughs at you. As I said, another King Kong clone. PG rate for violence, language, background elements, and some horror scenes.
