<br /> <br /> "The Big Sky," writer Dudley Nichols and the company proudly imagine how the Hollywood (and still) the masterpiece of literary imagination can be improved on a classic pioneer novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author AB. In doing so, they may remove the soul's story and the edge of the story and be a movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> The mythical nature of Guthrie's book and its main character, Boon Quidel, is innocent, from the innocent, Kentucky lady, to a hard and efficient survivor / mountain man, replaced with a portsy port that is less similar to the author's intention. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In the picture, all is confusing The book emphasized the role of a sudden and small character, Jeff Calloway, who only occupied only a few pages. On the other hand, the most important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the leading pioneer, is not total !!! Directed by Hawks director Hannibal, it is clear that Jeb was cast in the film, not boring enough. <br /> <br /> Jeff / Hannigatt, the involuntary, voice-over storyline, has given Hollywood short cut for a compilation screening, editing and directing. <br /> <br /> Some films are actually (William Wyler's "Ben-Hoor" is a wonderful example). But it is a terrible and frustrating feature of a novel rather than a novel. <br /> <br /> The story is dull and cluttered and the characters - of the script - Guthrie's literary vision consists of just shallow and boring shadows. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's star appeal can help lift the film, and he's caught up in a milking role. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" is the most overrated and teed director's history in Howard Hawk's place.
