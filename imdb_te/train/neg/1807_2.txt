I agreed that I was younger at the age of hippie-dippy, and I'm sucking this kind of movies. I can enjoy some of the hippie genre more than "normal" people. <br /> <br /> Every common sense of hippie stupidity is presented as a gospel, and when he has a peaceful fleet, he kills young long hair. It is terrible that the film is not too funny to see it as an overly exotic goofy of hippie drone. It is like a left-wing version of the dragnet, except without professional actors. <br /> <br /> I gave two stars because I had some interest in the soundtrack, and I could not opt ​​for negative stars. <br /> <br /> There are no actors, plots, shees, just the script ... you have it "art" image .... It has slowed down the root canal drilling, pulling the scene of every nonsense just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The bizarre twist of the art of mimicking the life of the film "Nanaqtar" joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, his co-robbers were killed and he was killed in a mysterious weightlifting. He was sent to jail "..... and just think, he had to leave behind a legacy ... oh yeah.
