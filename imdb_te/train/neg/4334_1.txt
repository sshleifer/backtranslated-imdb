The film is capable and I'm ready to make an effort but most timeline issues are very clear - it's hard to swallow the treatment as an idiot. <br /> <br /> Power Rise Last Sixties. The Carlito's Way was set in the late seventies. <br /> <br /> To be true to the film, it will eventually be set in 50 years. <br /> <br /> Rolando does not remember that Gail (Penelope on Miller), the Kleinfeld and Carlotto, run his "Hay-Day" Power Rise. No original characters in the film are in the original. <br /> <br /> We believe that Carlito has met these people within a few years. <br /> Carlito, in the original movie. Also, before the quale Rocco and Earl creates the characters - is they supposed to happen with them because they are clearly not in the Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how he can understand the relationship between the Italian with Carlito in the original film that shows the events of righteous power. Where's Tagi Alicchus in the film? There is probably seven years between the two films and he spent five in jail. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole. <br /> <br /> There is no one interested in telling a good story, throwing the role of the average gangster film and the so-called Carlito Brigante. The film has a few good moments but I think it's better to stand up for Carlito's way and try to make this film a better place. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the only advice I can give is not a clay earlier. Think of the spaghetti Westerns with the name Clint Eastwood named man, the other two words that have the same character but are not related to each other.
