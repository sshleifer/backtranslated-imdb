By my "Cool-Aid Drinkers" remark, this guy means dedicated fans of Pavarotti, who do not try to judge this picture objectively. This is similar to giving the Wally Cox award for Mr. Universe giving a 10 or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre !!! When the film was started, I remembered Savage reviews with headlines such as "No, Giorgio" and some of the worst films ever made. It's definitely overstating it as well. Very nice and very great artwork, the movie is very fond of the film and the film's biggest drawback is not the performance of Pavarotti or his girth. <br /> If it does not believe, the authors of the blame are based only on the sides (I, who believe, are chimps). It is rare for a clich√© dialogue or food fight with golf scenes, but they are not the heart of the problem. The problem is that the writers should pay attention to a "romance" for audiences, which includes a fraudulent middle-aged man and a seemingly frustrated woman. Perhaps it might be more apology for European audiences, but in the United States 1982 or today, such love is romantic and selfish - especially Pavarotti tells his wife and tells Harrold that "it's just fun". Wow, talk about romantic dialogue !! Sadly, if they just change the script and make Pavarotti's wife, or perhaps his wife is a couple from Classic Hollywood films, such as this and heaven, you can also have a relationship with a husband or even kill her). <br /> <br /> "Pavarotti's music could not save the film." At the end of the film, New York There is some fantastic scenes here, set is just amazing and Pavarotti's singing has passed, for this reason, I feel that the movie deserves at least one, I really wanted to make the movie more enjoyable, but this was really bad movie - it's not as bad as you heard. /> Pa Iii, from what I read, this film can be art imitating art, because Pavarotti's own life in the film, has some parallels, to discuss in detail, even though it is not exactly the forum.
