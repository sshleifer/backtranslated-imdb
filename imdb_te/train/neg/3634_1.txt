Joan Plowrite is a boring child fantasy that gives star billing but a little more to do. Sappy kids pursue their dreams. Frankie Ballerina and wants to be a baseball player (Yuk), but best friend Hazel goes for mayor --- she is 13 years old! Extraordinary disadvantages of pedestrians in every way, as well as syrup performances by girls and baseball boys. Definitely less effort for showtime --- no limits?
