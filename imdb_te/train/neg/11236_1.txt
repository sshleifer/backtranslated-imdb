The former Kalamazoo resident with a pen for the town I was waiting for watching this film. But, no disappointment! While the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the script is terrifying, the plot is dubious and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of the film is that women are without husbands and children. I can not believe how this can be a reversal in women's perspective. Does the author live in rack <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not suggest anyone to this movie. It's terrible. It is a city that is nicknamed.
