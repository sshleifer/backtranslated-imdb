The film was very interesting for the movie "Horror" produced for the film. The story and mystery of the story really worried me. But the end of the end is the deputy. The film was going at a faster pace and was constructed, however, it would appear to a very climatic end. But I guess there is no end. The film is just a half an hour later. Why not answer all the unanswered questions in this film? There is no explanation about the key elements in the plot. The film is like watching a murder mystery and does not know who did it. Very disappointed. The producers of this film come out of money and the film is not complete. True bomb!
