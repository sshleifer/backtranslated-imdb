I would like to start by saying that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with many of the things I did in the Bush office. And I love the daily performance and the Colbert Report. They should be both my favorite shows on TV. I admitted that Van was not the one to walk on Earth. Cannon, Letterman and Leno Bush enjoyed jokes. (I believe he is not a dungeon.) But when it comes to one point it's not really that funny anymore. It could be funny and it was (he was hearty he was making our power figure fun). Even though the comedy is central, it's hard to hurt him. I mean it's probably a special episode, but the whole series is just dumb. It's just the same bush jokes that CC has just heard we've heard many times WAY. I can not really see this show in the last 1 season.
