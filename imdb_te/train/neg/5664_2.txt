I liked Boyle's performance, but what I say was the only positive thing. Everything goes beyond the absurdity. Many actors have said that your 9-year-old man is willing to talk, he wants to be a frustrated, stone-hearted cop or an ultra-evil villain. The brave voice-overs seemed to me unhealthy. I was able to buy a cheaper synthesizer, and I was getting better early music. And what about the police violence in 1984? It is utterly useless and has nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox has combined many things, in fact, he thinks he is really cool, but nothing with the story. One of the things that makes Borges very good is because his minimalism is a big disappointment. This film is opposite. I stopped looking after the scene where the person from Lanroot Yidische Zaitung stopped, or there. I pay for this $ 4 rent, but at least some satisfaction can be obtained from writing this review and will hopefully save others from doing the same mistake.
