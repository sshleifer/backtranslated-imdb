Another attempt at teen-grass-out-comedy is to find himself in a remarkable quest for cooling at a college campus, and decides to threaten the trio of popular Jacks to earn the girl. It happened earlier, and it was done in a very satisfying manner. The macro-drug humor that teen flicks like "American Pie" and "Dude! Where My Car Is" is completely visible to the viewer and disgusting to the viewer is completely removed from the scene. The film is well written, and the actors have not achieved any success. I will reveal this horrible picture because my time and waste are mine. Best of all, slackers have never been able to entertain or laugh forever, and the worst to be the worst and sometimes completely disappearing. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his first rushmore, joked himself by appearing in the film and how fast would a career end up in the toilet? Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
