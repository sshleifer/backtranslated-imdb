We feel changing the historical events around for our pleasure in Hollywood, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For instance, bank robbers have never been back in the bank since they have been shot back at the LAPD and we will see it again in the movie! Another example is that the number of LAPD officers was shot at the end of the film, which is not true! But Hollywood should have a good hearted end, so they add * some more blood and guts. Some events have been combined and many of the major actors played different people, but why would Hollywood always do this? I only guess that the sad part is that I watched some one hour documentaries about North Hollywood shootout on TLC then very well!
