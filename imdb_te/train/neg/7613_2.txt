Diablo's small California town sheriff Robert Lopez suffers from mysterious deaths after taking place in an old box. Legend has a Mexican ghost named Ajar, a sixteenth century in the box. "The Legend of the Diablo" is an absolute worst for FBI Agent Gill to investigate the killings and the sheriff's daughters, Dominic and Mary to fight with the evil and bloodthirsty demons. Movies are not scared and gore, acting is unconscious and directed. Unfortunately, I love "torched", "live feed", "bone sickness" or "neighborhood watch", unfortunately, "The Legend of Diablo" is not perfect.
