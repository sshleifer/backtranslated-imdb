This makes the third Errol Morris film I've seen, and I do not like his style more. He found great personalities to create the most interesting and varied characters, documentaries, and then they enjoyed everything with tongue-in-cheek editing. This is not really the live curriculum and Morris said, "But nothing, these people are really lovely, really!" <br /> <br /> The film tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of the organic divide ... The African man who studies malnourished maleras is an awesome ant , A lion tamar, a garden of animal-shaped shrubs, and robot designer. The general plot of the film revolves around the question of what the animal, the human being, and the life style represents. So fast, Cheap & Not Off Control is not really any meaning in the movie's terms ... right? Unless of course, Morris is slightly upset by the desires of these people (he is called "obsessions"), which produce synthetic patterns in life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> But I have stressed his sensitivity. With no voice-over interpretation and words completely dropped in interviews, Morris always gets anxious over the audience's collective head. Instead of frequently combining circus footage and ant footage with the frequency of the circus and ants out of the context, a sort of absurd absurdity when talking about all these people. <br /> <br /> However, he did not intend such intimate ministers, ie he was just a bad worker rather than a subverter. <br /> <br /> No one of these movies I have seen so far has not particularly attracted attention, and really does not care what he is trying to do. <br /> - PolarisDiB
