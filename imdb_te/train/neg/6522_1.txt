This is not a commentary in the original movie, but it is in the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I do not know if different releases and upgrades are happening, but if we have rented discs, if they have over 2000 copyrights, if any. Anyway, the sound mixing on this DVD is definitely terrible. Levels are often yo-yo-ed up and down; I've not seen the orchestral track thread being too tense - it's my news or my speakers. When it's time for the dialog, the volume usually drops to something just to hear. Rarely, the orchestra and foley-work are very low, and the dialog is bigger. My wife is the only way I can watch the movie from this DVD, one of us keep a hand in the remote to keep the volume constantly silent on the volume. Furthermore, another user commented like this, when we selected English audio dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; And occasionally the dubbing Russian is in Russian when the characters speak locally, so if you do not understand you will have SOL. In the end, we were left watching the first disc. Before you get $ 50 + for the film on DVD for your own library, I really recommend getting your hands on a rental copy, if you can really enjoy this epic, read the book and really want to understand the storyline.
