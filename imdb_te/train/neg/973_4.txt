This distinctive dramatic Bollywood film is unpleasant for Western critics. The script is ridiculous, acting over the top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are amazing songs by Mangeshkar and Purana Meena Kumari's curtain call. Seeing a sick actress during the filming and dying to drink herself at the age of just a few days of film release, the same attraction as seeing railroads. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but does not deserve to perform the task well. Bollywood has produced very good pictures.
