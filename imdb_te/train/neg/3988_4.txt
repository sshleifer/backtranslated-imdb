In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee is very clear in his mind. He is a good man thinking about the level of consciousness in the politics of racism-colorism, media and empowerment, consumerism, capitalism, religion, genderism, 'hetero-sexism', etc etc. I think there's a blessing that more and more people are choosing to examine the basic aspects of our everyday lives of critics; Quiet and invisible forces in the governance of our societies. However, not just because <Br Lee makes controversial films that make him a better producer. What comes across in "Jungle Fever" is the awareness of these social-political forces. It is mainly the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> Lee is just trying hard. He is desperately trying to make every political / social statement he can think of in 90mins. And as such, the end result is chaos and undesirable, allowing him to have no time to develop the characters that he himself completely designed with ideas he hopes to present. That's why the stereotypes are exhausted and we have evolved testimonies and a lot of load dialogues. <br /> <br /> Second, he has attempted to make statements about various types of social work and does not have the exact or original description of his social / political problems. What's going on across is a plump filled with illness. <br /> <br /> It is very problematic because the artistry of these films has been sacrificed and transformed into a loud speaker. Voice of filmmaker. <br /> <br /> It does not work as art or sound political argument. <br /> I still appreciate Lei in bringing these important issues, I should say: <br /> Two thumbs down.
