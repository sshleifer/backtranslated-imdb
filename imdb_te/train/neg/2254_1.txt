OK, people, honestly ... this is one of the worst movies about the show biz who ever gotta, but I've been smiling me crazy (which could be why I enjoyed it). Generally, it's a way to get sex, sex and your own personal 15 minutes reputation. Do I know that sex is a big problem in the film? If you have Bizjazzare characters and are easily going for fun, watch this movie (and do not do it) if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing in the film is that he has his goat (! Images, bad taste and fun a triple A!
