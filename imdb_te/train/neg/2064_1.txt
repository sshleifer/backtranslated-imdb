Oh dear. If the new skate set with the Chevy Chase and the SNL gang set the sketch show format, it fails at every level. Fortunately Chevy is very difficult in this regard and can not be blamed for this full trip. It's bad too bad. Although it was supposed to be a political comment (1974) at the time of its release (1974) it was not yet funny or seriously observed. Sketches are longer than all, and they lose any sarcasm as they are full of boredom. It belongs to Chevy's film industry and I enjoyed all his work after these works. Avoid if it's also interesting.
