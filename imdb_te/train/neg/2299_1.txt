Before I started ... I totally believed in God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Oh, who am I in the world, do I think they are doing these morons that they "host"? The last time I checked the host did not discriminate, hate the hate speech on the TV, or try to weaken their own beliefs on every unfortunate spirit that went into the channel. Crazy, idiot, Conservative, Bible humping, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson everyday. I'm for free speech, but when so many people say that it will cover the person if you leave his ideal path in life, are you sent to hell soon? This is a perfect example of why many religions cause religion. One day in my classroom we had an alternate teacher, so we decided to watch TV. And we watched 700 clubs (against most of us), and of course the crooked pat and called on raving about the Bible, and he said, "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a kid and said "I guess he's right." WTF ??? If people feel that people are sexually disturbed by someone else, they must take the host and duct tape and throw a cruise liner in the middle of the Arctic.
