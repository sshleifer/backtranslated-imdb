Dennis Hopper is undoubtedly one of the best American actors of our time, and it's interesting to see how he plays his role in a child serial killer case. Many movies have threatened that Hopper is always threatened by psychological panic or killing spree, but in this film, Hopper made his best effort to keep the intensity and emotion when carrying a shield. After I entered the film story, I was tied up, but it was only the smallest thing that killed the film. <br /> <br /> The concept of cinema is great - the cops on the move are not only to capture the killer, but we will get an opportunity to work on how to capture gangsters killer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, While Hauper tried to act as a strict, experienced street smart cop, I could not help him, his acting was equal and he was really attached to the case. Directing is also terrible - it does not have the feel of a real movie, but a TV-movie production. It is very clear to set up an elite team to hunt the killer for the first time. When the famous gangster fires other mouth gangster in slow motion, acting is weak, predictable and terrible unexciting. <br /> <br /> The camera's desire is enthusiastic, and the recurring scenes or the killer's little sister's haunting pictures have no real influence. . It's not scary, it's not. Terrible all acting, and for Hopper, I did not feel for his role, and I did not really care much about her relationship with her daughter. <br /> <br /> The last thing that hurt me is the swat team. Once I saw the Swat Team in action, finally, something good. But I was wrong. Total 1, the whole Swat Team has 4 boys. It's impossible. All 2th film, apparently, Swat team has no training because many times in this film they carry their HKA4 machine guns with one hand. As the killer hiding the staircase with the gun, these 4 idiots flew to the bits because they did not target or target anyone. They should have two hands on the pistol ahead, but it seems like they are taking a job seriously and just flaunting around. 3rd, SWAT team members "Keep your eyes open, watch out for yourself, we're good to go ..." In fact, they use hand signals or radios. But they are literally yelling at each other - can you kill the killer and can he hear you coming? And to top it all off, these guys are no plans - obviously they're running down and going down a wild turkey chase. They can finally do nothing. That's the last hay. I am not an expert on special forces, but basically what I think is pretty common. When the audience motion is horrific, action becomes a good saver of the movie - when you can not take action, the movie is gone. <br /> I give 2 stars for the concept, but the rest can not be credited. If you want to see a crime thriller, this is not an embarrassment. There are so many crimes in the film - but it lacks the thrill.
