For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about francas fanatasies when he's traveling on a staircase and he's sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that you'll see when you're looking at this movie for an hour and the same fantasies / funny conditions again and again. It is predictable. <br /> <br /> I love Felix Hermann as Frank, and it is not enough when it's comedy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
