I have seen some pretty poor images in the past, but they imagined what they were thinking when they did this film. <br /> <br /> I'm going to die for the brain to make me very happy. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of many genres and have fun. <br /> <br /> Many people have already said that any script and acting are weak. <br /> <br /> Anyone in the above 4 radio must be part of the production company or segment, or they have a very fun entertainment concept. <br /> <br /> I was worried with the video store, which gave me a thumbs, which led me to rent. <br /> The second film came to restore my faith in the movies. <br /> <br /> Comic Book Guy "Worst Picture" is right!
