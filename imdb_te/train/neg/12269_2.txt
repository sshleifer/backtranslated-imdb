<br /> <br /> In Hollywood, there is a need to rebuild Hool Hollywood. Make this film and I think it will be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the city's edges, sandy policemen, earthquakes, sanitariums and mysterious saline murders, which is attractive. However, this story is just a bit different and maybe 40 minutes less. <br /> <br /> The film is full of "sixth-meaning" effect in the movie. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to see this Japanese bunch of Japanese filmmakers who are stuck in it.
