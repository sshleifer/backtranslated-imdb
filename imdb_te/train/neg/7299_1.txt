Certainly seen bad movies in my life, but this is so bad that I really became angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking me to repay my movie ticket, in fact I can not pay (or reply too) but this is the most important thing. In 1-10 scales I will provide this film a42. Why "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) Why stop walking from bat? Why did they hit "jeep" (chevy blazer ???) in the first place without breaking the skull of the bam? The plot is thin, the film is filled with clear cliche, and some parts of it have no meaning.
