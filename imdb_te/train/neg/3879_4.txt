The astronaut who goes to Saturn in space is the astronaut who goes to the first space saturn in the world, but these horror films turn into him and he will only move the land. He will lose his mind to slowly dissolve, often escaping the human flesh, who escapes to the nurse and melee victims in the hospital only. I'm on the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually quite good, but space sequences are pasted out of stock NASA footage and likes to look like interesting as a hospital warehouse. <br /> <br /> Very soft monster cinema, with a very weak script, small character development and totally poor acting, with the novelty of having a candle that lives like this shield, does not rise above any other than a simple slasser flick 10 to 4 for fans.
