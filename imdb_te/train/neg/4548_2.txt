Irritating. Minimal plot. No character is developed. I went into this film with high expectations from the book. This is a fantastic picture. It could possibly be a cult classic. No, it's too big. It is poorly featured and has terrible special effects. It is difficult to recognize that rebels or military or church or all of them are bad. I'm still disturbed by a small plot from the movie. It's really not as described as "so-called" aspects of this, leaving as intellectual. I felt like I was watching a sneaky episode of a small range of science fiction channels. It is very fond of TV movie. Do not look at this movie. It's the waste of time and money.
