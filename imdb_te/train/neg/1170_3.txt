The Lady and the Duke (L'Andlies at Le Duke) is a French revolution, as a fan of Eric Rohmour's study of sexual contemporary medieval warfare, "how to deal with men and women during a real and genuine war." <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully visible, each scene is made up of a pola painting, a tablecloth's vintage. I'll talk a lot about that style of Romer. <br /> <br /> With the overwhelming apprehension of Robbersphere et al, Rohre may have reinforced the screenplay based on a real feminine work. Some recognize that Fresh Alistocates Brittes collapsed? I'm doing humming: "Marat, poor we're poor, but poor." You choose a tune from "Les Misz". <br /> <p> The center to go back to the central city and the indigenous castle is not sympathetic to maintaining a tremendous improvement of the central revolution. . In one case she claims that the maid is the bear but manages to lay out the perfect repast perfectly. I do not understand her, the English sympathizer has rejected her and defends her former lover and patron, and he and the revolution keep transforming political attention; I thought I was sympathetic to their companionship, like a character from "Scarlet Pimpernell". Hey, the Prince of Wales or someone else, and she is insulted because she does not go back home after the baby. <br /> There are a number of reasons for the change in relationships between men and women in general during the revolutionary period, but no one has ever seen. I went to a Herbert Marcus lecture that ended with a long Q & A. The last question is older than the rest of Acetitis from the audience members, she has a gray hair, "Why are the revolutionaries so terrible?" She hooted at me and did not deign Marcus seriously - but the thing I remember from the whole evening is the only thing. Roger also showed that anti-revolutionary revolutionaries were horrific and predictable. <br /> (Originally written 8/11/2002)
