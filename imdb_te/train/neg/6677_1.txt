After reading the first 5 reviews in the IMDb, I am very excited about this film. But the really awful movie, the total time that the aliens see is 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is the cheap suspense), the pioneer in the story, the oh boy, what story? <br /> The story does not seem to go in one direction, they first capture the alien (after 7 years! They finally succeed), then they know what they know (after 7 years) and even release what they want (why are they caught in hell?). Then the girlfriend who is an actress wants to go out of this madness, then suddenly she is not an occasion, then she does not do it again and she does not. Then they kill all the aliens killing the entire human race (no one in those years can see these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, so I'm not too short to write soon, so listen to my warning: The move is not worth your time, this movie does not see.
