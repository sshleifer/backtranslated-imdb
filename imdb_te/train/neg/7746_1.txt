Literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget film comes from the categories of its ancestors, contemporaries, and followers. Bad special effects, a weak storyline, blood and gore deceptive amounts, annoying and nonsense characters, all you expected. "Abrete of the Sabretoat" is about a new tourist resort where the genetic engineering of the Smithsonian cats attracts employers. The cats try to escape and kill people, the participant in the show prefers to protect them and warns visitors who do not care about them, and there are some employees planning to kill visitors and rebels and cats. <br /> Special effects wise, the average achievement of this film is its budget. The sabretooths were filmed by poor CGI. Amazingly, though, the Cats look more realistic up-close, detailed shot than the long, more distant shots that are good hidden by the CGI. Their attacks are recklessly bleeding and bleeding. As you can expect, they will attack, pulling some hands and feet and leaving behind a lot less. This is why this film falls in poor school. <br /> <br /> The storyline and the characters are just terrifying. We have some college children who came into the island, who are planning a scavenger hunt. And take a lot, very seriously. Private property, security systems, and steal. Why are they seriously taking a simple game? Did I miss something? There is money Or were they sent it? I do not know, I can not see the movie only. But it seemed like they were doing it for pleasure doing it. Even so, they went too far. <br /> <br /> "Abbas of the Sabretoath" is a very poor movie. For a low budget sci-fi movie, this is a very poor and cheap example. It can be attractive for some, much tailored to viewers, and you will chuckle and laugh all the way through. And remember, this is not a comedy, this cheap horror movie, so it's not funny.
