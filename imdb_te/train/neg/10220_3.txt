First, the film is divided into three sections. The good start is when some of the cavalcans are surrounded by Cheenen. Only after this can be described as a long boring central section, completely wrong Candice Bergen and "Sainior Blue" travel to an Army denture to secure. Miss Bergen moves the four letter words inappropriate every time she opens the mouth, and she seems to have just gone out of the 1970s Jack Nicholson film. I understand zero interest in zero trustworthiness. In the third and final division of the Indian village, there is absolutely brutal killing. It is very clear to be involved in anti-war propaganda, it seems long lasting, outrageous, and fictitious. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacob (comment above) Here's an idea. Why do not you look at the movie you are commenting about, but instead you do not mind your noble nonsense. It's not a political site, it's for reviewing movies. - MERK
