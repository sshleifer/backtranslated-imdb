I can not vote this because I can not see trash from these people. They made my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and promised that I would never do it again. I think people are my civilian person to help them stay away from this trash. Go to the forums in this movie and read the reading that the cast members try to act as the movie for the first time. A man also responds to him ... with the same name! Shalls are in the forum that says good looks like Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... nothing close. If it is the company's 2nd film, it should be better than the first one. That means the third film should be very good. No, I've seen it. Everything I want to know about how you distribute this trash using the same names. Have fun with friends and make a movie for weekend ... But do not market trash!
