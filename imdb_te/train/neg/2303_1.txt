Except that people will surely buy into this garbage! As you may have seen, such as "Moral Orell", if you're trying to make a lot of foolishness, you probably feel the over-the-top parody of evangelism, it's not the joy of this show. It's hard to tell what happens when you look. Is not it a news show? Talk show? No one knows !? They begin by reporting on various international news stories, but at random points, this weird, tiny little man is bigger than his first face, smashing and laughing and usually grievously worrying. Pat Robertson does not look like a bad guy at first glance. He seems to be old-fashioned but still old-fashioned coat in his ancient beliefs (like our grandparents). But the man called for the murder, he did not help and helped, but two murders dictators were illegally used to donate money to enforce diamond mines in support of abortions in China and regularly cocaineans (especially American male Caucasians ) Are better than all other races. <br /> <br /> However, he is fun for everything, 40 years later (that, or some TV officers who do not give a damn showing that they have enough money to bribe). When you realize that some people are looking at it and hanging on each word, the alertness of the show varies. Although Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he was, the people still heard him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mixture of both.
