Well, for the first time I was curious to download an animated open source movie, it was ruined by demo demo. The animation is amazing, the lip synchronization is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what to do, not only realize nothing's going on. You only feel the emotion for the characters, the creators only pity for their time wasting time. I saw small images with emotion twice in half! It's a real short film, if it's time to take just one true director. I'm excited to present everyone their software and its rendering capabilities at blender, but sorry guys-what the story makes is a movie telling.
