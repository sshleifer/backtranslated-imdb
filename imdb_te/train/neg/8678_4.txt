<br /> <br /> Last night, "The Bodyguard", I was forced to review it. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie for this awful camera work. It's beyond annoying. All of the angles are wrong, especially when fighting scenes are impossible to see anything. <br /> <br /> In this story, Sonny Chiba hired himself as a bodyguard for those who are ready to take up a drug ring. He was approached by Jude Lee, who had never been with Chiba. <br /> <br /> If this story is good, and terrific dubbing, it might be a good movie. Moab and Lee's involvement in another gang gang is an in-depth implication behind Chiba's idea of ​​her. As a better direction and composition, I would like this classic Kung Fu movie. <br /> <br /> The starting lineup includes a familiar quote for fans of "Pulp Fiction", followed by Karate School in Times Square. There is no way for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br />
