I am very fortunate to see Michael Bennett's hit original production of hit musical. It was a wonderful experience and I saw the movie when it hit the theaters in 1985. It's awful. Almost everything has failed. Firstly, the unfortunate selection of Attenborough (the best actor, the good director with the right thing) - was almost as bad as John Huston took to ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they are cut with songs and casting chords !!! They are awful - the power of play These dancers - with these hungry, talented performers wanted an opportunity to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you could not get your eyes on them. But this cast comes just by dance, makes a "nice" job singing but none of them spark a bit. In fact, look at the cast on the IMDb - none of them really went to do anything. (Okay, ok, Janet Jones Gratesky - married Sheesh). So this film train rake does not capture a second magic, despair, passion for the music industry. Total strike-out! (But even though they try to music smother - great music still remembers at times and how great people remember the score).
