I'd like to keep my reviews short and simple, but it's up to me. <br /> <br /> One of the directors of Chris Columbus can not achieve the original cause. <br /> <br /> The film covers with more horrible acting. <br /> <br /> I believe that these meetings will act as actors. It is the protagonist of a secret chip and full joke about Russian terrorists. Rent a terrible, original one and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> This film is not set as originally as Christmas. Alone has turned from an amazing Christmas time family comedy movie with a joke with no moral or plot!
