This is one of the most hateful and ruthless films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I misled Donald Sutherland's misfortune and gave me some loyalty. <br /> <br /> Leslie Ann Warren's character is a whiny contrast and stupid when they come. There are more intelligent characters than she killed in the film. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing in this film, "Where is justice?" Asked. <br /> <br /> Why was late night cable infected with unhealthy turbulent gusts? Many of these films have a particular problem with women and are focused on terrorism and murder. Every bit of this film will be ill and without enthusiasm. <br /> When it works, the viewer's stomach revolves around its illness and insults the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> The casting is misleading. My opinion is that they have previously been Bagged Sutherland, and use him as lamming. <br /> <br /> I've been wasting time by giving this dirt a chance.
