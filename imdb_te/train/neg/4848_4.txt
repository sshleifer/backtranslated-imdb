I love the film as a good battle and I come to the category "that is there". So I think my review is accurate (IMHO). After watching this film on DVD just as I can say that I am a bad pile. <br /> <br /> It started with me on TV when I was saying "I can not do that ..." but soon a bit of a bit cool job experience is a hindrance. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, I got a nasty feeling that this film is a dude dude when the trailer cycle falls down ... I'm right. <br /> <br /> EOD scenes. I know the army team has some of the most patient rebels ever at the other end of the command wire or wireless trigger. I have gone through all my head. If you know that the story is about to leave their own driving around the desert, which is going on in Humvee. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was very ridiculous. It just does not sense at all and I want to switch off there and then. For a long time really had to test my patience for pull them. It started with "Contact Right" and went down the hill rapidly. If you have a Brit accent, you have taken the shot, but if you are part of the EOD team then suddenly you have a great shot and saved the day. Then you stretch it out for an unexplained long period without adding anything in the story. <br /> You have a booze scene that hits each other for just one laugh. Another scene that you have just watched. <br /> <br /> When my life was so slick, the mainstream went out of the wire to hunt someone else. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. It has resisted all logic and ability to write good logic ... it's wise and awful. I still do not understand why they waste time on it. Then I saw him jogging through the busy streets of the camp, moving me to the laughing floor. Poor comedy :) <br /> Unfortunately, this storyline does not necessarily mean that all the programs really should be. I thought I was not stupid luxury EOD scenes, but it went on to tangents trying to be different. But it struck me as hard as it tried. I wanted to finish it. It is a combination of stupid scenes in a mix of stupid, intolerable, action (ish) scenes. <br /> I can not recommend this. Perhaps my work should be to comprehend the joy of the experience but also realize that innocent does not make sense of this. Stupid is the only artificially higher IMDb rating than this film ... It should be a box office PR 24/7 work to use this website to make everyone think it's good. Sorry Mut ... It's Not Just! <br /> Not recommended ... it bore you.
