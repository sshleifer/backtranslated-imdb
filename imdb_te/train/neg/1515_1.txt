Due to the cast of Gear and Danes, I saw the film "The Flack" and the story excerpt was very interesting. It's been a long time ago (I've seen some turkeys) I have not posted online but this movie is terrible. I think it's unbelievable that the problems are so inhuman that this is the beginning of the script. This story makes sense of zero and the dialogue is very strange. The poor gear, he deserves so well. For the gear / dance on the screen turn, there is no belief for a minute role, due to the terrible writing. Gear wishes me that I can buy back negatively, such a thing is possible. It's an insult to watch very badly wasted talent, I can not say I want my 2 hours back. (I know what you're thinking.
