Coen Waters's career came to my attention by the notorious 'Night of Bad Taste'. Judgment by comment indicator is not the first person in western Europe to learn that I was not the first and I learned that this musician tried to be called (arguably one of the best in our contemporary pop scenes, even Dutch). Whether he made an attempt or not. <br /> <br /> He was very fond of 'in intensive care', but he was uncomfortable with the film he participated. No one can blame him. It deserves its rank in the Veriary Hall of Fame through all forms & scales. Suppose the story of the killer maniac is dead in an accident, but Alive and the scary have told dozens before, and without the direct directors the director can provide a more heroic story through innovative settings and cinematography. A hospital has IC contents with a wing and a couple of middle houses. The pace is dull. In addition to the melodic melody that murders every form of the murderer, orchestras are reported during murders, it is highly suggested and in any case bloodless can make them a small budget. The romantic scene is gratuitous but not least attractive. The couple from Amsterdam came to work. When dealing with the couple's subject: The whole subplot between the wauters and the girl does not work. A more emotional connection can be established on the screen, if they are just as fellow victims, relaxing their nerves through a physical relationship. I can not even grant the honor of the other cast members mention, because they should be cut into smaller pieces. In fact, there are many of them. I would like to convey a clear name for the genre: pretty nurse and two cops. <br /> <br /> In a slasher, comes only when it is necessary to save cavalry. The former anti-hero villain is supposed to be taken by a more intelligent idea because the former red herds often do not get the parts; They can overcome the illusion of the undesirable malady of the killer. Translated to events, Wauters kills Doctor and saves Dame in distress. <br /> <br /> I'm not done. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic endeavor but comes closer to "A Clockwork Orange", so it is a teenager who chooses a driller killer law and pierce through the brains. <br /> <br /> If this method is more than the killer's death than normal rounds of 9 miljun bullets, the doctor will survive to reach the doctor's 80-minute mark. Intensive Care Bad Taste is a bad movie that can only enjoy lovers who can verify Wernen's impressive statements and make some of them and thus try to sit through it. For example, the parody of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the last clash in the park (chase at the end of Friday 13th). <br /> <br /> However, the IC gives an overview of a small loan that gives a little overview. George Kennedy was not one of them. He is suffering from a fierce monologue by a fellow physician / French actor and they fear when he falls in the flames to retain his big name. He played a piece of his naked gun again, finished with beef, but with long screen timing. Finally, it may be one of them. I have never seen him open fireworks in his fireworks in order to crush him against a soft one fail fence. <br /> <br /> Get a good name for intensive care ... Koen Waters learned his lesson and devoted entirely to his music career. <br /> How many versions of the Paris-Dakar race have previously had to stop before he could feel his feelings.
