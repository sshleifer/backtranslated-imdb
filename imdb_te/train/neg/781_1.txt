This program is definitely terrible. A George is not funny, and his kids are snappy little brats. He treats his mother with respect. As a Hispanic, I'm playing this program and characters. <br /> Plus the dysfunctional family thing has happened to death. For once, I want to see something original. Does this show make it funny when other shows are millions of times? <br /> <br /> I thought ABC would come up with its feelings and remove this trash in the air, but sadly they did "until we jump to the shark."
