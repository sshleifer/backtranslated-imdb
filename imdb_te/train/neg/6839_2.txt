Two brothers are forced to retaliate after their birth (due to their parents' deaths) and return to their twenty million five years to recover their million dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs for two hours and the Corsic Brothers plot and Jean-Claude Van Dumm have no real mechanics, but the evil twin brother is a good twin brother. Also action sequences are not exciting at this time and Jean-Claude is more dependent on the firing on his martial arts. Also the supporting cast is ruined and the film is plain dull at two o'clock. <br /> * 4 (Bad)
