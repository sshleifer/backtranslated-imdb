I do not really know where to start. Acting in this film is really terrible, I can not remember seeing a lot of 'actors' in a film I can not play. Acting is not bad, the characters are very stupid. <br /> Then there is action. I also know that even when someone was shot and killed, he added blood. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd ten (!!) times, there is no blood. <br /> I have seen the long story short (I believe, because I spent hours about this film). This image must be number 1 without a doubt in the bottom 100.
