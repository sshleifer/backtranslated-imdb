The film is about a saberotto on the loss of an amusement park in a scavenger hunt. Because they have no rules, they enter the building and start killing. Deaths are cheesy and dumb. But at least it has good effects. Stacy was in it and I gave it to three and I loved the Sabretoth movie. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were on the screen. Two teens kiss out and sabretooth head out and the boy has a mute scenery that she left her girlfriend behind leaving her to have a fully fake looking red guts. Then the sabretooth gets up in the sacks and the kids bite off the head. The final death with the owner is completely fake looking graphics. The statue's tooth passes through his mouth and hangs there to support it, and the girl loses a contact, does not lose her contacts, and looks like she does not need. The picture is idiot and time is wasted.
