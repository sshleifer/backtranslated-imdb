It was a zealous for the cocaine in the late 1980s. I can not understand why anyone can make such brains of celluloid, time, effort, money, and the brain of the audience. Make your comedy, make it funny. If you want a movie trash, keep it yourself. If you're going to be released as a joke: DO NOT !!! I mean, is it a joke right? Tell someone else a joke. Please.
