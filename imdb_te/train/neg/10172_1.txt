When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same picture, I was like a score! I agree, I'm excited to see the movie. And I would say for the first fifteen minutes, or there was such a nostalgic. Then it went down to the hill. I do not think it is a dumb for Mumbo Jumbo as politically correct civil rights. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into a stupid story. I was scared of Noah, especially in his role. No one actually agrees with the worst thing about the Vietnam War, with a fully functional brain. If someone really wants to know what communism is, sit and read a book on it. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Ricky's body, but it made me very interested. . I made fun of the film.
