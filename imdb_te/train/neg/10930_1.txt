The movie is the whole dog. And my time - I found myself straining to find anything laugh I would not totally feel like I'd waste my money. Writing is definitely terrible. <br /> <br /> They save money to earn D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and spend it until the script worked. True. <br /> <br /> You do not think much about the movie - the film, including subplots, is not properly used in the movie. After watching the film, I thought the producers were hoping to catch the dinosaur Dynamite-like comedy, where it was not a character and delivery. Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver lines, letters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
