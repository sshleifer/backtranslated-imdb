What do they think about "Cannes"? One of the most frustrating, one of the films of all time. Even though not every detail of the film is understandable. If she wants to look again on those shoes, I think I'm shouting. If the point of the film is to show how painful life is to Rosetta, it must be covered in the first fifteen minutes and run the credits. But we had to see countless recurring scenes. The whole thing is packed with unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. They deserve hardships called rosetta. And I think it's passed up "Tumbleweeds" to see this over-hype movie of boredom. It's like growing grass, it's more exciting.
