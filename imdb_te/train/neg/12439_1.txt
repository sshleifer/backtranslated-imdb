The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest films of the 90s. The latter is the same cast and jokes just funny! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I continued with the same story that Kevin would make for 17 years by 1997. Can he care for himself? So, what does the director decide to do? He took a child who was annoying and ill to him. The boy is 6 years old and will leave him alone in his home? These idiots are any team of burgers. If you want to make this film a sin, I will not really explain it. But please, I recommend that you stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Hold a piece of paper, do things, balance your pencil on your nose, or take a nap! <br /> <br /> "Alone 3 Home" is good to see! <br /> <br />
