What is just below the surface? <br /> <br /> Other viewers just commented that the storm scenes were ridiculous. In the pouring rain already chopped sodden shells? That's smart now. Evil? foreboding? Sexual tension? <br /> <br /> I would like to thank God for Mia Sarah's shower sequence but in the re-imagination I feel that the filmmakers have completed the confusion that they have to put something to make half the way worthwhile. So it's still composing another. Make yourself a favor and give this miss.
