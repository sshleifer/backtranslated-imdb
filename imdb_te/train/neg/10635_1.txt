There is a comment that the Russian soldiers, who are completely unfortunate, have laid the heroes on a "drunken rampage". <br /> You can not show anyone in this case. <br /> <br /> "KJGB" is treated "Jews and Gypsies," which is "worse than Nazis". Imperial agents (kejibi believe), the "Zionist" agents kejibi looking for. The jury is different from targeting the whole country as the Nazis do. Gypsies have never been investigated. KGB is a political tool and politically used, but from an internationalist perspective. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is like duplicate. The main hero does not speak Russian, there are typographical errors in signs in Berlin, the KGB looks completely deceptive. <br /> <br /> Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
