Visually cluttered, the plot is low, very mind-touching garbage. The greenway's improved work is not even close. <br /> <br /> The exaggerated 'split screen' effects are confusing, the film is very dark and the 'artistic' composing of the films is intense. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to recommend about this film; <br /> <br /> Plus, Evan MacGregor does not tell me that the performance is good. <br /> <br /> When I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Little People', I was very dissatisfied with the movie.
