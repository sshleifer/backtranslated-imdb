I saw this with an increasing sense of discontent. Why did God, in the shape of Ian Hunter, help these special people escape an escape from the island of Devils? What is he doing in the first place? I mean, I know God is working in mysterious ways, but the thieves, murderers and prostitutes are helping, such as forgiveness and changes. In any case it is not a preferred film. What a gorgeous geeb in the portrait of the beautiful man is missing, Crawford has never been with me and I have nothing to do with it, and it seems to have done the full look of the film as it is prevalent in historical films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Dides Goes to Town".
