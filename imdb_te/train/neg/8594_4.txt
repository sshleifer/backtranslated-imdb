At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neal (Sillian Murphy) why he is constantly looking for an adventure. She said "because I'm bored-phobic". This means that she can not get her life by doing some mandatory activities. Well, I think she is the reason and the way this film goes is way too ironical. Because "watch the detectives" a cheer bored. <br /> <br /> Do you enjoy some of these characters? Neil is a geek who runs a very small video rental shop. He and his other geek friends were usually hanging around the shop, after watching movies and then discussing them. When violet walks into his store, Neil's life revolves around completely. She is an extraordinary woman who hides a little secret from him. However, after a few dates, they decide to see each other. The issue is a man who does suspicious jokes on Violet Neil and can not make something really simple, but Neil is entirely opposed to her. Question. Will they eventually fall in love? <br /> <br /> "Watch the detectives" is a clich√© romantic comedy to its core. And they acted differently and made them worse. From the first couple of setups, we know that Neil is a pretty laid back person who does not really adhere to anything. And then, the violet enters the scene, looks all strange and annoying. So at this point, we all understand that we understand all the meaningless conditions to see how they will eventually end up. Is it worth the wait? <br /> As I said, they tried to give more to the audience. "Detectives looking" tries to talk about commitment. To see where people are going. We know lastly all the silly things Neil has done to test how far she's ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). Well, I think it's completely bullshit. Just as Neil just told her, the film ends pretty quickly, "Forget about it, that girl is one in a Nashab!" After some of the more recent directors (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later", Ken Loach's "The Wind That Shakes the Barley") and Neil Jordan combine some of "Breakfast on Pluto", this is a pretty strange choice for the silken Murphy to make a film with Lizard Comedy Force, Paul Sotter. For all, he (common) is not bad, but the actor does not waste his time in the film. On the other hand, Lucy Liu Violet is terribly terrible. Her performance is a mess. I mean throughout the place and over the top. <br /> <br /> The endless but erroneous mistake of the film is completely absurd. You really can not really connect the dot between the plot and its header; And then you end up thinking that it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Bloody Monte rating: 1.5 / 4 However, "Watching the Detectives" is pleasant, if you have an unforgettable film that you will be able to catch on cable TV.
