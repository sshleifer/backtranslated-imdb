Looking at the truth about love (which is a double entender for the star?) Is like filling in white noise or made water sounds to sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there are no rest in store shelves and you need to distract after a serious day. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit too much to be a British romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The story is an elderly wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) Sam (Jimmy Misty) retains their love for her busy legal practice burden. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) likes both Sam and Alice, but Alice has a long-lasting appeal over friendship. Alice Pals, a free love attorney, promotes Alice's dealings with his sister Felicity (Kate Miles). On Valentine's Day, after having drunk with his sister, Sam sends a card to 'Ananisis' if Sam signed. At the same time, Ace's Mail sent a radish seed packet to Alice, in which he did not write a suggestive love. The post is virtually sad in both. Sam is indeed a lover of Katie (Branca Katak) who is spending time and really cheating on Alice. Alice creates assignments via email and phone calls with Sam and plans to make Sam meet in a disguised as 'anonymous' to permanently test his loyalty. The whole cast of characters is caught in silly intuition and the conclusion is that the end should be based on the true truth - and the surprising scripts of the scripts (varieties) of different types of images. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ ref> </ ref> <p> British comedians work due to poor quality and performance quality. Perhaps, John Hay, director of the British actress, was cast as a British actress instead of spinning a fraudulent accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt, resulting in better results. But in the end, this story Peter Blower bounced in a little humorous and pathetic in his messages. It covers all conversations for a terrible distraction and a musical score that is stubbornly loud. There are some nice scenes in London and a few moments of laughing humor, but in the end this little film is really the best background music / white sound. Grady Harp
