Cheesy Action Movie featuring Dolph Lunggren. Lugarn was once a military officer, and he entered the teaching job. But in the neighborhood area and the student body leaves him bored and he decides he's going to hang it up. When looking at a group of students in captivity, some looters get school desperate when they take school as an operation foundation for armed car theft. Its dolph and baddies in the fight to death. Some of the victims of blatant bad men and vulgar women have fallen to the extortion films of the last Grindows Era, which have a glow hair. No stupid image. I can not believe that all these people have taken action, low budget, counterfeit split sets, and direction of poor action action movie that might even have a twinkle in the eyes of the producers. Look at how delayed they are in the movie (they do not have the answer to the question) security tunes (they are still crashing because they are in high school after high school) and its bundled shape is not visible as it did before. What did the evil images of the gods do? Since Sidney J Fury has directed, I appear in the film (a) a good director who created films such as The Boys The Insurance C who failed or was disappointed with Gets and he is also upset? This is a turkey. A watchable one but the turkey none is less.
