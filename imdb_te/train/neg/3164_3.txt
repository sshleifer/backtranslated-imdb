An angel's ice sculpture (without wings) fell on the back of a truck and died on her wedding day when the evil Eva Longoria dies. <br /> <br /> She attempts to destroy her ex-girlfriend's relationship with a supernatural relationship that she can see. <br /> <br /> It is essential that the character of Longoria in a clich√© style is hateful and bad. It's like cleaning your ears with sand. To be a fair lore, there is no one in cast or crew, it's not a problem, its awful script, it sinks in trial. Its really really stupid.
