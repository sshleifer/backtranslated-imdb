I can say that before I watch the movie I might not have an idea of ​​what is an Annorar Schwarzbach or her life story .. And I agree that this film is rarely a help to reach this data. I did not succeed in convincing me to do some research by typing some words on the Google website; <br /> <br /> However, what I say is that actress Jeanette Hine is great with her mute interview, and she has played really well and has shown a deeper recession. Turkey was made in Turkey and in Tehran and Afghanistan. But I know very well about this area, it's about the Arabic desert in Morocco. Turkish people and the Persian people are totally different in the face and culture <br /> <br /> I would like to make this film - documentary type - thorough about these little things Research is mandatory ..
