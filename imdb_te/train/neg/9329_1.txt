One of the worst films I've seen. My only idea is: "I can get my money back from Hollywood video". This is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it is an attempt to break down the films of Mexican or Win Diesel, but it has failed to do so badly. <br /> <br /> The performance was terrible and I thought that they were not available for drama. The story is ridiculous. We're making lines ahead of the actors, which is predictable. The Mexican voice of the famous woman is insulting and exaggeration than a cartoon. <br /> Skip it.
