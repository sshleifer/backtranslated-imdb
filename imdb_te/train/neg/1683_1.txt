Grudge is difficult to call a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If you forget about the shocking evolution of the other side of the film, he is still upset. Acting is good but not great. This story is somewhat interesting at the beginning, but trying to find out what's going on. But ultimately means one does not understand a lot of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you are more curious to make carrots cut, see this movie. Or looking at the clouds.
