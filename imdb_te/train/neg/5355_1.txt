Now I hate low films. I can not see you wasting any money for a movie you can shoot with your father's camcorder. <br /> <br /> If I rent a movie, it must have a MOVIE, not a group of people thinking that some MiniDV - tapes can be wasted. The guy in the video store said it was great, and it was not. It's cheap because I hate it, there's a lot of dubious characters and really really a great showdown in the history of movies. <br /> Really, this time is completely waste of time.
