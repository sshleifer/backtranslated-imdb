The characters in depth-less rip offs. If you've seen all the characters in other films, I'm promising. The script seeks experimental and ignorant but fails miserably. It throws in some hangover but the jokes get out of the left field, completely forced, they are almost completely omitted after they cracked. The hot chick is old and there is no personality, with some wise donkey but jackals wearing underwear she is less than some dark noses blonde chick charming. Attraction between Molly (Hot Chick) and Kirk (Dirky Love Interest) is not just known. The embarrassing and predictable seat belt-mishap is where the charm is found in its completely platonic relationship until the kiss occurs. Lies are full of their relationship and complete belief. The main focus of this film is not in contact, but with a semi-catchy plot failed to make a bad super-bod-esquire film. I can compare it to the hangover with its comparative nature. I wont get into that. I'm going but it does not mean it. This film does not have to pay to see.
