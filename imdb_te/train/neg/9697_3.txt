I have seen for the first time in dwarf-movies and sometimes I have been very fun watching. There are a number of prominent TV / commentators who appeared in the first part, in the fantasy costume, the smallest parts of their stand-up-program and the second film to fight for the second. Everything is already there .... nothing new to get. You always feel like you have to put in every camomologist in the last decade that you are often familiar with boring and dumb "jokes" and want to get back to their goal platform. There is nothing important about this story: the story of Roopswiltkkin's fairy tale without any significance. I guess something like that but I'm not complaining about it. I'm complaining about the lazy story writers who have the whole theme story; Their only business was to get a lot of jokes and sorrows, but they did not. Except for the waste of time and money except the great performance of this garbage hell sneezing. (If you do not like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation) If you want to save your money and get bad jokes then it's widely played on SAT1 or RTL every Friday evening to see the worst. I'm sure you will recognize some of the "langers" I have seen last night in the movie.
