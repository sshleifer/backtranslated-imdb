I saw a lot of bad movies, too !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby really. Almost every Saturday night is a group of friends and I'm looking at the garbage around and around the globe - anything. Turkish veteran movies, Brazilian, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Costner movies, Vampire wines from anything (perhaps the exception of Helen Raising), but Ihave never been a WORST movie than Theodore REX. Never. And it's not an entertainer in an ed Wood too - it's just a success. Now the film is notable in Hollywood because the hoop has pulled out the gloves, told the press and others, when she tried to get out of her contract, she was moaned by CRAP = whined, but she was horrified to see this leathery skin furry coffee !!! And she can just look at her seating - doing everything but she's looking off the camera for her agent so she can scream him. There are three facial expressions about the dinosaurs and the script can do a good job if the third class class promised cookies is terrible.
