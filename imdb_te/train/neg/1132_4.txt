The ultimate warm-up point of this star's point is to make Bourne's story the ultimate success all the more spectacular. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a real woman who does not imprison her, but she plays a rising reputation and can never convince them that they have gained profits from this assault. Even in lengthy scenes of Esther's acting lessons, she can not see her teacher's fulfillment. With the sudden details of Esther (who is more confident) with pain, we do not get any sense of her success. <br /> <br /> The constant presence of pain in the heroine seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic surge. Furthermore, the causes of this pain (poverty, partial-autism, Judaism, and sexual betrayal) have never had a coherent amount. The 163-minute film with a simple plot ends with its loose ending. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go to the audience.
