I thought the participants in the "survival of Christmas" did not have many ideas in this film. The characters are so unequal and the plot is less understood, even though it is a little bit of a draft of the script, a single-liner concept of a great man to spend Christmas with him. /> <br /> Ben Affleck Drew Lotham, a wealthy, eccentric advertising executive's typical Hollywood image, buys his life. His girlfriend, Missy, leaves him for a short while before Christmas because she wants Fiji to take her for Christmas, calling her a "Family Holiday" and Drew never introduced her to her family. We learned that Drew's father left when he was four when he was about to leave, and that his mother was dead, so he did not have a girlfriend, let alone his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> With the fear of staying alone in Christmas, (Why I do not have any idea) the drawings are running. When he met the family living in his childhood home, Valcos and Drew gave him $ 250,000 for his family, so he continued his favorite childhood memories. He is angry when he later learns that he has an elder daughter, Alicia (Christina Applegate), because he "has no sister" and goes to write a script that follows for family members to deal more with his "real" family. <br /> <br /> Aliasia's role also refuses to play and play Droves' money for his family. Along with his fantasy. But without any good reason, she suddenly began to like Drew, and in a few minutes he hated his girlfriend for his girlfriend. Drew is such a complete jerk that his sad story about his childhood solitary Christmers is no sympathy; "I just kidding! The real reason my family did not see is that they all control orders against me!" (2/10)
