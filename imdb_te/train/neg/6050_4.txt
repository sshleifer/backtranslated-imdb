I can not believe the number of people that I am compatible with the first picture. It inspired me to leave this comment! This is an obvious attempt for the first film to successfully cash-in money. <br /> <br /> The storyline is funnier, funnier to the French police, and portraying Doyle, a mile away from the first film. /> <br /> How many transport officers would you like to go down to docks in person to come and see into a shipment? The ease that Doyle found on his person is just curiosity. As all French police simply drink coffee until Doyle turns from America and does some REAL police work. What a joke. I am going to a foreign city and try to avoid being disillusioned with the travel map and some tourist pamphlets. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Really a horror sequel, someone who does not think anyone is crazy.
