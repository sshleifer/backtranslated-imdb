Well, let's start by saying that no one will be surprised by this. It is said, my G-D, this film redefined! I mean, Wow, I do not know that they have the opportunity to throw as much money as they've clearly done at something and still have no chance to fall out worse than any Roger Carman film! Carman was probably pitching at some point in the film but he rejected the quality of the script! Only because he made the film in the first place, 'Hey, Zambia is famous. Video games are popular. Can we have any zombies that game? Resident Evil? No, someone else came first. Silent Hill? No, very silent. People do not need to panic in the dark room. Hey, does Sega people have a game that runs around zombies? <br /> In fact, the characters actually play the game in order to make a film that they feel like a video game and fight them. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem is the original game terrible. <br /> The garbage-film-merchandising-in-the-two-and-after-after-ship-in-the-door-and-by-the-more-morons-and the Christmas hridy for their-parents. The graphics are boring. The demons were boring. Levels are boring. The interface is boring. CASE is boring. In other words, this is a boring game. And that's the ARCADE version. The home version is even worse! With the home version, you can not even get a shotgun to hold in your hand while you're crazy bored by this meaningless game! <br /> <br /> The second issue is that they have gone through scenes from the original games in real-time scenes. Ah ??? Are not the editor's credentials in the influences that indicate that there is real fighting? Not to mention that each contest is shot from the perspective of the video game, which can be explained about the tedious use of matrix-style effects. Problem with this game is the first-person shooter (player player from POV). <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that has enjoyed this experience is remotely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that everyone in the theater is making a loud cinema, so crazy laughter and general belief I have taken my sudden laughs and have not removed me. <br /> Up, do not look at this picture! It should not be rented when it comes to the video in two weeks. Run. Just run.
