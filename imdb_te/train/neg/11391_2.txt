After I start looking at this film, I'm looking for some kind of subtle versions but I know that the movie is about the truth about the train. Interaction between people When you have a few interesting things in the street and in the scenario, the conversation becomes stilted and boring. This film is not about how people try to interact with each other, they are very boring in the film. If you want to see and explore these kind of relationships, actually go out and buy the train ticket and see the people on the train. It's realistic, but you can not see the movie to see the film watching movie.
