Finally, taking quality films (such as Minataur or Dog Soldiers) is a very bad bad luck. Grendel needs to be based on the great epic Beowulf, but it is very different (and relatively small), as the name 'some shitty Christopher Lambert film' on television. I did not expect the full-fledged Hollywood production to be accurate, but I think I did not interfere with the 'artistic integrity' of the original story (a little over two hours of storyboard flow). Do you know what the director and producers are doing? Have any research done in this research?). Beowulf and his team (Mul ) One major problem I have with Grendel's appearance is that he should be sixteen feet tall and 2 tons to wrestle him, be it not in every way as Grendel's death episode? In my opinion, one of the epic scripts created in the jam   ్ కంటే వాస్తవానికి ఉత్తమంగా ఉంది; ఉదాహరణకు: గ్రెండెల్ తన చేతిని బేవుల్ఫ్ ద్వారా సాకెట్ నుండి బయటకు తీసివేయవలెనని భావిస్తున్నారా? అతను 300lbs బరువు కనిపిస్తుంది ఒక క్రాస్బౌ నుండి ఒక పేలే బాణం ద్వారా నిప్పంటించారు తర్వాత ముంజేయి వద్ద కత్తిరించిన లేదు! And Grendel's mother When he died of his injuries, he would eventually die when she just combined with the dragon at the end of the epic? Honestly, what is hell with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this film because you have a connection to this movie, it is not really one (unlike character names). If you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Duffman) is the only way I could recommend this film ?? I do not recommend watching either.
