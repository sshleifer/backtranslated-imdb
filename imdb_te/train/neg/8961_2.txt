This film is another waste of time ... why oh I keep the worst rent like this? ... someone tell me ... * sigh * oh well. If you really enjoyed the first film, really like the first film (as I did), the cube zero is worth the job, and just want to check what's in the final (hopefully) picture of cured together just keep some poor job, then of course the Image for But good acting and watching a good movie with a fairy tale ... * Bad laughter * This film is perfect for you :-D .... ok I'm lying ... the film is good. OK, I have to admit that some elements are cool .. well .. cool .. and I laughed quite a few times, prolly at the wrong things, but I was amused. :-) But all that makes all "OK" category is not enough to make all this stuff worth the picture .. Ever is one of ten movies unless you count "Manos - Fate Hand"!
