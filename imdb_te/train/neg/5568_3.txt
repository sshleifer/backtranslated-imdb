Dalf Lundgren has acted as a former police / boxer who searches Boston's Kinki scene of killing his brother, who is well thought out in society, yet his brother Kinky enjoyed sex and blamed serial killer. Dalf Lundgren is a very good man in the film and actually forgets Lundren's rise to the renowned action roles, based on his performance. The matter material says that Lundgren worked on nothing, in fact, Lundgren left to dry in a daunting thriller which was completely predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Daniel Brett is also good, in fact the film works best, while concentrated around Lindgren and Brett's chemistry, which took time to explore the film's good relationship. Nevertheless, the film is poor, does not work, the plot is not enough (his brother's owner's Lundren's investigations are very boring B.S) and the film is nail and funnier without the need. Once again, Lundgren is really very good (Danielle Brett is new) but the film succeeds from a sequence to the next level, which is particularly disappointing. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ***********************
