The film made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters had a southern slang. I know that I lived in Iowa for 29 years and people here do not have South South American accent. This film is about Meth and I'm not a real plot or about a guy who suppose about the film. It has some gorgeous graphic drug use and it is really insulting, so see this person using methi as sugar. I will lose my brother and I am ill with my stomach as the film is glamorous. The film is good to use the drug, but I'm happy when that person finally gets up. I also know that most women experiencing a traumatic rape do not like to love their friend or husband the next day. The picture is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "basketball diaries" if I'm going to suggest a picture about medication.
