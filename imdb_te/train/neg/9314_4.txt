Well ... overall, the film is not quite a lot of work, and it's a fiery movie because it's ridiculous. I rented this movie last night when I and my friends went to the blockbuster looking for a horror movie. This is not exactly what we're looking for, but it's satisfied to us for humor. The actors (especially Brandon) laughed in the film. And most importantly that Tracy girl was in the room where she climbed to tell the clown to go. They do not show any emotions and are clear that they are acting. And even when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and mocks the mark, he does not even look like he was scared even as the clown started to catch him and attack him. And you're seriously, will you be jogging if you're abandoned? I like running for my life! Denis and Tracy throws her head back to Denis when she throws her head into flown, as the clown makes chops off Susan's head in the forest, not to mention that the effects are not great (although someone is probably outrun that clown because he is like 300 pounds). Like the previous Guy's comment, I did not even see why the concept was definitely NO concept and why it was included in the movie. So, what happened in 2003? By the 1980s, it made the sound of the music made, and the camera-ink (?) Did not appear to be really professional. Half the time, the camera should not be in a constant state when it is supposed to. Overall, I tell you that I enjoyed the film. I do not recommend it if you're trying to find something to intimidate, but if you're looking for something fun or a smile, I would definitely recommend it.
