I've always been interested in Bigfoot, so when I was browsing for a movie for the movie it caught my eye. It's WORST $ 4.50 I've spent and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money !! This is one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole image was very boring and I found my eyes rolling a lot and I did not even see it all the way through it. I was frustrated with it. The acting was terrible, the effects were terrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. It added all the time and money up to a really bad, boring image and total waste. I hope one day they'll make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then, I have to sit through countless little duds like this to find the true masterpiece.
