Very honestly, the omega code is the worst picture I've seen in a long time. In the first 30 minutes I was surprised at my seat and I was trying to decide whether I would like to make a refund. But since I did not pay to see the first place (passes), I found myself to stay the same. <br /> I did not think it would be worse. I quickly run through the fewer points (with some spoilers): Kasper van Dean's Gillley Lane, a terrific false propaganda like an inspirational speaker with two PhDs. The character is uneven; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is full of knit. Then there is a lame-in description of the fulfillment of the Bible prophecies; We see a bunch of soundbites of sensational news together with the ridiculous computer print outs of translation bible code. Also, the terrible "action" sequences: Lane escapes from harsh conditions without explanation, and at one point the lane does not actually look at the danger, it becomes a dream sequence! It's gorgeous for school writing work, but it's a troublesome plot device in the film. Pacing bad: After a long opener, the first three hundred seconds of film changes are in each scenario. Next, the speed increases, but there is still much unnecessary jumping around. And as someone has said, there is nothing for years (not even Lane's daughter). <br /> <br /> There are some good things. The image quality (eg lack of grain) is high and very attractive. Outdoor shots are well made and the city shooting adds a touch of realism. Επίσης, there are a few moments in the end of the Law help eventually (eventually) to help him - it proved to be very joyful - for me, even someone who would not accept personal personal savior. I liked it because it hit me for a real real scene in the film. <br /> <br /> The characters, dialogues, directions, and performances are all poor. Michael Ironside did nothing and Michael York was just unreal. I think producers do a lot; If the plot is more rigid and focused, and the character becomes even worse, the film would be very good. <br /> <br /> "You do not have to pay to see this. <br /> <br /> I'll give it from ten stars. <br /> <br />
