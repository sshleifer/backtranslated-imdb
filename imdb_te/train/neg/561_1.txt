Well, I saw this film yesterday and it - unfortunately - worse than you think. The first of all the plots is idiotic, it makes no sense. Playing on the screen is intentionally full of funny words. The audience is laughing several times. The suspense is very low. Actors have some good moments, except Sharon Stone, but there are also some bad acting moves. When she is aggressively trying to be sexy and says, "I'm * beep *", it's too much physical, a very mature woman rarely deals with it and it's not sexy. Sexual tension from BI1 has gone completely. The usual film from the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 - is typical of the DVD, rather than the original, on the lower liner. For example, the scene of crazy pleasure did not work properly. Basic Instinct 2 is not director Paul VÃ¤hverv and it shows. The new composer is Jerry Gold Smith and its performances. Joe Esserthas is scripted by no comparable individuals. There is no alternative to Michael Douglas. The film is edited at cheap and bad times. I'm sorry but after I leave the theater my first idea is: "why is this film a first victory, why is heaven with real skills behind?" This is the same as Citizen Kane for all the original. The first Basic Instinct is broken down in a classic and popular movie. It's provocative, sexy and controversial. It is her best known actress Sharon Stone. This particular Paul has a style of Vershon. Unfortunately the Basic Instinct 2 is unexpectedly a funny film, badly directed and is certainly the winner of the Razzie Award in many ways. They have a pity made by this film.
