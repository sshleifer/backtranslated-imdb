I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I was feeling like ripped off, but I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I found the real songs of a holy grail, bad cinema. If you have an empty stadium early dramatic shots filled successfully with the awkward camera address statement of Evel, wait for the Opel Credits to roll on the butt. This script is pasted with press clips and ESL textbooks. But ... I can not believe how bad that George Hamilton is. There is absolutely no connection to what he says, the only inner statement I can recognize is "I'm pretty pretty!" This is an epiphany! I know how bad it is now.
