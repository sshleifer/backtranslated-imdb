With the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), Risk Life and Limb to provide a Live Broadcast to show Doom in the hands of Reporter (Rachel Morris) and her cameraman (William Garre√±a). Love yourself and do not see. This issue is clearly a very low budget and a high school game feel bad. Acting is bad and the zombies with hungry meat are almost joking. Also found are: Michael Propaster, William Decoff and Brenda Hogan. Massi should be hungry when eating.
