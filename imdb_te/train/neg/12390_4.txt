After watching the film's heaviest sensor version of the television years ago, I'm curious to see the correct version. I'm incredibly optimistic and I am surprised that I have acted better than I remember, but one thing really stands out. I think other reviewers have also mentioned this, namely, what exactly is the nature and inspiration of the character of Chris Sarandon? Has he been raped by other victims before? Is he totally mental or "average" sockopathy? How did he expect to be away from his attack on his sister? Whether this character is all credible or is it necessary to have more background? He is simultaneously an uncomfortable believer, and is very lucky to catch up with the teaching of the young and the inferior girls. This is usually a big complaint of the audience. It did nothing with his performance, it was horrifically convincing. This film has a disadvantage between the lowest extortion and the acute treatment of half way, without completely settling into the mode. The worst image ever made, but all is good, either.
