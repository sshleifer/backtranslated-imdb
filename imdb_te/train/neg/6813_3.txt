Jean Rolin's artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and quest for immortality. <br /> Women are beautiful and photography is excellent. The dialog is inactive. It's a ridiculous mess. Great to see but no horror of a horror film or thriller is absolutely horrifying. I'm trying to figure out if I do not panic or think. At the same time did it or not? The art film and the horror meshes a lot of its an odd mix and its nice to see if it's an occasional shot or sequence frisson creates a moment and even any scary meaning "pointless" anything, and its never ever so imposing couples. Something to leave the background of a living wall paper for naked women.
