It may be fashioned to highlight every social misconduct as a result of patriarchy and men's dominance, but this may be unrealistic 'logic'. But within the story and background of the film, there is no gray area and the villain of the film, the "villain of the story". Under no circumstances she was not upheld. Women's sexuality is just hype in this case and actually nothing. This is the ultimate betrayal. The person who spends his time and time in wasteful harvest of another's offspring. To top it, arguments argued by 3 freed women's roles in the climax are very weak.

In some societies where justice is still ongoing, such conditions apply unfairness.
