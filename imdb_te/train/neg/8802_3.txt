Look, I loved the movie Proper Ankorman, but this is reaaaaallly bad. The bad type of desire that you want to get back in your life is the kind of bad that you think about what you think on earth, the bad type of bad looks that you have taken 50 minutes when you enter the kitchen to catch a snack. They want to rent. <br /> <br /> There are some semi-laughable laughs in the game but they are less than anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but the entire subplot that went out of Anchorman was left for a really good reason ... it's not even good. <br /> You do not have to meet yourself (or in the USA, a favor), and do not watch this DVD ... It's ankorman and you want to tarnish a good movie that you do not want to do that. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
