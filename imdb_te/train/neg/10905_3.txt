Guy is a loser. Do not get girls, need to build, stronger can choose by more successful guys, etc. Seeing it, it is shaken. I would say Rob should be part of Adam Sandler in his life. And get out of Adam Sandler's plot. There are two funny episodes in the film. I could not finish the last 5 minutes. I was frustrated. "The Animal" is an alright film. I do not enjoy the Adam Sandler movies that usually have the same plot. But it is very difficult to impress. Jokes are too old. So trust me. This is not a movie that most people really get. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
