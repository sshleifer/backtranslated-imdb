You immediately recognize the plot. The divorced couple's daughters are trying to get back to their mother and father again. Yes, it's the theme of the parent trap in 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the spooky thing. While Diana Durbin is younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills, Durbin appears to be the oldest when playing her daughter (s) roles. And she does all the so-called siblings. <br /> <br /> This chaos between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls wore outfits in tiny sailors but the director look ridiculous in them as it seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. So you're constantly torn between thinking kids or women. When Ray Milland and others start "tapping" they get the feeling that they are pedophiles, and you may be one, the director pointed out to the tuts and tops. <br /> <br /> Parents are also very old, the whole movie will be a very long time. <br /> <br /> This is a rusty version of the parent's trap and you can not avoid it or make sure that your tetanus shots are fresh if you do not believe me.
