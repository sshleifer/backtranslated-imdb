Obviously, most viewers do not care for Things to Come (I "Things to Come to the Comp"). That is a good chance that I will enjoy more than I did. <br /> Director is directed by William Cameron Menzies, a very experienced and still an art director as a production designer, a film adaptation by HG Wells of his own novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> The film opens in London-like "Every Town" in 1940. War broke out and every citizen of the country is afraid to reach them. It does. And it turns out to be a decade of destruction that destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies will move forward to show us the various scenes and the consequences of the war. We are two pilots, one collapse, and their fighting consequences. We meet a post-war society that will be a post-apocalyptic warrior. We met a man from a prosperous future society. We'll see the way technology changes. Finally, we are carrying the full realization of the future society called Circa 2036. The merits of sending humans to the moon are discussed. <br /> It's potentially very exciting, but it just does not work as a movie. Structurally, the film is very episodic, dramatically tied together. In the third section, I'm totally interested in tracking the letters. I could not get them out in the first couple sectors. There is a constant procession of new faces. <br /> <br /> Personal divisions with a couple exceptions are directed and edited nicely. They are also occasionally reversed - it almost feels like a promotional film. <br /> In fact, the Overlong section is a music video / industrial promotional video. The shots of future City builds, with lots of large machines, a lot of welding, and so on. At one time, the person who found the astronaut waves in the camera through a future glass kind. This section is somewhere between music theoretical and the biggest horror score. <br /> <br /> But the simple cry of support for "Things to Come" says this is "a movie about ideas". It may be true, but that's a couple problems. <br /> This is a visual and audacious drama art and has two ideas that are presented here. War and what it does to civilizations. It's a fine thing to make a film about. Things to Come is a script and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936), which is a prominent role in World War II. There are some interesting things to say about Wells War, some of which are against the general interpretation of the film. For example, the ending suggests that it will break another war or at any time. The whole message seems to be disappointing. Wells has emphasized that "progress" is not excluded, but war is emphasized that war is only part of mental nature - in fact, the fuels progress is at least indirect. It is perfectly suited for an image. However, there are many ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more sharp scenes of the film. It deals with complicated difficulties. One pilot shot down the other, but is now coming to help him. But a toxic gas that was shot dead by the pilot is now building across the field. They can not breathe without harm. A girl comes together. There are only two working gas masks between them. The shot dead and the pilot gives his mask, telling him he is dead. What to do This scene is even longer, but ideas - hitting each other in the battle and trying to make a film - a bizarre complexity. <br /> <br /> Another example. After postwar postwar war, there is a unfortunate epidemic that circulates around "bitter illness" in post war post warfare. It turns into victims like drunk zombies. It is a common practice to shoot victims on the site in an effort to prevent the disease. This subject is treated as an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Wells noted that the future society has controversial socialist ideas. That's enough for its own image. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Still, there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one view. If you're in all sci-fi bough, this is a historically important movie. Although the cinematography is outdated, the production and set designs are interesting, in the background of Menzies' background. It's also interesting to see what Wells is a favorite or repetitive comic in his "predictions." I especially enjoyed the paths of the moon, which reminds me of George Melius' 1902 on the moon tour (Le Voyage Dance Law Linz). Do not expect too much from Things to Come.
