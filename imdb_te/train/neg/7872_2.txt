Everyone who wants to become an editor must watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake you do not want to edit a movie! I have been able to do better than my grandma! But the only reason why this film is really bad! This is the first one of the sequel receipts, if it is a good family comedy with the first episode of funny whistles funny jokes and cult dialogues (this is very bad! Funny episodes can be counted in one hand and half of it. Clavier has played more than half of her role, trying to act like Robin Lehmersier (instead of her husband), but it is strange. Lemursior lemursier, robin robin! Although Murray Robin was able to make herself funny on stage, she did not act in the film because she did not use it to act. I know that I can be difficult to replace a good man in a role (LeMerzier received a Cesar Award for her role in the first film) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played LeMsire's character '! For the story, it's so much more! In fact, we learned that there was a sequel at the end of the first film, but Pueri and Clavier who tried to write a linear story like the first part would try him. Repetitive, childish and déjà-wu are fraud. No, really, this is not more than 3 funny episodes. Only good things can be costume and some special effects. So there are just 2 reasons to see it: 1) If you want to waste your pictures or if you really need a boglessless moment 2) If you want to know how to do a song! 2/10
