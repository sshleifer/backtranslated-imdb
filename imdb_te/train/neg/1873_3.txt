You have to be fun !!!! Parker Posey is really an actress, and the opportunity to be a bit of a "month club of the actors" is not just a few entries. Really, unless David's mommette is in the tongue-in-cheek satire - the cumbersome confusing dialog machine gun reparation or the uniformly (think Ben Stain) courtesy - or a flat-out dry comedy; The film is a Rotten Tomato Award - or worse. <br /> <br /> If tight and inconvenient pose is not enough, we are stronger and more inconvenient. Jeff Goldberg. <br /> <br /> Adding to this weird cast, there are many other characters from the most top-acting American actors in the United States, who seem to be fleeing from Don. Even though the term "is" as Pardo, or "Bean", even the Kid brings to our attention the fact that this film is very low, we are analyzing his voice guessing if he is Canadian or not !! I've sincerely laughed in the places where I feel strongly and take serious sections that are humorous. The soundtrack for Alamick Johns' music for Mamate's "The House of House" is also a soundtrack. If a spoof is taken, the film is almost dot; If you take it seriously, just a self-conscious drain piece.
