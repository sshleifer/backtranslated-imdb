Do not make me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are fantastic, and the drama is dramatic. However, it's a big disappointment and I've been very angry at what Disney did. <br /> <br /> The BBC's Planet Earth is above and above all. It's subtle. It has a whole sense of balance and has shown a complete circle of life and death. There is tragedy and success, loss and profit. <br /> <br /> The editing of the Earth's Disney is not this. They tried to make a picture of which Americans talk. They made it dramatic. They put one on the top musical score to scare us. They have corrupted the wicked. They are evil. Each encounter was shown negatively. It tried to succeed and succeed, but at the expense of the lesson of the balance. The film is an hourly and negative image and is only 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I am out of the way to avoid world alert, but it is the top political and environmental waste. <br /> Another thing, I went to see the big screen, but was disappointed in the quality of the film. It looked good on my TV at home. <br /> If you want to see this, get the whole picture, go out and buy the BBC's Planet Earth Series, rent or take. This is an improved image quality, improved sound and better (if Blu-ray).
