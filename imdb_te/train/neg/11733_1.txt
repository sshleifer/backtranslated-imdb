I'm surprised that there are people who love this movie .. I saw in Tribeca and it did not laugh at the scenes that many of the audience did not have fun. Because the main actress was in the audience I felt bad, but honestly the plot to this film required the MAJOR revision .. It does not make sense, the letters of a second characters snorting what they are exactly .. What they are helpless to do and how to do it? Even the end just took the cake .. I'm going to spoil the amazing ending .. but pretty much terrible plot / combine with the rest of the script ... you should see the comedy this movie ..
