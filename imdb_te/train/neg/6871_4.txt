A great feeling was wrong. Poor performance, worst writing .... After seeing the first two episodes, I thought about why I have done both at any time. The characters are unforgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just OK. Special effects are just sad - at the same time-frame are getting better - where does this money go? The first episode begins with interesting, then downhill will go faster - the rule of the whole show is just silly. Now I'm not wrong, I'm a huge size fize fan and 'geek' - but this show just does not cut. As I mentioned at the beginning, I am really surprised by it for two seasons - one season afterwards (Jake 2.0 for example) was canceled. This program is just bad.
