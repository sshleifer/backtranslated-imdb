I like to watch movies from around the world that we are not allowed to see it as a cast member, a band member of all basketball games, banned in Oregon. This was due to a deal with producers and director Oregon University. It seems that the sign U of O is shown. During the shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson is very memorable as one of the most evil mannered men I met. A young man is 20 years old. Though Hollywood thinks about it, it's not exactly that the campus's life is really what was in the late 60s and early 70s. Trombone player from Oregon
