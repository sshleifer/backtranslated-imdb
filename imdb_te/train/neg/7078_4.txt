If the film does not focus too much on 3/4 sex scenes, the film might be a good B-movie. I mean, he is a sex addict, and I'm sure there is so much that goes with sex slaves outside of having a steady basis sex. Michael Des Barres has done a good job, not what's beyond, it's not too much. At one time or another, he has to laugh at him, because his character is very pitiful. Nastassja Kinski's corresponding sex therapist is better in her role, she's made more while and I'm not suggesting that she has sex. Roshan Arquette is the most romantic and affectionate wife of me in the film, in which she plays a role. I have great appeals about the beautiful injecting and outdoors. <br /> <br /> When she played the role and you saw the movie, you started to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "The Diary of a Securus Slave" is not a modern classics of the Oscars or anyone whose standards do a fair work when showing you how to think of one's individual demons and destroy many things in life.
