Spoilers are all too often, entertaining pieces of Shakespeare's simulations of Hollywood's movie pieces. Beautifully filmed they perform text and are faithful. Images like Brong's "Henry V" and 1993's "Much Ado About Nothing" have powerful performance. So looking "LOVES LABOR LASTST", it's very disappointing for disappointment for disappointment. Sadly "Lost Lovers Labor" is awful! Navaratra king (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends left drink and women for three years. France's unparalleled Princess (Alicia Silverstone) and plans are different when she arrives. Soon love is in the air and philosophy is in the mind of the prince. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, you realize that the film is not Shakespeare. The 1930 music concert by Ken Branagh was transformed into a discourse, the plot still exists, and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed in favor of horrible musical flavor. <br /> <br /> <From the weak singing, we are also being treated for a number of awkward performances by regular stars. <br /> <br /> The main eight actors (four men, four women) are equally terrible and are just positive <br /> <br /> In fact, one person alone is getting the film that is appreciated, and it is a stunning fantastic Nathan Lane. He proved Lane in years that he was comedy genius, and in this feature he once again adds a funny air to Houster Coaster. <br /> There is a little bit more to say. Bring's original story of "Loves Labors Lost" is worthy of the old story in the old story. Unfortunately, here's the positive ending here. Weakly acted, performed, sung and constructed, "Loves Labors Lost", probably the last forty years of Shakespeare's adaptation. This should not be used as a plague. Brunag is a poor, disappointed choice and hoping his next effort here is well.
