Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Nightmare's sixth instrument in Elm Street series and another bad sequel. I feel like I'm tied with this Dream Child's last sequel. I'm lucky enough to get a nightmare on the Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday so I saw all the sequels. At least these two sequels are at least disappointing, at least the last two, Freddy seems to have lost its edge. It is almost as though the writers are trying to give a soul to Freddie, and instead of destroying the story, it is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Freddy Krueger refreshed. <br /> <br /> Freddie returned, but we do not know, daughter. Maggie, she does not know that she is her father, but soon finds out what his dark secrets and she needs help. She has to do her best to cope with her powers, but she makes all the good memories of her loving father difficult. Ionic, is not it? <br /> <br /> Freddie Dead: The Final Nightmare also displayed in 3-D, radical, huh? Notice the irony. One of these worst sequels, it's tied to Nightmare's fifth sequel in the Elm Street series, and I'd rather be honest with Elm Street Second Nightmare. It's bad acting, stupid editing, and all the bad ideas for a story. I did not like the feeling and it ruined the fact that Freddie Kruger really was, the nightmare of the nightmare, the father is not the best. <br /> <br />
