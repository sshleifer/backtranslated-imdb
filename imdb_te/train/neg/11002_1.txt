The most prestigious film is ridiculously guaranteed, everyone can guarantee - what do you imagine? It's working, I'm offended by this shed money out of the rent. Two friends and I decided to get bored and see if all that bull is true about the movie we saw on TV. Comedy Central and all the other networks that push us this trash! It's the worst movie ever seen from Man in the Holland. I usually avoid crappy ones, but this has got sucked into one. We rented it, and removed the powers of his movies. There's nothing remotely funny about this film ... "Digman's stunts" scene is better sophomoric .. Color me p *** ed. For some important reasons productivity may be worse ... whatever it sucks. Look at anytime! Any reason. This film is not even funny in the tremendous amount of illegal materials. It says ALOT. If you want to be holy, if you respect your intellect, you will never see this movie. It's a lot of things - stupid, meaningless, and some not worth mentioning. But the main objective is that it is aimed: dangerous funny - it failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
