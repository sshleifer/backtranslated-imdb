I recently watched with my wife and it was better than Cain, though it was a good cop. In this role, Britain's regular screenwriter has never been so interested in, as he is more confident about his performance as it is a pity. Rex Harrison suffers very little, perhaps surprisingly, because his character is very poorly written. William Holden is good, but his screen time is futile, and again, his character is not well scripted. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman I've ever seen, but given much less to do, the movie may have made a great deal of focus on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but mainly plays a very comic role with the serious tone of the film. The music is very small and Omar Sharif has one of his many nonsense cams (his career is based on decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer is a infuriatingly unforeseen movie director, who does not want to direct this more efficiently, and this is one of his weakest films.
