The standard "paint-by-numbers" monster fills a large collection of plots from large-organistic movies. It contains a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them, which are shuffled and dealt. The plot and characters that came into the contract were thrown into the script anyway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are much worse, and you need to root the creature to close them. Some of the main characters include: Birley Idol clone, surfers with sharks, a loudsmith brat who broke bank rolls, a captain Ahab Guy with a vibrant, and a buddy dancer in a bar. Oh, and big, big beast that requires anger management treatment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Along the way, people argue a lot, charming girls run around wet shirts, couples appear to be made of exotic beaches, explosions, ruins of a pilgrimage, and come through greedy-faced pirates. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ After a violent death, they make a liner jokes. <br /> <br /> Overall, you have 90 minutes waste, and you want to laugh with a very bad-looking picture. Otherwise, you can skip this.
