With Adam Sandler. <br /> This is one of the most idiot films ever made. It wants to be a cruise ship cruise ship on a cruise ship waiter shekel (sandler). First off, I honestly do not have a funny or brilliant line in the whole movie. It is inappropriate, so it is remorseful. Surprisingly there is not much raw or sexual humor, but F-word is abundant. The budget is really low and it also destroys the movie. It happens on a cruise ship, but they have only money to rent a small boat and have only money for 10 ship extremes, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are relatively cheap animated, and it's just curiosity. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and it also hates everyone who sees it. <br /> 86 minutes. R is rated for language.
