I would not have seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone that's going to scroll down this distance: The Wicker Man is the worst movie I have ever seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or look back at the time to warn me not to see <br /> <br /> I'll give you two positive steps. The irony of the cage's character was at least laughing at me and the scenery from the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes the gears. The plot of the film is only the other characters because the progressive cage does not give any direct answers - and he keeps up with this !!! My time on how to go for this (very short days in the picture) is beyond me for over an hour. <br /> <br /> The plot is filled with holes. You leave the theater with questions that are not enough to fill a library. Anyone could think of reading this script and how it is beyond me, "yes, people should pay to see this shadow shape what the image should look like $ 11". <br /> <br /> Do not look like this movie. Or rent on DVD.
