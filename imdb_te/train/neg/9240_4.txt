The idea of ​​making small things about Berlin's flight seemed to be one of the more interesting German (post) motion pictures. This is not a much-researched theme. However, the creators of this series were laid down by clichés. <br /> <br /> Direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor' is already started with the DVD cover of the film. <br /> <br /> Louis Kielberg (Betina Zimmerman), her husband, (Ulrich Notten), died in Russia and struggled to survive after the war. She gets a job at the American base, working for the coolest and highest level officer in the town (Heino Ferch), who falls in love with her, and becomes pregnant, and her husband is getting up again. Come on !!! This time we have seen many times. Hino Ferch and Ulrich Nieten played their role well; Betina Zimmerman is not really convincing. For some reason it seems that she has been somewhat delayed to give her the right emotional response. It did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Action scenes with airplanes and air lifts, we are sometimes stimulating, often not. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of WWII movies, I have suggested you spend a lot of money on something: chocolate ice cream is very satisfying! <br /> <br />
