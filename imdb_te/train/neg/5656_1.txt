Jiaba la Tacol al-Laehm is an awful movie. It's super hoop of scenes without a clear link. Even though Elizabeth is a good actor like El Alloyle, it's also very bad. But in the film, it's rare in Arab film about sexuality, women's liberation and nude scenes. I really like to congratulate the director and actors for their courage. We want to see this style in Egyptian films, but with good quality. The reasons for the film's defeat are visual and acting, lack of propriety. This movie looks enthusiastic. It can see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic film Ziab la Takl al lahm is not a recommendation. Your friends and your family will do the same if you want to encourage uncritical movies in the Arabian world.
