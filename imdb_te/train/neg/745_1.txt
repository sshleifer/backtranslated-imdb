I'm not really sure how bad the movie is to be described. I love bad movies because they are very entertaining. I love the bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and useless directions. Except for the music (better than I expected), the film has all of those characteristics. <br /> <br /> Special effects are amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. There are also some scenes in the Thunder Child, mechanical step, Big Ben scene, and the woman being crushed by train ruins ... Wow, there are very bad effects! On the plus side, however, some scenes of alien walkers take place well. <br /> Acting is perhaps the HG. Wells may be directly dependent on the book. To have a good source of material, the actors are trying to make it more funny. And then there's the myus ... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. However, half the film has only acting. The rest are characters that portray the aimless and poorly presented effects. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hines is a useless director to say unfinished directors are unfair. With the use of different color filters between shots for a particular reason, the background of the unwritten applications in the scenes, bad green screening, the film has never been approved to direct a movie anytime. I can not imagine that this bad movie can be converted into a brilliant book. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to those who watch this movie is what I need to do: bad movies, drinks, poker playing, drinking and drinking all this way. It makes for a wonderful bad movie, so have fun and laugh with you crazy with this disaster.
