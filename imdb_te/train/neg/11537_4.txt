For a little longer, I made a very low estimate of the progress of these films. I was interested to see what they could do with both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, looking for what would come with Dan Reed, but unfortunately it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the film does not really understand the style, because it is falling into it and it is a bit of a jack rather than focusing on one of them and failing to impress over drama, horror and thriller facts. . <br /> <br /> The premise (related to the most venerable images) is simplistic, a simple formula and many directors have managed deftly over the couple to meet and get out of the way and get their revenge. As Don Reed intended, it was not right in this case, "It's great to do one of those revenge films, which is more human-handed for all the characters and more detailed in their mental state." Wrong! There are also some key elements, and this kind of picture is usually kind of a warning. Do not do this or it may cause an element that adds tension but there is no such thing here. It just happens, then nothing happens, then something interesting happens and it ends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of really competing competition in this genre and no problem with his directing abilities but also the writing word for trying to read Don Reid's hats ... I'll stick to the principle for the kind of film he's trying to be rather brilliant instead of next time And he will have a quality image of hands.
