Wesley Snipes is James Dial, murderer of the murderer, CIA agent and pure evil-donkey specialist. <br /> <br /> In his free time, Dial cats can dial horse dogs with macho names such as cowboy hat and beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Agent Collins, his supervisory officer. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist in UK custody. <br /> <br /> The United Kingdom is an allied state and is a great place for covert spots and head shots outside the coats. <br /> <br /> This murder is a big hit. <br /> <br /> Dial's partner and local connection is killed when trying to escape the police, and Dial will become a hot asset to London Capers for trying to dispose of him and the CIA. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves to hang out with the cold-blooded killers with warrants to arrest the house safely for dial and help them avoid bad UK law enforcement ... <br /> < br> Such a script should I say more? Plus side Wesley Snipes on Wesley Snipes (Be a Pro or a Can) and the movie is very submerged. Minus editing is very inequality and agility on the stomach.
