Director Barbet Schroeder once believed to have done a majestic and very funny maitrace (1976), and now hopes to make the number of Hollywood thrillers "by numbers". <br /> <br /> This is a very lightweight John Grisham material, with a TV movie plot crossed. Bullock Kass Mayweather is a deadly and independent criminal investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her resident police partner Sam Kennedy, and they make a disadvantage duo. <br /> <br /> If we fail to create two unbalanced college badgers (Gosling and Pit) and Chaplin any sparks by planting very ingenious and misleading forensic evidence at a criminal, we also have a number of dull-dramatic past explaining an important event in Kass history to give up. Of course there is no doubt there is no doubt that the end of the OTT will be set in the lag cabin often there are shots. Oh ... the weather. <br /> <br /> See the episode of CSI instead. It is point and very exciting.
