Well, I agree with an Orthodox woman living in Borough Park, and I show little bit of bias on this film. However, Boas Yakin's only intention is to be an orthodox-bashing in the film. With our feasts, modest clothing and different seats, we're already pretty light. Yakin never went beyond the surface. The result is a picture with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Meet Sonia with Sonia. He deliberately refused his father's order because he would swim because of his health. 2. Sonia goes to her son's marriage. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong response? I believe that she will never attend. Let's face it, the reformed Jews also celebrate the Bris Mala celebrations these days. 3. Is Mandel sleeping in his Culan classes? He wants to be satisfied with his wife's wishes in bed and stay away from her kisses on the street. Especially in the middle of a crowded street in Borough Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel have to marry for a year, and notice that they are not intended for each other now? A little clue - arranged marriage girl does not mean that her parents take the first person to arrange herself. If the marriage does not work, she will avoid the community. If Sonia really wants to enter the jewelry business, she does not have to go through her gratifying brother. Traditional women doctors, lawyers and teachers. Sonia has come a little lighter than sympathy. Instead of controlling her life, she sat down and waited for things to happen and complained that she did not like the result. It does not stand up to one's atmosphere; It was beaten to stereotypes. Frankly, I thought she was worthy of her.
