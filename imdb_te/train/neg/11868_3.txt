In the first opinion of a vampire story, "Hyper-Violence", Drugs, Gore, Sexual (including lesbian sex), a vampire story that some fans are not "a donkey" filled with enthusiasm and homosexuals! But the bad music (the '80s hard rock), the video tape, the ending is a real shame ... the sexy scenes are ridiculous, with the bad story (so thin) and bad acting - Gore is not very impressive. And those vampires reflect a mirror, and do not be afraid of the day! If you do not see it as "Space Rebellion" or "Troll 2", you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the blood lust will reach 100 below a day because it is a real place. <br /> If you are friends and have enough beer, 3/10
