Here is an interesting little picture gives the exact phrase "low budget" a terrible name. Our physical teacher, who has nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "atomic reorganization." Students were killed helplessly from fake coins of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurgence of classic B-movies from 50? No! It's a way off the mark, the high camp fun is not an example. The Glamour Showcase of the breasts and sacks cures our desire for happiness, opposes the horror, which should be 99.44% higher in the first place. Lower-barrel entertainment with the help of tall blood and dead pins of dead students. The horrific films like this event finally make the task of the intellectual guru Mad Munk (1970) to work with a masters degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so the rest is easy!
