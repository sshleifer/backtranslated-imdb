Shame Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Do not take children to watch this movie. Humor is completely inappropriate for kids - plus they are bored and frustrated. Sure * We've all read Theo's amazing children's book and certainly we have expectations ... but this is pure rubbish. <br /> <br /> Doctor Shues was shocked and did not give his "thumbs" in such a calamitous effort to invest in classics. <br /> <br /> Make money in your book. If you have a copy, purchase the book and donate to a toes for the totes program. This movie is not a "free" ticket view value. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a more visual role - save your money ... seriously. <br /> You save on your money - it will be on cable through the day of St. Patty.
