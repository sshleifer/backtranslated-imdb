A murderer, a cannibalist, was killed in a fresh murder scene by a crazed cop. Collected reproduction plans by peeing into a cult grave at his grave. Of course this works and he wakes up the boys can not afford penis and he is back to his old killing ways with a new zombie look. There are two cops who are going crazy about the city's scum and are back in the case with a drug problem. Two of the original members of the cult are also trying to stop the killer by reiterating the other kind of death. They departed as they were filing but original plastic baby doll from the grave was used in the original renaissance. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible and one of the cops is Dr. Vincent van Gore, the same person who plays in the lines of the series, he's just as terrifying as the annoying police in the film. Only other police are about to fight to get his terrible lines. Now I'm for a low budget movie but this movie is just terrible. It would probably have fallen asleep if it was not so easy for the eye women and their nudity. Gore is a bit but the victims never exceeded some animal guts on the stomach. The zombie makeup on the other side is great and he has a long penis on his feet to rape her victims. There is also a good view of the love killer sex doll. The toy with the Chipmunks Voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy in a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is very bad. You feel that you kill more than the killer. God knows how they made enough money to do the sequel. <br /> <br />
