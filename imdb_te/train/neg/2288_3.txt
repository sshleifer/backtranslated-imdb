Who is the Betty Page? I was not sure when I saw this film. From what I have collected from other sources, Mrs. Page is heavily in demand as "Queen of the Nine" films during World War II and this is exactly what the film portrays. However, I have never learned a woman named Betty. Her childhood in Tennessee is an evangelical Christian breeding and an immoral home life. The film was intended for the film's "naughty" films, making glasses of his personal life. In some frames the characters are introduced and left but she has followed her Betty frame in straight Bronx, her frame, Betty's fence and stockings, a bottle in Batez ... The film from the black and white color to the Miami Beach visits. Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go. Greaten Mole has played Betty as one of the most lazy young girls you ever meet. Betti responded to a friend and she could not get her high school attorney an A through - she could not think that there were only two students in the senior class. The most interesting part of the film is how bored in 2007. "Naughty" photos of "Page" appear. When you find a woman, a woman who has been cut as a pig in a spit is my space or u tub. I'm not sure if the film is poorly written or some of the mess editor pieces are cut. I would recommend it as a source for people who study the history of odd underdings.
