The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE will be a ruthless phone game play college kids who gets unexpectedly (for them, if not fans of horror) gets over their heads. <br /> <br /> The story of the 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, the promise of horror film is low, which is really sinful with the bad writing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the silly, old-shaped slasher story embarks at the beginning of its filmmakers' misleading belief that the audience is watching a bunch of loud, whiny rich kids wandering at each other for a lot of running time. With the exception of Police Detective, played by Rutger Hauer (a small character primarily designed for the film's unique star power), each character on the screen is a different species of young A-Hole. <br /> <br /> Black and white, straight and gay, shallow and dark college children carry a large of the whole ensemble narrative of children. Even worse, since dealing with a party game, the scenes are completely complete with this small b ***** ds. Because of this, the viewer has a few stops, so sniping the angry of the thin-drawn lead characters. Even though some of these people are supposedly friends, long before the real conflict actually arises, all the characters interact in a very contradictory manner. It leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film: the audience is intended to ignore the leads, rather than cheers on an anonymous killer, but wishes he had to start picking off the tightly parenting brackets. <br /> <br /> The 7EVENTY 5IVE actually has some probability if not a real shame of this poor quality. Visibly this is good. For the first time directors Bryan Hawks and Dean Taylor know how to build a breathtaking source. Even if the classic 80s-style gore is small, they can even deliver some competitors. Surprisingly, the casting of the product is also good. The actors can not express realistic human emotions; <br /> <br /> The screenplay (co-authored by the new watcher Nut and director Hooks, who worked better on the back of the camera compared to the keyboard) is less of such moments. <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE is rarely recommended, its familiar masonry and some thrillers can not overcome the bad taste left by a story trapped by unpleasant characters. In this caterpillar, true mystery is to care for anyone who does not like one of the folks who do not like each other.
