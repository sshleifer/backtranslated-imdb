The film is absolutely fine. A Pictic screenplay and lack of any story left me bikini three losing children. Sometimes I felt like I saw Beavis and Buthehead's episode. I can not even sit through the whole movie. Imran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrishita Bhatt does not impress everyone. Celina Jaitley is not bad. Ano is the only valuable part of the film with his invasion of Malik and Shiriyas. It's very fun. The songs are "Sini Ne" and its remix version is good. You can always calculate the empress lip-locking and chart buster in lip-synching. All of these seem to have a good script from Imran bots.
