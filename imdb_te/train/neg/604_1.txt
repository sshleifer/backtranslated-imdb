I hate this film and I am responsible for warning others. The film does not have story, plot or intention. The film begins after the protocol "scary" film intro, now every filmmaker becomes a favorite. So we can not start fully. We are soon getting acquainted with the lead actress and you know clearly that this is good for you to see your hard-earned waste and stability. (Unless you've seen the white noise - EEK) acting is a terrible and they all have to return to the pantomime of the journey from which they came. The best actors in the world said it would be difficult to see the film remotely. Their poor performances can only contribute to the disaster. The helpless violence and another "junky" writer who I can only imagine is the result of a film which is probably the one to test your endurance, perhaps as an artist. I did not realize that when my fellow cameras were coming to me, "We looked at the picture for 45 minutes," I did not realize that the film was tinted and tasteless without a tea bag. Apparently something is missing and unfortunately not audiences. Let's see what it is: than dumb blond (surprise surprise), victims, evil monster-guy-thing, about 2 minutes storyline about hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> Need a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking at some of the scenes, but expect her face to see the rest of the film ripped!
