Predict the worst ski sights from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute film. Now, imagine that all the humor in those wicked scouts has been removed and replaced with stupidity. <br /> Now, let's look at The Underground Comedy movie.

But it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you look at the film, my father will be funny. <br /> <br /> I'm not angry at seeing this thing and wasting my time. He wasted his money. Vince's offer does not write or direct anything and why it's not surprising.
