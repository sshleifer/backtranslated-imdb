Yes, I know that there is one of the few people who want to make this movie sleep in the dust. Let me tell you why I feel like this. <br /> <br /> * Speller ... I'm not sure, it's a zombie movie or a campaign like this. What to do to ruin * Let's start with the first big mistake. The film did not know "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and I did not see some scenes in which some of the blood was absorbed, and the connection with the vampires did not appear. I mean, FANGLESS ??? <br /> <br /> The second bad position: what is metal? All young people, but especially the so-called "vampires", have different kinds of metal, judging by their shirts! Do not make me wrong, I've changed music for more than 15 years, but I'm not going to scare me by showing me some ludicrous young men in Iron Maiden (in all bands!). Shirts walking around, playing vampires! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you ' The film is very strong because of the fact that the "Brilliant" director is not selected to create an artistic vampire topic, but I want to see vampires, but some stupas like my baseball bat <br /> <br /> Filmmakers say the film is "soft B-greater horror than a plot but without much gore." <br /> <br /> The film blames blasphemy against the whole concept of Vampire And it makes me sick.
