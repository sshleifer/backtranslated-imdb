I give Africa's beautiful pictures only 3 stars. The rest ... is pretty boring too. For about 50min we have the shape of the plot ... In World War I, part of the intro, oh, about about 10min? Then the real action! It will be: "Take a walk in Savannah and Gap in the beautiful sunset!". And perhaps delivering a message, "Do not kill elephants!". Very environmental. I do not expect this from the "new" Steven Segal film, but not from that ... the famous actress makes me think of artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and many foundation! And I did not see a scene where her hair was in chaos, or her sweats, or her clothes were dirty. She does not look like a 19th century woman! In the bar, they find our hero, Swayyi is a Dracula commenting on the commander. Mum, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, which became known in later years. Livingston and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So no action taken between 1896 and 1900. Houston has a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. as briefly - hard outside, but inside is smooth and cuddly. I'm not saying it's a hug with a nut, but you'll get the point. He really manages to have the puppy look hitting on his face in most cases. The film is way too long and boring. Do not watch this! Do not buy it! It's your money waste!
