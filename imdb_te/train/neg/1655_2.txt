This movie really shows its age. The printing age I saw was terrible due to age, but there were no good prints. However, this film is not a major issue. Although the film was created in 1933, it is a silent film with only a dialogue (silence) in the film's most enthusiastic style. At times, the characters become backsliding or talking with their hands on their faces - all hiding their lips and hiding the film "clean" (?). Well, this check image is needed to be translated into many languages, but it is really stupid and clear to do so. <br /> <br /> In total, the film has seen a low budget and crazy look. It's really insulting because of the grain of a good story - a young man who is married to an elderly, is not interested in gay or / or women. But in the 21st century, some people are really ready to sit through this ancient mess. With a few moments of naked (and slightly chunky) Handy Lamarre, it was not worth the fuss that came with the film when it started. Even with the 1933 standards, this film is a poorly made rubbish. The only interesting thing about the film is that when she came to America she saw how Lamer appeared in 1933 compared to Hollywood's attractive image - she looks completely different. Incomplete and technically inferior film, I do not see how to earn such rave reviews. For technical issues only, this film will not be close to 10 or so.
