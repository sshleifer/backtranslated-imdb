Really, really bad slasher movie. A mental man escapes from a shelter. Three years later he is a sociologist professor who kills the scene. After a semester yesterday (hey, that title card) is a new sociology professor at school. Another female sociologist who works there is friendship with the professor, and dating another professor. <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate that you have passed a long time. Scenes are pretty small, and cut for different utensils somewhere else, make for a little bit of what kind of progress. In most scenes the characters are walking and talking, or sitting down and giving a small intention. Although time has passed, many characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the Vulnerable Time When we find a body for a second time, we ask: How long is the body there? Yet, at least one of the dead does not seem to be missing others. <br /> <br /> The killer kills another person without breaking a person in the chest, and another by slashing her forehead. <br /> <br /> The video box cover is cheerleader: There is no one in the movie. The back cover includes a woman's group in a dormitory with a photograph in the graduation hat and gown. The central red head in the photo is in the film, but no one ever wear such clothes, there is no such scene. The killer is definitely one on top.
