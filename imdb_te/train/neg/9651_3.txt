The whole movie is the worst. Salman Khan has two good actors to attract false publicity and female audiences. The story is even worse. The characters are poorly filmed. Telling the story that does not exist. There is no editing to talk. Ajay Devgan is a rock star .. There is a dream in it. The picture is dragged along the downtrodden point. If Arjun wants Arjun to bring his manna to London, he must abandon his girlfriend and do not play in Wembley (Wimbledon in the dubbing process). Salman Khan is very sad to see the top acting or faking. I have seen some good films from this producer Vipul Shah but not one of them. All the good directors seem to be playing box office mania. This is another worst movie in the form of "Wanted" with idiot actor like Salman Khan. This is not a good Hindi movie. He is good to Indian cinema because he is in Titanic Winter Cruise business. In a positive note-I love the dance of the Asin character, the teacher did not see her turn to Western style dancing.
