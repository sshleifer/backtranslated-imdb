The real highlight in the film is the death of the sniveling person and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> For the 1990s horror movie, the two non-actress women each have at least one of their dresses. Women are not dominated, because she certainly has a good agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surfers are surrounded by filming of a really dumb and extreme sport called blood surfing. In this film, there is a huge salt water crocodile in this area. People will eat. <br /> <br /> I do not mind a bad horror movie, but I hate a dull evil horror film, which is definitely this.
