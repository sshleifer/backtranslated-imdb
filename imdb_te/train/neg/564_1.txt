Producers can not act in the lead role or make a big mistake in playing the role of an unmatched Mark Lester. Unlike his bad "acting", Lester's singing had to be dubbed in all. I do not know why they ever played, because many boys have played a nice role and have their own singing. Shani Wallis is the oldest to play Nancy, and he was only 16. The current West End version is better than each image. Ross McCormack is the best artistic cheat of all time and he is looking better than Jack Wild. This old fashioned musical after the 1968 tumultuous events was politically the most Oscar award.
