There is nothing cool about the film, hip, or intellectual - it's a genre of real art that reveals the ignorance of the movie. How easy you can remember that this is the central fact of the whole movie and this is mean and ugly people. . . Serial killers! If they were to remove all strangers to be "a family back", we would not consider them as "a family". Which part of the problem has you suffered? <br /> <br /> If you can not do this art, what will you do? One person's head and life should be very empty to mislead this destructive misfortune. It's a camera without brain. Really, an art form is a great way to interpret the knowledge of history (or, in this case, any knowledge is better!). Instead, it randomly piled up the world's most aggressive images in meltdown, "cool reason it's so far out, man!" Just thanks to the kind of empty meanness glorified. These violent events are actually everyday. They are "not in the picture." They refer to real soul-less people who do the same things to you. Do you want to do these things? If a child can imagine this idea, zero sense is required, it is not surreal. This lazy mess is nothing, nothing is said - it's worse evening, it's nothing new, we do not know already. This is "the new clothes of the emperor", the most uneducated children who do not expect the director to boast of this vicious torture and their line of inhumanity. <br /> </ ul> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <p> It does not have a plot - it's just shocking that shock-value is violent. There is no "hidden meaning" anywhere in the poorly made movie. It's best to explore an image to see movies you can see artistically painted movies, but if you do not, you can not get the hidden meaning! You want to view & review the real part of the movie. Fernini, Bergman, Fassbinder, Herzog, Altman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Lynch, Tarkovsky, Peter Greenaway, Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Richard Lingleter, Eisenstein, Aronofsky, Gus Van Sant, Soderberg, Shyamalan, Ordet. Why do not you see the genuine art of the giants? This well-known director, Mi'yek, I can not make a picture just like a trick in the list because I only have talent! Anyone "visitor Q." The teenagers could throw that together one afternoon so some chaotic garbage could slap together! No message, no meaning, plot, nothing. ART Films has long had to learn lists - but this "visitor Q" is not an art film in any art. It does not have any content. It's just a common horror that picks up another, and to remember those bizarre crimes that point to things everywhere in the world, every day. They are "in the movie" because they're not okay. They refer to real soul-less people who do the same things to you. Do you want to do these things? Others? Why? Because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people enjoying thinking about horror events like this. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of beautiful images to put down your mind, but you are separating your talent with your worst. No deep meaning. Nothing to analyze; Why are you trying I've spent almost 40 years on almost every film I've done, and all the new ones, but I never saw anything hilarious in this way. This kind of events occur everyday around the world because it's not speculative or surprising. The film also caused 50 young airheads to make the film look or compatible, and it does not know what's good "cool". Others may be convinced that others can persuade them to persuade others to do these things - false killers revealing how they started this way by fearing this gruesome jihad. Trust me this - I know it's cool, and the trash is not cool this piece. Visitor Q is a real SNUFF film's FEEL, and I'm not sure, not yet actually. <br /> You have the consequences for your actions, the son. The world is already awful. Some such violence like this occurs to you, or the social irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film. Believe me, when you cut your skull in half who's "cool" it's not thinking!
