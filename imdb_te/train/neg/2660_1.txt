Moreover, it is an enthusiastic, exhibitionist film - or an attempt - it's as dramatic as a moody high school student edition book filled with interesting and death "poetry". To be sure, the audience can disturb the viewers who are disturbing, but the success is not a director, can be attributed to themselves. Sensibility, discipline, technology and talent, as well as the eye and ear needed to get reality under someone's skin. The film still has an inspired film which is still (and also used in the video case), but does not develop from it or its development. If the director has an eye, he is an opening point for an interesting film - it's a movie.
