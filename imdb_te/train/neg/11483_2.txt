I am amped entirely to watch this movie. I'm waiting for a year to clear here in New Zealand. I am very frustrated and I can not build a hard work because there is no doubt. Clark's worst movie is very bad in the film. For the first time, acting is particularly nice as 'The Bully' and the Curly Whey Hairy Girl (I can not recall her name) as Nickstall, but most of the touch and most unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is now a veteran of Clarke's films, and he's a lot of 'Kids', but he takes his songs to make his scenes ridiculous in 'Bully'. It was screened as a first year student film student. Sorry, a high school student ... never seen a movie. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Is he trying to point out what these kids mean? The hell did not stop him in a good pace soon. I'm no real but I do not need to watch every 5 minutes of teasage breasts and buttocks. I still maintain Clark's best film 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's amazing and I do not think he's ever been the top.
