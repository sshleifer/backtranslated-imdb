Mabel goes crazy in a woman with influence, but let's see why she goes crazy. When I lived my life with her family, I went crazy. Everyone in her family is off their rocker and it's not entirely up to it. <br /> <br /> She is constantly surrounded by people by her and is not sharp knives in the drawers, saying that she and herself and the best for the people. <br /> <br /> She is the most intimate person in her life, her husband, Nick, and her rocker is a small one. He always meets her when she's home to stop her life and stop acting like impinge. She has been working for several hours in the rest of the time and does not support her to support her. A man in her life has always had to be there and if he ever was, he suffers more. She relies on her for support and goes to her first when she thinks she's doing something wrong and does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital, she should tell her how to work, instead of comforting her, he shouts to her and tells her what to do. <br /> <br /> The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents have nothing in her life for her. Mabel primarily leads their lives, because she was afraid to stand and stand for her. Eventually she asks her father to stand up and he can not understand, and when he receives it, he still does nothing. They do nothing to save Mabel or save her from being crazy, because they will not do anything for her period. Nick's only mother who tries to do something for her. Nick's mom is adamant about Mabel's commitment. She wants to do Nick contract with her, so she is committed to the doctor. It looks like everyone is against Mabel and because she thinks that her commitment is a good idea, they can no longer face it. They all live their own lives and do not do anything for Mabel and it seems that something is wrong when she does not really exist. That's why she went crazy, and why she should be committed, her family was a mistake.
