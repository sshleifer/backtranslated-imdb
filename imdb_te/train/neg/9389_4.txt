According to IMDb, every other website in each review; This "thing" director does not exist. Well, it definitely explains a lot! A group of people together to shoot in obscene scenes that have become some discreet and throw in the ultra thin storyline about devil-worshiping and sacrificing women inside a broken sanitarium wall. "Hardcore" is a prime example of a fully separated 70 smot, which is really built with product values ​​and scripting inspiration. Horror movies about Satan's religions are very popular in the early '70s and in pornography, so how should both of them not mix? Here we have a simple story about a young nymphomaniac girl who committed a mental shelter, and since the first night, she is drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, dildo-action too. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her voice in the same clock. The horrors are really poorly illustrated, and potentially passing from the unguarded satanic masks to the seriously wounded pencil attacks. What do you expect from a movie that speaks of photography and acting performances almost impossible, but the footage of sperm-filling dildoz and the breaking of male reproductive organs? Leading female Justina Lin is a good looking girl with a ravishing body, but her co-stars (Male & Female) are very hideous and heavily-furred sleaze balls.
