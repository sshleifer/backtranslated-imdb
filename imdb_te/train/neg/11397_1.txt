This is really terrible! It has a terrible storyline, poorly acted, and is bad as an amateur remake of the dead but is not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> This is my civilization to make it through this, I do not see a good work toilet, I suspect I'll come back! This Hammer House of Horror looks like a big screen Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only thing worthy of this film is that it's not a beautiful women's supply. Not bad in them! <br /> If you want to stand together with your friends after a night in the beer, this is for you ... avoid the plague!
