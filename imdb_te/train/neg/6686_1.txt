The whole movie is not entertaining. There is no scary, funny or interesting scene in this movie. It promotes horror, then calls her a comedy. This is not even the ATTEMPT comedy. <br /> <br /> This film should not be bored, you have to be one of the most entertaining people on earth. If you want a little bit of this image than the standard for what ever you see it. I'm trying to understand that the hardest time filmmakers are trying to achieve with this. It's not funny, scary, surprising, or secretive. So do you want a play It's not really dramatic. <br /> Please make a favor to yourself and do not watch this movie. Life is worth it for 90 minutes.
