Sorry - this movie is just cheap TV-production. I saw a lot of promotion material and hoped for a movie like "Stormriders" - a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more worse fight-scenes. Some good ideas - not. <br /> My ASIAN-Tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English! "Shaoulin Soccer", "Battle Royale", "Verse"
