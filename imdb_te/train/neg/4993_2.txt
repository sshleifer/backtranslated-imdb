Seeing this film, 'There is nothing really' action movie, still very disappointing. In the opening sequence, it promises to take some action with a funny comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half of the cage then you're expecting to sign the kick in its time for action. Well, that sort of thing happens. The movie is cheating and sleeps until the point you're boring. See what the director thinks. No one knows. If the film is not in all aspects, there is no real storyline and if it's in "Rambo", I do not think it has helped him to get the rating. There is no logic for the film. A perfect way to waste your time and money. I have not seen so much trouble and I see others who have the same impressions after I assure them. Absolutely not the little cinema concept left them to people.
