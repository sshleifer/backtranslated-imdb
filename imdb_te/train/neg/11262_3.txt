Adrian just walked out of the shelter, without money and his parents, his life was empty. One day, he meets Gonzalez, a poor boy with her mother's prostitution. Desperate for earning little money, Adrian helps her to explore her life and explore her parents. It is clear from the movie that the new director is very clear: the scenes are not properly directed, the conversations are a little forceful, some incompatibilities in the script ... Anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a small) and saves a small picture. Actors are famous and have great quality, however, they can not be inspired to make the film interesting; They made good papers in all other films. The movie will spend a lot of time thinking of boring results and perhaps how much time will pass until you end up. Of course there are very bad movies, but, obviously, there are many very good ones.
