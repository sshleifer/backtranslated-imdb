I t.v. This afternoon and I can not see anyone sitting in this part of the trash. It's not funny and your I.Q. Some notes are down. I know this movie for children, but the authors do not have to give their intelligence. I watched the writers sitting around a large wooden table. A) The term "pope" is equal to big smile. B) A four-foot-long boy can dunk in a ten-foot basketball hole. c) kidnappings come for anything and D) You have to fight the children who are fighting guns with the guns to hit the "ninjas" you call knives for 3 months karate training. One good thing I can say about this film is that it has the world's weakest suburban "gang", which is not afraid of anyone. Probably the guys in MST3K may use this movie for a good laugh. This loon-donkey is not required for a movie.
