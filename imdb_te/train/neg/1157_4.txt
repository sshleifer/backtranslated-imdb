I ended up looking at the Tenants by my mirror friends who were based on the look of Snoop Dogg (their emotionally fetish) cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. Snoop Dogg related behavior in the movie and the images that often appear in the Clip Rap videos. However, most of my normalization is wrong. Unfortunately this did not improve the film. <br /> <br /> The film is described as a dark intense drama, but is described as a darkly bored drama film. The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McKermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own unique masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyle is an opportunity but the closing of the most complex and nervous friendship. This friendship moves across the entire movie, such as a wild roller-coaster - most of which contributes to the character of the Snoop - anyone in the extreme case of split personality disorder. <br /> While this film is a play, acting - it has a morbid and intense tone - something more snooze from the snoop and the company. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, because this is a very dialogue and a lot more dialogue. There are some common conflicts, but they are mostly conversations. The end, however, sudden surprise grew to me. It's a fairly twist, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to close a picture that needs to be finished. I could not help when looking at the end credits but the director's idea was painted, "Oh God, I believe how to end this hell." By the way, the director made careful notes and delicate stories leading to the climax - all of which are bigger than Vaulto.
