I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. <br /> That monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers, and is roughly the same in the rubber movement. If the manufacturers are not very pleased with their design, it may be okay. That means, in a big rubber suit in action / summit / horror flick, a person can gain some mystery from the shark, and the shark spends a lot of time. Of course, it is generally unstable and unstable. <br /> <br /> I think the camera person is also strange. </ P> <p> The camera goes to a person about eating, the camera goes to the shark. The guy goes back to the person who is eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. <br /> If this costuming is not bad, acting is poor and special effects are sub-equal, but writing is much worse. Things are eaten more and more people will eat something, or something can explode. Tell me because people who made this film definitely went with more explosions = better feedback. Characters shoot cars and there is a huge explosion. They are a huge explosion, shoot helicopters. <br /> <br /> "It is a good idea to believe that the Freaky Shark people are trying to make half a shark half the half having a woman to have sex with children. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that this film is a long-lasting interest in a very random (and sometimes boring) person, which can be good for MST3K with your friends, Ani in the past, if you capture this bad boy, you get an idea and change the channel.
