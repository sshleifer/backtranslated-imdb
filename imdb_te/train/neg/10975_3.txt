This movie is blowing - get it straight now. There are some scenery gems nestled within the pile of rubbish but no one can redeem the limp plots. Colin Farrell appears as "Brad Pitt" in "12 Monkeys" and works in the same manner. I usually hate Colin because he's usually a fantasy because he's right in this movie. Moving the wind sheets of moving vehicles and throwing stones about a woman with a mace. Let's face it - this is a freaking idea that the film is nothing about what it wanted to say or wanted to say. The stories of these stories are interchangeable at certain levels but do not fit into the script. The whole thing is weak and nonsense and occasionally there is a scene. But overall - you can see the usual voices and do not feel ashamed as you choose to be lucky charm as everyone is protected by elf.
