Wow. I rarely felt the need to comment on movies rarely late, but this was particularly ominous for the beat down. Let's start at the beginning. Originally, the author-director Susan Montford placed Kim Basinger in the role of Old Victim, and requests the abusive husband and cousin of the necessary suburban. Let's say now that this dull image is almost hackneyed and trite to almost all content. <br /> When some Christmas rolls are taken to a dark and ominous night, della is worried that someone has stopped their car in double-park. The most crowded shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield. The next fifteen minutes at the shopping mall were della walking around aimlessly. When she finally reached her car, the thugs will meet her about her note, a cop is killed and she runs, and hold her, she will get away, and she chases others, and on it. Everything is completely predictable and universal. These thugs are not scary or frightening, and they choose one of the most common ways. <br /> All actions are stupid, as you can imagine. Why is it bad for me guys to wait for her to hit them with a tire iron instead of kill her? And once, once, in this film, the leader of the pack will die? When were they all equally useless when they all were choosing one? Much of the movie is just "della!" The screaming Woods has Lukas Haas running around, and the inclusion of the Joy Division in this wretched film's soundtrack is insulting. <br /> When della is wounded, wounded, where I actually run me for my computer keypad, where are you? "Where is God when this film is being taken? I give it a 2 due to efficient cinematography and lighting, and it's not as bad as the ultimate marker for 'BTK Killer,' for any terrible film verdict.
