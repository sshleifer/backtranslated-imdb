This should really qualify for an "O" rating, or negative ten. I saw this show for the ages, and the shark jumped around the program series. This episode, however, has demonstrated that performance shark has increased. Worst words like Beavis and Buthehead are also lazy, absurd, self-fulfilling, and not good. <br /> <br /> It is fun to be ridiculous - Pirates of the Caribbean, The Mummy, Monte Cristo Count - All "pleasant" movies are not taken seriously. However, it's as ridiculous as "it's the worst thing I've ever seen". In fact, this is the worst part of Stargate I've seen. It's terrible, and it's coming from someone with a stargate in the dungeon. <br /> <br /> I need a lot to sell my stargate items.
