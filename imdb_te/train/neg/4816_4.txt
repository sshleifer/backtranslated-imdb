I imagine that I should have a small fortune in a set of horror films with a man named "Necromancy" (aka "The Judgment" plus young people involved in making a group of other titles): John Hossein's work in the production of "The Craddill Will Rock"; Frightened people fearing the invasion of aliens ("The War of the Worlds"); And directed and starred in a great film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). Now Orson Welles is featured in a third-party film about a satan culture. <br /> <br /> There is no creativity on this film. Lots of nudity, but background music always shows really attention. Although the film is not specifically speculative, it is still not worth it. No matter how little Wells sank. Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about 1940 Warner Bros. Cartoons) commented and documented "The Man Who Saw Saa Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend both of those, but this is not. <br /> <br /> Pamela Franklin and Michael Ottaken also starred.
