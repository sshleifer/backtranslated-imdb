... you know the rest. If you like a good zombie image, this film is not there. If you want a documentary-esquire look at "Hood Life" you're in the wrong place. If you're looking at the movie's hilarious piece, it's a real winner! Acting flat as a piece of paper. A good example is the drive-by investigator. I can say he has voiced his voice's flat tone as well as the 911 operator. If I could hear the cardboard box debate, it probably feels like this. Oh, and the amount of "zombies" made their best snake stamp, which is equal to their magnificent acting amount (not the irony of sarcasm ... the best for quiroz can not win an Oscar) ...... Do not make any kind of directing. I thought I was looking at a one-uped by the worst script I'd ever donate a movie while directing a sophisticated period piece (as long as the 1990's is LA). Another "urban" thriller from Ice Grill, "F ** k!" I did not hear such elegant lines like the epic word that starts with the movie. It works only with the same-epic hip-hop soundtrack! It's all 3 or so songs! In all, what hell did you get from a movie entitled "The Hood of Living Dead"? I rent this movie with full intention of laughing in every scene, and boy delivering and more! I would definitely recommend anyone to get together with a group of guys and laugh at the low budget horror (yes right ...) for the night. That's definitely a memorable experience!
