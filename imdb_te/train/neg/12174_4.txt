This is a big step down after a surprisingly enjoyable original. The sequel part is not nearly fun and it spends most of the time on platform development. Tim Thomson is still the greatest thing about this series, but his learning has been reduced to this entry. The shows are not enough for everything, but this time the script lets us down. The action is just simple and the plot is a little bit interesting, so I need lots of crazy laughs for staying entertaining during a "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, the smiles are so small, so the film is worth watching.
