You're hurt by watching this movie, if you have great movies to watch. It is a total waste of time and money. The film was very bad, and I thought it was bad for watching. Everything in it is bad. Actors are bad. The script is really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI Ever. The first 60 seconds in the strip club are only good moments. One interesting thing is that we are in the habit of dying because he is adequately stupid (I do not remember the name but the BOYFRIEND of the "chosen"). /> <br /> Note: If you want to see a good image, this movie is not the right choice. 10 to 0 stars
