<br /> <br /> Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), who has so far seen the story of this vampire, is a very bad movie, which is very bad and tactical (But nothing compared to the blade), and some were like a net in the van Helsing Vampire's hunters, Ray, but he's going to work alone. He has been enlisted to explore a powerful vampire queen to explore a beautiful vampire queen, enabling her to be impossible for sunlight (which was directed by John Carpenter directed by Vampires (1998) and James Woods) Derek Rani's quest explored the queen with some new friends: Sanco (Diego Luna, Really cheed (Acting younger) Rodrigo (Christian de la Fuente) is a Catholic priest, Joy (Natasha Wagner) is a special Vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McGuard) is another specialist Vampire Hunter. He is not alone in this adventure. <br /> You can imagine how the film looks at its mainstream actor (Jon Bon Jovi) <br /> <br /> If you look at the film (I do not recommend this episode), you'll have to take part in one of the more simplistic, completely simplistic stories, with horrible acting performances. Rent a picture, watch another channel, and go with your friends. <br /> <br />
