A long time ago I saw this movie on television. I would recall the premise of the film as the man-eating ants attacked a group of hotel owners. <br /> <br /> I recently caught this film on television last night. Movies like this are usually disappearing from existence and can not be seen again because this is definitely a mistake! Suzanne Somers (in his career loss of Chrisi in 'Thrice Company') Luckwood plays a picnic in Manor. Analysts meet the nest inadvertently, forming a swimming pool outside the construction workers. Or I say, * MAN-EATING ANTS 'NEST * !! One of the workers was actually attacked with ants. One minute he is one of his clothes, one of them will cover them in the next minute. The next scene shows a skeleton in dirt. <br /> If you want to be far away, you will see a wheelchair-bound resident who leaves the governor through the Mirna Lai helicopter! <br /> <br /> Final scenes Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and the third person sit in a warm room and sit with their backs. Each other is blowing through straws and covered with ants. <br /> It's basically a movie. The "catastrophic" appeal or the "big-star" draw is really really the picture. It was meant as a 'Grand-Scale' television program at the time. <br /> <br /> If it's time at 4:00 am on your local television station, it's so weird. <br /> <br /> If you want Suzanne Somers to catch her best, look at the Thrice Company's episode. If you want to bake bread on the marna lounge and pay bills, look at this picture. <br/> <br / 10
