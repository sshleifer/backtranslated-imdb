Hills How Ice are as you would expect, and nothing else. In fact, this is not an Oscar nomination, but it's just pure entertainment that lasts for just 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically the National Guard Triunice Team against Hillbillies, a sensational transition towards their last day training in the desert. It's all over the whole film, it's a lot of violence (mainly the whole movie) Blood and Guttle are constantly flying around the whole and another graphic rape scene. I'm in the second place for Hills Hawk for pure entertainment. Although I saw more of my watch, the film continued, because the viewers would be able to shock the audience with audiences and graphic gore and the occasional jump scene would just wake up to ensure the audience. <br /> Hills HOW Ice II is just good fun, if you get bored, and there is nothing else. <br /> <br />
