Thinking that the cover is good, I bought this video very cheaply. And it looks good, but the movie is trash. I can handle B-grade, and sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (i.e. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a fine example of how fun the genre is), but it's just a blonde blonde blonde. Very soft romantic and entertaining horror sequences are much less dull scenes. This image is too small to provide.
