The plot of 'House of Games' is the most powerful thing about it: a successful writer and psychologist climbs through a gang of gangsters, but when she gets to know her worst part of the worst she is, she finally gets her revenge. It's about the pitch: but someone should be responsible for acting as a pipette. It should be director mamet: Lindsey Croce has a different and pretty stable TV and movie career, so she did not perform all at this time seriously. Unfortunately, the bad fast lady fun is to go from the uptight to the cool, controlled professional to the calculation, as shown by the transition from the beige trouser suit to her light brown sundress (she seems to wear straight for three days including underwear). But everyone seems to have their lines cut in the same way, talking perfectly; I think Mamat does not miss the letter of his sipping scripts. He is trying to create an atmosphere of success and mystery and suspense. Sometimes 'House of Games' loses any connection with how humans behave or talk, and is a mechanism for removing the plot. Clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack does not help either. The final result is only guessing the outcome of the entertainment, and in advance you will be bored with robotic, two-dimensional performances. And they have a lot of smoke!
