<br /> <br /> I think one of these films is considered "art", but Don said, 'it is deceived ... it's the worst. <br /> <br /> The artworks of Gauged Shakespeare's "Tempest" are taken away from camera pine naked people. One of them was to abandon the urine in a swimming pool. Wow, this heady thing and true "art," is not it? It's just an example. Most of the story is not understandable, so it is impossible to follow and, therefore, liberal critics fear they can not "understand", so they give high marks to protect their deceptive friends. Want Shakespeare? Read his books.
