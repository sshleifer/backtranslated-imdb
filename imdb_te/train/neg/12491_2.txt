Yes. Poke a pleasant movie plot holes, innocent acting, the oldest (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to watch this film three times over the past six years), I've always seen the worst. I know the heroes are never known, as I saw the killer portable guillotine, as I saw in the dance floor murder scene. First of all, I do not really like the film, after the first 30 minutes of enjoyment, the remaining confusing dialog and the plot failed to progress to a logical conclusion (though I can not remember it)).
