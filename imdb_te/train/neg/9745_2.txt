The film is unclear in the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K is good when they close this film. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad decoration, poor effects. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand because of the villain makeup. As an assistant dummy sound said things like 'you can not' !! (Think sneezing). This is just a poor speech. One of the longest eyebrow characters are pleased. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the plot is in terms of plot. I missed some part of the beginning. <br /> <br /> What are the minimum lines of these 10 lines?
