Back in the 1970's, WPIX was "The Adventures of Superman" in the afternoon every few days of the week. Each time, we'll get a treat before being broadcast by neighbors' "Superman and Mole Men". I always waited for those days. <br /> I was surprised at how well it really was. <br /> <br /> This is not bad because of the lack of exclusive effects. True, George Reeves Superman Costume is pretty bad, the fringes of the foam padding make him look even worse. And the truth is, Mole Men's clothing is even worse. What should not be covered with a fur that is tied to age ten, because the zipper, sleeve hemis and badly fitted fabric bag have been damaged in costumes. <br /> <br /> No, contrived plot device is not bad at all. Time and again, the Superman situation failed to keep anything from getting worse. Does one lynch search for mob? He explains the circumstances surrounding Louis and the PR person, rather than surrounding crazy audiences or exploring the creatures. Are the living together? Again, he looked around to speak but did not save them until they were burned. Luca Benson, the rarest-rouser of the town, shot him? Suppose that no rational person attempts to murder, Superman will cause further problems. <br /> <br /> George Reeves and Phillis Coats played their roles, and were instantly comfortable without appearing in the characters. . They gave a good script to work.
