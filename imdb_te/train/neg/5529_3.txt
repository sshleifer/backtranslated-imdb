General Duvall (George Cleveland), his companion Tsian (William Crowell), has the power to hypnotize people and puts them in control (a bit like people who really work). However, Siang was murdered by Colonel Mozovia (Roy D'Arcy), but failing to gain knowledge for people to be sick. Siang no longer telling them because General Duval has set up a trip to hunt for the secret. General Duvall is heading the yard with his daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone), who is also engaged to Louk, who came along. During the tour Claire W. Laugh was not very happy with his colleague Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland). Luck begins to use his new invented force to get a revenge on Claire & Clifford as he finds himself in a film that locks himself into the zombies & loses himself in a film ... Victor Halperin co-authored and directed the zombies have a bad reputation and after watching I can see why. All scripts written by Halperlin, Howard Higgine & Rowle Lloyd have a good central idea, but die dying cold. No one is going to grow older, then no one else will do anything later. Halfpernin is different from what many modern audiences want to show as a zombie, these zombies are just a brainwashed people & filmmaker audiences George AeroMero in the Night of the Living Dead (1968) before deciding how to think a zombie is now. Only an hour long reservoir rebel seems to be too long. Technically the film was made 70 years ago, black and white cinematography was adequate, but in some cases they were filmed against background. Acting is wood & more unpleasant. The rebellion of zombies may have been hot in 1936 but by 2005 it was not well and it was a perfect duty to sit in 2005. I believe the image is now public domain so I can turn on lots of ultra cheap DVD additions and budget labels, but it's not worth looking at how cheap you can get.
