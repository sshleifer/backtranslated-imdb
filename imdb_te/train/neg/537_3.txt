Because of the cast I went to see "evening". Diane Keaton, Leonardo di Caprio, and Meryl Streep - the film - I loved every minute and went to see "Norman's Room" for that reason. Although it is the same chick-flit lite for "The Notebook". And my sense is, at least some of the presentation offerings by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close will be at least good. <br /> <br /> "I actually enjoy cutting back and forth to tell a story ... an age other and But Vanessa's character is "wrong" when she reminds her death and past event, sometimes, the piece actually shows nothing to clarify the subject of "last mistake". <br /> In fact, it is the silliest "girl boy <br /> <br /> Be the spoiler here, so keep on reading the mind. <br /> <br /> First, Claire Danes is a terrible misfortune, and Vanessa Redgrave is just beginning to be a teenager, and she does not know where she is at the chops. Eyakandi, she recommended that the role - not just one of these. Patrick Wilson misleading, however, he was acting chops. He played the part of Hugh dansi saripoyyanu well - confusing the WASP rich - and not a sex object and for all; He is a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I'm a tortured drunk and wait for you to find out why." And "why" (I have a room case in a sexually abused world, so I will drink too much and I have to make a crazy before everyone I know). I am very dangerous and in the manner he died. <br /> <br /> "I'm sleeping." She's jealous of her sister's "perfect life", her pregnancy and her very perfect Ryan (in fact it might be more interesting if she played Tony Collette and her sister, fear of commitment, and meaningful Patrick Wilson, and Ehrn Moss-Bachrak may be interesting Harris that gave her dreams) - however, all of these have comforted in the 70s and 80s And much more depths. <br /> Is it fresh and memorable? Old layer with all her facial expressions hidden She's still good, but she can find a way to get rid of a tight dialogue even under the massive of makeup, Meryl and Meryl. <br /> <br /> To keep it simple, the movie is a "really meaningful message" Book, and it adds some that somehow the business is being trotted again. For two hours, "Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week" music guarantees that you bump into the knot, which is a complete failure in both "meaningful" and "mobibeaking". <br /> <br /> Now if you have all the content you want from your movies, set my comments about "evening" and your time life. But if you want a real meaningful experience that works with great actors and movie makers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death, it's going to rent a "Norman's Room" and learn what really great acting is.
