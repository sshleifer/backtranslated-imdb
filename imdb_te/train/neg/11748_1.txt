The film is one of the worst films I'd ever had to do with DVD! If the movie has more funds and writers, I'll take care of my parents if I click the story .... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there is one thing like a drive thru film maker - this would have sprung from one. It reminded me a lot of movies in the late 1990s that poor poetry was written and put in the filming. <br /> <br /> Only the clever characters Bartender and Bower in the whole picture. The rest of the films were made by middle school children. I really gave this film 1 rating, which left my entire family with the feeling of horrifying and deceptive. My advice is not to see it
