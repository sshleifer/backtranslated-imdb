This must be a movie about Sam and his wife, the wonderful Peter Faulk and the equally spectacular Olympias Dukakis. It would have been a worthy film. Instead it was a Paul Riser vehicle, with little falc thrown. The amazing Elizabeth Perkins is also in the film, but you rarely know. I assume Rise is under the impression that he is a big actor who needs an appropriate vehicle. He is not. Ryaz has struggled to appoint some of the best female actresses on the screen today and praised all of their backdrop. Dukakis did not show up to the last 15 minutes, but she does, the screen glows. The story is actually about Faulk and Dukakis, but we are subject to the meaningless, crazy, innocent road trip, as he can show Oh-in-in-depth (wrong!) With how beautiful, valuable and mental awareness of the racer. For example, in the restaurant scene that the resceer had imagined, there were ridiculous false clashes between the "caverns-like" reserve and the falc, so I was embarrassed for Faulk.
