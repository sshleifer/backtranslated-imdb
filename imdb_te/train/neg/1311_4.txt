Jerry meets the creepy story on the radio and leaves an opportunity to intimidate his hostility. <br /> <br /> I have found this funny special episode: Harmoniously blocked and set up the entire set <br /> <br /> The occasional flash of inspiration (such as Tom's literary 'note' experience), and his friends Moment when sucked out of the body), on the whole, this effort frenzied pacing, stunning animation and T & J's other cartoons Not Livy.
