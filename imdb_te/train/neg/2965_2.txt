This film is interesting ... I have to see it for a college class about India, although the summary tells you about a thing about this thing that really does not have a very cool, hard information on this film. It's not really true to completeness until the very end, they try to combine all the elements. But Gore's item is amazing. Even at the very beginning, you want to see away because gore is pretty serious. See the movie if you want to see some cool gore if the plot is narrow and you will waste time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other websites based on the facts about this movie, but you can not find any information about it ... so basically this is a waste of time to watch the movie.
