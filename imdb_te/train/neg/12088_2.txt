I read the reviews of this film, and they thought it was pretty good and I wanted to see it. I'm a big francopyle and art film lover, but I believe that it is yet another case of critics' arti "or" intellectual ". I am stupid: I have never seen the scenes of sexual abuse, I'd always like to see. Obviously, the piano teacher had some important psychological problems, but I really showed it graphically. The picture, essence, is disgusting. When I saw the Requiem for a Dream, I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.
