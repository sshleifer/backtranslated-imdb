The film was written by Charlie Higgson, which features his own performance based on "Legendary" Fast Show and Fast Show's characters (Tony the Car Salesman). He also wrote James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have seen only the Gordon films based on Love Carcra stories, each of which is amazing. Gordon tries to do different here. The style is entirely "synchronized", ie moving camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillate music in the background. It works very well here, I guess, but it is still meaningful and cheap. It often makes the camera think who will try to make stylish moves in his dv-camera shakes and pictures before the actors / actresses (hoping to come out of admissible something). The cast is good, good atmosphere, it's good direction. I think the main character, "zero" young person, is very interesting in his "zeroes". Fat man is also good. And Alec Baldwin is the person who appears, but not him. But soon after the start of the film this film is not very interesting: in this case I understand the endless lines of classicalism and illness. The film / story does not have much humanity: it is totally pessimistic, and every person in the film is frustrated and disappointed, or dies soon. No need to say that there is no humor. There is a 1'40 long vomit without relieving any time. Anytime Gordon is one of the most active filmmakers today, I feel like an experiment on this film, and that failure. Everyone has to experience sometimes lose, just learn and find their way again. This Gordon may be the most unpleasant and empty work.
