Recap: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory, how to create energy, a knowledge that can not be misused by the world. He coded his knowledge and keeps secret and desperately wants from the Soviet Union. On the other hand, KGG wants new technology. So, they set a scheme in motion. Markov is trapped in a rescue effort to leave Markov's actions, leaving Markov in a secret place, to speak in Sweden and work for the UN to reveal his secrets. As a backup, KGB kidnapped Marcov's split daughter. The CIA now sends their best agents, the KGB, and the Ninjas team (Sweden?) To protect Marco and his daughter. <br /> Comments: A cult film is not very good requirements. The movie is very prestigious but lacking in many areas. First of all, it is dark, it is difficult to understand some scenes, perhaps to hide locations and bad effects. You can not see what's going on. Despite a ninja-movie, this is the second art, martial arts. There are definitely some very low quality, but mostly ninjas firearms or firearms set fire. Automatic guns have the same problem as having an endless supply of ammunition. <br /> <br /> When Soviet guards die as flies, the bullets are almost immune to the pistols. <br /> What do you say about it? The first thought and ambition. Some are in fact, and especially for Swedish films, although marshal arts have good reaction-scenes. Some good slow motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explosion. Most parts you see in the B-picture. <br /> This is definitely a B-movie because there is no mistake. But if you expect it, and watch as a B-movie, it will be fun. But do not forget, it's not just a B-movie set in the Eighties. <br /> Some girls, for example, are wearing ... Say "interesting" clothes, have fatal doses of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In all, look for cult status and ambition. Enjoy it, and then forget it. <br /> <br />
