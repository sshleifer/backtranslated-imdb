A month ago I rented this movie when I had nothing else on a Friday night. I can say to describe this worthless film is very bad acting so badly I've done a good job of seeing kids in high school as they're just reading their lines, the whole cast appears, no feeling, no emotion, and the room to capture the viewer. In another note, the special effects are overly cheating and the entire thing is shot with a camera, anyone can buy a radio shock. <br /> <br /> The clownman did not find anything in the video cover. The heck does not show up in the film until he is at the end and he will make ham songs in it and go around to fire some characters. I have questioned some things since I saw that this was not a real slaughter movie but it was not a real murder. 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' is a killing serial killer clowns? 2. If your boyfriend is missing, why not having sex for her? <br /> <br /> Why only real acting is suddenly sputtered out of vain at all? Should the cast finally show endeavor in their jobs? This film is very sad. My advice is to go on rent because it laughs more than an hour or two.
