I can not believe that those who appreciate the film are not thinking about some other films. I was prepared to think it would be awful, but the script (or absence) would also make it a pointless film. Plus side, the part of the actors and technical team is quite competent to the normal level of craft, but you can not make a silence when you have a sow ear to work. Benji fans are with any other film he is. He must adhere to Dorothy S fans galaxia. Peter B fans should adhere to the final film performance and the target. Fans of cheerful laughs to those who are asking for it is Peter B's awesome awful book, Killing the Unicorn.
