As always, I am dashing to see movies that I have not seen before in Oscars. I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie, it seemed to be fine. I do not understand why this movie does not understand why. No story! A group of guys meander around Iraq. One day they divide a bomb here. Tomorrow they are turning around the countryside, and they have started sniper fire at little. They did not return in Baghdad here. There is no cohesive story. The three main characters are rarely just sarcastic. I mean, there is a sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have a practical hardened military man and want to get back safely. And then we have Daredevil cowboy who do not follow the rules but there is a soft spot for a sick little little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. Do you think what will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules is going to get the wounded sweet kid in his rebellious ways? Why yes! Are you going to kill an Iraqi kid who is a soft place for a cowboy soldier and take him crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! Camera moves too much to look like "Arti". And go to rent a "full metal jacket", "dherhanter" or "platoon" for all that you think is a great war film. This boring image does not waste time or money!
