I do not know why I should comment on this stupid reality show, I was watching some parts (when a cable marathon broadcast a stream of 5 episodes in a row, I did not see the whole thing. <br /> <br /> When I was nine months pregnant and I'll be frustrated today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, Do. Money and fame has little sense of her respect. Or she is seriously self-centered. She is nitwit Federline (okay can make a mistake) and she has "starred" this horrible show about her everyday life, where Federline is standing there where she sticks to a camcorder when she's in one's face or in the shower. She does not care about her sexual life, but she does not care what she feels about when she divorces. She feels very beautiful, spacious living. I do not want to change lives with her even though I can. If you want TV killing the road.
