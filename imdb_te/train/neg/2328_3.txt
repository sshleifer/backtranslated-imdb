I have recently seen this stuff and I have definitely told you that I was shaken by the reality of the story. However, "Haley" did not act as a film. <br /> <br /> I think the work is more constructive than the film because I look forward to seeing the documentary of the producers who organized this project. <br /> <br /> The international cast B-class actors, but their performance is appropriate, and I specifically referred to the young actress who played Holly. This is her first film role and she has done very good work, she is a very challenging part of consideration. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingstone Patrick is adequate but bland, the search is "saving", but Chris Penn is good in his good role. Unfortunately, while Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier are my most favorable view, these actors do not forget much and this film is not their best. <br /> I believe the message and intent of the movie, but I have to be fair, so I rate "Holi" 3 stars based on its flaws in one image. But I want to take into consideration the subject and I hope that people behind the film have made a documentary and have begun on BBC and other TV networks.
