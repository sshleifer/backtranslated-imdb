Call-girl murders as a witness and becomes a killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma really has a solemn roll here: his camera swoops around the corner in a museum (after a long time on a monkey's painting), divvies into splv screen for argie purposes, practically his plot sequence (again in split screen) Looking at a TV program about a transcript, and during a thunderous rain The (first) end of the steps. "Killed Toss Kill" tired, basically it does not ask us to swallow us and swallow us anymore. Most acting (except for young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and (second) finale is not about Rip-off - "Psycho" of de Palma's own "Carrie". The description of dirty deeds is like Hitchcock's impersonation, not a tribute. Stylish is a cool cool way, end results are clearly half-baked. ** from **
