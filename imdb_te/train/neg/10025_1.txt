<br /> <br /> If it is one of the largest producers in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), it is a long way to reach the right standards. Go to this length with heavy actors like Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, making filmmaking more difficult for everyone involved with the film. Apart from cinematography and Akshay Kumar, the movie is not in almost all sections. <br /> <br /> The first scene from the mountains to the river has very little graphics. Cartoon image. It is a clear indicator of the director's attention. Every actor who is an actor every actor is just wasted. Anil Kapoor's Jimmy of good English effort is flat many times. <br /> <br /> Saif is a hit by thinking why Saif is signing this movie. <br /> <br /> "This is a large number of resorts after the" Zamoom Barbaror Joham ". <br /> You can not understand how this type of script is written and accepted. The most unwanted is the flashback sequence of Akshay Love Story. The wrong element of the film is its music after the wrong script. Vishal Shekhar gave some fill tunes to each song. The songs start out very well and suddenly the tunes are completely absorbed. The single song "Falak Tak Chal" is very good. Wasted by Vishal Shekhar. </ P> <br /> This is a sampling about the continuity of the producers: Akshay and Saif are on the road in a hilly area of ​​a foreign land (probably Ladak). In the next scene, they are looking for Kareena in Haridwar, then looking for their car's dick in the hills with Kareena. <br /> If you sit till the end, then the scenes have thinner and unnecessary stunts. They do not worry that they are gods who walk through the bullet storm. Do you still see the 2008 film that has achieved all these highlights? <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, if possible, ask your movies to watch their first film. Is outside. You have some responsibilities to your fans and viewers, such as elite artists. When you enter the screen in your first scenes, people still clap you. I do not think this type of film should be seen during the day, because it has the reputation associated with both the film, the actors and the production company.
