I thought what the directors would do for a while ... After seeing the welcome (2007) I had a wound and thought they would do it again. <br /> <br /> After surprise promises, the tassion finally ended with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Promo - Dil Hara, Chalia and Tashan Mein are three of the best songs ... and what do you get in this film? Encouraged storyline, Akshay Kumar's stunt plenty and Kareena is keen on watching Kareena after her major weight loss ... <br /> Another major disaster in classical music ... They spent time in giving these 4 jokers a generous little dialogue Akshay Kumar did not want to give a background song while performing ...! The song is comparable to Tatian Mein and not included in the music album, that's fine! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I say, it will look to hear the background song ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> Very disappointed <br /> <br /> Get back, I need to pook!
