Knowing the full story of the dark prince is very simple (although with traditional rituals) the modern (delicate hip keeps) very soft in the story of the Dracians. When I try to watch for the first time, it passes half before I lose interest. Again it was a good start (especially when the scenes with the thieves and Dracula met theirs), but it was less involved in me when it hits the New Orleans of Van Helsing's daughter. It's a great place to set up, but it does not use its settings (despite the presence of a heavenly dream where Dracula thrives). Built by Wes Corvine (and they renounced the name there), but Patrick Lassier wrote / directed. Artistically, its dream comes with some characteristic visuals, but some dynamic albums and inexpensive jolts will not help. The worst script is significantly crazy. Lassier has a very improved job, which has a lot of blood, too much blood insertion (make-up) and a lot of "virgin" ads. Not that I do not understand virgins, it's music company, it's got in many shots and hellsing daughter works there too. Oh that's not clear planting. Soundtrack is a fun choice of rock tunes. The exhibitions are all in stores now, but there are some familiar faces to recognize (Danny Maesterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillian, Shane West and Lochlin Munro). Like Dracula, Gerard Butler just did not come because he did not form the existence of much. He only falls out of the night with only the bridegroom; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jerry Ryan Dracula brides. The likes of Johnny Lee Miller and Justin Waddle are respected. Christopher Plummer von Helsing and Omar Eppis gives a patching turn as fun with his role.
