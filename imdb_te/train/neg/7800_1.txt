Dust is difficult to work through this video-video exercise that is cheaper and haphazard. <br /> <br /> It has a distinctive gore that you imagined in a zombie movie, but it is not worth it in the necessary environment. <br /> It's an amateur German video, and version I saw English-dubbing! Dabars are seen as American fans (Germany's Peppers ?!) can not determine whether they want to play it straight or switch to comedy. A character (a white Germany, of course) is clearly dubbed by a black man who speaks with thick ebonyx! 'No Wahm Saddin', Kamrad?
