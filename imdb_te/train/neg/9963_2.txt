I love Alec Guinness. And after that film too says. Actually, he's not bad at it. He seems to stand next to him, will be Urban and his usual delightful self, but invested Nada. It is obvious that he is a featherweight, like a novice young Frenchman inexperienced girl. <br /> <br /> Sir Alec did not choose her and was not happy about it when she was younger. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the odd "Suzanne", another couple. "Donald" was a French Heathcliffe and his secret was not in vain. What kind of dark secret behind the dark spine? Is he in love with his father's wife? Why do Suzanne move her hair while plotting to bring in Turkey's uneven parts in her country estates? <br /> <br /> Guys and the "Old Lady" are looking at Paris to recollect the movie. There was a great story! Two lovely veteran people in a picturesque city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not anyone come? I would like to see Alec gown in a little known but worthy image in "card".
