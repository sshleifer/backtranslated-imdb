I recently saw the revival of "Blighty Spirit" Broadway starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Eborsoll and Jane Atkinson. It's a wonderful product, and shows what good actors can do with the drama that is less than perfect. <br /> <br /> Checking the film version of the play by Rex Harrison is probably wrong. The film does not have the power or laughter for good theater production. <br /> <br /> "Blighty Spirit" is perhaps one of those plays that plays well in the audience of people who have acted directly. Come to laugh. The story is "Fourth Wall." The story gives you a quick look and feel to the performance and lines of distribution and a personalized approach to the DVD presentations in the film house or separated from the audience. Story: Successful writer Charles Condomain (Rex Harrison) and his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) live in a house in English rural areas. His next book, a book dealing with supernaturality, Charles Mamum Arcorty (Margaret Rutherford, refers to his role from the original 1941 London production), a local spiritual medium, invites him to organize a sannenance for his home. Charles believes that he is self-confidence, but wants to "trick the trademarks". But then Madame Archety brings back the ghost of Charles's first wife, Elvara (Kei Hammond), who died seven years ago with pneumonia. Elvira refuses to leave, and Charles develops an embarrassing opponent with Ruth (Charles can only see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> The stage is where the actors give performances that invite these laughs. But on screen, the actors in "Blit Spirit" do not know who they are not listening to. They are dictator lines designed to laugh at stage. Harrison, Cummings, and Cai Hammond's performances are flat and lifeless. <br /> <br /> The Oscar winning visual effects of the film are hearty - not by today's standards, by 1946 standards! They are mostly covered with fluorescent green clothing and decorating coy hammond, which is taken in special lighting to make it look like a bright ghost. <br /> <br /> Cinematographer earned a loan for creativity. But it's comparable to Disney's "Song of the South" that really had the sensational effects of the "Blity Spirit" - it deserved the same year's awards. In "South", humans and animated characters open once a minute to open. <br /> <br /> I would only encourage Angela Lansbury to break the Broadway revival of this play. Compared with "Southern", "Blitz Spirit" ends it. Skip for the movie with Rex Harrison.
