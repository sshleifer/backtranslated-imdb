The design team is seeking an apartment to live in, and is shown by a local real estate agent. Although the models and agent are unknown, "entrance of the hell" is in the apartment and if the devil "Deathman" is called to kill those in his path. A story told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was murdered. <br /> <br /> I can not appreciate this film even though I am a low budget, micro-budget and independent film winner. The creators take pride in their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor has his acting prowess DVD, but I can not wrap my head around this. Why not make an extra one or two hours of editing all the differences in 24 hours? <br /> <br /> For the most part, parts of the apartment are displayed by models real estate. Agents. The dialogue is clearly statement-free because no transliteration does not come with such empty text. The agent, too, clearly does not know anything about housing ... she says that the problem with a home that is unnoticed, misunderstood describes the heat source (does she look at the radiator?) And lice problem is called "terminator". Please, write a script - some deviation is fine, but it's confusing. <br /> Why did you become like girls? Their careers have no point on the plot, and it seems like a forced situation. At one point, the role of an actress breaks down and, despite other bad conversations outside of space, "Dude, they are more natural than any other line (they are disappointed)". /> <br /> The devil does not make sense of it. I appreciate an attempt to explain how to the places of intersection (including apartment fireplaces) on "Earth's Entrance". His background consists of a man who was killed by another man. How do you make a troll? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Have a break, a funny face and a response ... After a pause, funny face and response? I was disappointed For me, only time is dragging time ... but I'd rather have thirty minutes of better delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice). <br /> <br /> The role of Sam Bishop Who accused him of killing girls, but yet at any time he is always part of the story with the girls. Continues to see? If he is, how he learned detaman killed them? And if he did not see detman, he knows how the spirit of Dethman Apostoles? I lost ... it is also written an outline for the plot? <br /> <br /> The only part of the movie is the one in the bathroom. It's really important or not, but there's only a break from the frustration I've given. I'm surprised that director Felix Diaz is thinking. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu performance), but I'm wondering about the making of his films. <br /> <br /> I have tested what happened in 24 hours or is just an experiment and entertainment quality for entertainment is never a film But "Superhero Excelsior" can give quality the Diaz ... So why did he choose to avoid here?
