The subject is absolutely compelling: A group of people will take their love for one more stage gaming by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, kings and castles. Wargaming is actually an interesting phenomenon that delves into our collective need to "escape" from mundaneness of reality and of our existence - almost everyone is involved. The characters include Lord of the Rings nerds and the speculative mix of Star Trek enthusiasts. This is enough for most people to see. Nevertheless, the film will quickly turn into an inner view of the nose's almost stereotypical defeat for the audience without "Internet". The filmmakers take war, and take waaaaay very seriously than once for a while to recognize the humor and fun in making this film a specialty about drilling and frosting swords each other pounding in each other, medieval gear. It's pretty difficult for anyone to like the latest Star Destroyer and why they care about 7-10 hours playing games or talking about the characters. Nevertheless, filmmakers do not focus on the subject of the game, rather than building a strong story with a clear story that anyone can understand. Moreover, the characters themselves are not troublesome and quickly get bored with them: when you're trying to keep a large number of people out of 90 minutes.
