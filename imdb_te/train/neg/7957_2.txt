Oops. In the Twin Cities, there is a "Big Bad Movie" Monday evening. The film with Tonight's Nugget Killer Fisher is called "She Back", ending when Hughes enters his home. Bee (Beatrice) returns to pursue her husband. She wants to take revenge on her killers, so she is "back to her". If he does that, he will not rest. She irritates him infinitely ... and viewers too! This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hey, I love bad movies, but (my fav movie cannadu). I was really waving my head across the whole movie, wondering I thought this film would be a good idea. Bee was just so annoying. The plot is silly; Good acting; The story ... well, you'll get my motion. Anyway, if you really want to see the bad movie - really very bad movie, check this one. Do not be disappointed. Heh.
