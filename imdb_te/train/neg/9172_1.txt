When I watch the movie about zombie, I do not expect Oscar carrier shows, or write The Godfather level, but the actors at least read their queue cards, and their conversations seem to have been typed 10 minutes before the actor reads the camera. The film is terrible, I have really stayed in 25 minutes and went to bed and Cold Creek Manor, which is not very good, but it looks like Citizen Kane compared to this rubbish pile. Plus the side, the girls are very beautiful, which is probably something that kept me in my seat longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after killing one of the hottest, after which I did not have anything to do with my interest.
