I was really impressed by how bad this film was. Would the viewer want to learn something or reflect on anything here? What did the pumpkins do? Did I impress with motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on the roof of a hotel's street? Why the narrator makes him ridiculed the interviews people (it is so clear he has really modited the information portions in his interview to achieve mockery). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film was interviewed by the film director Professor. It tells how bad the film is before it's done. <br /> I'm really amazed. I believe that the Creator struggles to become a genius or is trying to impress the intellectual community.
