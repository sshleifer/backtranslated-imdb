- I start to understand that I mean paralysis of the Stars of the Star Stars 50's science fiction films. I understand that none of it is seriously considered. The problem I have is that it works nothing. It's ridiculous and this is not one. Never once did I ever smash a smile in the entire runtime. <br /> <br /> In general, I am easily amused and amused by the Star Star Creatures expedition. <br /> I know I'm in trouble from the start. The two "stars" make them appear on their screen with one of the most imaginative longest gags - the water hose that makes them moist. These two Boyier boys come like wannabes. Why would anyone want to have a maury, the person of the Baler Boys, the person over me? Less than the popular start, movies have fun chase scenes, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other classified unfunny bits. <br /> <br /> I purchased this on a double feature DVD with BeeDie Girls. The film earned the Academy Award for comparison with Star Creations' invasion.
