The boy was fooled me by this film. I honestly thought it was definitely a campy horror movie with no humor, boy I got that cold shoulder. This film, and I'm honest, pretty damn good. It's not scary but the campaign and clever humor really make this film interesting mad. Some of the horrific acting and clich√© murders were very painful to watch, I laughed at how bad it was, but somewhat I enjoyed. The murders are associated with all the blurred ice games and Christmas, which are more intriguing. <br /> <br /> When a film is being shipped to a jail, a chemical trick car accident is about a viscous killer who died in a clash. He was later revived in the same chemical as the ice-cream of the mixture. These are the selected ingredients to make this perfect killer snowman. <br /> <br /> In this film, except for Christopher Alfort, this is a bad act, funny. I'm also disappointed that this film is not horrific, but it's actually a dark sitcom. They have a great story and have a great story, but it has not been implemented properly. First of all I like at the movie but is now really annoying. But the film is better and darker than the sequel.
