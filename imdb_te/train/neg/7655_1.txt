We all have to congratulate Uwe Boll. He's not able to imagine. IMDb may be the only director to have two movies in the Lower 100! He is kind of a cinematic cockroach. He has little talent, and he maintains how bad these films are, even if they are bad. <br /> <br /> I know that he has earned them all through tremendous German funds, yet his complete ability to make films is one of the great mysteries of the universe, even though he is a complete, complete failure. <br /> That video game developers are not as bad as giving this person their best qualities. I really enjoyed the Alone in the dark series of games. The latest is also, New Nightmare, a few hours of play. There's a good image to make from the adventures of Edward Cornby, but it's not. Now Wowe boled his blood on blood and blood: The Reconning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I guess he was going to cut through the movies from the game if he did not stop. Someone must remove his credit line or this video game publishers have to be discerning and no one knows when nobody is interested in the title when it comes to bad image from the game that killed the franchise. <Br /> <br /> Think about it, Dead or Alone in the Dark House is a longer practical game title? There is no chance. Dead game's new house comes out for X-box and nobody cares. The title was dead and killed everything due to the Uwe boll. So if any of you are working for a publisher of the game, or if you know the game publisher, or have access to the game publisher ... warn them. <br /> <br /> This image is not even valuable. I can not drain the dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, compilation. I thought I was disappointed if I waited until I got out of DVD and rented with less expectations. Boy, I'm wrong. BoulL sh * t Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steam pile never underestimates.
