It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. It's hard to believe that this is both the director and the actors. Henry Fool's refreshing, witty, humorous, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and does not go anywhere. Where is the knowledge gone? <br /> <br /> When I look at Henry Fool and I have been up to 10 years, its dialogues and sequences are still very clear in my memory. Fay grim is painful to see. This is not the fault of the actors (Parker Posey) or the great (Jeff Gold Blum) - the storyline is completely dialogue, dialogue, and some filming (not less budget exclusion). Mass disappointment. <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was frustrated and disappointed ... You could not have enjoyed Henry Fool if you enjoyed this experience ... Two films are perfect <br /> <br /> I'm sequel Henry Fool is all deceptive to entice fans to watch. Now - Henry in prison with a Taliban?
