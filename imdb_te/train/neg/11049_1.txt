If Mr Cranky has this rating, I'd be copying his review and being tempted to paste here. <br /> <br /> Malkom McDowell's performance is awesome. Nevertheless, he could not save the film from disaster. The director really cared for the film because it was a mix of the 70s' badly-reminiscent of scenes - with less sequel scenes. Even worse, both the actors and the directors seem to go to the wrong version of the original script. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the story line, even though it's moving around the future. The Corporation Projeet Corporation, who appointed an old container / slave ship personnel to distribute a dangerous cargo to Nigeria. The computer of this ship is wrapped into one of the crews by a baby and a USB 12 or something kept in a glass jar. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value of the film is to be called Prostate Corporation by testing the same name. <br /> I honestly did not find a scene that I did and made any real sense in the context of the film. So long as I had a touch of bird flu, I saw it and this movie really reminded me where Malkom McDowell was more than just me. <br /> <br /> If this was not the film earlier, it would not be a great actor and every great actor deserves a bad movie in their career. The store hires or you do not have the surgeon and you do not have to do the prostate tests this week and you really feel this is a bad thing to give this a really wide berth unless of course you really are minded if this community really is a copy to support and use as a coaster to support Malcolm.
