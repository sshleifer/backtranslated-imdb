This film has made me a seal forever. I looked at high school as a freshman and was alone that night. I've lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who is a huge fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought that Chuck Connor's character was horrendous and bad. Nevertheless, I liked the film as a volunteer at a time when I was trying to change the lives of women while doing Bible studies and church services in the women's state jail and women's lives. What impressed me was that some people actually saw this movie. None of my friends have seen it and my family is brief about today because I can not see this movie.
