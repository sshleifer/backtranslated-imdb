At the beginning of the film, the scenes of beautiful photography and fox are terrific. However, the story is very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to domesticize the faux, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see the foxes. Someone must know that anyone can keep wild animals in the forest and enjoy them from a distance. The film is a horrible example of children trying to make it a wild animal as a domestic animal. I do not know what to do with the story's position. After the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wants to play with kits. Did she learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring animals for the foxes, along with the trauma on the children watching the film. How disappointing the film is. And it tells a terrible story. The final commentator's dialogue is very absurd, at that time my wife and I were throwing on TV! I absolutely hated this movie, and never recommend it to anyone!
