This movie is terrible. I can not spend anything more than just a few words. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Avoid all the costs of these images, it's terrible. Lots of slaughterhouse footage. Wired cuts and edits. There is no continuation of the plot. <br /> <br /> This bomb of the film is designed to earn some money on the accuracy of its content. Camera work does not focus on time and always moves. <br /> <br /> In fact, they have now got Dennis Ruder in jail, and I wish they would put in the films that made this horrible film in prison. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think of looking at it. If I could, it would give me a negative star.
