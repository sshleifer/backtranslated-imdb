The image of a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. Moving into a new family, replaced dialogue, mediocre acting, grated carrots with green jelly salad and each other known as 'Mormon joke'. Anyone outside Mormon culture will have a hard time in the stomach. Anyone inside Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a stew here and there. You'll be watching Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.). Acting is normal. Jared Hess holds his hands on the most sophisticated films like "Saints and Soldiers", and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend two films on this groan.
