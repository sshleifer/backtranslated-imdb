The problem with the contractor is used by the opening scene. The CIA wants to contact Black Ops Assassin James Dial so an international terrorist is dead. The terrorist appears in London's Old Bailey Court, and if he spent his entire life in jail, why would they try to lift the terrorist? He goes out of the radiation. Before he was arrested, the CIA was arrested. If there is little chance, he will kill him if he does not judge the crime. There is no logical reason to kill anyone to live in the maximum security jail <br /> <br /> The audience may choose to get out of the story audience in the premise, the fire. Dial's colleague is driving a police bullet and taxis crashes but maintains the dial. So police are very close to shoot anyone who is in a car accident but are far away. This kind of plot is a picture of non-canons. Dial then finds a police inspector pointing at his gun, "This airport is surrounded by armed capers" and makes it easier to escape without a dailymail. The film will describe the whole audience. It has a significant supporting role as Emily Day. Why can she even dial a fugitive <br /> <br /> This is a very poor thriller and not a "big name" cast. Wesley Snipes was used to qualify as a film actor, but his career was featured in more unlikely films. Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions, such as Last Action Hero and Elien 3, but he is well-known for direct DVD participating in these days, although he has mainly starred in a guest role. Lena Headday's likes to become big players in the movie, but they can not fail the contractor on their resume
