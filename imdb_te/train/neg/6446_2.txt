Western society gave India ideas of poor country. Such films make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it difficult to accept Indians abroad. <br /> <br /> I'm totally hated by the pictric Swayze being portrayed as another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this film has shown India a bad sense of bad light. It is unfair to discuss the same topic of community. Why did people ask me, "Can we rent an elephant out of the airport when we go to India, so that you do not walk on highways and snakes, who want a second view on contemporary Indian society to see" Varshan's Wedding ".
