Wow! Pretty terrible thing. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor Highway in the lands of Sardinia and the Argentine director Joseph Lucy, this extraordinary badminton, Tennessee Williams flop. Taylor has a great, dead widow who has his followers on an island where she is very expensive, and many memories of her patient. Taylor finds out his time when the evilman claims that Burton is a poet and an old friend. Strongly ridiculous - Whether Taylor and Burton perform better, or Williams's intention is that their characters do not disappear. If that's the case, then acting is amazing! Burton sneaks into his songs, including a number of times, but Taylor kills her. She's really awful. So NoÃ«l Coward Taylor's Katie Conscient, "The Witch of Capri." <br /> Maybe BOOM shakes the time and how fast the life moves along - the two standard Williams themes, but the audience that Taylor and Burton wrote it did not make it their most unrealistic monologue, the film was completely dissolved. <br /> <br /> Boom has excellent photography --- Camera focuses on lifting the beauty of Sardinia! Supported cast Jonathan Shimkus, great Romolo Valli like Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard ... he and his dogs do many in Burton!
