Bela Lugosie sends poisonous orchids on their wedding day, steals the body with his fake ambulance / noise, and Bela's wife takes home for his midget assistant to collect jentular juices to keep the youth constantly. Some detectives playing second actors try to solve the terrible, terrible secret. Bela Lugosi is doing well, but you can say that you need money. <br /> <br /> The film is absolutely horrific, and many actors have to wait for the tables, but the plot is amazingly ridiculous. Tell them what happened in it and they are laughing at most people and demanding to see the movie. I got the DVD in Discount Store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is pretty accurate valuation, someone who pays more for this will be in their mind.
