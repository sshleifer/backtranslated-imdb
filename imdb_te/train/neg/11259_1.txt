I gave 1 for this film. Eto'or scola, one of the most directors in the Italian film, I can not understand how the film is stupid and ludicrous. All the stories of the people involved in this film are undoubtedly boring and interesting. Very long, very boring. The only thing I have saved in this movie is Xiancarlo Jeanini and Vittorio Gosman. We expect Scola to change the background and style of his next film.
