This film is "inspired", but it is similarly inspired by a car accident. It's hard to stay away. Overall, this film is no more than a social experiment that is not very irresponsible - and a wasteful, partisan experiment. Filmmakers seem to be facing any problems for manipulation and less possible denominations. The way money was paid to Ted is pure exploitation. Instead of making any attempt to meet up with Ted, it is painful to cover filmmakers' ancestors and to further exploit Ted's situation. The filmmakers stopped Ted after 6 months; They are also completely cut off from the previous few months. If they take care of it, they found good professionals to help Ted. If they really want to see how Ted would be, then they would have to spend money without any intervention. The film is the best-Bro's Jacques Stunt and not the documentary. It is sad to think that $ 100,000 actually changed the lives of the homeless person, which was put in the right hands.
