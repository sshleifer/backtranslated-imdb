The film took nine years to complete. I would have said someone in that 9 years, hey, this movie is terrible. I have seen good acting in romantic movies. The story was tired and played. An abusive child becomes a serial killer. How about new for change. Will the abused baby change into the florist? There was at least a new twist. Why does the camera and everyone think that a movie idea (especially weird movie ideas) are they director? After completing 9 years with this film, I finished. It shows the gig and the soul. Hopefully the next time, this kind of drive was focused on a good script. If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film from a writer / director from Michigan, see a minute's hatred. If you want a good movie with Evil Dead from the Michigan writer / director stick.
