I can not say this movie is terrible. The whole Chinese ancestors because there is a awakening in your mother. But telling viewers that Chinese history has not read the Chinese history. It's like telling American American history or learning about every Filipino. It's just not believable. <br /> <br /> The story is bizarre. This is a shin of China from a monastery - later recognizing it from Beijing. However, the early sequences of the film show a map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese rule is to grant areas such as Mongolia for its own. But its special country and it also symbolizes the "Mongolia" symbol. Disney Studios 5th grade fails geographically? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is the best, and she somehow connects. Her training is as well as cheesy. And, let the chase cut: everything about this film is bad. It is not bad enough to cry, smiling on it. In many cases Taekwondo played action and was unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The bad eyes were bad. However, the left edge of the left is only about it. They should leave the bad eyes in it. But instead something bad is lost. Yey! <br /> <br /> In total, the dog's time in the film is not valuable. Brenda Song needs another studio. "F"
