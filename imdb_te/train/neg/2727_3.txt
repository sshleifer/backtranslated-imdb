In this new DORIS DAY collection, this eccentricity is only about a 30-minute film. But what she does, she is shining on the screen. There is no need to display some Warner contract players of the nearest movie picture of the low picture. Johny Rule shows promise and she has not changed to become a big actor. Ruth Roman maintains the role of "Go-Buster" with Ablom. It's fine if it's in color. Probation behind some of Travis Air Force base positions work well. The best of the film is some wonderful musical relationships. If you enjoyed thanks to your lucky stars and Hollywood you can enjoy this one CANTEEN.
