I bought this video in Walmart's $ 1 bin. I think I paid the over !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate films for small studios (in which case, Monogram - starring in most Bowie Boys films). While most of these films do not reach the dreadful level of achievements of his past films ("Uri's Bride of the Monster" and "Edin Wood" classics like "Plan 9 of Outer Space"), they have poor images and should not be omitted <br /> <br / > I am an old film drug addict, so I've given this effort. <br /> <br /> These little pictures are only very good - just not. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, another, mad scientist, he concocts from the young bride. <br /> <br /> They do not really explain why they should be brides or why they should be a woman or his wife - so you can see that the plot has never really attended. <br /> However, the really annoying woman reporter (a loses lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to take these dead bodies into the bottom. So, she follows some evidence of Luco's home. Lugosi's house was completed with two crazy men who had her crazed wife, female assistant and assistant sons (an ugly hunchback sex fiend and a dwarf). Obviously this plucky reporter fains repeatedly throughout the film - obviously go hand in hand of narcolepsy and good investigative journalism! In the end, the maniacs die all - mostly their hands and all is well. At the end, the reporter and her doctor met she decided to just marry. Obviously, the reporter's dumb cameraman faces this. If you do not notice, the film is very faint. Or, maybe they fell asleep because it was a slow and spectacular image!
