I'm a big fan of Troma but I can not figure out why they bought the rights to this film, which is so boring I felt I was watching for 3 hours. <br /> <br /> Some people have said about the plot summary here, but "Satan does not know that he is hurt by the annoying tourists". The actor who plays Satan's role about this film, I like the bad movie but it is boring.
