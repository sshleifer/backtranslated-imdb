So it starts with a beautiful old boy in the country. You have a group of people who want to come to this home and (surprisingly) the gates lock up the gates without any obvious reason at night. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke etc. This doctor tells them an unusual story of this woman and some kids. They are afraid, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, the ghost of a girl look. Some people talk this huge ghost and so on. This girl learns that this ghost kills little children and she should break their souls, yes, blah blah. But if she does, oh no, she does she dies. And this nasty ghost goes to heaven during the hell goes. Two people survive and escape from home. The script is terrible because a man cuts his head and says "Oh no!" Acting is a wooden, the effects are much worse and the set is a couple of reused rooms. If you look at the pictures that are badly shot and watch it, do not miss it unless you look at it, but if you are scared. I was very disappointed when I saw it. Let's down too big. My sister (very easy to be holy) gets bored in the film.
