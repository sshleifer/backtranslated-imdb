Okay, I learned about this movie and read almost all reviews of the preview and it's hard to discuss whether or not I see it. Before I saw the film I was emotionally peculiar to it. I'm not going to see this and I'm not sure if it's such a long time. So I chose to risk it and told it what I was thinking: initially I started fine for myself. It seemed to be a good direction. The rape scene has gone before and I can not figure out why the movie is disturbed or bored. The rape scene is just sad and scary I can not get it wrong but it really does not bother me for a dramatic point. Then in the middle I had to understand the boring stuff going on. There are no such things as 5 minutes but people are saying nothing or anything! It has a shot that gives some kind of emotion to a person, but it does not exist. There are 3 scenes in this three, where you see the main character coming out of a magical kind of control and it wants me to go forward. Then when she was engaged in a hardcore dinner it was not so boring but it was still a little dull. Oh and a note Rosario Dawson still did a great job. Okay, finally, at the end of the afternoon, it's a revenge for Maya's attention. It is disturbing. I did not think he was bad or he could not do anything, but the whole scene was really upset and I thought it was all the cake after that. I can not really tell if I can watch this movie. Because of that ... I do not know how to sum it up. But if you choose to see it, it's not right.
