Well, I do like Gore in this movie - it's genetically unsetteling. Why would anyone know the dentist? The story is not really bad, the motivations of Corbin Bergen's character make more sense than most horror films. <br /> <br /> I saw a bad acting, directing, scripts, but it's still a bad horror movie. So if you enjoy that kind of kind it comes down. I tried to see the sequel, but this picture is exactly the same thing. If you enjoyed the torturers at the dentist, this picture is for you!
