Now, poor reviews have come and "Oh yeah ... it's not so bad!" I liked the Cable Guy and thought my Big Fat Independent movie was great. Remember, I did not really start looking at this with high hopes, but I might have ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a kind of way I could not laugh. I made a mistake. At any time of my distress by this "film" (and I will use that term less) I am also close to being a little entertaining. To begin, Shock Quentin Tarantino played the role of Marlon Brando, when it came to act. I hate rap music, but as far as I can say, the Amish priest probably better rapper than him. The main character is just annoying, and it is not a character who likes it. Most frankly, Harlequin will eat a greasy turd out of the bloody sores' bloodier than I see this again.
