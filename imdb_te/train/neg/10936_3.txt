I like this film, I really did. It's got some good actors but finally it's flat. In some places (daughters on vigorous cooking efforts), it's hard to be funny in some places, and some scenes, really only fill (all work sequences) in others (the scene where they clean the yard, accept the team). And I did not find the "villains" bullying, or the most abhorrent I seemed to be childishly annoying to them. <br /> <br /> When I play a Church Ball, I'll meet with those in the movie. And I will say that the referee's spot is, yet, in the end, I really do not care much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. Because they all are so dimensional, perhaps I may not be too minded if the film seemed to be quite ridiculous or slightly smoothly flowing. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale, and Halestom Entertainment have made some good pictures, but this is not one of them.
