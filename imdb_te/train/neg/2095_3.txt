Buttar Galactica was great because it was a very hard writing, great look, best actors, and interesting stories ... and yes, hot men and women would go out uniformly. <br /> <br /> Coppika is just lazy. Lazy writing. The actors have been storming a storm to give them "role". Outdoor sequences that destroy the feel of a different place (yes, this is the Ford Focus sitting in the background). Lots and young ones desires. Naked women (but in the background I will definitely be cut for this series) and token view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Pali Walker did not get my attention. <br /> <br /> When an hour is over, I'm still surprised when I'm still hanging out. <br /> What is the purpose of bringing me back? Science fiction? It is very light. Actors? Along with the fine turn of Polly Walker, it is very interesting here. <br /> <br /> "I'm skeptical about the coffee and I'm skeptical, and unfortunately, I guess I expected far less for a series unless they really sharpen pencils at SCIFI and get this more making work than on OC on another planet.
