You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leather Face. Be ready for now: Safety Pin Killer! In the killer workout, in a mute slasher movie, if I saw one, the unseen murderer sends it with a huge, strange security pin to his (or her?) Victims. This is clearly an odd choice, a type of thing that deserves a description. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone suspects. In fact, the film gives some evidence of the identity of the killer, the potential murderer until the killing of everyone in the film. In addition, killer killers killed by killing everyone but it is just a removal process. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, if the whole name dies, the aerobics classes will continue to be stimulating. Of course, there is no ability to stop dancing. Although three men are murdered in the next room, the exercise will continue. Death is not even a factor; A character dies, but is still prominent in later exercise sessions. <br /> <br /> With cop, explosion tanning beds and hundreds of women's exposed meat shots are thrown out for good measure. The tailor was like a woman trapped in bed, and I thought the killer workout was ultimately uncomfortable. Finally, fortunately, END flashed into the screen. What happened next You got it, women work out shots. <br /> <br /> That's the end of the movie!
