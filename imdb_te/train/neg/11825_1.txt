Silise Merner is one of the best novels of all time by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The original authress of the image shown in the IMDb should be reported to the original authress but I can not see it at the beginning of the film, but only in the end that it says, "The book of Silas Mariner." Suggested? <br /> <br /> An unlawful and sad old artist, the poor and the loner, was stolen by his entire money. When one dies in the snow, one night he eats his door. The man takes her and demands a local squire (or a great politician) to adopt a child up to one day. This gave birth to a child in years of ill health. <br /> In this film and in all other aspects, the story is exactly the same. I find only one difference. Sylves Morner had epilepsy - but perhaps most would have deteriorated Mr acting abilities. On top of that he has dyed in some carrot juice concoction his hair (perhaps to look younger to him, but in fact he makes it look more clown)! There are also extraordinary jokes in addition to, that this off beat comedian can not prevent him from entering the story and removing it from the story's error. When she says that she is crying in the business, she is happy only to her father all this year. <br /> <br /> In this film, I am amazed to make a film such as the integrity and integrity of the film industry. If I were the trustee of George Eliot, I was losing. If I'm Steve Martin, I will send the benefit to the estate or the poor. At least it should be named Silas Manger - adopted by S Martin. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - you expect it - see it completely and see Silas Marner. Or read the book! In the 1980s, the BBC made its excellent adaptation.
