Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, her fifteen years and her birthday is coming week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the town wants to be with her, but some people who can catch her curiously die. <br /> <br /> I want to see this film because I'm going to be honest because Dana Kimmel on Friday 13th page 3 It was not the right reason why it came and see an image. "Sweet sixteen" is not a very good slash when I start looking, it's really dull and boring and does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> One hour later, only three murders occurred, and the story did not actually develop. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully portrayed with photography and good direction, with movies from the 80s, very dark in the film. <br /> <br /> The story line is not entirely rubbish but it is too dull to make you curious, Melissa Melissa and she is really sweet and beautiful in this movie, Dana Kimmel . <br /> <br /> I do not want to go anywhere in a pretty dull image. It is not recommended for fans of Slasher.
