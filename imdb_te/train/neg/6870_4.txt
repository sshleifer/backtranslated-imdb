A well-known film about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), wife of the Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glen Fitzgerald). Who is deeply happy. Mendel's brother sender (Christopher Ecclestoston) looks at it and already hires the work in which the jeweler is in the field. He started an affair with her and later when she spent time with the Puerto Rican artist, he eats her and drives her to her, driving her out. When Sonja's dead brother speaks to her and the beggar in the magic takes the form of a woman, but is not clear. Most, unfortunately, does not know exactly what happens with Sonja, why she has a fire with Rebbie and perhaps why it is not from God and its meaning, and the magical beggar tells the woman why she understands. An elaborate story falls on the plight of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sona was not properly released. It does not seem to have redeemed the love of another race personally as well thought out. The title comes from a biblical definition of a good woman's value? Yet it is the bastard sender that Sonja says it. Zellweger is fighting in this part; She is considered to be a Jew from Mid-West and sometimes her voice is flat, and at other times it has taken Brooklyn's characteristic sounds. She's fine when she's tough and charged, but eventually the movie is confusing.
