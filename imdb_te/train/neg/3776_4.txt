I believe, I wanted to like "Spirit". Idiottic interpretations made by people during the release of the last pencil-animated cartoon that was released twenty years ago and looking at old-fashioned, hand-drawn animations, computers are now out of old use, got my blood ... But the insulting and ill-made ban is " Soul "to wake up to nine in ten minutes Indi. <br /> <br /> "These characters are simple, animated (partially) only effective, totally towards the art of art, full of folly" Egypt "and" The Road to El-Dorado ", DreamWorks have talented artists) and CGI Sophisticated use of each case is ill. There is not a thing worth looking at (why do not they bother?). <br /> <br /> Horses can not speak, but they are very human and unbelievable. Debut in "Bobby", it can. And in a way, it seems that horses can speak. Spirit gives us the previous event (the world's sound like the 21st century actor from shopping mall in California), and from his detachment from the soundtrack ever since, tells us that we do not already know, or even artistic, but poor, twice as well It's not a feeling of expression. That prolog, by the way: (a) contains the spirit of the information, we know, know the way to know; (B) He expresses the feelings of the Spirit to not express any empowerment to speak when he speaks; (C) The New Age Worst Even, "This story is not true, but that is what I remember"; And (d) horses belonging to North America, the most common ancestors of domestic horses and zebras, most of the children (the production pitch, thought to be six years old) belongs to North America - but before the first humans arrived, all the horsemen of the continent were exterminated, and the spirit of the flock Mustangs (accusations are called "gede grass") ) From the horses introduced by Europeans <br /> <br /> Speech was embarrassing to me. <br /> <br /> Spirit talks often bryan Adams, who has a bad sore infection. If he sings or sings how it sings, he sings: the moudly narrative folklore stories, if possible, than the spirit of speaking of the spirit, and if they are all exactly the same tune (I am closely paying attention, and that they probably did not). If Bryan Adams and Guy-actress-to-one-horse have a minute or two minutes of shut up, the film may have been allowed to take its true form: bad, mediocre, and jaw-falling bad.
