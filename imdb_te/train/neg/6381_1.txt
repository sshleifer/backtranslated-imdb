<br /> <br /> In this film, a group of extra-terrestrial blacks who create homophobic hypocrisy, wiping women on the ground. <br /> <br /> I saw with the intention of seeing how bad I was. Still, I was amazed at how bad it was. It was like a film 50 years ago. Acting, if any, is ultra bad. Sets and clues are so funnierly fake, making no college image look mega budget. <br /> <br /> In order to congratulate the film, it must be a particular drug or a change of consciousness. If I were from Denmark, I was deeply troubled by my countrymen creating such a horror movie.
