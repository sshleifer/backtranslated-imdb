I'm still bored of any movie that features Karen Allen's nude scenes, a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen is trapped in Paris and is dating a delicate-handsome French man who has sex right away. In fact he was married ("But, why, why should that be a problem?") The interesting confrontation of cultures is that it is just dull. I walked out. <br /> <br /> When I leave, the movie looks good. <br /> If you find yourself in this case, do not go out and walk away. Save your time and your energy. Saves your money very precisely. It was not a product company that saved money.
