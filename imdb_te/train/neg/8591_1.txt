I'm trying to decide which jumping into a timber chopper would be much more pleasant than this dirt. This once ended with the destruction of a classic twin images. We have Lucas's career with Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith. Do we want Anakin Wonder to be nonsense? I believe it is true. This film confirms those feelings. The story did not work from Phantom Moron, and each new film piled up the trash until it was left in the fairy tale. I should go. I know where some new rocks are thrown out. Do you want spoilers? Here they come. No connection with Luke and Leah. Wader is not their father. Duke Count, turns to the side when he still can. Yoda has less sound skills than Yogi Berra. His advice is never good for anyone. Obi Wan was lured to Luke in the first two films. Annakin C3P0 is not built. He discovered him in the desert and lied to his mother about the first time he was combined. Chebakaka has flies. With the wader and the fall of the Republic, the whole mess can blame the stupid b *** hmma mom-lama-ding-dong. She has no brains, but she does not come in all of a lightweight year, but she tells her what George Lucas wrote. What dope!
