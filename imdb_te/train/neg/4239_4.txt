It's better than the average picture I imagined, it's on the cable. <br /> <br /> The cast was well-received ... I especially liked Ron Livingstone as the SWAT commander of the hard-pressed pressure. It is good to see again the same thing that he has very fortunate in Brotherhood of Brothers. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch this film, I am undoubtedly. FX takes 50 hours to go back ... 2 hours and enjoy.
