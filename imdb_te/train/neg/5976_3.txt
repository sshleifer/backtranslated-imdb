The rumor is true: guys like COYOTE UGLY than guys. The immediate causes of the plot are clearly visible. Jersey girl is a song writer who goes to New York. And after the initial disappointment to have luck, they will hear some girls who come about $ 300 each made last night. They get an audition at work and surprise bar! <br /> <br /> The story is not bad, some characters, especially the comedy ("fashion coordinator" episode), and bouncer but let's face, the play is terrible and totally ridiculous. Violet and her father were very ridiculous in the film. <br /> <br /> How can I think for the first time, how terrible is the production? Shortly after the film, Hollywood stands on his two feet, "You're Alerted!" Without any major public protest, demonstrating a new level. Instead, Kyoto UGLY is intentionally intentionally intending to try to kiss every major part of the world. <br /> Finally, music. I'm not sure the break of music I've discovered in this movie, especially when it's needed (hospital scene). Every scene that you feel is considered as some small music video that you want until the bar starts. But the climax is the ultimate launcher: as you guess the jump on the stage and jam with the song Sandy Lapper Wiet like '80s. Heck, I thought personally going to jump with Bon Jovi also with long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Diane (especially the wet scene), and a Coyote girls are some really smart camera work beautiful couple trend, Kyoto UGLY is something totally intolerant. Even if you have seen or made, it's like killing nothing but time. Or you can waste it by looking at it.
