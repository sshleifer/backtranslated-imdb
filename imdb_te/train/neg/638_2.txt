Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and low. Acting borders are joking. When I loved Paul Muni, I saw a movie that did not have his real capability. The only income I found with this image is the value of the product. Hundreds of additional use across the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create millions of twigs can easily be sold and revolutionized at the time. Other than the value of the product I can say a bit better or entertaining about this film.
