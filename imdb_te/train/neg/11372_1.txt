I have been using IMDb for years and I never wanted to take part in movies commentary. Until now. This documentary has many problems and I do not know what to say. I'm not Muslim, nor I am an Islamic study expert, but this documentary espouses the clear one-sided perspective that knows some light shed. <br /> <br /> The problems in the film begin even though it is a documentary. Most of those documentaries that I saw anchored around some valid points are those discussions, erroneous explanations and false information. This is exactly what happens with Islam: we need to know western countries. Yes, there are fundamentals around the world and it is very misleading to build a documentary about the whole of Islam about some Muslims, but very few radical people. This is not really about the foundational factors of Islam and more. <br /> <br /> There are many points that can help those who are more objectively searching for some of the issues collected in this documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but most Muslims live outside the area. More and more Muslims live in China, rather than in Saudi Arabia or not. Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia have almost 40% of Muslims. <br /> <br /> The Qur'an's translation used in the documentary is questionable. I saw another document. Now I have warned you about the translation used in the documentary, now I know why. Surah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Sura has said that unbelievers are going to hell. But, I have translated this: "Those who reject the truth in the Scripture and the Polytheites are in hellfire." Those who reject the truth are those people who know about God and know the truth about God and decide to deny anyway. <br /> <br /> The film claims that there is no morality in Islam, but this is not true. Although it is true from the Qur'an and the Hadith, Islam also recognizes the concept of 'arf or behavior'. <br /> <br /> The documentary shows Shar'ia (Islamic Law), which is good or bad. As a unified body of knowledge that follows all Muslims. This is not true. There are many Islamic laws, and they can be used to describe the principle from progressive and modern. <br /> The Hadith tradition is the same. There are tens of thousands of hades and every school of law accepts some and rejects others. Selecting hadius without a serious scholarship to determine what is accurate, real and applicable is indiscriminately choosing and quotations from the history that you want to say? <br /> I do not believe that Islam or any other religion, people would realize that the theory of theory is a problem. Christianity abortion clinic is the doctors who shoot and walk that is fundamentalists. It is not like a suicide bomb, but I understand that the fundamentalism of the fundamentalism is undoubtedly a problem. If you feel that you have the answer, then everyone should be sure. But if you feel that you have an answer, you can work with others' opinions about politics, religion, god or other things.
