<br /> <br /> When I saw 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' I was on the big Elijah Dushku kick when I got the movie rented. 'Soul Survivors' is a wasteful mental thriller dressed as a waste teen slazer flick - masked killer twigs dushu, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), Casey Affleck (Mona Drowning) and favorite star Melissa Sezmiller. There is also Luke Wilson, a ridiculous miscast like a priest. Writer and director Stephen Carpenter's design, a revised child of 'Open Your Eyes' or 'Vanilla Sky' and a character (and audience) risk / death. The film is experiencing motion pictures, and the alternative reality runs the whole time in a tumultuous situation until it finally settles. I'm not entertaining these films - they started with their nature, but 'SS' is the richest movie in the rock-bottom of the way you press. Visuals, script, acting, and the reality of any reality have previously rejected the theaters for movies. Plus, it is PG-13 so it does not provide gore or T & A for a flawed pleasure (even the version that has not been corrected). I heard that there is a movie in some "hot" shower scenes between Dushuk & Sezmiller. I'm patiently waiting for the shower sequence, since the film seems to be different from me and seems to lose all the other amusements - at least I'll get something from this. Then comes: Two girls are painted on their shirts, they should be thoroughly dressed in the shower and clean it up. That's it. Did people feel it hot? 'Soul Survivors' is weak and ineffective, it's hard to have feelings on any side. It's hard and worth writing about it. In the end we are empty. The carpenter's finish is a shining light and integrated sound mess and it's probably the most active part. It is undoubtedly due to a low cost and PG-13 rating that makes it round at night in the USA or Science Fiction channel and is the best one.
