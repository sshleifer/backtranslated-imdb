Critics wiped out Syria and mentioned it. I think it is one of the brilliant films ... I think you should be well-versed in the oil industry and politically clever mind. I did not think I was aware of it, I was reading politics from my first teens and I enjoyed a brilliant movie, but most of it is a documentary film that must have entertaining and message. Syria has tried to be clever, and it keeps some people away. They are referring to it and they will go until they say 10/10. The film is a very confusing, mindless, diligent dribble I have seen quite a bit ... especially critically acclaimed, Oscar Nights, cast. Writer author Stephen Gagan again disappointed me. His terrible work Hawk is before this movie and he is trying hard. I can not believe that he was given a chance to write Da Vinci Code screenplay. He directed the film on the gigang, which made it a perfect coincidence. No one knows, why, what and who he is. This is a disaster. <br /> <br /> I do not know who I am because I can only say the actors and their performances because the actors have alright in spite of the horrendous complex script. George Clooney C.I.A. Field Agent and Assassin I think ?? Bob Burns. Clooney has never been the favorite of mine but lately he managed to perform some good performances parrot and it seemed a pretty good show on her part. Burns is a complex character with an obscene history and I really enjoyed his role if I knew what would happen with him. Matt Damon plays the role of Bryan Woodmann and he is cool and always looks like a deer in these headlights, and I try to understand the confusion and try to do it after reading this script. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she works well in some of the scenes she has given. Christopher Plummer plays a guest role as someone else does. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> If the story only makes sense, the cast is intense. I would like to quote a plot description in IMDb. "A missile disappears in Iran, but the CIA has other problems: An emirate of an emirate gives China an oil deal, a US company is soon to be removed and burning its migrant laborers and a small company is the Kazakhstan oil dealer bribery, and the oil company's law firm Find a scapegoat. Its plot fails to kill Emer ABB Bob Burns, who has a fallen person, has double cross-out, economists have signed an agreement seeking to kill his son's death, and unemployed Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group, all roads begin in oil fields. !? Who can say now Syrian thought may be the image of man but it tears and I eventually surrendered and eventually surrendered and bored me no matter how hard it turned off after one and a half an hour and you could not bribe me enough to get me out. Suppose you want to create more feedback than you do, but someone you're looking for for a sleigh of fun in the first half of the year or just for fun. 1/10
