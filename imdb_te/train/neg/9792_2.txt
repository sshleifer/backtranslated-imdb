<br /> I read the manga and my purpose is different. <br /> <br /> This animator was disappointing that I was manga and OVA's comedy and high quality action. It would have been just what it was like. In most characters there is no depth in the manga. Alucard is not the character of sympathetic sympathy for the mysterious death. Walter's story is not betraying. The Nazi villains who are intended to surround the world in war are not entirely complete. Instead, anime Gary Stuil gives the villain anonymous. Lose out against all the irregularities. <br /> <br /> My most important complaint is that the manga is different from the manga.
