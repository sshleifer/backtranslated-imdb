I guess this film is based on the kind of true story ... It's about two young women who have grown up for 48hrs; I can not see the Terror coming into the game .... There are some "strange" and "surreal" scenes in the film and two girls (Sandra Lock and ... Ohh ... oh well) Held for the two psycho-man's haters ... they Have a good job (but it is a bit shorter). The picture is not good, it's not terrible, it's just really really! I understand this thing is dripping with 70 .... If you like that sort is not really bad ... Did you know that ... thang?
