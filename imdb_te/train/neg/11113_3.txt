I often feel like a scout, I'm writing a review of the movies that are portrayal of others-or, to assemble, unwanted towns. I found this movie almost invisible, and I was quick to go through the unusual, uninterrupted, cliche dialogue, or dull, cliche musical numbers. There is nothing realistic in this movie - exceptional domestic settings for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation - more than offset by a script that does not develop intellect or thought-provoking plot. Individually, June Hayworth and Don Dolly appear to be good people, but a film can not be a movie. Which is not really attractive or too sex appeal. They're both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty. The best part of the film, for me, is June Haver's beautiful dress and great body.
