This film is the worst butterfly. Bad everything. Thousands of thirty times thrown to ten people who love western movies. If you do not see names such as Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, or Tom Selleck, it's not enough to cover. Most of the Shi'oah waterfall's main activity occurred in 1892, but there were 1860 designs using revolvers. The shooting is also bad - Marshal wakes up his six-shooter nine times in a scene, and he is unable to beat the three adults who are twenty feet away. After 15 minutes of this wickedness I had to stop it. Participants in this movie may learn some lessons in the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
