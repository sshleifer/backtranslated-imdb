I love Chris Rock, but he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking Heaven Ken weightage is fine, but the filmmakers are closely followed by Turkey's story. When Eddie Murphy recollected Dr Dulittle and The Nutty Professors, he made them complete - so they became Murphy's films / vehicles, not just sleep remakes. So they succeeded. If Chris did this, it could be a better film. He had some laughs while he was standing up to his stand-up - so he also made a concert. Whether a white man was his trailer driver or Hillbill was even more ridiculous. So why does Hollywood make such waste? Because people are going to see it - they like Chris Rock. Give Chris a good script and give us good movies! Do not remake the images that are not good at first!
