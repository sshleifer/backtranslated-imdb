Why not be a woman in a woman in a woman without a famous woman? In the film, the campaign manager Tom Selleck dreamed of dreaming of the White House. It's all that she thinks about. So why should there be a relationship with her on earth? It did not add anything to the theme and served only to the successful women. That tidbit is only worth the value "we've all slept with your husband" scenery. <br /> <br /> The people who made the film did not even see the national meetings they spoofed. The broadcasting between the two major political conventions was only to show the nomination and selection process to show their total ignorance.
