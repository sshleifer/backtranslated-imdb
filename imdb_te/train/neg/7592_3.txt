The 1930s' golden age of Los Angeles has become a great and famous and happy with the great possibility of its film industry and many other possibilities. People were hoping to fulfill their dreams. Open hands and welcoming prospects are both successful and impressed by the majority, and the majority is then looking for respect in hunger, depression, undesirability, dirty bars and dirty hotel rooms. <br /> <br /> The young Italian-American writer Arutto Bundini comes to LA similarly to make one of these beautiful wealthy women and write his charm to write a wonderful novel that sets him on the way to his career, so far a little published in a vague volume Wrote the story. He wants to create a romance story that he does not produce anything without experiencing himself, and occasionally, he sends the pieces of magazines to the local editor. He is proud to show himself as an Italian but deep in his heart, who thinks his Italian origin is a burden. He had little money and he had the last single nickel to spend all of his time daring to conquer the world and spend his time as a hangover spent on his dream. <br /> <br /> She has a cold underneath the cold and sour and her insults, an endless relationship, unconscious excuses and a hidden love. With Camilla being an illiterate trying to get American citizenship through marriage, she has a huge cross of elite class heritage. Although she is a very beautiful girl with a strong and lifelong experience, she treats as a beautiful Mexican woman, but Arturo is more difficult to recognize. <br /> Does Arturo finally find his inspiration to work on his novel? Can their love finally find its place in the sun? <br /> <br /> It is very surprising that chemistry does not work between the two main characters performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell. The relationship does not have raw and authentic feelings. Although Farrell has forgotten her role as the patron of Hayek Liverlier, she unveiled the camera, which was once an amazing character Frida. Being wise or illiterate and illiterate is hard to be confident in the role of using very difficult terminology and complicated sentences. A stronger role in Phil Marl is precisely in harmony with Farrell, although he looks awesome at the times of his time, who tries to find the world of twenty-year old dreams between a secret love and wish. <br /> <br /> It is not wrong to look at both the screen on the screen. Their relationship may be in the forest but it is possible that a thunderstorm and a lightning is explained, not from the very true love, feelings just do not feel inside. It is very interesting that an interesting script and good actors such potential wasted, soon-forgotten become a gray average.
