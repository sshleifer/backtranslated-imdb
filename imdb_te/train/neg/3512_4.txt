I think the film is somewhat overrated. There are a few things to worship; For one thing, it deserves credit for a film based on its story, instead of special characters and action scenes for a science fiction film (ish). The support is good for the cast, set design and cinematography is good, and the ideas are interesting (after a very mediocre Dark City / Memento / Fight Club clones in recent years appear tired). But the film is canceled by poor roles, wooden performances from major actors and a ridiculous bad ending. <br /> <br /> The main problem I faced was not the hero's favorite. I know that part of the story is that he should be a bit (wait for it ...) cipher, but I could not fully utter the task of any empathy for the role that seemed like a boring, anonymous schlub man. Any character for this mournful narrative can be artificially forced into him by the plot. The lead actor Jeremy Normam succeeded in telling the storyline to be confusing and vigilant, but failing to promote any sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> Faced with him, Lucy Liu is a woman who does not have any kind of personality and can be herself a spy film cliche, but as a personality. <br /> <br /> The movie ended. I will give you any spoilers here, but ultimately a surprising twist is clearly clear to everyone at least 45 minutes before. In addition, the content of the first hour is a very active, thought-based film, and the last few sequences are suddenly and horrifically the most terrible type of Hollywood pop, full of big explosions and special effects. At the end of the film's MacGuffin is much less revealing, and finally the main storyline of the characters feels less than the characters before the threads are resolved. <br /> <br /> This movie is not all bad, though. Although slowly moving (I feel that I have more patience than average for the slow-looking movies), this is done to maintain a very low level of tension. There are a few moments when the director Vincenzo Natalie is obviously trying to get up the surface, ignorant, paranoid feeling. But in the end, these things are not enough to overcome errors in film acting and script. This is probably a good picture that covers the same themes and ideas, but it is not.
