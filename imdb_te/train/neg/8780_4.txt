Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes his wife when his wife died. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Pryce, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP), received messages from messages from electronic gadgets from Jonathan's exiled wife Anna. Are you trying to tell Anna Anna to Jonathan? Is this a reference to a large global or other world class? Keaton is looking to be in a major role, but he has previously been mocking and abusive story; <br /> <br /> The film breaks the viewer with new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton is good to herself, and her husband dies as a divorced attempting to communicate with his wife. He is a little bit matured as an actor, who left the frat-friendly thief-haziness characters he played in 15 years or so. <br /> <br /> He does not lose any of the satirical and panorama he has shown during his quarter century in Hollywood, but he looks somewhat scarce with fewer wrinkles than he did in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Keaton has not changed at an average performance, which is the script itself prefix. The story is written by Niel Johnson, which shakes the plot when it shakes, and each wrapping another path will end in another terrible way. This is all well and good if something of the way leads to acceptable destructive sort, something more or less related to something and describes something ... something. But not white noise; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know how to make a living.
