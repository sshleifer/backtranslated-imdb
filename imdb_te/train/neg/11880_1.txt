Office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail, and `Temps," the irony is grown on the land of opportunities, in the past, "vatcers Clock" and "Office Space," and the most successful. However, temporary / humor, this is the latest addition to the pool, however, was directed by Josh karnblut and Jacob karnblut 'haiku Tunnel', its predecessors, and the door to the outside was jivincaleka navvincakunda somewhere, unfortunately, the audience does not get the chance; <br /> <br /> The storyteller / actor Josh Kornbloth (playing Josh Kornbloth) in the early framings pointed out. (In a statement directly sent to the camera), the story is pure fiction, and a fictional city in San Francisco. It's an innovative, very ridiculous disglaimer, and not all that funny. However, it's the messenger of everything, it's all - like a disclaimer - not just that funny. <br /> <br /> Cornwall, Cornwall, is a 'temporary.' It's a job that suits him, and it gives time to slip into some work of his novel. కానీ అతను ఒక న్యాయవాది అయిన బాబ్ షెల్బి (వారెన్ కీత్) కోసం పని చేస్తున్నప్పుడు, అతను మొదటి రోజు చాలా మంచి ఉద్యోగం చేస్తాడు, మరియు షెల్బి ప్రధాన కార్యదర్శి మార్లిన్ డి'అమోర్ (హెలెన్ షుమెకర్) ను కార్న్బ్లత్కు పంపిస్తూ అతనిని ఒప్పించేందుకు . 'The idea of ​​full-time work for the same company, however, is initially afraid of Cornbull's heart, but he caves in the cave and in the caves. He's about it really scared, but at least the other secretaries in his presence (which, of course, they temporarily will never do) agree, and things are very tight, as if he typed in seventeen major characters - just e-mail to send it is necessary - to send them back (he Mailing is easy, and the reservation is back Vlo easy it can be to do something, it's all too much for him to be). But these are 'important' characters, and by the end of the week, Cornwall still reserve on his desk. And when Shelby learns about it, she does not have a genius to discover that the days of Kornbluff are the fair-hearted boy. <br /> <br /> Brothers Kornblut directed the screenplay for the film, along with John Bellucci, to get the page from the Ben Stilller book of comedy. 'If you play it straight, they smile. 'But they did not, and the audience was not. Ironically, when it looks objectively as possible, the main character (in this case most of the supporting characters) is `fades' funny - when he knows he's funny - he's never been. And that's exactly what cornblue does here; So he is "funny," he is hypocritical and serious in judging on the part of Corneblows, because by allowing it, they have killed their own film. <br /> <br /> Trying to figure out why this film does not work, it comes for two basic reasons: directing, which - if not bad - is least blind; And secondly, Josh Kornbloom begins with shows. Quite simply, Kornblut feels able to influence himself. Unlike Stiller, or Steve Martin - both use self-frustrated humor very efficiently - Kornblatter clearly has an ego, which does not allow himself to be just that; He feels he wants to tell his audience that the real Cornblad is actually more intelligent than the character of Cornwall. And he can not get past the past, as well as the picture makes. Instead of handing out hundreds of thousands of office workers, or to find someone with whom they can identify with this film to see, karnblabt, the very people he was trying to reach paradesistundi. అందువల్ల ఇది అన్నిటికి దారి తీస్తుంది, పేద దర్శకత్వం మరియు నమ్మశక్యంకాని నటన, మరియు స్క్రీన్ ప్లే కూడా ప్రారంభం కానప్పుడు బలహీనంగా ఉంది, సంభవించని ఇరుకైన దృష్టి (సంపద విషయం యొక్క సంభావ్యత) తో, <br /> <br /> ఈ చిత్రం యొక్క ఒక పొదుపు దయ, షెబ్బి వలె వారెన్ Featuring Keith's performance, its subtle delivery is confident and in it - very ridiculous. However, the effect is reduced, but Keith shares his scenes with Cornblad, which will automatically cancel his favorable work for the project. <br /> <br /> Schumacher and Sarah Overman (Julie Fousino) have also managed to keep their heads on top of their water, even though they are not entirely remembered; They can not at least see their scenes, and Overman increases the performance of the Cornwall, which is only a matter of time. <br /> <br /> The auxiliary cast is by Amy Resnick (Mandy), Brian Thorstonson (Clifford), Jean Melena (Daunne), Joe Belen (Jimi the Mail Clerk), a guest role by shocking Harry Shearer, A part of the question that answers the question, 'What is he thinking when he agrees with this matter?' In any working environment, one way or another is the conditions that arise that somebody will be fodder for a comic artillery, and the pictures depicting us are always with us; Good people (see paragraph one) may also be classics in their own right. The "High Tunnel", however, is very long because its fate is lying somewhere - just in a kingdom known as 'Abdardity'. I would rate it 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
