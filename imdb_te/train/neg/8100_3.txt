Vanity's Bonfire's flap is a sweaty picture. I tried a very hard time trying hard, provocative and important, and consistently failed throughout the board. It's funny like a comic stand but can not leave the stage. Trying to make the film difficult, results in a resounding mole with every attempt to laugh a laugh. <br /> <br /> The film is disappointing. The participants are almost merciless. <br /> <br /> The film's laugh-loud state has only achieved twice. Geraldo Rivera appears once in the role of a bad, proud and innocent TV newspaper journalist - because he clearly does not realize he's playing himself, because it's fun. The judge who played Morgan Freeman's other scenery to laugh the final "big moment" of the film which offers a sacred speech about any morality ("This is what your mama taught!"). It is insulting that the momentum's papacy is absurd. <br /> <br /> This is a great effort. If a team of actors who try to make the carbon narrow satirical characters make a poor cast is good. The film is professionally made and the director Brian DePalma is not particularly evident in the little cinematic flourishes that are loving. But the image of modern morals and ethics is the narrative, which is no more than the cartoon level. Saric style is essential. Farce's power is needed. Even the sitcom needs time. But the best bonfires are disappointing. In the end, you do not have to laugh, you want to stay away.
