Many reviewers here will hold this piece of European spy horror in this regard, including many views that I respect. Personally, I do not like it. Its impossibility in the weather period between sexual and violence. Jess Franco does exactly this kind of films in his best films. Unfortunately, the notorious exploitation is the filmmaker Joe D'Amato. D'Amato's well known movies are infamous for their high-grossing-out cottage. This did not show him the initial film, his notorious "Antropophagus" and "Beyond the Darkness". In the end, an incomprehensible image that can not be performed in any way with the viewer. Without insomnia, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed the film, but I found that I was a perfect example of the most lazy work. <br /> <br /> There are a few gifts to the film. Eva Aulin (from "Candy"), and she looks pretty hot and often naked. Nonetheless, the cult film Icon Class kinski is completely ruined in the suburbs without any relation to the main picture. He seems irritated by character and does not have the manic intensity he makes at his best. Music score is good and unexpectedly funny gore has some brief moments. Still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be very boring. (3/10)
