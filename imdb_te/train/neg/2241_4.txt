I remember a few years before, but I'm coming again and again, wondering why. I think it's always nice and girls are doing very well, but men do not have sides. Why why so many English films about sex We have such frivolous men towards pretty girls? And it starts with the concept of seafaring sex in confessions movies, but by the third way (we start to enjoy the presence of the lovely Your MiLa) this movie asks us to take it seriously. Apart from that the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forceful and just frozen. In short it is not exactly foolish or intelligent as intended. Richard O'Sullivan, maybe such a central person may be helpful, but I will consider him as one of his worst performances. It is worth it for ladies.
