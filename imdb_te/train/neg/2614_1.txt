Continuation of Disney's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dolmas's (originally remake). Cruelella Devil (Glenn Close), a psychologist named Dr Pavlov (ugh!), Was released from prison after her firing "fires" with a fur. <br /> <br /> When Krullella hear the toll of Big Ben, "heal" breaks down, and she goes once again in a mad quest to make her the perfect quote for dummies hiding. A "Thanksgiving Family Sculk" originally created with the last available dime mix in the Disney marketing machine was originally launched. Close over-over-over-over-the-whites as a Glen Crew. The film is tied to her - thicker script, endless makeup, and a cake in the end - I gave her a huge amount of cash. <br /> <br /> If you are in the climax of the movie, a fur coat factory in the world, a bakery with a rabbi Goldberg assembly line and a candle light restaurant in the same building.) In fact, the real stars in the movie are considered to be dogs . They are referred to as the "Macaulay Kulkins" of the film, all the stupid "home alone" dresses in the villains are pulled. (Hitting them with logag barrettes, icing etc. etc.), ad nazom etc.) I have dogs are very good actors. <br /> <br /> Gerard D'Pardyu was completely wasted as a freaked out French furrier in the film. Two human "dog lovers" - different from previous film, but with different actors - totally boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, watching the dinner scene from the movie "The Lover and Tramp", both lovers at home, and their dogs back and forth. I said, "Oh please, do not go there!" I thought. I wished to make a sarcasm for people in the "Lady and the Tramp" Dinner Scene in Charlie Sheen "Hot Shots: Part Dukes" - his nose with "nose of spaghetti stand" <br /> <br /> Eric Isaac's enable. <br /> <br /> These dresses are nominated for an Oscar and are good. But they are the only good thing in the film. The rest of them will die unbearable.
