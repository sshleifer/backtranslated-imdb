I hoped from the movie. Well, now I know. It's really awful. Screenplay, direction and acting are equally bad. The story is crazy and stupid. The director is able to make a brilliant and thought-provoking film, but he did not. I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the film because it was so bad. Where is the picture vision? Where is the picture Instead of encouraging this, Christians should be expelled. It was frustrating and my money was ruined. Do not see this movie.
