The worst thing I've seen for a long time. Interestingly the first half is an engagement, conversations between the dubious characters in a late night bar. <br /> <br /> The film will then be transformed without visual shock (irritating reading) scenes without human or any ransom observations or lessons. <br /> <br /> I would like to go out, but the director opens this presentation and my respect for showing me disrespect. <br /> And yet, time is very priceless (when the director observed in his own experience) I really appreciate the time I wasted in this second episode. <br /> <br /> In the first part is the image of the three main characters, especially the female lead.
