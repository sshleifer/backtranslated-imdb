I was frustrated with Shakespeare's modern introductions when the director could not use his original idea or was able to make it his mind. If it uses the original words in the updated setting, which is set in the 20th or 21st century, it can work in seasonal genres, e.g. Trevor Nun Twelfth Night is very effective at the Victorian end. The song and the dance are very low and only Shakespeare's text can work on the setting of 30 if there is. Unfortunately, this is a very pleasant appearance but it ends with a pretty tiny look. <br /> Another problem is Branagh. He is old enough to play one of the students, but most importantly, he is an experienced Shakespearean actor, despite his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. In fact he acted as a king - there is no problem in the maturing student king surrounding young people. Instead of being a fun but uneasy actor for the king, hence there are no qualms that are kingless. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, unfortunately, the great Shakespearean dialogue is dramatically cut short despite songs and dance songs, dance songs, nice songs and pleasant enough dancing. So the whole thing ends with a trivial and light meditation, and I'm very frustrated, including comic twists, when it's over. <br /> <br /> Richard Bairris and Geraldine McEwan were definitely the most wonderful of the old couple.
