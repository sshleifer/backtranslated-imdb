Combat sequences are slowly motion jockey chan and intellectual attempts are curious (so far worse: "what do you think? This time I hear you come"). The stars are an unmatched pair: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he says, actually shows Charisma and screen charm - Dalf Lundren is completely free (in this movie). Note to the director Note: In the future, stay away from any love scenes, especially your main actress does not make any nudity and you have to rely heavily on the body's double. (* 1/2)
