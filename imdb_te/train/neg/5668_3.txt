First off - There's no flirting going on in this movie - Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is being used by more than 15 minutes of serious violence and sexual abuse. It's not so bad - hell, like the next critic I like violence and perversion, but it's not repulsive without a context. So you make it through torture and turbulence. Then we will meet Donna and the movie will vary in everything - not good - just different: the road without a heart. Cameo has been laughing at thanks to the comedy thanks - extensively written and widely played through broadcasts such as Judi Tenota and Mink Stoll (and some hookers and drag queens). They all deserve good. Photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you have motion sickness (or really sick) - this picture is not you. Let's not think, it is noteworthy in this movie, gay and well-known homosexuals and poorly written S & M fans have been poorly portrayed about themselves.
