It's an awful movie! For the subject, but not for delivery. I wanted to make a film about the success of the oppressed human soul at that time with my girlfriend (when it came to the film). We looked at 2 hours of brutal police repression, without any uplifting. There are no previews and announcements about this! Plus, for all those who played Hoop Goldberg, my recollection is her first 20 minutes arrested and killed! Again, the previews do not say anything about this! (Not that you expect, but it's just a problem). If I know how dull this movie, I can not see it. Or at least, I've prepared for it. This bait and switch ad campaign, and I will never see this film again!
