I have seen this film in the last 5 years. It is surprising how the actors like the two main characters agreed to work in such an unsavory samshal. Image Rape / Beating and Revenge. The couple went to the party and on the way back they hit a deer and when the bad guys came full jeep he went out to complete it. He did not go to their car and instead kicked her when she tried to drive a car that she betrayed him and was beaten and her gang raped. Then she was in her father's house and the bad guys took her to the gun and wanted to kill him ... so stupid illustration! Bello Hollywood! He must oppose that hostility but "she laugh her" so she must kill them all ... but at home once her bad guys were satisfied by pushing the top of the rifle in the anus and he went away crazy and run the bad guy. This gang ends before the participation of anyone involved in rape and the film ends because it is not a big surprise because I feel personally that the director has earned money. Valley The film is not even enjoying watching rape and can not see anything they see ... this director should be banned ... Worst Peace British cinematography I personally like and I see it. Do not do yourself to have a good look at the film in a stupid scenario
