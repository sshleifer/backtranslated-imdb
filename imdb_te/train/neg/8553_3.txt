This is really a bad movie. This theory is not rational in films following California. However, my main suspicions about the film are for some time confident and very clear boring. The entire concept of the former SAS man who joined the terrorists for a particular reason is not quite acceptable and you can not think why the most organized terrorist group (after the later clueless) will come for it. The film starts with a pretty powerful scene, but for a long time the Menders will be built up to great end. Overall, it may be an interesting 45-minute episode of the professionals who think they will succeed but the story does not have a movie. The film was a reasonably successful success in the film's opening of Collins' career, mainly for inexpensive and unrealistic soldier-Fortune or Army films in eight years. But Martin sha chose his characters more carefully because he was actually a very versatile actor and has a life that is still successful.
