I'm so sorry to say this but "Thunderbirds" does not even come with a loud pop, never mind any thunderstorm. At one stage, I was seriously thinking about getting out of the film, and I continued to wait for the film to improve. I was disappointed, but not good, if it was possible, it was worse. I went to see the movie and thought it was a "wretch". They have an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here, they have lost that opportunity altogether. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be unhappy to have the names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes, what he can say, that he is impatient and shy away from the truth. I saw this film in the previous release, and I waited to see it very much in the sixty years with original performances. I would have something to say with a simple description to say I was disappointed. The ultimate thing about the film is that the toys in the TV shows have a little more wood than the actors in the movie.
