Robert Carmichael's Great Exciting is a bad image in every way. The script, the daunting pace, the lack of depth in any role, the nonsense sub-plot, the terrible acting, the unwelcome climax all the worst picture I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I imagined that the filmmakers would be intelligent and gloomy with their emotional light, a long silent and chanting traditional soundtrack. If so, they totally failed. It bored me and I wish I never seen it. <br /> Avoid all costs.
