I usually try professional and constructive when criticizing movies, but my God! It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, everything bad! <br /> <br /> Whenever the group arrives, all the empty dancing floor and bloody clothes they found. Determined to know what happened to the rest of the birds, the crooked group went up a mission through a race-killing forest. During this crusade, they happen to have a proper number of weapons to give each child just a police chick and marine captain. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. The collection of action sequences, usually the rest of the film, is in a very long shootout outside the "dead house". This fight is full of Hollywood violence, recurring clips from the HOTD video game and the sloppy merex-esque camera rotations. One of the character's volunteers to sacrifice himself to save others. Why? He was not noble and courageous, but part of his face was damaged by acid because he had been killing him for a long time after killing the creature after he stopped! I think sorry for this person? <br /> <br /> If you want to see how terrible it is, you do not see the movie. I was more than dead on zombies at the theater screen, and I'm sure the money I could easily see with this part of sh * t easy to see. GRADE: F
