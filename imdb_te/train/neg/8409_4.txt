Eddie Murphy as Best Supporting Actor ??? Alan Arkin and Jimon Hounsouau are no insults. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox (who can work) walks through this movie like a zombie. <br /> Beyonce? Will it be acting ??? <br /> <br /> This image resembles CHICAGO or any other recent musical armor. <br /> If this was not for Jennifer Hudson's great singing and performance, I gave it a zero. Typical Broadway vs. Hollywood Rap.
