The creativity of the film lost at the beginning when writers and directors left the good story, altering the terrible special effects substitute. The film was focused on amusing children, but it did not. Many small budget films can have great movies, but this film is not anywhere. Fortunately this will be another image made easy, and easily forgotten. The film is likely to earn some money on actors until the film is likely to be a real role in a good film. Anyone who is respectful of movies, this film should not be seen at all costs.
