I should not review this movie because it's not really a horror film - Dr. Cheese is not worth the attention. At least, this is not a horror in the general sense. It's definitely a horror proposal to waste your time watching this rubbish. That is why I stopped it after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, and when the clock shows that the clock is about 45 minutes. Yep, that's right; This image is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of errors in "The Order". In particular, the main problem with the "religious" subgent of horror films is that it does not want to engage Christianity in Hollywood's own way. Traditionally, it is also possible to make serious movies. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without tradition, these images are merely a smorgasbord that only filmmakers (usually dull and real) imagined. <br /> Think about it. If someone makes a film about physics, if the basic laws of physics are not correct and the whole plot is removed on the basis of its faulty pictures, you will soon disgust the nonsense plot. In other words, "The Order" (and earlier many such films) about the Catholic Church and build a plot from these innovations in Christian faith and endeavor. Surprisingly, the plot ends incomplete and stupid. It is interesting to see this film growing on your toen. <br /> Avoid this steam pile.
