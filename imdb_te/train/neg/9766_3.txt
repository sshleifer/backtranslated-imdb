Roger Carman is not one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He has provided some of my favorite horror movies, as well as some unsustainable cheap and frivolous worst shortcuts ("Living Ghosts from the Sea" and "The Gods of the Shear Reef"), such as Edgar Allen Poe's introductions "Red Death Mask" and "Pitt and the Pendulum". Corman also just unclassified and made some movies? Just enough? It is almost impossible to judge properly. For example, "The Trip" is labeled somewhat as a psychedelic exploit entitled "Gas-s -s-s". In other words, they are very strange hippie-culture influenced films. Half the time you do not have a slight idea that these characters are back and back and the whole thing is where the hell is. The plot is simply and more efficient: a strange, deadly nerve gas accidentally moves and destroys the entire world population at the age of 25. This * is an atmosphere of sand, a post apocalyptic size-free landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" road-image comedy. None of the characters are trying to prevent their inevitable coming deaths; They just walk to the streets in the streets and find fewer juvenile crime groups. "Gas-s-s-s" is a disappointing boring and tries to overly hard. The whole script is sophisticated on the spot and not at all funny. Definitely tea is not my cup, but the film is a loyal fan base and has so many fans, so who can say that I'm not worth your time or money?
