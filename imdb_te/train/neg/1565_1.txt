The film uses a cutting edge title for the slum story. Kill Kill, nice ones. The viewer pictures the scenes that take the ban to move back in their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and unstable. The film is a new screen writer. Image evidence and network money just waste. While my film is not worth 10 lines, this film has to write 10 lines of criticism, but I try to let people do it without understanding. If people count on you to choose a good movie for the movie night, pick a different one. If you have a soul, you are responsible for this leper.
