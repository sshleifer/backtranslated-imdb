I did not see the movie in very short time. Fast forward function in DVD unit is the only salvation. It's like seeing a poor production CBC movie. Lighting, filming, sets, location, script writers, editors, actors ... There is nothing clear for money. I need to write ten lines of comment ... bad, awful, terrible, wretched, anguished, hard, intimate, bleak, turbulent, cannibalism, frustrating, weak, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelly, wiley, trash, all-pain -Down, and I do not know if I can continue going full of all ten lines of worst-o-matic product this piece!
