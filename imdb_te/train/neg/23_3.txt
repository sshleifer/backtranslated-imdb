I rent this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I've seen Michael Madson was suspicious of appearing in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check. <br /> <br /> "Well, if your script and dialogues are awful, good actors can not save the day. The film did not tell the enthusiastic actors that flooded the film. Native-English-speakers, many local-English speakers, have been thrown out of a script and read lines from the script that are not featured in the movie. It's unbelievable that all the lines in the cinematic sound are unbelievable. The music is awful and totally inaccurate, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play. /> <br /> I recommend you appreciate other Better movies just as you watch. I've given 1 instead of 3 instead of 3.
