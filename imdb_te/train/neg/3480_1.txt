This film is terrible. Terrible. One of the worst movies ever. I can not imagine that Gigli is worse. The previews say "NO", but we're looking for something between the present and worry, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> He can look good with a movie and explosions, but also Bruce Willis came in "Die Hard". It would be humorous if he removed his shirt and the bad guys were fighting. <br /> <br /> The best part is Catherine O'Hara - she's always cool. <br /> <br /> When every scene is mentioned by Hughes and others - there is no motivation for their actions. <br /> Get rid of this movie with all the expenses.
