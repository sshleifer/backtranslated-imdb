At first, there were some good things about this film, but it was all clic slasher stuff combined with a teen image. In the film's statement, I saw, focused on Denis Richards, but she is a poor actress, and it's not good for people to try to make her up with that). And with that look she gives it to everybody? Perhaps it's a part of the character, but as I mentioned, acting ... Still, the writing is good. You know who everywhere throughout the movie, and you can approximate what happened, but not an annoyance. I think it's probably good, judging by the plot line which book is based on, but next time I think I'll read the book to find out more than watch this.
