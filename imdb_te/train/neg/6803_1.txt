When I come on IMDb boards, I'm always bored when I see the "worst picture" post. After seeing the movie, I'm going to create my own post soon! <br /> Started Titles: Great, Gas Oven A Kind of Gas Oven (Sometimes, I sometimes, "sometimes" stress) but Steven Seagal as police he plays plays ... words are beyond. The rest of the actors ... I do not know where those actors are renting but Geez !! Was not my dog ​​better than the actor? <br /> <br /> This is the story: the action sequence: The first shot of the film is the explosion. I said it well, nice! <br /> <br /> Dialogues are fun, music is pure garbage, ultimate happiness. <br /> <br /> I'm going to have my cousin looking for cinema (I'm 22, she 42 ... well) on the edge taken by the film and it burns. Next time I'm going to see ... (who ever says ???)
