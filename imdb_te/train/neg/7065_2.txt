OK Well my films found this movie in my dads old pile and looked pretty good from cover but the movie actually sucks !! The first story of swimmer was pretty good, but it took some time to get it, then a guy with the boy was completely gone! It's not even horrific! His dream baby is like a sleeping story. Then the newspapers completely stalled one. I told someone else to call a news guy and tell me to go out with you. But she was cut off by the cold and she was in the hospital and she saw him in her t.v and said she was junk. There is a pretty homosexual story about the person who brought the dead back .. I can not say anything about it. The last one is the best. It's not that horrible but the idea of ​​the story is great .. Yeah what girl will have and she will kill all her colleagues or something. Then when they finish their dreams to each other, the losers get the bus (Hell Ahahaha) and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus (h). End.
