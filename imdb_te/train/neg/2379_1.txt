I agree. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and she has made every film (unfortunately Batman and Robin, the Avengers) and made a mission to watch this one. This is the worst film rank I have ever seen. (Yes that is smaller than Avengers). Everyone loses it and is beyond belief. <br /> <br /> If you think Uma is a goddess, please do not do this for the film. The next morning you hates you.
