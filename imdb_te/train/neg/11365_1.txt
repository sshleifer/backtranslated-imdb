This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing has happened in this movie. The script is bad !!! I am copying and pasting the first pages 15 pages 90 pages. Let's see the producers make Hollywood films here in Belgium. They did not succeed. And in the third week now, Antwerp and Brussels will have only 22h45 or something. In the past there were good films like Dance in Belgian. Shades waste your time. You can read it in the theater after seeing a real movie. If you see 10 minutes shades, you can see it. It was promoted to death on local radio and TV. I hope it will soon disappear in shades.
