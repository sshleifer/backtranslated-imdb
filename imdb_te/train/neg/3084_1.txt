This is the result. A bad image that does not qualify to classify as a film is that it contains only a portion of the movie reel, no sense. Well back actors, since they seem to be just a bunch of friends who wanted to get a small amount of money together and try to make a movie that was a great horror movie. Well this is a great horror anyway, never being a film. In the "Haggablins" there is plenty of horror acting, but worse, Richard is the main man, and he is also firmly weak and firmly convinced. Well, when you try to make friends and cast a horror film, it's less than the shoastring budget. Oh well at least MST3K version is hilarious. But it still sounds confusing, it deserves all Bashing. 9 for MST version.
