Maya is a woman who has no interests. She just dreams of her life and wonders, why she did not feel fulfilled. This could be interesting. Good story, good setting and good dialogue are required. None of these. This film is totally boring. There are only lengths and climax. Only one climax is Shahrukh Khan. Although I'm his favorite fan, I can not stand this film. He can not leave this movie. The film is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you're an art-house fan or slow, you might like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. My recommendation: do not look at it.
