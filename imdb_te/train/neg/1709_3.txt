The copy of the film was one of the alternate names with the 1964 film 'Zombie Blood Bath'. Perversely, the film actually has a better rating on this site than the title above; It may mean that the other is really bad! The film is very beautiful; Apparently you do not have to go into a movie called 'Zombie Blood Bath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and do not live up to the title with the gore sum of it to the fair ... but it feels very old and tired, it does not help through the act of vicious acting and stupid platform. This is your first nuclear strike, teams and so on. The film is cracked by people's smiling eyes and pretty much you know what you are doing; Low quality zombie trash. There's plenty of gore in the film, and the film was really boring if it was not a real good job. The zombie bloodbath is very cheap, and apparently put together inexperienced filmmakers! The main impact seemed to be Romero's high day of the Dead, which could only be about anything with zombies and gore. It's a generally predictable and pointless end and overall I can not say I'm impressed with all the pots down!
