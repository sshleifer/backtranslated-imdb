Some time ago, I saw Sleith (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Oliver. Michael Caine returned, but now he is husband and judd lawyer his wife. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed watching the movie in this film. One of the reasons I do not like this remake of the classic. When a movie is received, I must watch the movie and not just play. Director Kenneth Brannigan did the last few amazing films, but this time he missed. Another reason is the look of this image. The design is modern, beautiful, clean, uncomfortable and cool. I never felt the feeling of someone living at home. Photography is not bad, but the lightning is awful. <br /> <br /> Sometimes blue light, dark, green light, it is not friendly to the eyes. <br /> Acting is very good. Michael Caine and Jude Law are their best performances. I really want to see these 2 guys play together on stage. But I never accepted Jude Law Fan. The middle part of the weaker part. I remember that this part of the original is still very mysterious and simply excellent direction. I tried to see it twice and was always sleeping in the middle. The end piece is good and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not awful, but it's a movie for critics than audiences. Sloth (1972) is still entertaining and more fun than Sleet (2007).
