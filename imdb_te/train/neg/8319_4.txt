Very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> If you see any of the movies in the past ten years, and some interesting episodes (which make use of the clues to make a decision), and the 'twists' are pretty predictable, they are pretty predictable <br /> <span> /> This acting is good enough. The story is not very interesting. The whole 'still wake up' mantle will be canceled by astral projection stuff (not funny). <br /> <br /> The surgical scene was initially confusing, causing some discomfort but then totally uncommon. <br /> It's not terrible, but it's not memorable. Terrence Howard's most interesting character until today, as I have seen so far. <br /> Total amount of boring.
