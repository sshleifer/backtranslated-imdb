I like bad movies. I want to rent bad movies with my friends and rip them for their duration. Then there are such bizarre movies. Redline is not just a bad movie, but it is a sign that the American film industry might have been for at least the proof script scripts for a viewer before funding a movie. <br /> <br /> A stereotype trash is the spawn from this movie. The storyline is unbearable, and the acting around is ridiculous. Nadia Buzarin and Eddie Griffin are probably the worst screen chemistry I have ever seen, and they personally have to be separated from human merchants and they lose legally in the orange bag until street vendors change their career. Furthermore, Angus MacDaddy convinced me to do this film and how far I've never thought about an analogy is beyond me. <br /> I'm loyal to him, but this questioned me. Many people would like to take revenge for different reasons (and if you have enough attention to know what they are, you're bigger than me), it's very violent (I guess). The film is like ooroboros, its own tail swallowing snake, which has a lot of chaos and dialogues not suited for human ears. <br /> <br /> The film is a vague action film for commercial and the rest for a first half, it must avoid anything and all costs. <br /> It's a positive factor. <br /> <br /> I'll eventually make the credits roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Boozarlin If you play the two songs in the film, you will be a hack, and I hope that aging will ruin you. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this movie for the funniest experience, listen to the lyrics for Nadia Bj√∂rlinn's songs.
