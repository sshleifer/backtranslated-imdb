The DVD came from the library to get a good idea of ​​how I was going in the background of a major opera product. I said, I was disappointed. This thing is very powerful. The sets in a Wagnerian product must be broader and more intuitive, and the story behind their creation and use may be an excellent learning experience. Instead, we get together a commentary that failed to have my attention blurred, to get a hodgepodge of people's clips moving around the larger items of the scene. Background music from operas I found mainly listening to. I am very impressed with the effort needed to produce such a product - I'm sure this video is obviously in the opera, but I can recall this video - but with little explanation and lack of detailed commentary and explanations.
