The story is about the life of ordinary people from Antwerp, spending their lives. I said, in fact there is nothing to tell about the story. The film is like MTV-Flick, well done, and the director is a talented man and we want to make more movies. So let's forget about this and hope for the next Deus-Berman picture the best.
