I spend a lot of time in this review as the writers did in the script. <br /> <br /> They killed Nevine Johnson. Only Mark Blankfield's performance is God-AWFUL, so everyone has elses !! Physical comedy is forced, flat and predictable. Script pin names seemed to have written monogloyd monkeys using Ziggy Steynberg and Rocco Urbiisk. The producers were able to distance themselves from such a disastrous film. They also made the veteran actor Ray Wawstone look like a skill low-buffoon. <br /> <br /> I would like 96 minutes in my life to spend this memorable memory of a wonderful comedy that I can try and punish every one of those in this film.
