Leap Years have some huge hitters in local and regional film and television scene. And yet, they can not save this image. It's going to be a lot of things - acting, overly dramatic, poor script, in unsteady direction; Good music, good cinematography. This movie is about to watch all the local movies in a basket and to say that all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest of the film based on this film. This is a television soap opera that pretends to be a romantic movie. When I bought my ticket, my hopes were too high and my hopes were taken into a five-minute film.
