The bad idea is to start with Scary Movie 3 (2003). The last picture is a simple attempt. Keep this load next to the comedy classic. When some date is filled with humor and short shots, at least it's funny. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, revenge and sight clothing are naturally thought to be funny. It was nice to kill the viewer on the head with tired jokes. The humor in the movie will provide you with some laughing kids. When they trained the junior high school audience, the self-respecting feelings threw the window out. Ring Paris is not funny. In 1998, I saw them in comedy films. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool. <br /> <br /> American cinema death is slow. These pictures are nails that are part of its coffin. What happened to true humor? I have not laughed out loud in a movie theater in a very long time. Very bad movies write the brain. Do you need proof? Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's in the shelves. This image is bad. Hype does not believe. <br /> <br /> I will watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop rather than bothered by this comedy. <br /> Definitely (if not recommended if the brain contains cells).
