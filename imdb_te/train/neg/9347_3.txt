This film guarantees something of value worth hanging from the momentous moment from the moment of self-memorizing moment. But it is not. It's flat, self-conscious, predictable and tedious. <br /> <br /> Set images and backdrops do not make a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of pitiful socialist fake drama documentary ("It's True True") is not only a fun but failing one, it does not work as a social history. Clich√©s will be combined with bad acting, the film is very difficult to complete, the entertainment factor wears very quickly. The characters never develop to a dimensional, the extent that it feels for them. Director Ego is the biggest character in the film.
