I really like this movie. It deals with the most important problem in any society: sexual addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story we will learn that when you get used to sex you can lose everything. In this case, our main character and hero, all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, nerves) are continuing his marriage, job, and his life for sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are terrible; Mainly acting. Oh, you can not enjoy any sex scenes, most of them happen in a very poor taste and you're sure you're looking at a picture of a house. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is simply non-concept. How can such a smart and gracious wife survive all the evil things from her husband? How can she trust him? <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with black cinema theater assistant just means and you "wtf?" I think. <br /> You will see similar scenes. <br /> Avoid this picture. Please avoid it; It's not a soft core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Kinsky's legs in the show are only worth watch. I caught it on the HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money. But 90 minutes my life does not come back.
