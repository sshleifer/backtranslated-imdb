I believe, I love horror films. Like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And, I like low budget, B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I also like bad acting, floating scripts, wood lines, unrest conditions and much more. However, I do not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> It does not work at most levels. For all reasons listed in the past and more. The woman has the involuntary, blatant use of genital images. <br /> <br /> Most likely, there are many references to male genitalia. Against an attempt to do something really different. <br /> I do not intend to take any years to film, but can not continue with the level of compound demanded by modern audiences. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is the main character. However, unfortunately, with the intention of this, as we see things that are open on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can express is that the last film is gorgeous. If it was initially used, it would eventually allow the film to end in 2001. <br /> They did not try it badly. It is not even important what this film is about. Is this not a plot? Sure, it is not. Is not it the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I can live without knowing about Ed 15. Is not this a dialogue? No doubt, no. Music? Perhaps, but the more unlarnished ego of the Principals needed to be stacked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
