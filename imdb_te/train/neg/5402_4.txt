This film is so unbelievable; - The whole premise is glue; The fact that a serial killer (bloodthirsty or otherwise) can kill the film without recognizing the movie is a mockery of the fact that many people can kill as the film suggests. The bloodthirsty could not see him in the film Bela Lugosi. Acting Most actors should be treated for dry rats. I look forward to the day from someone who is exempt from a Steven King novel (exclusion, perhaps, stand by me). The film has done many Stephen King films - "exclusive" effects, poor actors, scary characters and lack of money to use the dialogue. The film is inexpensive, inefficient and failing in everything it tries to do.
