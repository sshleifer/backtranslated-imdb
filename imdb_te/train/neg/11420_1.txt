There is no significance in life after the arrival of St. Elmo's Fire University (however for us in common folk). Why did this worst? Who really is involved with this? Who are these characters? Actually sorry to have actors to deal with such a terrible script. Some of the talented young actors have done a good job in this movie. <br /> <br /> I really found this movie to be insulting to my intelligence. The only pleasure from this is that Sir John Hughes has a good ol 'laugh. That same year he released his best work on The Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy 80 movies, I see the same mistake. This is really dangerous for the genre.
