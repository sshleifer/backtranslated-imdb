There are some spoilers in this review. <br /> When you think that they have not done so badly, Rey Dan Chang is an American American witchcraft by Space Wickson and Willy Nelson! <br /> <br /> You understand that the cast is a good movie that is viewed only by "starlight," only for laughing. <br /> <br /> Chong is an alien sent to the ground, half-tribe, part man and episode alien. Apparently, the land is in deer straits. Mankind's genetics is something wrong, and in some decades the world can be converted into a polluted wasteland. Demon can only save the alien race planet by duplicating the DNA of half the race. I do not want to tell you how this movie will give me the impression that human beings will be destroyed by pollution. You think you can save the land from the polluted creatures and save them, not save them! However, a half-tribe Billy Wirth, who lives in a small southwestern town, is a native of his mother line, despite the fact that his mother's red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather Willie Nelson. Which bombardment of the melakari bomb bombed Carmen Electra bombed the "selected one" as a toilet? Vorte was almost drowned after driving his motorcycle in a reckless lake resulting in breaking up with his friend. Before you fully understand the word Hagvash, Chang reveals his mystery to Wert, who does not surprise him for a moment, and spreads to the Whackfreet family. Chang also makes Pals with Wirth's mother, who seems to have lost some of her marriages over the years. Well, because it is an alien who left her with Wirth's father. In fact, he was a standard rogue alien, who chose this moment to land for that break, so he could use Wint's DNA to make his slave land. (Huh?) His funniest attempts to utilize his telepathic forces and to wipe the screen a lot of screen time are the worst scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> These ideas can be good on paper, but they are treated with stupidity here, especially stupid. The above scenes with rogue alien. But the effects of this film are good. In the opening sequence Chong participates in his spacecraft, with her superiors, a guy we have not seen, but can be communicated by a vampire that lets the chong pink light. They do not use spoken words but the telepathy, so we treat the subtitles. Both Both Chong and her superiest subtitles appear to be the same, and the director can not talk to you at any time, in any conversation, which makes the whole conversation untrue. The Ed Wood film from Hollywood has a tremendous effect to get out of the film. Now, when I deal with a low budget picture, I will express the effects, but these effects have really come to me. The most dangerous is the most common: fake night sky. The stars in the sky make a sound tone almost noisy. Especially moments that Chong gives her to a guy from Pleiades, and we get a seven star shot. Thing, the seven stars in this picture take half a night sky, but no stargarager Piode's galaxy star is a star cluster between stars and Taurus, and the cluster does not take much room in the sky at all. These effects get very lousy so your jaw is hanging low and low with every passing moment. Be careful, because effects Willie Nelson is moving into a human spotlight and in the final part goes to the floor by the right. . . <br /> Starlight, star bright; The last star I see tonight; I want to, I wish. This trace can not be viewed right now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
