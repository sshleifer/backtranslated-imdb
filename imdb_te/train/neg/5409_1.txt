The Christmas Secret was promoted as a fantastic film, but I was disappointed. The VHS and DVD copies of this film have also been sold, and I think the producers are truly proud of this project. Most of the performances I played as an actor were telephoned, but Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. I do not have my resume in my film if Richard Thomas. It's a trouble. <br /> <br /> I hope that it will not be considered a critique of hate critiques and negative expectations about my qualifications as a critique. I made a good film because I'm ready to enjoy the movie. Anyway, I will challenge anyone to see this movie and T.V.
