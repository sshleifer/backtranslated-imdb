When closing the original intelligence, this cheap remake is designed to shock conversations. Instead of intricate plot-twists, the sudden and unmanaged random story changes known as this thriller are only used to lessen their bizarre development. <br /> <br /> The replacement of the original Masala dialogue is bad for everything, the saltchecker who completes unwanted four-letter words. It is perfectly clean, but uninteresting taste. <br /> The promise - is unfulfilled promise. Exciting by Michael Cain pulled from Keller-to-Sullivan Graduation, such as Patty Duke. Unfortunately, this clever and respected actor first hit his reputation by accepting this deadly replicated nonsense role and later reversed his performance just as compared to Judy La's amateur overtaking. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the classic originality, ignore its dated visuals and gimmicks. Enjoy it, look, and enjoy just a story and a half. For remake, pass this insult to the original.
