This adaptation is a classic, affectionate for its sensitivity. Timothy Dalton found no idea of ​​the different short things of Rochester's character. I get the feeling he never read the book, sauntered in his very tight breeches and "grumpy, broody, murky past." Rochester did not play the role of a person or a real person but at the very top of the day he was never crushed on a smile banner, he transformed into a pancis with great inspiration when he was engaged. There is no chemistry. I am very happy with this adaptation, which is truly a sympathetic and sympathetic to Charlotte Brontë who is in her grave. Go and book a ride. Rochester is a personality. And by the way: A "love" Love Sean you do not have to eat her face.
