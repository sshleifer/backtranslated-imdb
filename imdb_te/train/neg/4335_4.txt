The film and acting is not bad and Jay Hernandez Calito Brigante does a good job playing but forgets the movie is a prequel to hit the movie. These prequel makers clearly can not see the way of the original Carlito or at least keep in mind about continuity. The movie is a prequel, the original image already has some history and the movie will start or at least lead to it. The original old friends of Carlito's old friends did not see anyone in the film, they did not even mention. Louis Guzman, in the original film, is in the film but he plays a completely different role. The original was held in 1975 and the prequel took place in 1969-70. If you see this film more than 5 years ago, will one of the many friends of Carlito appear? In reality, Carlito was released from prison after spending 5 years in jail. It's only a few months before the end of the prequel and the original start! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the very beginning, Carlito spent 5 years prequel that ended this insight into the ultimate fanbase intelligence which gives us this Hollywood happiness. What is happening to gail? The film is not a continuation of directing the film's release.
