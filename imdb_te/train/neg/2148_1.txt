Maybe spoilers, perhaps. I say "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst films ever made. First of all, the film was created at the height of Disney's sequel busting. It is "The Little Mermaid II," "The Jungle Book II", and "Peter Pan II", reflecting their original motion picture classics at the same time. (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I dropped out of that because their original films were not really classic in the first place.) I was interested in good Disney films, and I was the original Disney "Cinderella" I worshiped. Cinderella's role is a bit wasted during the continuation of the "Cinderella". The character Cinderella is not very original and I grew up. The real Cinderella is kind and loving. The new Cinderella has a very long role with current wind vocabulary, "I'm going to do this dinner! " You're the new Cinderella (I'm affectionately called her), "Ewww!" It is anti Cinderella I try to find the best among the people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the steps is good! Heck? Why? They are just as terrible family members for the poor little anastasia all out like Lady Tremaine and Drizella SIA. My question to the world: Did you see the original "Cinderella" in Disney when doing this sequel? Well, it certainly does not look. Correctly I remember, Anastasia Cinderella's misfortune like Durzella and Lady Trimine. I have everything for redemption and forgiveness, but there is no ransom for Anastasia in this film. First, Anastasia is bad. Secondly, she's fine. Earlier this story could not be omitted. Disney learns that I will insult Walt Disney's name in this film. Perhaps now Michael Hinner has gone, things start to shape around the mouse house.
