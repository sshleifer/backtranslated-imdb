Brokedown Palace is not the kind of film I would ever like to see. I did not like when some Ausie man was involved in drug trafficking in Thailand and blamed Claire Danes and drug trafficking Cate Beckinsale. After watching this movie, I'm going to the country. Actually the film sticks. I want to go to Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I can not tolerate. I would rather stick to the United States. I saw some pictures in the theater, including the false accusation of drug trafficking, I left the theater and I could not tolerate the film because I paid my money back. If you're going to Thailand to meet someone who might be a drug smuggler, forget this!
