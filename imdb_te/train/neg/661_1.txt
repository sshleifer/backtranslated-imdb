Okay. I came back. Before starting my review, tell me one thing: I like this movie. I knew I was negative in the past, but I was surprised and actually liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Every horror clich is not predictable. And they are just a jump scare (walking into baseball bats left on the floor? Is not every little thing you just thing? It's not just scary. <br /> I am very much surprised that I have more blood than I thought. <br /> <br /> Film Donna Lisa's Mother House at her. She comes upstairs. Camera pans of his father's dead on bed. Awful. The above mentioned baseball bat scene takes place. Clearly finds his brother who is dead and her brother (how can she tell? There is no blood on him). As the killer comes, Donna hides under the bed, mom dies. She runs outside to throw for help. The killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to treatment sessions. Many of these are confusing - everyone asked whether her family actually died or she imagined- and when she was returning nightmares. Filler dialog was heard. <br /> Some scenes in the <br saloon, they go to the hotel. But the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but did not provide police / family information as long as he was there). <br /> I'm not going to tell you what happened in the movie, because I do not want to spoil too much. If you want to know who will die, Horror_Fan posted about it. But on the subjects of death: they are not that exciting. People in the theater actually laughed at them many times (even an experience I had never had before a horror film, even in a Stranger calls). Especially one: I'm very excited to see 'Busy Boy' face bus boy guy. The only death involving any blood is Lisa's, and it is rarely. Her voice was cut and blood (if you could call it - it was practically black) on the subject-matter spliters. When we see her body only the other blood is Claire. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after she had choked her to death. Oh, ok? This movie is one of the most clicks I've ever seen. Let's see here ... intimate-mirror-screens-boom! Scene. Check. Twice, in fact (they can say that they are struggling). Surely a killer-up-killer is mandatory. Check. Backing-up-into-the-lamp is also on the scene, but you've all seen it. Oh, do you like the birds that fly away? Well, you got it! (Yes, they were able to include one of those here). And, of course, we have-all-departure-but-he-still-escaped scene-have. Should i go <br /> <br /> Do not be stupid to anyone who claims the characters? "Oh, despite the huge alarm ringing, let's literally build the building, and my friends are not 3, I'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap." These characters are some of the most erroneous and stupid characters. The only preferred character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moments in the film. "Oh, mental-teacher I'm here! I must leave my cousin to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is slow? Into the construction site!" Hogg. By the end of the film, they all deserve to die. The only death was anyone Donna's boyfriend (I can not even remember his name), and by that time all the spectators were completely emptied from this frightening, sharp image. <br /> There are some positives - acting is pretty good, and it is well documented. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction is bad, let me laugh (I believe, some of the spectators ) And Brittany Snow, but it's bad, people are so confused after the end of the movie, and then some are negative.
