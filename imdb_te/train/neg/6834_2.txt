Gee, no heck of an image! ... I wanted to switch from all decades to a specialist in bad films, so I decided to start it. This is pretty good choice. I enter this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces, but I did not see anything in this pastel colored mess. I have not really watched many bad movies before, but I've got to feel that this is probably "good so bad", because so unexpectedly damn funny! First of all, there are bugs. Plots are related bugs, physical bugs, and mental errors. Especially in the next von dalmée's blue spandex, it is insane like donkey cheeks. There are a lot of frivolous lines and I can not even begin to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. Except for a specific case, there is not exactly bad acting from all those involved in the film's mess. Jaffrey Lewis is fully repentant as Frank, a completely stupid character. And, telling the truth, I was very surprised to see that Van Dummé made a good job playing twins. He convinced me to succeed in achieving a different voice and mood in both roles. But the film is a bad and sad part that has produced a big movie studio ... It is now bankrupt.
