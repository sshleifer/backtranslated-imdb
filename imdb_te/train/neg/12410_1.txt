This movie is terrible. Acting is even worse! This is no worse than student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor is an old woman. The first is the old film, as I think in me. Then I remembered that I had no need! <br /> <br /> I saw big movies with good acting. <br /> The music is horrible. It's really choppy. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not eligible for 1. I saw because I was frustrated, and this film was much less entertaining for me. It's just ridiculous. My dead grandmother's left pink toe can do better than this.
