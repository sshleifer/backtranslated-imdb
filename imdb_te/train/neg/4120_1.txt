Definitely terrible film. Amateur and it's not funny. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Ali is very painful. The edits made by It's Tits and Star Wars are plain stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Gokhal is good about the film. He should go to his English talent and Hollywood. Hollywood has not found an actor with its features. <br /> <br /> Director is mine Mujeed comic author, the film is the worst written work of the day. </ P> <p> Plus these waste of money. There are also some actor Sumer Tilmac. The actor who has three sons has no talent.
