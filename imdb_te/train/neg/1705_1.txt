A horrible enthusiastic film director (no, not tad sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. Friend and sister come and be rescued. Meanwhile defending their 'turf' by a gang of horrible actors. What a heck means. This film and I use the word too loose it is very bad .. it's bad too bad. Humor is painful unfunny, "action" just sad. Now I see some terrible horror films in my time and I'm tired of my attitude to looking at low-budget films, and I've been sitting by this openly to anyone. Only for you is the hardest masochists. <br /> My grade: F
