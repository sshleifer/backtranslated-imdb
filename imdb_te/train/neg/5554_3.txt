Darkman 3: Dye Dark Man directed by Bradford May, the same person who made the first Darkman sequel. Darkman 3 is worse than Dark Man 2, and is not unique with my opinion. Larry Drake is currently the main villain, now starring with great Jeff Phahee, whose role is to once again attempt to create Darkman's work and create some ultra stronger humans to get the city's entire city leadership. The film is very hard on Darkman 2, and Darkman 2 has been a lot of emotional scenes. These sequels were made in a short time and with little money, so make these kinds of decisions. The couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exit, but still this pretty tired image and often irritatingly stupid, too. The letters are scream and very laugh and very annoying. There is no philosophical depth in the film, and it's like a remake of Darkman 2 which is not even equal. Darkman 2 has great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drake's great villain is capable of playing. Dark Man 3 offers some nice scenes and moments, but this movie is very tired and full of clich√©s. Some positive things in this picture are flashback edits (Nightmares of Westlake) and really surprising plot turns and tricks. And worth mentioning is the pretty villain's pretty nasty death scene, which is also pretty comic book and inventive without any gore. The episode is even more interesting than the death of two main villains. <br /> <br /> Darkman 3 is the worst in the whole series, remember that the two sequels were made directly to the video and did not even come with Raimi's original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 is with great scenes and suspense, but this is the tired and boring of the last (?) Entry sequel. It has some merits as mentioned, but the whole concept should not be in the first place. A talented director in May, hopefully can get some important events in the future. <br /> <br />
