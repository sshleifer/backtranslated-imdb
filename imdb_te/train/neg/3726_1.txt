I was forced to watch this whole series of little boy movies and I was told they were REAL! Discuss child abuse. I was afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. They would like to laugh at those ridiculous believers and laugh at their children. In addition to the obvious aspects associated with brain use and teachings, there are also bad acting, bad writing and bad "special effects". They are just terrible, horrible movies. Yes, believing (and horrifying) as a kid, but I can not imagine buying up this grown up into hypocrisy. However, I must say, as an adult, I am interested in seeing them today. They have a midnight / midnight movie.
