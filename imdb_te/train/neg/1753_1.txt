Dietrich Bonoffer's writings have had a great impact on my life and I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing and watching this film. Words can not express my disappointment. This movie was confusing ... It's no background for his life, nothing about the historical context and his great work (except for the smallest, a colleague referring to "The Depression Cost") instead, we enjoyed jazz (apparently In the States) and his friends cool before deciding to go back to Germany Tundi. To clearly show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic episode. He is a part of his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we get a very bad love with a 17-year-old school. Whether it actually happened or not, it's not a big part of the movie. Now ... looking forward to the dramatic episode, or some commentary describes all of his writings ... or something to tell us about the greatness of this person. Drum-roll ..... wait ..... ..... wait wait. This is the kind of movie that gives bad reputation for "Christian Films". All they have to do is set up a film for the film, in some background ... even some voice-overs, or he's been talking to his writings .... But ... that's what we got. Fits the original for a hero of Faith.
