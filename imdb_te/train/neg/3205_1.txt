From the comments that many of those who talk about the MST3K broadcasting are based on their comments. It has a tremendous exposure, but I share some ideas and comments that I do not cut out because of its misfortune of looking at the "ultimate justice" in its original form <br /> <br /> First, the original copy must be accepted as a more coherent version of MST3K, An Expositor scene mainly between Rossano Brajze and Vanantino Ventini (It was not a very good plot point, but at least the filmmakers attempted to cover it.) This scenario was just cut for a time, or it was just a time to replace the names instead of actors, but the fugitive character of Vennetti could not immediately leave Malta. I do not provide too much fodder for riffs, for me <br /> <br /> There is no original storyline: Ventinino's betrayal of the stripper Jon Donn Baker has not been seen in the MST3K version, and Vanessi describes a very unpleasant scene before her beating the victim. Although she gave her a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... icky. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Joe Done asks an allied police officer with him because" they look uniform, they do not cooperate. " , Joe Don dressed in his fraudulent cowboy-slash-sheriff dress, finished with a shiny badge! /> <br /> A final scrutiny on the original, uncorrupted version of "Final Justice": Why do you think they need to be naked butt of the ending on the screen?
