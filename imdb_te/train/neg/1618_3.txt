I have gone to see the positive expectations of this film. I saw Jacquet's previous movie (penguins march) and listened to a very positive review on the radio. However, I was deeply disappointed. More than anything, this film is terribly boring. Literally nothing happened. I tried to explain the pictures of the film, and we ended laughing because the winter comes because "winter is coming", and then an eagle after spring, and a river, and once it's dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and once again the fox has children And so on. "About half an hour later, I was rolling my eyes, Rev. At the end of the station, I started to expect that it would be short, but it went on and on to the end.I was so deeply in my chair that I saw some similarity to Stephen Hawking, the most annoying parts of the film (a) girl, She's in the whole movie (single year) Wearing clothes, and certainly shows two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness She is beautiful, what a question about it, however, a film about this natural beauty made her better than most human beings.I am eating a bear and drowning in the river, I find it horribly that she can handle me constantly. (B) Girl's adult voice commentary tells us nothing but the lowest, obvious, boring, unnecessary things. (C) Music that is not desperately free. When the girl happily jumping around, even jumps around the music. When the fox threatens an eagle, music becomes more intimidating. It reminded me of the very early days of film production, and it is very imaginative to enjoy. However, most of the kids who watch me have absolutely liked it, at least they are involved. In this way, my warning is only adults: if you are ten years old, avoid this film. You can get better (and cheapest) sleep in other places.
