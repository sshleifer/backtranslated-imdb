I'm glad I rented this movie for a reason: I want to read the book and read the story and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: The film is very beautiful, this time is well and consistently (the best of my knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn perform good jobs. <br /> I worried if something was wrong with his mouth - the worst acting job I had seen from Jeremy Irons. (And he hates the terrible English path called "Transnito") is nothing but believable without Winona Ryder young and ideal. Other performances are quite OK, but some things are character twists and hang together to develop the relationship that I feel very angry before the embarrassment and end. <br /> <br /> I am very excited to see if the film is special in August's work. I have to drop another bucks to rent the ice of smile's sense.
