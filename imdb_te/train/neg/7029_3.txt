The Phantom of the Mall is a movie that's best suited in the "easily forgotten" category. It is a beautiful lousy variant of the Phantom famous story of Gaston Lerox, Opera. It is not a bad idea, but the storyline and production of the film is a weak way to give the story a great honor. On the bright side, Gaston Lerrox does not yet turn in his grave. It may be very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The mall phantom is a very frivolous past, making it very memorable scenes. Also, written writers wanted to give more drafts than needed. And even though the mystery has a lot to build about Eric's character ... the basic plot is simple and deja-wu. *** Spoirs *** Because it gets worse about a young couple that the boy gets killed in a fire. He and his parents refused to sell their home to build a huge mall because it set the fire to his home. The boy escaped fire and he was hidden in a mall to take revenge on himself. Meanwhile he's working in the mall now and tries to forget her loss **** The ending Spaniers *** This is pretty simple - but effective - the plot gets our padding of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. It just has to be an entertaining horror movie, which desperately seeks a brilliant thriller ... and can not look for those fans. There are some innovative murders but they are not satisfied with the relaxing horror film. And besides, the mall's Phantom humor may have used at least a bit !! This whole product - the cast itself - is also very intense. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to finish with some positive things ... for example, it's a Ken Four! Die Hard Harrier fans will certainly recognize Peter as the Dawn of the Dead! Yet it is like a horrific milestone that has to find an equalizer. Though his role in the film is limited and totally unnecessary ... it is good to see him again. TV-film fans also recognize Morgan Fair Child as mayor, a good actress and a beautiful woman. Polly Shore is also in this case but I can not keep him ... my opinion about him may be slightly biased. In the end, the famous actress Kari Whitman has been praised. She is a very beautiful girl and has a bit of her talent ... she's never too bad it's never been. Actually, this film is her biggest achievement and her career is enough to say ...
