<br /> In general, I have a lot of good times than writing reviews but I was disappointed with this movie, and I got an IMDb registered one hour with a picture of Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacesi ... well, this movie is just terrible. It is impossible to suspend "disbelief". I tried it, really, I enjoyed it but Justin Timberlake did not just allow me. <br /> <br /> There is no existence, no role as an actor - <br /> <br /> Timberlake should adhere to music. Justin can not blame each other: the film also praises a terrible story and a revised revised edict; This is definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I should be surprised by what really motivates the actors. I mean, I read the script before Morgan really took part. Does not he see how bad it is? What can motivate him to participate in it? Money? True, it's more about what you're looking for than improving quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He gets a lot more time in the movie than Freeman or Spacey and really struggles to come to an agreement with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience is going: "What is hell here? Do you believe this trash?" <br /> <br /> Just like Justin, run - very frustrating.
