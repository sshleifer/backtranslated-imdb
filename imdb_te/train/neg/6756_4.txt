Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in Full Moon Entertainment. Unfortunately, he came to this independent studio where he had a budget and product values ​​at the lowest of years. However, in his small career, Hamilton has made himself creative, creative and creative creative director. <br /> <br /> His films are not good, but are different from the general in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In "Bleed" for the first time, Hamilton has a creative twist slasher sub style for us. Madi (Debbie Roche) is a girl who eventually gets her dream work. Not only that, but it seems that she also found a boyfriend in Shawn (Danny Wollsecke), and it seems that after many mournful moments she was finally laughing at her. <br /> <br /> With Shaun's friends party, they have created a "club" where members will have to kill anyone to kill. </ P> <p> They are obviously joking, but Madi, actually killed anyone. After that event, someone starts killing one of the members of the "Club". <br /> <br /> Made is like identifying her as a murderer with her. <br /> <br /> Maddie, interesting character played by Debbie Roche. This is a very interesting twist in the style of the main actress as part of the suspects. The concept is very original and Rochen's performance is very good, and it is unrealistic that Hamilton is slightly better overall story. The film is slowly slower and the whole concept is one of the worst good ideas in bad cinema. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are good too, the female cast is painful and bad. Danny Wollsky is a terrible wood and is very stereotyped as an adult for his performance. Julie Strain, Brink Stevens & Lloyd Kaufmann appear in small roles and are excellent in their small roles. Also, nudity (both males and females) and the cast is very good looking, so it's really a plus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> msgid "This picture will affect the picture in a low budget effect, very low scary scenes and not really graphic (probably because they see bad); <br /> <br /> Hamilton's recent work, sex speculative venture "Delta Delta Die!", is a well-made and totally ridiculous film. This is not as bad as other good films, it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for Debbie Roche fans or fans of independent budget films. 4/10
