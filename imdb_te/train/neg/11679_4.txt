First, the movie is not a "thriller". It's not nothing "persevering, tat." It may be based on the script, but it's hard to be slow in the direction. <br /> <br /> This storyline is very interesting and intelligent. Unfortunately, we only get the * ingenious * sense of how the * after the movie. With two hours of long sequences, we leave the scene with some action sequences that do not attract the audience, and by listening to them by listening to "fraudulent vuigin" scenes that cause little public intelligence. I'm a fast thriller in the box I promised. This is a fantastic picture. Instead, Spike Lee will eventually plant it along with it.
