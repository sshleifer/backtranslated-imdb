I am a Catholic who teaches in elementary school through the sages taught by the Jesuit priests in High School & College. I'm still practicing Catholic but can not be considered a "good Catholic" in the Church's eyes because the church does not believe me or in some way because the church tells me. <br /> The image ... The monk killed this monk because it is supposed to be a sarcasm of the incarnation of a male religious figure of two monks. It's not funny and there is no scarcity on Diane Keaton's performance. I've never seen the play but it's fine if it's very different from these pictures. <br /> First I was a former gunman and four former students who tried to demonstrate the faith of Mary's emotional and intellectual faith in the first lady's leadership. But the bullets have come true and the story is a tragedy ... tragedy of life loss (along with two former students ... surviving children's lives, student's mother's life), dogmatic tragedy, love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replaced God's true faith. Today's Islam, and yesterday it is wrong with Judaism and Christianity.
