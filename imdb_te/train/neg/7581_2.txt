Today I saw in the movie school class, I did not see Almodovar first but I thought it was good. Unfortunately, it was a nonsense film with two bellied laughing couples. <br /> <br /> The high heels are only a collection of random scenes in their own specialty films, but not any meaningful amount. <br /> I thought. Later, the next day, my movie professor explained the whole class clock detailing any pictures depicting the flamenco dancers filmed in the background of the Dragon Queen scene. Spain was developed in the fascist regime. Clearly, the whole picture is chuck full of intelligent little visual tricks and references like this. <br /> Great, but you know? This is still a bad image. It takes more than a depth and complexity to make a good film - you need to give a reason to keep the audience in focus, and have a keen interest in seeing the audience. High heels gives us novelty, off beat characters but recycled from other movies puts them in more mundane situations, and Almodovar does not seem to make them any point. For example, what is the significance of the revelation of the Hitchcakian surprise character? Why is there too? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene in relation to a newscast. And that's it, just an entertaining moment. The rest of the film is intended to show us just how Penro Almodovar is useless, with the intricate artwork and Visual cues. But regardless of what my cinematologist says, it is a self-determination if the film is good.
