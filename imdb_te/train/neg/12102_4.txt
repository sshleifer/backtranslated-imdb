This film is just a description of Bill Maher. There are many funny moments, and some interesting points, but one of these religions does not even go into expecting hand discussion. This is what I consider the kind of worst kind of documentary - rather than letting you make your own decision forward, the director will forward the time to provide you with feedback and set up editing. <br /> - It has been slashed to strengthen clips from pop culture and media. An interview is likely to complete just one sentence before he interrupts through editing. Bill Mehr is the only one who gave a fair chance to talk to their brain. <br /> Interviews - They represent the absolute most militant religions. From TV Gospel to Ultimate Jewish Stereotype, TRUCK STOP CHAPEL (seriously a TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He was chosen for the worst money grabbers, heavy terrorists, and those who do not have a budget to say no to pick. When he gets a good person who's interviewing, he revives the hell out of them. <br /> <br /> Stability - All religions are portrayed in the same way. Muslims were especially hit. In the Muslim section, no one can give anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting himself, or by breaking up with suicide bombs. All Muslims were portrayed by gun-touting terrorists by editing, and none of those interviewed were correctly modified. <br /> <br /> End - The message is ultimately heavily handmade, and this is a very interesting idea that has not been given to the countless people with religious aesthetics. Bill Mehr explains himself. Religion is stupid and dangerous, and it literally gives the message that it will destroy the world. <br /> <br /> With the flaws in the picture, it has some good points, and is actually funny, even though it is very ridiculous. But it is the opinion that it is one side, Bill Maher's opinion, religion. He does not look anything. <br/> <br/> 4/10 - Some good moments, but in the most irresponsible documentary style, are heavily riddled.
