I've seen this film at the Mar Dell Plata Festival (Argentina) actually (I've seen Cutting Moments + 2 other small films Cutting Family Portraits, by Douglas Buck) ... I can not see! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a peek each once for a while. By the end of it, my stomach was overturned and I faced light. The second small beginnings (BTW, of course not the same guy I left the room) just a few minutes later I left the movie. This is terrible and frustrating for me! I'm really impressed by many brave people who loved it. How can I not love that kind of movies! Two days of shocking and cruel and horrible images I've seen really stuck in my head! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend told me the whole thing and told me about it) and I do not feel any sense of it. I mean, the amount of violence and the subject, makes sense no other than to try to insult people. And this is not a good enough reason, I think. There is nothing in this movie, I say "good, at least 'x' thing is good." Well, I guess I would never understand that kind of movies.
