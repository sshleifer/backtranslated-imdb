It was originally a "beautiful" film, then it was very sari and simple songs. <br /> <br /> Speaking of King James English is not an annoying world in today's world, easy to explain. Can you imagine today's young people trying to hear this film? <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and looks like "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alsande La Cortuelis") is also a good look and lovely, long red hair. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, and I can not beat it. Perhaps this is a rental worthy, for historical reasons or if you're a big crosby fan, altogether, it's not too much.
