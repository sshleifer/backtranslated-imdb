I never understood Garbo's appeal. She is always coming across in her films, not moving around, and the annoying voice that sank Tuba's division. She is also a very limited actress like Gloria Swanson until she remains in the silent age. In this last film, her performance is very average and unprotected. <br /> <br /> Even though Melvin Douglas is well-managed, he ridiculed that he was never reliable and did not get out of the ground. <br /> <br /> The script has failed in almost every department, wasting each actor here. Douglas and Gorbo have good enough chemistry, but this is not even a place in ni√±nitschka, which I found was very overrated.
