Dudes at MST3K should see this dog of an image. It is not about any drama hook actor in any major acting venue in Hollywood. And he had this strange invasion with a taxi driver. So what does this mute actor do? He wears his hairy blonde, L.A. Acting as a surfer will act as an actress in an innocent hope. You'll be far away in the most suspicious funny scenes of the film. The actor's friend is a heartbreaker and sounds, "How can you do this to me?" Why is she weeping? Cos dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer who got acting gigs. This film makes no sense at ALL! Benson is also a film star in the film and he has acted as a stereotypical rightwing politician with a simple mute funny dialogue. This movie will throw you down, trust me. Do you talk to me ?!
