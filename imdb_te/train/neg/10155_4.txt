I have read many good reviews that defended and criticized various aspects of the film. One of the things that I see with the ideal political scientist Megan, trying to change the world. I liked her role. Perhaps, I'm a 23 year old political student, because I think I'll change the world, so I'm in contact with Megan. Moreover, she is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Well, she cried and cried a lot. It is quite dramatic, and seems overdone, but does not fit her character? She participates in the program to prove herself a point to sacrifice her life. She feels like people who enjoy such programs are sick. I think she did well for her argument. However, as a young linear girl, she feared the things she would face. I think her acting is definitely a young girl who shows moral courage despite her very fear. Moreover, despite her disappointment, she played some respectable role throughout her. <br /> <br /> Unlike Megan movies in general, what I expected was pretty good. It has excellent gorgeous scenes through micro budgets. The plot is probably an idea and does not care. This is basically just a slazer picture of the dark humorist knowledge, which refers to the name. I love the doctor's sadism. He killed Megan's shirt and tried to kill her before she could kill her. Chainsaw hick is hilarious. <br /> <br /> I will give this film 4 to 10. It's a good setting, almost any theme, good and terrible acting mix. I would recommend for less thrill, but it's hard to find a diamond that's tough that micro-budget horror.
