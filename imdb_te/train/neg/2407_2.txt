I have seen today, partially attracted to all actors and some have enjoyed many other movies of the film. However, this is one to avoid. Dozens of badly cut scenes continue, where continuity is not just stream, starting at the beginning of billiards, for example. The combat scenes with locals who remember those old black and white Tarzan movies are good, moving to the ground moving on the ground moving in the air and the camera cuts, and moving to the thigh. That instant death? There are also many unnecessary scenes where there is nothing like the plot to save the little girl while collecting flowers. Really badly animated clay toys are very painful to watch. If you look at this movie, the inches of 5 km away are highlighted. Somehow one David covers up on Makkal and manages to give him a nip. In the city, when the floor is broken, local time takes 2 feet to the left all the time, but he screams and it comes to him. I give this a 2 because Ekland. Why is McCullum's voice a stutter because the film is progressing?
