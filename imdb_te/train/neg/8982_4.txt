When I write this, my nose will be a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> A few weeks ago I sent a previous comment about this film, which was not yet visible, so it rejected all denials. Thirty minutes, most notably Jardi Mollah's performance, is a leading actor who plays in major productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is very good. Unfortunately, everything really sinks ultimately under the weight of an awful, dramatic script. <br /> <br /> There is also an abundance of undesirable nudity that does not do anything to give an impressionist cruise to the heroine's predecessor or piece of art. <br /> <br /> The real day trip to the beach in Valencia is more difficult than ever to deal with these fictional characters anytime.
