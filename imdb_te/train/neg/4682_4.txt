Yep, shouting, strongly, encouraging, arguing, celebrating, holding the fist, high driving & fighting. You have a simple idea, but 100% certainly is not. A naval technology is an advantage for quality points, but you'd probably find many flaws. An awful movie & Hackman & Washington are their typical intelligent, but the plot is the one you could pretty peg off. <br /> <br /> I'm still looking forward to seeing a submarine movie, but they argue but you probably will not have a movie. <br /> <br />
