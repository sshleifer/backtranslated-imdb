I was a kid as a kid, but I was a kid as a child. The movie stories are stupid and a bit boring even though the killer does not use his light knife to kill people. There is a really solid cast in this movie. Since the film is only a part of the film and is only a way to show a small amount of light saber, what script did they read in the film? At times the plot is incomprehensible and ultimately completely haphazard. The whole picture is to rotate around the aliens and a weapon. The plot consists of two children, having a alien encounter in the flash for a few years, which appears to be in a compound. For the dead animals and exploration and for some reason a dude gets the weapons and income of foreigners to use it to go to a lightweight killing sphere. Actually, you should be surprised why you did the movie, if you have some good death scenes in a killer, you show that alien movements are more than a lucky light whirl and you can then call yourself Star Wars.
