You do not care about the movie when you go to the open summer movie for Greek summer night! Edison has started a good good with some good work, but the great Morgan Freeman once again ... (a film is generally a bit boring, full of a good start to catch the audience, and the role of the characters in the vertical It's much smaller and more complete, and the third part is good, you just grab the movie 30) Elite police officers (those weapons can ruin a building), shoot a man behind a car, and kill him when he strikes him (but 3), then the guy throws fire (kill the rest 3), Greek summer stars The sky is very good with a film in this way!
