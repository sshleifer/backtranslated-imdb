Why should Mary and Rodda's histories be seldom? Divorced women with different daughters. Why the original appearance and the characters are a very short reference? Daughter's characters are crazy and uninteresting. Why should not daughters always be like their mother on TV? Mary understands that she will leave Minneapolis, Roda goes back to NYC, but Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens are not the guest stars. It's a pitiful way to remember the wonderful characters. It is good to look at Mary and Roths, but it may have been better. Mary Tyler Moore's Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, Mary Richards returns to Marie again to get her back on the ground.
