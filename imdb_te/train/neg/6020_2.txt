I like movies on the end day. I like B-movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I can ignore undesirable events, and the ever-depicting film on the Dieses Ex Machina is actually given. I disregard the bad guys who are trying to deal with hunger and reach world peace. None of these did not kill the movie. This film was just plain and simple boring. Nothing is real; <br /> <br /> All the sequences in the film are designed to create the cinematographic morality of the creators in the audience, originally for a coherent story or any kind of suspense. Enter entertaining B-movie, elsewhere. This film is just boring.
