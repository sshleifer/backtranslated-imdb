What happened in God's name? How about going to create practically cheap mockup of Red Neck Zombies? Zombie '90s to anyone who ever earns, or earning a dollar profit? But basically, what happened here? <br /> <br /> The zombie '90 Extreme Infectious, Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000 is directed by a crazy man named Andreas Snanes who is expert in gore films such as Goretti, some of them in pornographic titles. In the Gore department, it is not much different than the rest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie Zombie 90 ' <br /> <br /> The story gets wasted time getting very specific. An accident involving chemicals, the dead come back, and causes the country to eat. The concept has never been treated in such a manner. The total of gore effects, new less. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can not say whether I first felt funny or not, but I suspect that the English dubbing was very real to the original script, but the stranger was done. <br /> <br /> This is the only thing I have seen, but it reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction in a Troma film. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Snanes is a real director, I would recommend Nicos the Impaler. If you think you have no criteria in the bad movie, serious illness, but you are alerted. It takes nerves of steel. But if you're here, then you can do this stomach. That's it, the weather is not, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Shinas. <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After a few more views of the zombie '90, I got a change of heart, or I guess I get it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so forgive tough words, however, Extreme Pest still deserves only one star.
