I do not know why I'm doing this !! I keep defending Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it needs more credit and opportunities ... and they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive care is a terrible product and the worst thing ever made in the Dutch speaking countries. It is a Dutch effort to create our most frightening franchise, based on the mainstream American slasher classic as Friday 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers were very much in this regard, but they fell far short. Intensive care has become an embarrassing product for everyone involved, so here is a true culture image. It is almost impossible to hunt this original copy and is only featured in special occasions, such as a "special night". It's exactly 5 minutes, intensive care attempts to tell a story and tries to create a storyline ... it turns out to be the most dull and inexpensive-effects of the gruesome and low-brain slash 'n stalk image. The casting of the entire cast is unreal, although there are some respectable names. The famous male character Koen Waters ... This man may be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, TV presenter and a host of young girls statues. Though he did not act in the film. Like everyone in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince intensive care has never happened.
