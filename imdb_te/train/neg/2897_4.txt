Curious about "Don in Real Life" is very low. First off, the whole setup is very talented. Did you really believe that Mary Dawn did not tell me that she was going to the very first meeting at the restaurant at the restaurant? After Don talked all the time during that conversation, why would she attract her? For that matter, I found out why Mary was attracted to this film. He does a little bit to convince us that he is very innocent and he really is a good guy (he tries to make Mary envy with his brother's mockery about his last girlfriend, lying to Mary in the bookstore, and a 'blind date'). Don and Marie are more willing to be bowled by the whole family as the bowling narrow scene. Yes it really happened. Don's slow, relative and manipulative in real life. Chick Flicks like the Jen Aston Book Club gets more marks than this speculative "Terzerer".
