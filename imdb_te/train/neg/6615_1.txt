Shortly after the Indian film, the audience gets a good movie with a film like Shale. And at one time just once the den (hopefully) we have Aag to an RGV that breaks all criteria and creates one of its own. As little as a standard, it does not break. Ram Gopal Varma's talent is to take a melting pot and create a dish so that it fills the distance. It's totally unforgivable to take a classic like Shale and murder and I can not believe that he is Sholay almost the film RGV. Despite the folklore elements in the show, the film was able to build on its platform, which characterized the constant roots of the characters from time to time. Any Ag will take these characters and compete u very badly to get them into the mess. The realistic element is totally absent and the movie ends with the "actors" group parading in a plot of lesser and unavoidable events. The movie is a ridiculous waste for a vote. Its time for RGV to refer to another "diverse" plot that awakens its realism and classifies it in the film.
