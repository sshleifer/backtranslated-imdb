This movie is just terrible. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are so bad that I've ever seen such worst actors and scenario it's happy. <br /> <br /> "The main" actor gets all the girls who have to be a hot guy, but he looks ugly, overweight and looks like from the beginning of the 90s. <br /> All the characters are away for the weekend for a combination of friends, but no one is actually friends! The married couple did not see the "main" person in 5 years and again they are not really friends. The main person's "date" only knows him from the work and than the girl they pick up in a bar. Say now that there is a risk of losing your job to spend a weekend at your cabin with people who are not your real friends. What he's doing at the beginning of this film! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time even a minute in this lemon. <br /> <br
