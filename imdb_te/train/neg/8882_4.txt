The calm is too calm to call the film about the revenge from the grave dull and lifeless vengeance, but this is a rejectionable impartial combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) through LAS DIABOLIQUES (1954); While still still viewable, it raises chuckles instead of cold for the winter. While the British film industry thanks to the unfortunate difficulties of the late 1970s, this sample script also attracted 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (sister-in-law), Jean Simmons's title role), Jenny Aguter (Robertson's artist half sister), Simon Ward (troubled Driver), Ron Moody (unfortunate therapist), Michael Jaeston (Robertson ya) Strategic business partner), Judy gisan (Simmons 'best friend and wife of jaistan), Flora Robson (the house owner), David Tomlinson (nampari read Simmons' determination) and, perhaps most surprisingly, Jack Warner (the tomb of the architect) I'm sorry!
