This is a bad image. I have crippled my brain and I can not make a positive comment to make. Acting is worse. I've seen more believable shows on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, presidential secret recordings, and anything else that gets near it should be made for cheesy fun at a shark trash. Night of Sharks is not good too. The dialog sounds and distributes as seconds before it can be filmed. And to top it off, Night of Sharks is the worst soundtrack I've ever heard of. <br /> <br /> Everything that I read, by 1987, my ears did not open blood from the 80s techno synthesis noises that Italy's film industry was dead. Sharks is the last nail in the coffin.
