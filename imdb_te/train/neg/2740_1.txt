I do not know why I was forced to sit through the whole thing. This "movie" memores did not destroy DVD-R; I saw the end result of a middle class group stealing their parents' camcorder. The lowest movie ever made so far. <br /> <br /> I really want to sue Aaron Yamaso from the bottom of my heart, two hours after he stole my life. <br /> Apparently, it was deliberately evil; However, if you end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see Yamasato really trying hard to make a wonderful movie. Actors try comparable dramatic kick-gloss performances with Crimson Tide but come closer to Marine. <br /> <br /> The worst acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is a good C-movie - the plot is not good enough to be considered a B-movie carrier. The dialog attempts to be dynamic and witty, but everything is even worse. It is rumored that the hard copy of the heroes will actually attract the flies. Plus, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because of it's NON-STOP. That's right, it displays the music in the background and deals as a delicate reminder of how bad it is. I do not care what the disclaimer claims, I do not buy. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is very low-budget. But it does not have any need for its recording setting. Great movies are not material, not budget. <br /> <br /> Allow me to wipe out this 90-minute waste high power: Samurai came in if I had three lines with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel before TV and Blood, I was going to be more than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. <br /> Undoubtedly, some try to save the film. Two, maybe three. They say, "This is the Grindhouse chop-sink!" Or "cheesy on good way!" Or "It's so bad, it's good!" Those people are idiots. An image is good, or it's bad. There is no such thing as good bad image. But there are things like bad movies like idiots. Do not get me wrong; The carbonbill that is enjoyable and fun there is never going to make serious movies. Clamp is one. <br /> <br /> This suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it is 90 minutes long. The DVD cover is great about this "movie", so you're near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin, check it - see it, just see - and walk away silently.
