Until the end I saw the film because it was only "hope" to see it interesting. The film is very bad and the performance of the girl is honest, honestly and honestly, I'm not a film critic but an expert you will notice that this is very bad. <br /> <br /> When she started talking to me, the first thing to come to mind was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafso and she agreed to help her with the screenplay and agreed to act in the film because she was an outstanding director." Surprise, surprise, and the next day I found out that Gaida Kalagande was the wife of my wife. Horror story and terrible appearance.
