Okay ... I have seen a lot of odd / unusual movies in my day. The fear and jealousy in Las Vegas comes to think when I feel. Well now ... From here, when someone asked me, "Hey, what's the most extraordinary film you've never seen?" I say slip stream! <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film it is clear that this will be one of the "Trappy Camera Effect" films. I mean, the small things like flashing on the screen, backstage, flash forward and quick backing of the speech and scenes of flash backslash, quick and fast forward ... then you have the original acting. People randomly shoot, shoot / shoot people, tell us what the real things that are not quite made up, if any. <br /> <br /> For the lack of writing, writing and the lack of a good way to describe this movie, you basically see this "trip" he goes across the movie. The subject, Johnny Depp went on a similar journey in Fear and Looth in Las Vegas but his distinction was just entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I finished sleeping. This hurt some part of my brain. <br /> <br /> In this film, I have some cinematic skills and have some special cinematic natures and feel dementia feel. Blah, blah, blah. Point, when you see this picture hurts your brain .... It makes little sense, it also takes your concentration to understand what's going on far away and understands what's going on and in the end, you're only happy about the thing ... Sit by and say! So in closing, if you want to see an image, you can go "both the heck" and loudly and on your head and check it for an hour and 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, I praise you as an actor and praise your choice to take a stab at him, never make this film again. Next time, try something more reliable than leaving the viewer with a bigger head than camera technologies.
