I think this one sucks on ice, because it's leaving the cube, and who gave us so much news and why. The original cube never left the cube and it left everything to your imagination. This garbage fest will give you all, though. And I do not like it ... Although the performance is excellent, this is a prequel to this orchestra, or made by other people than the original filmmakers, because I believe this is a damaging cause and I think the sequel has done well and the source is more real. I would recommend to stay away, Hyper Cube, I'd like to discuss another movie ... (I gave 2 for the performance)
