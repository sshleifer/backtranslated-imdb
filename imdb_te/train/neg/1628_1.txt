The question is that GAOTS really looks, really important, without one of the most awkward productions of the 1970s. Tragic truth is that it is a help but laugh is so completely wasteful at every level. The city follows the couple's day in the jungle, reaching desperation for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman films ... they walk along a dark path, Berkeley coffee clutch. Almost every line of the Tortraised dialog here ("I think the small compartments of this small life are in the life ... but it's pretty") is not incomplete (well ... okay ... we have some nudity and a white soft romance ), A couple who participated in a couple had anticicemic face. Some pretty tough folk folk songs with a sound guitar, making the Nam Whats landscape. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this incident or anything interesting. Larry Buchanan's film "Strawberries Need rain" was a weak example of a Bergman tribute. "Golden Apples" every bit is bad, but it is a consensual random speech that makes it memorable. 1/10
