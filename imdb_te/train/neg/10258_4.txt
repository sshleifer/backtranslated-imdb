Some of the land Father Fathers and nuns are not grateful. Christopher Lee (who has been trapped in the film by producers, claims he has loads of great actors) gets the father to Pergado and his usual intense and horror routine. Most actors retired from acting, though not too bad. The film has terrible sound effects (created primarily by pressing the keys on the old computer) and it is at times humorous - for example, it displays the scene of the sky, for one hour at a time. However, the story is quite ridiculous in the world-doomed way, and the production is adequate. Interestingly, a scene involves Albert band and wife jockeys; Meda band; Author Frank Ray Perrilli and Charles Band's assistant Bena Burton. Despite its plodding nature I wanted to see how all the work was genuinely and so loved it too.
