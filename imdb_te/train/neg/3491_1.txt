Apparently, people who wrote the back of the box see this so-called "trouble." They explained that "blindingly directed choreography and violence." I saw "intrigue". Instead, I saw a bad effort in dialogue with Kung Fu. I do not see "violence". At least, I find nothing to stop my disbelief from what I can hurt a person with "painful" skin - but here I am declaring a lot of "plots". In addition, as a viewer of many and various films (in some cases Kung Fu film), I can officially say that the film pieces may be exceptional. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do.
