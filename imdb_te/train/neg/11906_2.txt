At the end of the 80's, I feel great seeing "Der Himmber Uber Berlin" a good experience. <br /> <br /> In addition to "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a clause for the intellectual of the Weme Wenders. <br /> Unfortunately the subsequent years of "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hit a steady decrease in the quality of his work with a horrible low point. I lost attractive pictures or music. No searching or displaying for great insight. All the remaining characters and thinly veiled political statements have been exposed, not only to the toilet, but also by explicitly mocking the mature audience. <br /> Do you feel very dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr Wenders to either put it or stop it altogether.
