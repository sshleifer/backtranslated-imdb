When I saw the film, I felt like a B-grade slap. While many speak of its quality, the film describes the effects of drugs to realistic representation and the self-sustaining state of a person and their subsequent dirty unfortunate events. And indeed, the techniques used (many already mentioned) are overused and therefore unbelievable and irrelevant to the film. <br /> <br /> As far as this story is concerned, it is soft, unexpected, unbearable and twisted. <br /> <br /> You can read many other reports in this movie and I can say it is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors and actresses are appealing but face such a boring action ... Take a picture so far. The action is lackluster and intermittent: some punches thrown here and there, ultimately with the last gun. <br /> As others say, 'Bad' movies are great because they are very bad. But the film is empty. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend the number of other movies there, if there really is an academic film to intimidate people from drug use. Effective way. 'Skm for a Dream', 'Trainspring', 'Fear and Lating in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are some examples. <br /> <br /> You also need to check some lightweight movies on 'Go' (both whole, serious and funny) and 'Halfbacked'. <br /> <br /> In the final reference, Winnie Jones distributed the film 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly suggest that you will save your money and your time without seeing this movie.
