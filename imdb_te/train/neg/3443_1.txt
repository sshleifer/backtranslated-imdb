I watched this movie last night and dreamed of the best of all the cool trailers of the DVD.Even I saw the cover .That some of the moments that I was a bit creepy looked good as soon as I started looking at it "What This Oh Oh God" Stupid was ruined by music. Rock and opera are at times when suspense scenes are considered. That's right there to me destroying it and I was shocked by the head thinking thinking of my head I was again deprived of the art.Nothing covered against a rental and music, even if it's just a movie.Whoever imposes a shot in the wrong parts edited cinematic doing.The cover lightning There is no clue what the sea is.That storm was more interesting but it did not. Acting worst I have not ever seen in consideration all they need to know and in the sense of plot.In the beginning 2 men have seen all of the teens I was disappointed in their first film. This boat, apparently getting over on the other reason, was supposedly only 1 girl existed at the end and the others were either her imaginary friends Or I'm because it's very badly portrayed because it's absolutely kind There alu. Fox wrote a comment here that it is a true story. He or she is believed to be souls and souls and has a haunted boat in the area where the film is shot. The true story is in this film .I never experienced something like individually but impossible.I am not telling the news if anyone is interested in renting this movie, you love it amateur Do your own risk.If you like student horror movies.
