I saw this movie last night and I was struggling to remember it very much. The story is about a group of burglars that escape from an empty penal colony. They traveled to the moon in a space-age dustier carrier; They frighten the dustmakers who work on Chandrabose. <br /> <p> It is the worst low-budget science fiction films of desert planets, or the film, criminals fleeing criminals. I do not know why. But I can say with certain certainty that such films are always targeted. This is not really an exception. It's a good credit sequence and half-way alright dancing music soundtrack begins reasonably well. It then degrades into a boring sci-fi thriller. As a result, I'm struggling to write a helpful review in this film, if you read this movie, I can not give you a sense of the film's sensitive and nuances. For the record, I recall the vulnerable bunch of evils, the tedious bunch of goodies, some nuclear warheads and the naked woman's holograms. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in moon cartoon programs, I do not hesitate to recommend this film. I also recommend those who want to send their friends to sleep their wallets and steal their wallets.
