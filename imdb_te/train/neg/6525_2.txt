I gave the film 2, and I think it is a science fiction fan. It was a late night at AMC, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is good for some laughs, but not too much. </ P> <p> In fact, we have now learned more about Mars, but we can not really hold it against this film. <br /> <br /> If the astronaut's injury / condition, I have explored quite a bit and there are many parts of this film. The creature in the lake, etc. Overall, the film is like a long episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - finished with the cinematic end.
