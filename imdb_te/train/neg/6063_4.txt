"The Masters of Horror" proved to be a poor pretext for 'messaging episodes', and making a definitive case for Joe Dante's 'screwflow solution' (one of the best episodes of the series), the aviator-heavy and impressive (none of the soapboxes More straying than the horror). And 'Pro-Life' only creates a reaction to the slightest violence; Young Angelic (Caitlin Watches), which appears to be running in the woods, is hit by almost 2 (doctors) (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuel Wooger) and is now running to work in the local (and discrete) abortion clinic. Angel's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), a rock-chilled, very right sacred roller, does anything to prevent his daughter from getting pregnant. If there is nothing else, 'Pro-Life' acquired some sensation on its controversial topic, but John Carpenter disappoints the entire venture - the script is less interested in the film than it is (the accepted poverty); Slow tension increases any tension, and it already opens up the occasional plot. When Dwayne and his sons were in the storm in the clinic, when guns were blazing, it was not an amazing event; Later, when a physician torture a 'miscarried abortion', the scene is undesirable and unnecessary - an attempt to get the underrated film out. Poor performances (the perlman is damaged here) has become the script's development, and if Carpenter's direction is the source of 'pro-life' for his next hot dinner, tired. Spider-living with a man head and a rubber monster suit by the time are waving the hallway, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess think ...
