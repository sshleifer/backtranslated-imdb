The film is poorly scripted and directed, but it's just bizarre. A beautiful novel is terrible in the film. There have been many changes to the storylines, perhaps to sort the time period. But the results are just confusing. Acting probably did not overturn the script that eliminates the intentions of the characters for their behavior. Plus, English exchange exchanges do not work as everyone represents ESTEban like Patriach Essenban. Horrible. Please read the beautiful novel in Spanish if possible. Do not see this movie. It will destroy you with what will be an amazing experience.
