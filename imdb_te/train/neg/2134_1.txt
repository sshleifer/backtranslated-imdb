You can expect more with this cast and budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> John Cusack has many strange and still working images. <br /> <br /> The film is not just a series of rare scenes and poor people. The plot goes somewhere, writing, learning, and the letters paper is thin. If you want the story and the depiction of the characters that depict the depth of imagery three dimensional, this stinger looks like a stuntboat like Mickey. <br /> <br /> Another awesome memory of the look of Don Ackroyd is really awful, 1991's Nothing But Trouble. Apparently this is the kind of project killing careers and the agents fired.
