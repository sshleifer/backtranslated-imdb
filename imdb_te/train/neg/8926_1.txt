When I first came up in 1970, I saw "Myra Brokenidge". At that time, I was a healthy 20 year old and loved the movies and really liked Ruckwell Welsh. On top of that, I read the Gore Width novel based and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie in the local drive and half way because I tried hard to change the car of my car so that the monoxide poisoning would die and the rest of this shipment would not be seen. It's not "smart" or "sophisticated", it's gross and sloppy. All the actors are tone deaf and the director does not have a slight idea what he is doing. Our West's cast is one of the worst cast choices in film history. As one critic states here, her role is not associated with a movie or book. Her character in the book is hitting through the young stud which will never be for sexual Mrs. West. Oh no, she is so sexy that she is sexually immortalized from a 77-year-old woman who appears every day of her age. I have gone, but why? It's an awful movie. <br /> Bluto
