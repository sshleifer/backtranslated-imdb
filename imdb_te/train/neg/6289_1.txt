This is the most cliche I've ever seen and has the worst romance comedy. Each scene is valuable and two main actors - Corey and Danny are very worried. Corey should never be too mute and linear and Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neil Campbell and the Killer from Urban Legend are the only merely repurchasing qualities of this film. <br /> <br /> Danny (Dean Paras) appears in his last thirties and looks like she is still in college - a girl who is trying to bed. <br /> Here in Australia, the film is called a very smooth; There is nothing smooth about this film. 1/10 Avoid
