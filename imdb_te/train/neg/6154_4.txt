Portly nice guy comes for a sweet blonde; She also liked him, but not for the reasons you think. The short-lived black comedy from the author Pat Proft has a very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dickson, and it does not have any effect. This was just a quickie thrower attempt, and Norman Bates himself was led by Anthony Perkins. Also B-comic levels, somewhat-like "Eat Roule" is a good bet. Here's an amusing setup perfect; Unfortunately, the film is nowhere to go to its second law. <br /> <br /> **** from **
