First, I want to say that Sam Neal is somewhere in the film. What's the film without Sam Neal? Anyone saw the event horizon. The film about a dragon that controls lizards with D-Wars rocket launchers has a potential feature film, but it is not a sin. No, no Sam Neal, no good movie. I took 5 dollars or it was renting D-Wars and adding 10 to that and Sam Neal's film - obviously I had ten lines so I had a list of Sam Neil movies <br /> <br /> "Jurassic Park" Calm - the October for the red-wenth horizon-not the jurassic park <br /> The whole D-wars pile
