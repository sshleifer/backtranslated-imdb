I was willing to laugh across this movie like the Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. Producers have been told that many biker are enthusiastic friends, and decided to make a film from there. <br /> This is often unseen. Many of the footage of the bikers on a dirt road, repeatedly played the same music. Unfortunately, Reyne Harman is just in the film. Harman probably would have livened up things. <br /> <br /> But bikers are scared of a small town. Fights, murder, a shy cop, goofy mechanic etc. One of the bikers always wears a weak effort to separate from the football helmet and other rape. <br /> <br /> A biker who attacked a woman in a scene, the woman's face "You're the same!" One minute later we returned to the scene and said, "You're the same!" Again declaring. <br /> <br /> "We also learned that the middle-aged mechanic has been canceled between Joe and young Susie. We suddenly learn that the wedding is still (but with another bride).
