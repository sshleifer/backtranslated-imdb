This is a very odd picture ... I'm not really sure what's been about, some N London lowlifes believe that they all believe that the Orange kind and something they do all in their own way, find a mute kid in the woods, usually changing something about their lives unfolding in disaster. The film ended 90 minutes later, and I was very disappointed, almost annoyed at all. I did not care about the characters - any of them had a chance to grow up to the viewer. <br /> What is the message? Am I blurry? It's odd. What happens runner? Why shoot Emilio kid? ... that's definitely understandable, made sense. Can someone help me understand this mess of an image?
