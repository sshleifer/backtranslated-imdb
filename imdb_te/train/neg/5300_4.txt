I'm one of the millions of addicted wolves around the world and have seen this episode, which opened all of this in British Channel 5. I thought that it was born out of this film and I am only surprised by the fact that he recognized the colossal power of "Colombo" and added all the small improvements that make such an exciting & classic lineup. This particular feature is not as good as the rest of the movie (except the awkward last episode & British episode played). If Colombo was manufactured according to the original pilot, it certainly did not last for a long time, nor was it viewed and loved by the world. In this film Lt Colombo smartly wears a normal car, is a partner, does not speak about his alleged relatives and comes across very aggressive. There is no cat and mouse chemistry between Colombo and "villain". It's worth watching, but only for the novelty of seeing how Colombo is starting.
