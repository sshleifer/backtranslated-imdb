Prom night: No depth girl compose completely plastic on a very important night. <br /> <br /> Every few minutes later we reminded the characters that we remember. <br /> <br /> There is no need for Prom Night. Nothing about it actually does not exist and I really would have given zero or fewer stars in IMDb. A group of young people sitting in front of us was the only part of my view that I enjoyed when I decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. <br /> <br /> This plot is mainly a person going on a rampage. And the thing, it's not even a little exciting devastation. If the guy is not really scary, if Robbie Williams looks like a baseball cap, I'm just anxious. Either I did not really add to the effect, either of the cinema less about the characters than the color of the carpet. And to make matters worse, the remaining characters are evenly dimensional and ignore. Hotel employees are more likely to say that one of their masters is missing or out of concern and that after killing a murderer he is no longer identifiable. I was shocked in the blue robes that were amazed, the stereotypical girl he was the only person who noticed. She realizes this and then falls on the stairs, hangs her in the plastic sheet and then hits the paint buckets on the pile. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that I believe the director is doing his hardest effort. He carried all the boundaries without actually showing any murder. Shocking! And the music, I'm not even opening up. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> I think Prom Night is a joke. It's terrible and ignorant. If no one is in their right mind or not, there is no reason to see this film. The mainstream film is going downhill and the situation worsens the situation. If you have a desire to see this absolutely awful movie, listen to my plea. Do not do this. There are good things to spend six pounds on. Play ghosts as a sheet.
