The thing that I really love about this woman's shorts is the theme of the theme - especially "Living with Happiness." <br /> <br /> There are some good openings in the film - the unusual location and the probability of treating a strange film, but clunky exposed dialogue, worst performances and most television coverage fails to succeed. Simple Cinema. The ideas are so fleshed so that they feel almost pat like a television commercial. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this director make a full length animation, working with the producer who is not too boring. Resolution.
