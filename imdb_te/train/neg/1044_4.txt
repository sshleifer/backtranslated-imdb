"Increasing Victor Vargas" is one of those light and family movies that you can see and do at the same time as the NY Times Times. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a coronavirus, you do not have the "Pause" DVD. Just let it roll, 'cause you really miss anything important. No turns, turns, or tension. This is not really a racial movie, it is struggling in a migrant family dealing with poor films as a film. They can be any race group. This is a very small difference. I've seen a zillion times before. Put on the Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Only tones and names are different. The Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton, and Presbyterians had a whole touch. <br /> <br /> The critics here did not directly get to the locale. Some people are Spanish Harlem. Some Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a lifetime New Yorker, I voted for the Lower East. And the family did not meet anyone other than Latino. They lived in an insulated / unified short enclosure. Interacting with Latino-Nothing has created some enthusiasm, interest or tension. <br /> <br /> Now for the cinematography of criticism often. I do not know whether this is my TV or what, but all the indoor shots are very easy for me. Apt, furniture, and faces all orange. What is And that's appropriate. I was pretty sick. Some people here claim that the old apt's / rent has too many rooms. Well, probably 50 years ago. Which landlords did 2 or 3 to divide into smaller pieces and enter into the majority of immigrants. <br /> And another annoying thing .... This second family film was criticized by all I saw, which had a young boy "off jerking". Do we need this private sex law to see us? Please leave me! What's with these directors? <br /> <br /> "Victor Vargas" is a fun little picture. It is good to see young Latino actors giving a break and showing their talent. But the authors refused them, giving them a flat, insensitive script to work with. Enjoy the presentation, but keep your fingers near the "Forward Forward" button.
