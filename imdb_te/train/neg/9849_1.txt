It's one of the worst films I've never seen! This is also bad on TV Movie Level Standards. This plot is unfortunately mistaken, and the familiar names in the film are ruined in confusing and uncertain roles. I do not know how the director worked with this film - it's bad. Bill as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it is absolutely horrific. There is nothing thrilling about it. And you can do mental damage! The earliest sequences initially included such promises - embarkation on whether the soul was just the brain's subject, but the full sounds of the car-crash scene were beyond belief. The harder you try, the more you care about the characters. <br /> <br /> There are so many sprinkling ideas that the collage of the words removed from Chinese philosophers is the best, and the worst is that the film will actually make you brain dead? <br /> I have over 300 images on DVD, and the first one I'm going to get my money back. Clear the steer.
