What is totally disappointing! In the IMDb here 6.1 score has produced some lightweight expectations but, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bugs me is that braindead, generalization university children. Yes, I know that I am a teenage kid and something like that, but why are they always portrayed as full breaded morals in movies? I had a role that I thought very well, but he / she was killed before the end (which was not revealed here). Other characters were poorly executed and the hero / heroine I expected did not do it. On the plus side: the plot is pretty good and productions make cuts on this kind of rumor. Acting is generally not very good, Ruther Hare stands in a small role. But it's boring and failing with bidmid characters. You have to look after them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and it's generous).
