"La Fury del Hobri Lobo" is a stand-alone storyline that does not appear to fit with previous Waldemar Dance films. Some commented that the film is likely to occur before the events of "Werewolff Shadow", even though it's released ... I'm not sure if they're right. Waltmann Dynskie, in this film, cut out an epic creature in Tibet (here is a great deal - "It is an IT but it is impossible, I'm a scientist and these things do not exist." Even though the pentagram was identified with the mark, he was in a wolf until he learned that his wife was cheating on him Changing into a night beast, he is a storm She and her lover kill two before being running and electrifying, not long before being reproduced by a Dominitric University professor who is somewhat obscured by the mind control. <br /> <br /> The subjects of these experiments are of a castle that lives as relatives Going to the underground room. <br /> <br /> For everything - Jackinto Molina, Paul Naschie, wants you to call him, thinks arrogantly about the actor and his work, how these films are flawless, and you can always rely on him for a good show.The rest of the cast seems to be adequate, but when it comes to voice-over voiced on all their lines difficult. And really the main problem for me ... Voice over artists that they use are very awful, awful, awful. When they kicked in the film they were ineffective that they did not distribute their songs (they were constantly pointing to "Waldeman"). But unfortunately they are almost impossible to find the subtitle copies of Naschie films, although they are available in the original language without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Josh Maria Jabalza's direction appears to be a hit of the hit and miss. Some scenes have some great visual insights, others are badly built and poorly edited, especially when the final scenes are really computational. The reason for this is that Jabalja spent most of the time drinking on the set. His fourteen year old nephew allowed him to rewrite Molina's conversation, using extra permission without his consent, and shot many shots from Molina's previous films. <br /> <br /> The film is likely to be one of Monna's best works, and it is surprising that both of them did not work together. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas here. Some elements of the storyline make an interesting mental play with wolf as a metaphor for envy and tension. 'Wolff' as an idea of ​​a 'Yeti' come back to Mobina's next work. Some pretty horrific and surreal elements go down in the room, Daniskie goes home home by a village, there is also a very memorable sequence about half way through the killing or rape of the innocents as he goes - a scene is particularly intense, but in fact some Molina's first The film was lifted straight from "La Marca del Hombre-Lobo" The. Although there are some problems with the front-row entertainment reform, the pretty obvious cuts (some may be due to the lack of director's), I am very entertaining in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I am trying to get my hands on a cut in a few stages for this period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
