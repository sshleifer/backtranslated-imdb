I started watching the posters and I am happy to hear it soon after talking about this film. The Matrix is ​​amazing and I could not wait to see the second one, after I started looking at the trailers at other movies. Nevertheless, when I saw, the theater was very disappointed, and there were many movies in the theater along with me. Though the action sequences in the film are always astonishing, they are very few. In the very first film, there appears to be a continuous struggle, but the latter takes too much (and very unfortunate) audience view. For the whole of the plot, there is not much to do with the unexpected. The machines were dug to Xian (intended not to be a spoiler, but everyone in advertising) in order to destroy the machines. The dialogue of the film is totally horrific. Unless you are a psychologist, you can not understand much of what you say in the movie and do not just care. It became a romantic film with the appearance of events and events of the lives of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, he seemed to get all religious and preachy, for the evil ass as in the first film. Personally, I do not have to pay to hear or hear about it. This film is confusing my time, and I do not think I can see anymore first. The dialog and continuous boring and dry monologues from each character have quickly lost interest in the movie and the little fighting scenes are close to the edge for me, and the end of the film shoved me right off. What film ends "end up"? How is that original? I wondered if Wachowski's brothers would eat midnight oil. In the end, the movie is evil and it is the end.
