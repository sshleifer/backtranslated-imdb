Oliver Gruner I'm not fully aware of. My friend showed me that he saw Gruner, he was a pretty good science fiction movie called Nemesis. As we have seen, we have found that BS drama has reached reliable action scenes through parts. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! <br /> <br /> Granery's role is a graduate student who has forced him to stay close to a grown up. He really meets the boy he's living with. The Mexican gang is hurting his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (very crazy against a gang). <br /> <br /> Gruner plays the role of a special Van Damme who kills everyone (or worse for them), and the Gang works to break his block of members. <br /> <br /> The plot is very cheesy and easy to think. Gruner probably does not know much about picking up his script if there is anything to compare the possible options for the film. This ghetto is pure hell and the colorful crew of the characters goes through it if I have a chance against the character of Granner. Music is a simple noise music (which uses piano and timpaneye, the use of swollen guitars), which is not really unreleased. <br /> Lastly, I gave a 4/10 because it really was an average action movie starring Oliver Gruner, but wanted to close the whole story of what you saw.
