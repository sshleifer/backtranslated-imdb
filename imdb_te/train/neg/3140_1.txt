I would probably think about the new Star Wars film, "Phantom Menace", if it apologizes, when it comes to a totally devastating box, it will leave the "Titanic" water out of the office receipts, and thereby lose the number one. Every time I hear someone "Titanic" is a great movie they have ever seen, I think, "You can not watch many movies, will you do it?" What a mockery. <br /> <br /> "Titanic" is a lot better than 50 images, and you can do the same price tag. <br /> <br /> "Spike Girls, billions and billions of people will eat at McDonald's, but this is not high quality, yes, millions of Elvis fans are wrong." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' It is true that the "Phantom Menace" is likely to be fatal. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is a serious A cheesy action film which is radically shredded in a split piece b) The three-hour epic is the best moments given away in the trailer c) Faith or entertainment F) is a very sensitive love story d) The documentary members are good and I have enjoyed it e) The film with the pride of a true shroud f) The 3-hour theft I have never come back, so there is great inspiration for a time machine. When I meet people who have not seen me, I say, "I want to be able to trade with you." g) A real slap in the face of any real victim to hypothermia. Do you believe how long will cold cold water sink and still make meaningful sentences? h) Fortunately a film was not recognized for any acting success in the Oscars. i) techniques in filmmaking and a little else. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to hear the reflection of thirteen thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans because of what I posted it as an anonymous comment. I'm not really interested in listening to the defense of the Titanic story, acting or length.
