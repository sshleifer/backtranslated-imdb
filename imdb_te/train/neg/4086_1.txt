I got this film with high expectations. I learned about Greenway's work and 'The Tempest', which is of interest to me. I first wanted to switch off after about ten minutes, but I thought it was unfair. There is a storm representing it, but in your mind you roar a little boy in a toy boat? What does this mean? I continued to bump into my wait 'off' button for another ten minutes, somewhere to my interest. It's not Shakespeare, it's not a movie. There is time and place for it, but I do not waste my time and Shakespeare does not have it in my studies. Twenty five minutes later I gave up and it's ending. I have read all the comments on this website and the image's pride is enough with its counterparts. 'Its painting ..... then put it in a gallery', 'This is a ballet ..... then put on stage'. Shakespeare can make smart and play a mass audience, and they can access this version to help keep a split between Shakespeare and the general population - and I do not think Bard will be happy.
