I am currently the current A.S.L. Student and this film were forced to watch in class, and there was a blatant partisan involved in the film I got out of. The picture is clearly visible to P.O.V. "Common Deafness" is not their middle class. In addition, the film does not mention or take into account other conditions in the discussion on this topic. I.E. The deaf gave birth to deaf and deaf. Is that the right or wrong? Deaf w / a Capital "D" view is partly biased and realistic. It's not bad, but it should try a little unbiased for the true documentary film.
