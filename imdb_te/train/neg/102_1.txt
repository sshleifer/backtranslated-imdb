My girlfriend brought us around zombie chronicles to see it as a joke. The joke is on her for Â£ 1 payment for it. When looking at this film I started to come up with things that would rather be doing than watching zombie chronicles. <br /> 1) drinking bleach 2) rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) American Civil War 5) Tax Revenue 6) GCSE Mathematics 7) Sex with an old woman. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Swarz. Ben Draper wrote this? The person can not properly dig a hole. The best tinging door he was doing was the door door (the best part of the movie). So far the worst picture I've ever seen, and I've seen the Light: White Noise. Never made mistakes in error. <br /> <br /> News: Owen Wilson saw the film and tried to kill himself. <br /> Do not watch
