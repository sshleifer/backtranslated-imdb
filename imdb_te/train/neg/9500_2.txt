This image is very bad. Unlike Michael Ironside, this character is terrible. I can not get the story. Richard Griocock is the only survivor of the two meganges. He is coming to a town and suddenly he is selected to fight the bad people who seek Indian-Land. <br /> <br /> In this film, a bad actor is an Indian, who brought his hometown back home. Stiff and ugly. He also said his lines. And we can not talk about Sean Young, she's not one of my favorite actors, but she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Greary). <br /> <br /> "When I rented her, I chose Amanda Paes to be between this and the Sabarfujah, in the cast of Michael Ironside <br /> <br /> I do not see it unless I feel rude on motorbike with sunglasses <br /> <br /> I'm in the house soon after I saw the movie. Asanu.
