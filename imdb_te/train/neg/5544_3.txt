While the film is definitely a bad image of a bad movie, it is surprisingly awesome at many levels. First, it is interesting to see the main character played by Dean Jagger (in relation to the old) for older movie fans. After Jagger he played a very dignified role as an assistant actor (most of the 12 Oscars for Oscars in this category), where he is really full of hair and his performance is really unique (I did not see him in this way) and he is the worst actor in the film . The film shows that if an actor does not act in his earlier films, it does not mean that he has not learned as a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is that Paul Newman, whose debut film (The Silver Chimes), is considered to be one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to see this movie is that it's all sharpened. Writing is bad, acting is good and special effects are bad. For example, when jagger and unnamed Cambodian water are being lit, they are really just walking in the open space and the background is lagging behind. Plus, once they leave the water, their clothes are 100% dry! Harrid continuity and deliberately widespread across the bad dialogue film - it is hard to imagine why they did not star in the film Bela Lugosi or George Zuckko - both of which had a lot of Grade-Her horror films. <br /> When giving it a 3, it is a bit over-generous, it is fun to laugh. And a look for small movie fans is valuable.
