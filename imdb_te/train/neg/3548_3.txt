For those who love movies that are discouraged with lethargic characters and unhappy heroes, it's for you! From the dark New York City climate, it is a real flaw to the two different mainstream characters, which are not the most horrible and almost helpless area of ​​morality. <br /> <br /> Why was the Academy Award winning because it was so surprising at that time in Hollywood that it wanted freedom to show anything that wanted to abandon all ethical codes and to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers were at the age of six at the expense of the cost of the local candy store. So, only the theatrical audience (probably for the first time) has been the task of rape, adultery, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness and other amazing scenes and sounds. <br /> <br /> I decided to shock the mainstream audience. Well, it succeeded at that level. The spectators were surprised by what they said and heard and the academy, presenting profanity and making money at the same time, but the gold gilded garbage did not give the honor to this piece. Forty years ago, as a teenager, I also found this film lovely. However, in 1990 I could not see such a bad taste in my mouth again. <br /> Acting is very good, but what is it? Acting is good in many films. No one ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Woyt could not perform. Hoffman has been outstanding in his short days. He played the roles of "Ritso Rizzzo" in the film, a genus of Johnny Dept, and later "Rain Man". Yes, "Rosso" you should never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Wait) wants you to forget, but the story is very dirty, it surpasses good performance. The film is not "art" and is not suitable for many of its awards; It only brought out a large armor in 1969, and so it was remembered in movie people and critics' hearts. <br /> I'm two hours obsessive and ultra-shameless, religious cheap shots, special weirdos (Andy Warhol also practiced - no surprise), and usually baseless persons. <br /> <br /> "I liked the song that was impressive, and everyone was talking to" Harry Nilsson, but it was also Bogas because Fred Neil wrote this song and sung it well, Nielsen did ... and some Neil <br /> <br /> The film is a milestone, but in the negative sense, I'm scared: it's "officially" to Hollywood's Toilet Douña It has gone, and since then has been in sewage.
