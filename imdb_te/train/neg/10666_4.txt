I'm a big 1930s movie fan and I see a lot of things I see in Turner Classic Movies, something new to me. So I gave this shot, which was competing with Chaplin as the great movie comedian after the great Harold Lloyd. I saw little of Lloyd's silent movies of chaplin, but I told Chaplin fan very big. However, I have a lot of information that I did not complete this film. I can understand why his sound career is very limited, he's not getting a good thing to work with. If you make boxing spoils (or usually torture) in Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Louise, Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, this is very unforgettable. I really enjoyed Adolf Menzow in Glory Paths, but his role here is also interesting for me. Perhaps they should have gotten boxing in advance because he got at least one half of the film (at least it seemed) before he gets in a ring. I can tell you here that Lloyd has a lot of fans and this is not a popular review but I compared it to what I did not out there from time 10 to 4. You do not see anyone trying to see this old movie, they can not see someone else with you, too flat. I usually recommend that anyone who likes this will usually make a difference or generally "Kolli the Second" a few years ago and the other is in the role of a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and Charles Chase. These are shown in Turner Classic Movies channel.
