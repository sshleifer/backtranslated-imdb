This is probably the worst Christmas film ever. This plot does not exist and acting (especially Affleck) is the best. Ben Affleck fans probably preserve the movie, but they agree well. The plot I acquired is that Ben Affleck, a Millionaire trader, is going to be remembered for his childhood and disclosing a list of things that he wants to forget from his childhood. This work ends up paying his family for Christmas to his family ... and that's it. The film continues and finally he gets together with the family daughter .... blah blah blah.
