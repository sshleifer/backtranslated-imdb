I saw this movie under the title "Tide Up". I enjoyed the dolph movies in general, and hence gave me this effort. It's not worth it. The box has read some of the previous comments about lovely viewers. Do not be fooled. This film is the best. Acting is missing. The plot is minimal, very imaginable. The film is slashed in places. It just stinks the plain space. Cheap night rental price is not worth it too. Just a dolph fan, I'm waiting to see him in action. At the end of the film, you will still have to wait. This film is best to avoid, and spend your time watching almost anything.
