Time wasted time spent watching this movie. I do not like science fiction. I can not deny any kind of being able to do any kind of good work. This movie is not a good job. I was not wrong with the visuals (when the alien included makeups), and the special effects were impressive. The story did not come out for a Trekkie comic book. But FX visuals are clear when all the designers' interest / attention / money went. The alternating between a slow and confusing direction (one sure and to whom and at least one crucial situation). "Acting" is mostly bad. "It's on the page and the director thinks I'm mad / sad / scared / it's ok, it's the SF series pilot When I'm in a dramatic medium, I'm surprised to have sold the pilot series, or even in the hands of technicians ?
