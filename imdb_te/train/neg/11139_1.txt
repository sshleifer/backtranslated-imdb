<br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue is not good, the story of the hybrid wolf is not well explained and not the whole thing. There are plot holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI does not want to see you. This is irrelevant as it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on DVD is in extras. Gag reel. Everything else, just waste time and money. I believe that no one has bought it, it is not a rental. <br /> <br /> Get away from this.
