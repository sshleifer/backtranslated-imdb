I've seen "El Vitro". He always took my hat for Joni Chavez's performance, he was a great actor, but the film was really discouraging and slow. I guess Julio would not have been worse. However, I would advise you not to understand it, even if it's not from Argentina, and that your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friend can not rent a movie to get good time together. ... It's really discouraging and very slow and the plot does not make sense. Probably the director wanted to show the vulnerability of human life, but what he was doing and the viewers make you look a little shocked by the viewers. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely do not like this film.
