'Iderein Baromed' has everything we expect directly from the video-movie. This is the story about a man who believes that his daughter is a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. Some people are kidnapped and able to do a simple plan. The problem with the image is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything must be funny, but it is not. It is frivolous and clumsy, the characters are frustrating and the final-scene is complete without climax or emotion. The last sequence is perhaps the only scene you'd like to smile, but the whole set-up is curious.
