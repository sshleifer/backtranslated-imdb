<br /> <br /> I read the original short story to find out all the literary points that I made wrong, so I can not go down that path. <br /> <br /> But I have learned a while ago that Stephen King films are not just horror movies but with some exceptions. This is not one of them. Fred Gwynne is amazed, I'm going to complain about acting. Once I'm here for the story, I do not forgive the whole shortage of parenting skills. <br /> <br /> But I could not help, there was a constant point of frustration. And the film finally got pretty close, and at least 2 characters partook of dumb stupidity. There are moments I see: there is a little zombie running around the house. You doubt under the bed. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> <br /> If you go a little bit from the bed, you can go down from the level of security to the open end, or at least the slightest fear coming to you, ) I feel like I'm giving myself a slaughter today. <br /> <br /> Very much cinematic but not very scary.
