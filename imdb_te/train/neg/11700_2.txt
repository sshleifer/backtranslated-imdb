I'm really looking forward to seeing this film, but I'm really disappointed by it. Stephen King is the best of it. Robert John Berk can not work to save his life and no one else can do it. Some of the performances also made me laugh out loud! The film is not as I imagined, it was awesome after reading it, and I imagined it was dark and very scary. <br /> If I'm Stephen, I'm really mad. <br /> I do not know why they changed the end. If you just kill your daughter, will you eat it? <br /> The book is very good!
