Do not get other critics' opinion about the Japanese whale industry (which is, morally, American meat trade or worse than Scottish haggis bull), which guffs-up-its own-back gafe that brings together a gorgeous tash modern art. There are some amazing pictures, but there are amazing pictures on the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so this is not the reason to go and go nonsense. The film is very slow and often sounds like a cat with soundtrack, and starts again and again when you think it's done. I viewed it in an obscene film in Rome, which was featured on weekends to perform Barney's film works, which was once an amazing and intelligent way to return from the rare old-men-mock-to-local spy. Brigade, but sophisticated young things and little old-beard-stroking If Bizor fans should be honest, everyone can have a lot more fun if they think it's just a sexy one!
