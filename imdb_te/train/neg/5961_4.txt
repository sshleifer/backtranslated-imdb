It was in the 88s with slazars, so it was time to break up the old films. The brain is well done, the script reminds me of Videodrome's but in a more cheesy way as mentioned earlier.

It can be seen for all the tremors out there and it does not have any gore and blood is not there but nakedness for hypocrisy is going to be. I have seen bad movies than this, and they wanted to make it bloody ...
