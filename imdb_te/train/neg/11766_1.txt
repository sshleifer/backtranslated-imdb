It's hard to know what the quest starts, because I start with problems with books. Alexander McCall Smith does not read them for detective stories, but an African who does not exist has made it a deeply veiled and completely fake perspective. <br /> <br /> Previously, Mam Ramotswe starred as Mam Ramotswe. If she represents the land that is not African, how good is a black woman who is not African? She is not only American for actors; Mika Makutsi Anika Noni played by Rose. Two women are very young, they are very young, and very attractive to the characters they play. Both of them were murdered by local tunes, and both were focused on this cruelty that led to full action. Scott's MMA Ramotswe is bouncy, beautiful and soft. Rose's MMA Makutsi is an annoying motor-bitchless bitch. <br /> The result is almost invisible. The main cast is only redefined by the existence of Lucian Msamati, who turns in a good performance by Mr JLB Matekoni. Hes came out smarter and more intensely than books, but I can not blame Mummies - he is the light in the Saki Sea. <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing is always bad and bad. He refuses to edit. As a result, his book has experiments in grammar, which are the characters that change the name of the border and the boundaries. Hence the writing team has become worse in this project. <br /> The conversation is now much English. The characters speak of "opening" and "sensitivity to needs". Mama Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni openly flirt. <br /> <br /> MMA McCuashi does not have a computer, but she is constantly given hair, makeup and jewelry from time to time, and she is surprised that she will not have a handbag MacBook along with her Visa card. <br /> Do we leave here? It's hard to worry with this crappy adaptation because it's honest, things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway anyway. Makkal Smith is a fictional botswana filled with beautiful, frightening black people, full of fun and intelligent knowledge-nuggets. It reads well despite the language mockery, but some people have a focus on what the white people have about blacks. <br /> <br /> "Even the European and American viewers may even notice.
