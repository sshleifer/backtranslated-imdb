I saw this at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. We decided to check this one so the essence in the festive guide sounded pretty good. I'm sorry to say that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> For poor writing, it is boring. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of the cast because they can not do much with this unfortunate script. <br /> <br /> The first bite is ridiculous, with the film Hunt's campy horror feel better. Instead he took himself seriously and it resulted in a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. It is very long and strong in everyone.
