Warning spoiler. . . I agree with you, it's almost there. Such a bad movie about such a real and interesting true story. It's such a promise, but acting is ridiculous at best. Some sets are beautiful and realistic. Others are one of a theme park. As I have seen, I've laughs, suppose serious scenes. I really wanted to like this film, but I could not. The best part is the fight between friends who ended with death "King". I liked the punishment of Queens. And, the last shot, however, made a beautiful picture. There are very good movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
