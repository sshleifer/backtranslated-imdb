Great Western I hear you hear all! Bright first effort! Well I'm not sure all the image you've seen but the one I've seen should be different. Great Western or any kind of good movies are the characters that you like and there is no movie! The acting was poorly understood and I could not care less about the characters, the whole movie did not understand. The story makers are very big and maybe you should try their hand straight to the low-budget trash of TV, as you see in the "Fact or Fiction" programs in Science Fiction. <br /> Please look for a good picture, a great Western or a fun hour and a half, please see elsewhere.
