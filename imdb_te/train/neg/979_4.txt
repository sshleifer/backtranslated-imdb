Anyone with a remote interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone has the best sci-fi movies of STAR Wars and STAR Trek, but this is not the best factor the The Terminator and the film, Soyland Green, are far better choices than this series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept science of fiction. It remains one of the biggest and most forgotten films, but the effect of its arrangement is becoming more realistic on every passing day. Charlton Heston overgraduates his role, and it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his last role, will make anyone more SOYLENT GREEN than anyone and touch his final scenes. <br /> <br /> In Manhattan, in 2022, the world revolves around and the food is an unbelievable wealth (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). <br /> <br /> Seyland's company has been murdered by a large executive and is in the police detective Thorn case. <br /> <br /> If you research on the film, the silly green secret is no secret. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay joke. It's just as cheap as the whole product. Actors' screenplay and over-the-drama have been made and are still full of happiness. Everyone has a moron and nobody knows the rules, especially the thorn who likes waltz into the apartments of people, scrutinizes around the scandal and steals anything he wants. Keeps your focus on the role of the character, but it is still known to be SOYLENT GREEN SUCKS. If you have time to be happy, do not expect more.
