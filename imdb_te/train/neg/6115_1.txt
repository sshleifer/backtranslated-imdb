The role of Tarzan is subject to many clues and many bad commentaries, who have hoped for a different kind of version (like me, people like Tarzan books as a child and always wanted to know this book has just published a booklet). <br /> <br /> The son of a Marooned English Noble Dealer, the tribe of monkeys who want to raise him, took their death after the death of Tarzan 's M - cinematic images, Christopher Lambert and Christopher Lambert with Disney animated Edgar Rice Burrough, And "Lord of the Jungle" is more common than the ordinary Hollywood wild-man And its trademark, his abusive inability to speak English, has long been exposed to his strength, heroism, his strength, heroism, etc. The two characters are common and the fact that Tarzan is the wife and they both have a wife named Jen. Ron Ely's TV version is compromised: Burroughs As a character, he speaks in good English, and James Bond is happy with both cultures and is not Lord Greystoke and Jane. + Well, the film belongs to the third category of Tarzan films, and this is terrible because I hope it will remain a category. This category uses the character as a vehicle for smooth romance, for all things. Jane, who acted legally bad actor Bo Derek, was delighted to see his father, who did not mix the woods looking for what his father did not know. Although her father had long dreamed of, she seemed to be inadequate. Richard Harris as the father is the best thing here; He sees the film is stupid and is hamming in a way he reminds me of fun ostentatiously and the deliberately silly appearance of Peter O'Toole in What's New Pussycat. To his daughter, his daughter, and his daughter, he disagrees with his daughter ("a ghost or a soul" as he says - stolen, or attempt to worship King Kong). Shortly after, we heard Tarzan Illy's infamous clich√©. Dad dies, which does not make his dedicated daughter very difficult. <br /> <br /> Then Tarzan appears, but nothing. In fact, he said nothing during the whole movie. He and Jane fell in love, and they do not wear doggreel love poetry almost off the screen when reading. End. This is the same plot. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; Tarzan also has a scene that is unnecessarily struggling with the Boya Constrictor - the exceptional boy, the only tragic ever seen. Jane will heal this bite with the aid of a cloth that helps to cut the tear to cut the tear to the eye (I'm not making this!), And many of the excuses that she should take her clothes. <br /> <br /> "Let's see ... well, the film is unfair to criticize the film, as we all know that the Onangutans are not in Africa; after all, Classic Tar (But in that case why hell she does not just make the career as an art model? It 's plain boring to see a beautiful woman when it' s about an image What should I say? I actually did not show her a punch either positive or negative.) But now I'm Hincanu: I try as much as I mugincalenu positive note. <br /> <br /> If you have a bad image of the pub to see this movie. I'm here.
