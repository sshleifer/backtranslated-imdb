DEATHSTALKER B-Fantasy is perfect for movie fans; This film can be heard by every hecklers for a 80-minute film production - but unavailable, awkward acting (save for at least a sound-noisy old lady), ridiculous scripting and sculk editing and bargain-basement style background settings. There are no preferred or interesting characters (especially, nothing more appealing to him as the main character), and the actors can not do anything to climb the F-grade material. If that does not fit, DEATHSTALKER is not about a lack of structured plot (not what the film is like) to qualify as a major turkey? I also suffered that women in this film serve no purpose than just 1) without being and / or scantily wearing; 2) rape; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) All above. In addition, the background music is bizarre; Electric noise, cheesy coral bursts, and blazing orchestral cacophony's bizarre mess. One thing to keep in mind is that the ear filled with dreams and the eye look at everything and see Deathstalker laughing well (and believe me, that's plenty here). Otherwise, I do not like this 100th grade CONAN at least.
