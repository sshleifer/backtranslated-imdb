I read reviews that clearly show that in the 1960s it is a very difficult, a student in British school. Perhaps this is true, but this movie is old. <br /> <br /> ************* Spoiler Aller ************** ************* <br/> <br/> <br/> Yes, the main characters can leave, but they will not do. The reasons they go about do not make sense. Not enough character to explain why. The firing of any innocent people can not be understood or explained. <br /> <br /> The war is said to be the final creative expression, which contain the roles of the film and this is no sense. <br /> <br /> In the murder case, the characters are not in the fight, they are just killing people. <br /> <br /> "This is a baby's day-to-day fighting against the power of the film plagues, It does not mean symbolic truth or its meaning; <br /> <br /> It's a rational and clever way to fire a murdered rampage / school like Columbine or Virginia Tech. You're like me and you're working to make life instead of "man" (much neglect of the film), which is childhood and embarrassment. <br /> /> You may also be aware of the lack of funding, and the story seems to have a touch of defective deficit errors. <br /> <br /> All in all, okay cinema, Log dialog, character development, no effort is not sufficient ... it is morally right or not. <br /> <br /> I'm going to get my two hours back.
