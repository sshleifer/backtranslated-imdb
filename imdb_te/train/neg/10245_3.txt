I guessed alot from this movie. Like Kinta, it looks like Nostradamus like me, but instead is the time and boring movie I get. I can not even explain this movie. It has a terrible script, acting on trees from pieces from the Bible, such as storm, tides, waves and earthquakes. But that's at the end! The rest of it just meant I had to understand and that something could come out but it was not. This film is about a couple trying to get to know about places like China, earthquakes, and eight nuns and places in China at a priest-administered convent. The convent starts. The whole movie is disappointing and boring. Lace is one of the worst.
