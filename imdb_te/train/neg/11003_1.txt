How do I start? This film is perhaps one of the worst films I 've ever seen .It has no redeeming qualities .I sat through this movie and it was a struggle. I did not get the same smile on my face. Anyone will distribute this terrible film. I thought this film was a failed attempt at untold humor. The soundtrack is only valuable for this movie, and I'm pretty sure it's the reason I want to see the film in the first place. I'm going to have time to try and forget that I wrap this wasted with this piece of garbage. I will leave you with this warning. Do not watch this film, IT SUCKS.
