I'm not sure how I relate, but I'm almost sure that the movie Last and Delicious is a remake of the film (or based on that story). A similar storyline and sequences and scenes are quite similar. <br /> <br /> The film moves very slowly, but at the end of the 60s is the French film, which is an assessment of style. It is said that one of the girls who are reconstructed in school is reconsidered from the perspective of one. The previous edition of the current scenes with the current scenes was initially a bit confusing, especially audio from each overlapping (ie, glasses heard at present and vice versa). Moreover, "girls" are a bit older than they think are in a boarding school. Finally, not too much character development will be added to the movie.
