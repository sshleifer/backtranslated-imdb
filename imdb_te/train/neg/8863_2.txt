The first film (1985) was completed 180 of the first film. The first film was campy and creepy. The second is shameless and cheesy. The production values ​​on this are very bad and acting outrageous. From him the brother of the proverb, 'wants to know what happened to his sis. The "scenery" was created from the first movie. (Rebe Brown), who is a skinny looking woman (Romania) to uncover the mystery of his sister's murder / transition / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears and is a sage / guide of both. Cybill Dancing and her two biggest possessions appear to be Romanian head Wolf, Stirla. <br /> She suffers in the evil of the morning face, <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing better about this stinker. I'm surprised by Philip Morra's film because he's usually a good filmmaker. The film is dark, it requires a flashlight to watch (not content but cinematic stock). To close the movie you get a lousy "punk" presentation from a donand vanabe "Babel". <br /> <br /> If you are disappointed or have lost the remote, you have to change the very thick channel.
