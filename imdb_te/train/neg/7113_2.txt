The film has some pretty cool early credits (a screenwriter warns that film patrons can be freely buried if the film is horrified, pool and ubiquitous scary music), but sadly, the film is all downhill from there. A widow takes her new bride to her lonely mansion ... warns her servants and friends that the new Mrs. had a very vulnerable character due to a tragedy in her past. Well, at any time she no one can see and hear those mysterious things. Her husband says that it's just everything in his mind and that he can guarantee everyone ... You probably see that it's all going away. You can find out what you are doing before our unlucky leader ... You can see a plain plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows because (and very well done). To include a number of violations of the film, many of the film's cuts (many of the cheap DVD DVD compilations) will escape some key scenes. You walk the window up slowly ... she goes to open it ... you know that she's going to see something scary ... Suddenly the scene covers her husband's hands. So what did she see ??? I guess we never know.
