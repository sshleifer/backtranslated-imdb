I love Deauer in the Series Noire. His talent is trivial in "The Waltzers" or "Going In Places". Well, it's flaunting meeting guys in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; Many such behavior is entertaining. It's a boring, nonsense exercise designed for shock. I find the smirk on Blier's face, face behind the camera, annoying. Series Noir is a valid expression of personal freedom and sexual behavior. From the first moment we'll be spending time for a couple of hours we get an idea of ​​bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero when we see Patrick Dewaere leaping in too much. We have a white warning that we'll be two-hours soul-drying spending time with these chaps "look elsewhere" look good chasing middle-aged male with luck with his buddy Depardieu. I also embarrassed a "3" for this annoying distraction.
