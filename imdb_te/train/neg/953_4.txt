"Happy Go Lovely" is only two things. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. It is the British (Excelsior Films) version of a M-G-M music composed of second-class stars. I'm thinking that Vera-Ellen will eventually lead this role to a leading musical actor. <br /> <br /> With the opening of a terrible Scottish number and removing the dialogue that fears the next dull tune, the film is very heavy hand sloppy. The imaginative error is that the identification plot is too thin and David Niven, Cesar Romero (the producer is the top player in his role) and Bobby Howes (who are completely wasted in the role) do not forget the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives her. She is not well known for many of the other music actors (and she is not singing, although she does not star in many of the films "Dancing Stand", but if she does dance, it's just a star, she's shining, <br /> <br />
