Dave goes through the divorce and his mind goes back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I must say he fixates the last girlfriend. When the relationship ends, he recalls. Dream sequences do not have cloud transitions. He recalled their favorite songs and places they went to love. I am not a councilor, but is it anything with a failed marriage? Dave goes to a supporting group and a woman meets her half (divorced), instead of "brutal" with her brutality, showing interest in him. How did i say creepy dave? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He walks his hands while he is walking. It's just weird. With a very long story short, Dave plot has to kill Mary and kill her ... wrong ... I face her. He's going to do that. It's really creepy. He believes that she will marry her, and she runs halfway across the country to meet her. Before she falls on her wager her home to make sure she is alone. He ends up sharing the Gospel of Christ with 10 words or less and returns to a new young friend. We enjoyed the movie more for the humorous value. I'm still entertaining my wife with my Dave seals ... "I heard another Dave & Mary song!"
