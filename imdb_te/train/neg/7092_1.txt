<br /> <br /> This movie (the movie - clearly recorded in the lower-cam cameras) may be one of the greatest cinematic stalk-bombs in history. Caution: Packaging promotes the image as a sex exploration of this sex-addiction. The movie is not something to search for, and it is more romantic than watching a personal warts. The script is meaningless and melding, with all the plot elements serving segways between sex scenes that are considered. However, sex scenes are also lame inexhaustible. Except for the first, they will be three seconds long (again, perhaps my version is cut) and tired of humor. <br /> If you are looking for a good image, you do not like it. If you're looking for a sex-flick that you set up, you do not like it. Whatever your goals, desires, or attitudes of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. Rosaan Arquette, Natashaia Kinski and Ed Begley, how hard it is to act in this stunt bomb.
