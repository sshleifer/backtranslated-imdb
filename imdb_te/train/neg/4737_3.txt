I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I saw various Mrs. Yuto in her TV shows and saw Samurai and Nina Flicks my fair share. <br /> <br /> After casting and setting up the film "Azumi", the film is much better with the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 "and it seems less impressive. <br /> <br /> It does not say that it's a total loss, some of the best fight scenes and some over-the-top characters .Unfortunately, Shuccu Cancio The film suffered from the general realities of Kaujari Reihei Ketumura and Ios Kiyyama, and the latter two really took over the experience of "manga" on their map, but in the past it was "much to come."
