The image is bad. There is nothing special - it's just a kid with no serious stuff. There is a reason to see this topic: animal discussion. Some of them are so much fun what they are saying, you can not stop laughing. If you want to hear a dog saying that I'm saying "I'm Killer Sozz" or "You're Dead Cat Walking" or talking to many other funny liners. It's not a good movie to see. Vote: 10 to 4.
