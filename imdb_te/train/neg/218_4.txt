*** Light Spoiler Warning *** The story is good and if you read the novel, then you're probably looking forward to a deep and intense movie that can give you some insight into some of the interesting and unrelated human relationships. The truth is, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast will fail very badly. Maria is dying because she does not have any feelings, her most intense movements are almost joking.

I'm very sorry to spend money on the ticket, I'd rather watched from the comfort of my room.
