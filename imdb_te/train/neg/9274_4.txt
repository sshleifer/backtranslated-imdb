This sequel is the first cinematic rhythm of the first film. Totally nonsense image. This was primarily taken for each of the first film of Syrriyarion, and they repeated this in Oman IV, except for a male antagonist. It ends in the same way as the first! The music is very busy and interferes, and is pretty much a replica of Oman I, this is very imaginable. It's not a terrible film, it's not made terrible, there are so much worse movies, this is exactly what exactly is doing. Omen remake since 2006 has been much worse, more understandable than this, so I guess I have it. If someone shows you a gun on your head and you have to choose to see this sequel or 2006 reamke, I will choose this.
