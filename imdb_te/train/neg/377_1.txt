Do not even ask why I watched it! I'm ill with bronchitis and I'm very weak to change the channel. :) It's the words horrible, bronchitis, the picture. The performance was unfortunate, Richard Griocock called it a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer, with a tendency to get out of the cops. Nick Mancosso's phones acted as police on his pedestal, and Nancy Allen played the only sympathetic character in the whole movie. The script is tedious, picked up with clichard lines, "Are you ready, pardner?" Purch Richard Griey for each of his victims. Tyr. Avoid.
