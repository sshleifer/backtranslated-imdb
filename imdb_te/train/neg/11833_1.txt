So do not even think about renting out of these stores, because it's a hell of a bad movie. This film is by JJ. You feel like Abrahams wrote. Basically, a rat washed down the toilet and something was getting back. Perhaps the most terrible "Shrek" fans will enjoy, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans may have been frustrated. Also, why are they not in plastic or mud? I mean, CGI animation ?? For an Armarman movie ?? Apparently, Aardman lazed around while they let the whole thing in DreamWorks. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every single character is awful, rather than a freaky frog guy who is just right for a villain. But the rest of the movie is about DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I saw this movie and fell asleep with boredom. No, actually, I was sleeping bored looking at this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately, this is not as bad as "Shrek".
