If you make a mistake in watching the movie before reading the book, please do not give in the series. I bought the first book in my book in May of this year, already in 10 of the book. I am so keen that the film does not make the worst piece of nakedness of justice. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Not that Rafford has ever worked, "Back to back: This film" follows the story of "Vamenda Behind" (book). His feelings for Hottie (when he was informed of his disappearance); Buck Williams is a blonde fur, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is in Stanford, and many of the details of the book are wrapped up by Rafford if she 'survived'; Buck and Chloe do not meet for a long time after a meeting in New York, set up by Hatty; Irene and Raymes 'book' never existed, but rather in Redford's pseudo-thinking; The roads are so jam packed with wrecks after the rapture that the helicopter back to the suburbs of Rayford and Hatty ... etc, etc ... and it's just from the first movie; They are about to be released third. Please, if you do not like movies, give the book line a chance.
