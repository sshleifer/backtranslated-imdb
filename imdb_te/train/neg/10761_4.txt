This movie is a mess. It has the best worst editing I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The writers were almost like the end of the scene that would go to commercial, and added a second in the black screen to fulfill the dreams of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> <br /> Glimmer something better in the worst direction and compilation. Good idea, compelling spark. <br /> <br /> This story is about a partial-minded priest who is trying to solve the murders. Richard Greery is the first thing to bite to be a priest. Well the part does not call him a good priest and he succeeds very well. The second issue is Dennis Hopper's silly man. He always plays a crazy bad man. <br /> <br /> Oh, one thought has passed me, all of which is a serious and terrific album and attempted to recognize the confusion that the character of the disconnected plot (gee) has experienced. And they rolled back credits backwords to prove that it was contrived. <br /> <br /> Not a good sign for any movie
