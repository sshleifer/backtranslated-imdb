This is one of the worst films I've ever seen! There are people who leave the theater, others fall asleep (ok, it's a nighttime performance) ... It's a nonsense movie, one of those who want to see you again from the main movie. I am very interested in what I'm doing in the minds of such worst writers. Do they feel laughing or wondering if they create these ridiculous things? I'm surprised ... this soundtrack is separate from a few instrumental remixes of the previous Bazorch album. If you're a fan of Bizoker music, stay home. This is the best thing. Small, small, nice music pieces are no reason to go out of you and submit this violence to yourself. God! ...
