SPOILERS. Strange people with generous taste reviewed the film. <br /> <br /> The script: Terrible. With Tom and Don "binding each other", banning movies, the debate clearly belongs to one person and I am the director, and he carefully worked his words to understand. At one time, Don asks, "Did you hear about the HIV virus?" <br /> Acting: White teeth and a chശിed face is not a sensitive actress. Speedman did well with what he gave, I think, but Marsden is terrible - his unbelievable, unbelievable, and bold and lively throughout his captivity. His appearance is empty (Interstate 60 can also be seen). <br /> Plot: Spare me! Half-flight moves are not thrilling, irritating and weak. Marsden is trying to keep the keys on the door and throws them down: "They do not work man!" Tee-hee. And beware of semi-black and white flashbacks, which have started some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime plays. <br /> <br /> All in all, the most dangerous, the bad and the objectionable is the most important, which is a homosexual (external or internal, you decide) in a picture that HIV is considered a weapon. Tom said that the condom could be pulled or it did not use it - Tom, where are they when they are in sex? <br /> <br /> There is some antagonism of the commonly inserted partner as homophobic villaining. <br /> <br /> Total: Beware!
