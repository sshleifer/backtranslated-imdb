Max V-8, Trace (the last and only hero of the wheels) has a jet engine on the back of his car, making unexpectedly humorous faces, such as rockets around a partially desolate wasteland. <br /> <br /> The Mad Max 2 (known as The Road Warrior) was astonished as a new film, despite being underscored by bad actors and lousy stunts. <br /> WOF after wasted land? Simple, The Road Warrior! Any questions can be asked: It's in the road warrior! Except for the actors who have changed from the original 60's The Time Machine film to actors to give a few minutes to cheer for audiences. <br /> <br /> The explosion in the big Billing explosion of all cars exploded by the huge boys of the typical 80s, kills or badly exploded. Inevitably all around the car will happen near the favorable cliff side and cars will surely come off them. This 80's cinematic ride is the simplest rampant fraud in this style of cheap film. Normally, I'm waiting for the trace's racquet car to speed up and shoot for the car, so he has another shot, he's got to be stiff because he hangs his face, which comes more and more to cover him. It's good to work with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Matte's Knights of Terror is improved. And in it and a lot of people are talking! According to these estimates, 2020 is a cinematography compared to Texas Gladiators Wheels of Fire. <br /> <br /> A bad street warrior is not enough cheese to make the movie viewable
