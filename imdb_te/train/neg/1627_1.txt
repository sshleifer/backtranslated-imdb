I reviewed videos for Joe Bob Briggs' legendary "Where Are the Wired". I've seen a lot of stinkers, but it's a lot worse, years have passed - this was an indiscriminate crime that I have ever done against movies. Do not stop me - CAGED Terrar is a more technically efficient way to say whether the monster A-GO-GO or the collecting hell or something in it. The worst movie of me all the time is its special blend of bare craftsmanship with creepy compasses to strengthen his argument. Is not it a Vietnam comment? An ecological protest racial uproar A study of man's inhumanity to man? Padding nature is a novel exercise (almost) feature length in the footage? In short: a young young urban expert (perhaps a very unpleasant screen role) persuades an Asian-American colleague in camping with him. Partially-philosophical clapping for an hour is part of the hammer, and they walk across the two revolving veterans, unforgettable Jarvis (brother-in-law) and trebbadour (rejecting Guitar-Mann Manson's family). Hey, a plot twist! Tension! Action! Suspense! Well, no, just a temporary-wire-chicken-coupon in a climatic get-lock and a lightly-belittled scene. At the same time, Jarvis Troubadour "every time" every two minutes to mind, Juan Porky's POD People's alien marten, as the victim in the question captures and listlessly stares at the lunches, "no ... not ... please ... no ..." Nothing too much. It's about all the things that happen in the CAGED terror, and such a summary probably looks almost rational. But believe me, I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I've seen it in the first eight years, which is absolutely worse. (I congratulate myself to pop up or assure me on the old VCR once every two years, and I'm sure you will be sure to reassure me.) This is a lot less because I hate the coger terra. It happens to be very slow and very slow, and really does make it compulsively unwatchable. Filmmakers really have a narrow feeling if you really want to shove your thumb down message kind. But because CAGED terror is so ineffective and inefficient, what is meant as a civics lesson crash course in serious view discomfort. This movie is 75 minutes long and three and a half hours. It's terrible, the truth is really terrible. Folks, believe me, and I have seen that I do not stand. Let's see! You say thank you. Curse me. Just for the record, my favorite line: (Yes, well, you probably have an illustration for the love of Christ for the Song of Solomon's Church ... ") (Perhaps in the carrot terrier but ever) (Note: the tone of collective satisfaction must be delivered in the tone.)
