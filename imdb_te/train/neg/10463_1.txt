This film is very promising. I'm excited about this movie. In the end, this is the best thing, the worst time is painful. Acting styles are really, really, from the flat (angels, wife and daughter) to the high-animated (Castper's character). I thought the conversation was an attempt to transfer information to audiences rather than real people trying to talk to each other. Special attention to the scene for "bug". It is very insulting to the ability of the audience to figure things out. In the scene of the scene, however, it was the biggest laughter of the whole movie. I read that they spent money traveling in different foreign places. Very bad people did not use it. I think I've been shipped to exotic locations. Stock footage of Coliseum in Rome can be added to anyone. However, the end of the positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics displayed on decoding computers. If the SCHMALTZ factor is very low, and the ACTION factor is greatly increased, this view is good (and that's it).
