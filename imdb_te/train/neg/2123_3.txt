I will go to UCSB and take some classes with Executive Producer Alison Anders. She was an amazing teacher and director so she thought she should be pretty good, anything that she named her. The film was a good choice as a selection option at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. <br /> <br /> There are some good shots and cinematography in the film, the story and the incomparable achievement that really took away from anything that it was trying to do. My main problem is this is the first picture of others and you can clearly tell. The bad acting and the worst screenplay of the film stalled. Soundtrack has some good music that has given the concept of the main characters, struggling to lead his departure and now to overcome the pain of returning to his place. Even though I have some of the cinematic talents of the cinema, it has to say that the lack of story and performance really resisted some good.
