"It seems that most critics have found injustice in the thought of Allen Drama." And for good reason: they are Bergman's unbearably wooden and pretentious simulations. And we are not a kid: critics have largely supported Alan's Bergman performances, but Allen's contradictory allegations are contrary. What I do not: why Alan generally praised his originality in imitating Bergmann, but contemporary Brian Dapalma was a classic for Hitchcock "hitting" in his suspense / horror films? At Robinwood's perspective, this is a strange cultural scorpion. I have to agree.
