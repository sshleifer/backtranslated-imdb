Now I'm not a film critic, but I really hate "September 11". This film is based on simple, bad. Alejandro Gonz√°lez is very effective and direct about this topic, except for the section of Innerite, short films are the most frustrating and most dangerous. In the dominant segment of USSaf Chahin, he compared American soldiers with Palestinian suicide bombs, and even worse in my mind that suicide bombers are fighting for more reasons. This section has become a topic of contention and I have no sense of what kind of chainin, the waste of my time and patience. The eleven different directors from different countries show their views in a tragedy that the film is good on the paper, but in practice, it's tastier.
