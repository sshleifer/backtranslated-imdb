Recently I saw the film in the Hallmark Channel. <br /> <br /> The story: A US soldier in Afghanistan received one of the Christmas cards sent to the US by a woman in the US. For Christmas. He was inspired by the Christmas card that he had given the rays of hope and pleasure in his life, an inspiration to continue. When he is given leave, he goes into the city where he lives in that woman. He finds that he and Spunky come to a young girl and send him a Christmas card. He encounters his family and his father (Vietnam War veteran) hit the car after crossing the car, and he decides to take him for a short time. We learn that the family did not return home. The soldier agrees to help the family members in the Christmas season by working with them in their logging company. The family loves him and vice versa. The soldier is in love with the family of the family - the woman who sent the Christmas card. There is only one problem. She already has a serious relationship with a man that she is in love with. It is also a distant relationship. The boyfriend is very different from the soldier. He prefers wines and journeys to France hard worker and great outdoors. The woman likes the next. In the rest of the time, there is a "love triangle" in the town where women's boyfriend visits him in the season. Every family in the family seems to want to be a soldier and the mother is basically good for her daughter. ** (spoiler warning) ** The soldier is more likely to be a soldier, they are very common. They happen to spend a lot of time together. She is gradually attracted to her person. Then one day she kisses and she kissing again. Now she's in chaos! She fell in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him one day, but she is very fond of her soldier. Immediately adequately, the boyfriend decides to propose the woman (kiss is unknown, but the woman is very protective and the soldier is trying to move on her) and agrees with her. However, his plans for their marriage are not the plans she wants. She wants to stay at home, have children and is close to her family. He travels the world, go to exotic places and he wants to take them along if they have kids. This is rare for a woman. However, the soldier feels bad about what he has done and does not want to make things worse. So, when he told his father to stay with his daughter and father, he decided to leave the city. When it comes to the Church's Christmas Eve service, the soldier is still missing, it all comes with a head. The boyfriend and the woman talk to each other and with the broken mind he decided to go with her and break her with her. <br /> <br /> Things I like: He is basically good and courteous with a strong sense of doing good to others; There are moments where the family goes to church and participates in charitable causes; Take a family and pray at an evening meal during the meal; Father and mother have a long and obviously healthy marriage; Sometimes the soldier tries to do the right thing in the situation. <br /> <br /> Things I do not like: The film has a very distinctive "love triangle" story; The soldier turns on the sour like he kisses slowly and deftly when she moves on the woman and when she's already a boyfriend; The family has appreciated this behavior - the family goes to church and participates in services, but how they work; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> > This film is very fast because I am long enough. So, some of the film started better with some gem moments, but also destroyed. Therefore, I do not recommend this film to anyone.
