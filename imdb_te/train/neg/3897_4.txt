Corridor Comedy I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall investigated unusual agricultural families in Maryland, who did not pay their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the cobbler who is increasing the pressure on the inexperienced taxpayer. Debbie certainly made the stake of inferior theatrical sitcoms in this period - and better or worse than this other person. The picture is bright and obscure, flags at half-point but the flags begin. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle also loses chemistry. H.E. Based on the novel "Darling Buds of May". Bates, a poor sound mix, makes all the actors sound in a resonating room. ** from **
