This is the most disturbing picture I have ever seen. This makes "Discrete for a Dream" a Disney movie. Technically, it is reasonably well-made, acting, cinematography, music, direction, etc. However, the closing gang rape scene was the most terrible and violent thing I've ever seen and I really do not see it. I'm afraid that my life will kill me. Though I would find someone in the film that is very concerned, some of my wife and her friends were victims and I really did not need a clear reminder of the horror they experienced. I watched the film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX and no cast or crew was present. I would have liked to have the opportunity to protect the violence in their film, which I felt was overwhelming, incomplete and unnecessary. The previous scenario was successful in expressing the mood that they apparently tried, but did not massage your face in serious and explicit sexual violence. This image should have a big warning label on it. For these reasons I do not recommend what I saw. You are alerted.
