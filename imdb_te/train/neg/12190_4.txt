Scorsese's worst one. Average thriller; This is the only thing to play in Dio Niro Psycho. Finally, this genre means one other, invincible, immune-to-pain villain. I did not like 60s and this version does not have much improvement. I do not know why Scorsese wasted his time in his remake. Then again, thinking about how bad it was for his recent films (I was with him his cuddly Buddhist film and his new favorite actress, the beautiful girl de Caprio) was not bad even with this comparison. And wanted to remake Spielberg ... could be very bad.
