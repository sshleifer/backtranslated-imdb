It's very good, including my favorite actors 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazrasra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked very amazing. But it is. They do not give any characters or good lines to work. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female characters are good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp are very competent and confident in their small side. They showed some talent and they did not act in better films. <br /> <br /> I did not think Dorothy Stratten had the opportunity to act in his only major role in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie has some fans and was very polite when I was looking. I am a big Peter Bogdonovich fan and I enjoyed all the first films that came from his last film, "Cat's Meow" and "Targets" to "Nickelodeon". <br /> <br /> The film is a bizarre detective agency involving detectives and clients engaging in sex with one another. Five years later, Bogdanovich's former girlfriend Cybele Sheppard Bogdonovich had a hit television series "Moon Lighting" with the stolen story. <br /> <br /> These sophisticated films tones have been based on witty conversations, which try to make circulation and some screw-up lines. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: The Paper Moon "and the very soft version of" What's Up, Dock ".
