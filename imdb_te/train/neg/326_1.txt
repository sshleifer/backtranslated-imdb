This early Adam Sandler film was compared to a comic in his life at this time in 1989. More from Sandler than a consistent confession script of his role of his secret comic intellect and frustration with humorous subjects. There is nothing compared to his blockbuster movies like Big Daddy or the film Billy Madison. Unfortunately, Sandler does not yet recognize the way he expresses itself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when he plays his role. The film's "jokes" hold conversations with a majority of the majority, usually over his unmatched comic talent and defeating himself, he is very ugly and unable to take on women. This film is very difficult because it does not act as a genuine film. Sandler speaks to the camera and camera across the film, which often refers to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is finally embarrassing and difficult to see. I immediately learned about it after I saw it, and if you learn more about it, it will ruin Sandler's career. At a video store this is a pass, I rent it for free and it still wasted time.
