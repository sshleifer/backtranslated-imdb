Storm's hippie past is a revelation, but overall it's a fall. Campaign stories work best around the intimacy of the campfire. There are too many semi-boring old friends' events and most filler stock footage. I've loved Clash and Joe to repeat and sell their songs (FU Mick Jones) so far, but this doc wanted me. Without a detailed explanation of the use of motion picture storytellers, some view the viewer significantly. They should interview them. The film worked better with the strummer's 'Radio DJ Voice'. And who will explain all the flags that are flying behind the scenes of Campfire? After awesome "Filth and the Fury" I hoped I would be able to deliver the temple. A Joe Stormer document is good.
