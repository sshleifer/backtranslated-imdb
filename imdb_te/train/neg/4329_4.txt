I'll never forget the wit and great comedy of the original holiday movie! The lines, motion and time periods in the picture are the best! <br /> <br /> In this sequel, Grisswalds has won a European vacation in a game show. The problem is that the jokes in the movie are slightly more lightweight, "ha-ha" is smiling. For example, a flight attendant asks Clark on the plane, "Do you want to be your coke in Ken?" Clark replied, "No, I'm here." <br /> <br /> The European vacation's humor was damaged. The authors attempted to re-hash the pre-made script, as all the jokes received from the first film, and based on a ridiculous slap-stick chase sequence at the end of the movie to kill time. /> <br /> The original kids who play the role of Rusty and Audrey from the natural comic stamps and the first film like Randy Quaid like Kashyan Eddie do not appear anywhere. Their alternatives are not funny, they do not work, and they are thought to be going through moves in a number of times. Some raw sex jokes and comments are not just funny, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> You have to stay in Grisswald's Volley World. The place made by them legends! Join this terrible adventure. Viewers must revert to the actual vacation pictures of this place! You will be happy.
