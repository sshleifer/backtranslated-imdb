Depending on your own personal psyche, "Christmas Evil" can be made with an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or the most curious and desperate vacationing slazers on the subject. I personally did not want to do any research, and I chose to choose for the second one, and I imagined the slasher of the early 80s with a chest of appeasement among the people who dressed up Santa Claus. Wrong! The film is actually about a block called Harry Statelyling; Who is obsessed with Christmas, worked in a garbage toy factory and considers it his responsibility to recognize on Christmas Eve who deserves the presents and deserves punishment. Harry started all the problems when Santa saw? Is her daddy perfect in a costume ?? Fill her mummy's naked legs at a soft age. He then developed a social boycott and was bitten by his brother, and he was committed to snap a day (Holi). I totally understand why some fans are appreciating the slightest horrific movie, but does it really have to be boring? There are many edges and seemingly unseen episodes in most of the film. I can forgive Gore's wound and aggressive bloodshed, but this film is not even an undisturbed atmosphere or unintentional plot twists (with the exception of the exceptional exception, I must confess). Moreover, I will take a more serious feeling of punishing the son of the crazed child; He behaves mistakenly and especially kills. How would you like to be a constant controversial and original Christmas movie thriller when Santa is murdered by a painful child? It would have made "Christmas Evil" a standard, but it now has an unforgettable and dangerous piece.
