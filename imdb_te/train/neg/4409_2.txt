It is certainly surprising that a number of numbers, the number of Westerns (directed by Andrew V. McLaughlin, is the genre-main character). Army Colonel Bryan Keith, who had never seen Colonel's wife (Kidnal's wife after playing, never saw Pussyy Glorr in "Goldfinger"). In the other words, nothing completely new or original. Speaking at a low monoton, Keith is a prostitute (a shock after TV's "Family Affair" run), but Keith's exciting talent counts. It's bad news for Dino, who does not even notice notice or care. Hack direction in lock humor, poor writing and many unfunny trials. * ** from
