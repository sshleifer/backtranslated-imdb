This movie has several key errors. It is the first and most important is the obvious lack of good plot! This unfortunate film is not hard to see, he or she wastes valuable time in their short life, and sends hope to disappointing feelings. This means that the film does not attract the audience, instead it encourages the audience to view it and everything connected with it! In short, it really is pretty much too bad too! You are so much more interesting and enjoyable than hiding in a big rubber shoe, chewing, watching the Terminator Woman.
