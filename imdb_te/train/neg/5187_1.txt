I'm going to approach and criticize RAW theories. I mean, this is the site on whether movies are about or feature film or debate or a site discussion philosophy. <br /> <br /> This video is really damaging. It was the head of the RAW's speaking head after another. It's some old video, so how old is you, and that's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> It's a weird comparison, but I kept thinking of Sunday afternoon when I saw some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). Shortly thereafter, I was in Barbra OD'd, I wanted a scene that I did not see: "Until you know, there are some other characters in the picture that are different ..." Moment. But it's about Barbra. Well this video is RAW's * Funny Lady *. <br /> If your good theory, if you look at the type and aspects of the face of RAW, he prays with his doctrines, or insight, then my guest. For me, I can not take 20 minutes later.
