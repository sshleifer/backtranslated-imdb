I can not say much about this film. <br /> This is a terrific film ... I have decided to see it. <br /> <br /> This plot has been moved to an abusive absurd. My whole body image was tense over time because I could not wait for the awful thing. At the end of the film, it seemed to me to be relieved. <br /> <br /> Editing is poor, acting sub-par, and storyline weak. Fran√ßois Robinson has appeared as a native American, although she is not close to herself with a native American heritage. <br /> If this movie is a idiot, it should be very stupid - very little. It's not. It's just curious.
