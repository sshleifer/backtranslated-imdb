This is an image about infidelity and revenge. A couple with the feeling of "twin" connection that is wrong with her sister. The film has taken forever to set up the plot. Many times a plot happened. This act has grief for most part. After the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with an abusive father. Father is in favor of Ashley, so Lara comes to deny everything. Girls have a never-ending promise, but when they grow up, their lives come in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a diner where she meets a man who married Barrie. Of course any good can come this way. The fact that Barry Tinnitus is not a poor need for a way to find him. I look forward to making this film good, but there's somewhat a resolution, but it does not.
