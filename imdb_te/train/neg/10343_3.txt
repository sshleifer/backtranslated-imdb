The golden age of Disney cartoons is dying at the end of the 90s. Duck Tales of Spine should not be considered because the show does not have a quack packed with duck tales. They talk about the difficulty for their uncle Donald and talking in hip-hop lingo and about teen teenage Huey, Dewey and Louie as they are thoroughly dressed up in DuckTales. I like small daring nephews from duck tales. Duckburgh has humans and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckberg. There are no signs of screw McDuck. The stories are repeated, the animation is good while the plot is boring. If you want a slapstick humor, I will recommend you. If you want to see a good Disney show "Dark Duck Duck" or "Duck Tales".
