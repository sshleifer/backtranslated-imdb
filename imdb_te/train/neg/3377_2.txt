Broadway music, "Chorus Line" is arguably the best music in the theater. This is about the experiences of people who live for dancing; They enjoy the pleasures, and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is auditioning for parts on a Broadway chorus line, and each one of them relieves stories of how their lives are going. <br /> <br /> Despite the film version, nothing of the hobby or beauty of Stage Show is captured and it is a bad movie adaptation of Broadway music because it is lifeless, no matter what. <br /> <br /> It was a big mistake for director Richard Attenborough to direct the job, which was directed to just the right touch and "Gandhi". <br /> <br /> Anything that brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in theater with real sets and limited wear modifications. It is very fashionable to Broadway music, and its simplicity is its fame. However, it was not properly translated into the movie and no one really thought it was doing it. Therefore, the film should take on the lives of these dancers, and leave the theater and audition process. The singers gave their songs in other surroundings and provided glasses to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they were able to dance Broadway in their cheerful imaginations. <br /> <br /> Attenborough's complete indifference and performance for performing dancers is evident in his negligent direction. Whether he listens or desires the director (Michael Douglas). Douglas's character has extended to him a sympathetic ear, and he is capricious about choosing a man who is not impatient. <br /> <br Although film producers are acting as real as the nature of the drama, some religious changes have been made. The most beautiful "hello twelve, hello thirty, hello love" - ​​a smashing stage number that dancers have taken back to their adolescents - was removed and terrible place, "astonishing" is an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Hello, Love" is just a "surprise" that explains the same story without wit or sadness. <br /> When transferring a Broadway performance image. If you want to see a movie version of this program, the next close thing is Bob Foxes' clever "All That Jazz." When Fosse's daughter was in the "Chorus line", Fassay was a director. He knows what to do with this. There was much more respect for this tragic effort.
