I was disappointed in this film. Definitely it is weak in the silly border: solutions that affect their originality as they do? Is a mission to one of their youngest members handed to the Sol Hunters apparently complicated? And the whole B-story is very worried in the case against "Holbobroth" and the station, at one point I banned television, "Why are you wasting time with me?" "The River of the Spirit" really did not go to the Spirit's question, rather than the original episode "Soul Hunter" in the background. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we do not have a concept for their culture. <br /> Acting is the thing that needs to be done with them and special effects - especially the scenes of the planets in the first method - the most impressive. But altogether, I'd say give this a miss.
