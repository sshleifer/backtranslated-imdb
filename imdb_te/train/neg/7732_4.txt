Before writing this review, I went back and reprinted others reviews. This film is often featuring my favorite dancers Jean Kelly and George Chakiris, often featuring fantastic Michelle Legrand ("Worthing Heights," "Ice Station Zebra," "The Thomas Crown Affair"). The dance is unusable, unmotivated and unrealistic, forgetting the songs, the story is a joke. Even costuming is not particularly flattering. Only the photography correctly captured the right mood and soul. I'm glad the other people "Rochefort's Young Girls," although I did not quite make sure.
