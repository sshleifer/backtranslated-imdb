What happens when you live in China and the local video store is on a narrow run on English-language titles? Yes, in this Romanian film you will bless this work. <br /> <br /> Spoilers are technically: <br /> <br /> I do not think it will ruin the happiness of anyone. The film has a scene of beach archery in the cinematic set of punctuation in the casino. The mystery, and many other pipes and disappointing comedies are exploited, perhaps because they are caught in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of people who look absolutely beautiful and misuse it. It is painful.
