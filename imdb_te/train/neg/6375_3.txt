Jennifer's Shadow is in Argentina, where Jennifer Cassie (Gina Phillips) arrives after her sister Joanna dies. Jennifer leaves Johanna's big house in his will, and Jennifer decides to sell her home to Los Angeles, even though her grandmother Marie Ellen (Faye Duieve) opposed the sale. But as strange things begin to happen, Jennifer starts having nightmares about her pecking ravens at her & she starts to feel very sick. After being inspected at the hospital, she had not been seen as a mystery of the kidneys, what was happening to Jennifer? Is this an ancient family curse? <br /> <br /> This Argentine co-authored with co-authored by Daniel De La Vega & Pablo Pares. Ninety-odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story I imagine will make more people sleep earlier than to frighten them. Vega, Paris & P.J. The script is pretty slow by Petit & I'm sure not to be bored from their skulls. All of the character they are uninteresting & with little or no motivation for anything they do with very infidel. For example, who is that cemetery caretaker? How does he know about the demons? What is his interest and motivation to take part in? I could not see. Jennifer is her amazingly amazed & blunt woman, as her grandmother is as clich√© as Mary Allen & she is clearly surprised by the villain. I mean this sort of mystery-based horror / ghost story of surprisingly predictable & simple news. <br /> <br /> The Directors Vega & Parses are going to many people. I suspect they wanted to give the gothic feel for a long time but it was not too long for all of me & the way the breeze used almost all the color from the movie that was very often done before & it is often very good & just makes the whole film dull & lifeless . From the inside of the big house, there is a perfect 40-year period, but half-hearted, rather than looking again. Jennifer's Shadow is well made, but it's not forgetting, it's not scary or creepy, it's not too predictable. If there is not enough no Gore, people have some scenes of the ravens & a beating heart but nothing else. <br /> $ 1,000,000 With a predictable budget and the US & international DVD release of The Chronicles of Raven is reasonably well made but one million these days you do not have to buy & Jennifer's Shadow proves pretty much theoretical. In the thick Argentine tones there are many scenes in which the actor speaks, although it may still be true, but people can understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jenny's Shadow is a rubbish ghost film, from the beginning to the whole bore, I am incredibly strange living stop creatures and mixed-up zombies !! (1964) again. Total waste of time.
