I have to admit that I liked the first half of the sleepers. It looked good, acting is also good, childhood story, pain and revenge curious and moving. An elite Hollywood film. But ... no one ever (at least 20 comments), and when it came to court scenes, and Brad Pitt's role followed his plan to protect his two friends, who were murdered. This film insults my intellect. <br /> <br /> "If you are with the two boys, why do not you tell them when they are investigating? Amazing? If you are a judge or a member of the jury, do you believe it? /> <br /> Sorry, this story is very weak and it is angry with me and this film has great potential.
