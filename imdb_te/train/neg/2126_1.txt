Jason Alexander is an outstanding actor, but it is ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. He dances well and is so effectively dancing, and throws himself thoroughly, so he seems totally creepy. In his more cutesy moments (girl in train station, the last number with Rossi), he is repulsive so I can not take my eyes off him. You keep him nice-guy act drop and expect to start snarling. Vanessa Williams is the real star, the only show better than the 1963 film. If you see the musical stage, 1963 film and the 1995 film production, you will see three versions containing more versions (different songs, songs that are assigned to different characters and different versions) and other versions. The music I've seen so far.
