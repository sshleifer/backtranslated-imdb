Oops, poor hamlet. I know him, dear reader, and let me tell you, this version SUCKS! I do not know that I have paid all these people money to this float, but I hope they will be proud of me. They took the classic game and changed the most boring play to be imaginative. This version is very bad, and the title role is not a big soldier like Maximilian Shell. The only ransom quality of this film made it a great feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Sarro and Crow are so much fun in this regard. <br /> <br /> I do not think Shakespeare is alive. It is. This "Hamlet" is not so bad, it's fine; It's just plain bad. Strictly terrible.
