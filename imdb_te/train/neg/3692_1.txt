<br /> <br /> The film is very difficult for the film, which is obvious to the casual audience: 50ish Rajinikanth is at home with his parents; The father of the girl's father feels he is a compelling "boy" ('Vasiramaamaya payaan'); Rajinikanth suddenly hinders the film with his speeches, how far earlier the women got their work through housework - and still believe he is not a theorist; Even though he is reading, he is in vain in six of his seven powers, <br /> There are gods, gods, and Rajinikanth. One of these categories is difficult for director Rajinikanth. Initially, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what the Tamil heroes are doing - even though the villains are standing, and the oldest, is attracted by the beautiful girl in the film. Rajinikanth is good and Rajinikanth's trademark styles are really enjoyable - "Baba Count" is a novelty. The film that can not afford is just a preface to a worst book written by these early minutes. <br /> <br /> The director did not explain the purpose of the hero; We see the hero facing many obstacles (politicians, general) but we do not know what the hero is the ultimate goal because we are not really a hero. Eventually, when everyone wanted to be his leader, the hero gave one of his speeches and went to become a nun. <br /> <br /> The director does not provide any solution to the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> R. Rehman score is very interesting. He shows patches of brilliance or he does not bother to fully invest in the film - who can blame him. Raninikanth enters the battlefield one by one and throws it with a knife and starts his Baba count. Adding music moment and more tension is a lot apt for a catalyst works. The songs are all mediocre, and after a few years no one cares about the songs in the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb 1. This film has all the items that justifies its true location at the IMDb ranking's net.
