One of the 1940's cinematography is the comic hassle comedy that can not afford the music of Ke Caesar. Kaiire, Orchestra's leader and radio-star (and goof-off of the permanent college fraternity), spiked Joe's predecessor, damaged it for his guests and wouldingly supported his merry group of musicians. He was appointed to play a birthday in a gloomy mansion, imported from Africa by poisoned arrows and hung on the wall. Shandig was surrounded by a creepy judge, a horror professor, an ominous swamy, with very sparse women, and three bad hoops to fill Bob Hope films. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are not songs, and no one is a Kaiser who is not convinced, which turns to ten years in 1940, which is elbow-in-the-ribs. * ** from
