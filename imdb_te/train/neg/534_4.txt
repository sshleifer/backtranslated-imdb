This is like watching the garbled paint powder. I was disappointed because I was very eager to see. <br /> <br /> This does not mean the film. If it is never done, no one will notice or take care. <br /> <br /> The film is hype for all the big names in the movie, but "no one" gives the film any love. </ P> <p> I looked at Vanessa Redgrave and said, "Soon I'll die and die!" It is like "Joy Luck Club". <br /> <br /> This is the "Ocean 13" (which is named big) of mother and daughter films and is fully anti-climatic ... Oh finally to it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
