When I decided to watch the BARBARIANS, starring that dual body builders, Peter and David Paul, I did not have a bad movie, but this film was directed by Ruggero Deodato who had a reputation for creating unconscious movies, but well sleazy movies. Well, barbarians are an unusual trashy action / adventure film that wants to be another canna barbarian, and each level fails. The shape of the image is incorrect. Some scenes were well filmed but the tone and skin of the clothes and hairstyle, the toughest "disco" look just did not make any sense for a low-budget movie. <br /> << Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdresser and dress. He needs to be alarmed but he comes across a buffoon. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of my parents one of the stars, walking around in skimpy fur bikini, her first movie appears. I'm sure this riddles wants to disappear from the face of the earth! Their characters are really bad idea, like everything else in this mess, because the so-called muscle bound heroes of the so-called twin twins are okay but their acting is almost impossible for proper criticism. The only way to distinguish between different twin twists from another couple is that a couple wears a liningcloth that covers his donkey, while other twins leanloth cover his muscular butt. I'm not kidding! <br /> <br /> Who is willing to do this movie by diDotato. And his frustration definitely reflects in this trashy movie. It's just bad.
