The film is like Darkness Falls, and The Boogeymann (2005), but it's not much graphic and more than both. It's not even slow and very imaginative. It's Deliverance and Amitieville Horror.Plus, we get some new age flavors thrown in a mix Those scenes come in some inspirational / inspirational lectures. This film is a haggad on almost everything. Though it's a crypt, looking at makeup effects is not quite realistic. In fact they are very cheap. From all over, there are conversations with really awful click. And I can not say when, but a couple of actions of the character are not authentic or reliable in those circumstances. Nobody can act like this in their right mind. You can watch the movie and you will know what I do. There is some inappropriate nudity for nudity here. It just is not necessary. The good news is really good s.so, after careful examination, id this picture is remarkable, but not good. My Judgment for The Tooth Fairy: 4/10
