I understand jokes well, they are not just good. The program is terrible. I understand, another awful thing about it. The only cool character out there is a hobo in the episode that has been in Ever Show, but I see the other episode including that episode and the show is terrible. Not funny is not funny! I do not want people to say that they are clever, but they are not intelligent and intellectual enough to understand that they do not understand why people are "just intelligent people". It's like saying "sky is red" but never looked outside. Whatever it is, the jokes are terrible, I think you can understand them, they are just terrible, her controversy is very dull, her jolly jokes and other jokes are really dumb and usually bad acting in the body. I'm not sure what the "smart" people see in this show, but others judge when it's not exactly a smart comment about someone else about the unknown.
