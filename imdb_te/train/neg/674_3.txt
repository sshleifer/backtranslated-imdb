I knew I was sleeping in movies, but it was usually a combination, being so tired, overwhelming and comfortable, eating a lot of trouble eating a lot of trouble. However in this case I fell asleep because the movie was even worse. The plot development is stable. Slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but there is no explanation for why or why they cause it. I agree, I missed a part of the film, but I saw a lot of it and everything was about its own accord without any real concern for everything. I can not recommend this movie.
