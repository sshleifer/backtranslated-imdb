This amazing idea and scenery is beautiful but where it ends. It seems like a poor set of sets of the West. This theme does not have any meaning. There is not enough time to develop many characters and their personalities. There are also unnecessary things that are not related to the plot or it has helped the story more. There are also long empty moments where the plot is explored but used for silence or unwanted conversations. The script should have more sense and direction. I had a big question mark on my head looking at this film. But casting was great in my opinion. If you're only looking for eye candy then this image is for you.
