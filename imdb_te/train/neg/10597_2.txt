This film is absolutely awful. I can not think of a good thing about it. The plot holes are so heavy you could drive a hummer through. Acting also Jean Claude should also be shy, and that alot is saying that! And conversation, what conversation? I think it's a fan of the first (I loose comment, like anything more than a guilty pleasure). The film shouted in Goldberg! This film is not good. What makes this movie even worse is that it is very bad if you can not even see it with a group of friends to have fun !!! This had to be my first five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it's very hard to give me 1.
