Do not bother trying to see this terrible mini series. It is a six hour bore, unbelievable love triangle among the three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, true love and true love. It's dry, boring, drawn, and uninspired as they come out. It does not even achieve the level of technical knowledge. Take that six hours of your life and use them more valuable.
