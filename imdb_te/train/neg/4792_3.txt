Fantas .... Class. Fantas II ... is awesome. <br /> <br /> I love to stand for the film, I can not do it quite simply. The movie is "sold out". Initially, other movies include video trailers when the first bad signals (others do not). Even the most meaningful characters, the main examples are the ladies who use karate to fight off the balls (a crack shot, funny but soon you want him dead), the karate (erm does not work, or rather) and blooming zombies (what they are doing, hell in the other Phatasms link). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It looks like you can continue at the end of the 4th. <br /> <br /> Overall, very frustrating. 3/10
