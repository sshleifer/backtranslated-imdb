The film is only luxurious when I see the film when I was very young. However, I can say that the killer tomatoes can not be funny as the film and the most memorable things from this film are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about the poor Timmy. Other than the film is really rolling around a little tomatoes and large tomatoes and this kind of people should be in a film scared and overacting just scenes of acting. Of course, having a very silly mantle and a catchy theme song does not make a good comedy. The film is going to be a B film, which is not taken seriously, however, you should not try to extend the fun jokes and full amusing campus into a full-length movie. A small fine is required when a trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a person trying to hit a big tomato in the endlessly. The trailer also looked like a mock trailer, but they actually took full picture, and it was rather weak.
