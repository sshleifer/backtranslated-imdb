There may be possibly possible spoilers (something new in this movie or you do not even have a little surprise for that matter) <br /> Does they feel Disney need to recycle everything they've ever done into Oblivion? Absolutely priced for them, but after a while, you can not think there is the overall quality and the way people think of them off. A despicable performance of the House of Villains cartoon crossovers. There are a few signs of total disillusionment in previous movies: voices are also remotely match and Iago is again bad (from when?) I know that these films are directly on the kids but enjoy all the Disney movies. The musical number of the film (which is typical of Disney years) is also difficult. I do not recommend this movie for most young people. If the release of these films of the same caliber is released, it is only time before the smallest animation studio overtakes Disney in overall quality.
