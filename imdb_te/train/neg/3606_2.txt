The film is the worst movie, but it's great for me. How to be a slasher image This is done at a university, where only children are found. Teachers are less than Hammers' s scripts. This is a good Catholic priest, filled with sexually oppressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The conversation is very angry and I believe I can estimate the lines in quotes. Slaws have some creativity and roam around people stabbed in the genitalia. The soundtrack and characters are not very bad, and the lack of continuity for dying characters, I will spend this film fun. Find the case of cheap beer and some friends, and smile.
