Animal Farm (1954) studied the dangers of totalitarianism. Those who are ignorant or ruled with iron fists and empty heads can change and distort good ideals. Sadly this film does not describe this either. What we have shown is a very promising piece of finger and pointing. Although animation and direction consider the budget and time duration, the essence of George Orwell's novel is not intense. <br /> You're interested in seeing everything by looking at the novel or the adaptation of this amazing novel. I seemed somewhat mediocre to this one. <br /> <br /> Reconstruction is very small.
