A horrific film made on budget of about $ 9.99. The most striking scenes were used, poorly acting and an awful storyline about aliens who use the discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spacecraft. The film has some blood (not enough to interrupt) and a character with a eggbird that replaces one of his arms. <br /> When you read it correctly. <br /> <br /> "'M'Heat Seeking Missile'. In addition, it's not worth your time, it's also "good at good" level. You're in cheese alien films, but nobody should be clear. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 1
