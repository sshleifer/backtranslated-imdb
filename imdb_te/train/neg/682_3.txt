Please note: I see from different posts that have the original silent version and the sound version of the same image. I saw the sound version and it's ridiculously yicky. Without the original version LONGER and crappy dubbing, I would like to read my review in mind. <br /> <br /> I know René Claire has a lovely reputation as a filmmaker and Louis Brooks. After a bit of a cult as well, this technologically poorly made film has many different ways. Hollywood had already sounded almost all of them in the mid-1930s, almost all of the famous French films were quiet - some dialogue and sound effects rarely cut on the film. Many lip movements, and most importantly, the film does not come equally well, and explains why the American French movie like Mrs. Brooks can do. It's just a loose and silent film, and the silent film was the average film - excellent camera work (sometimes) and some good silent-style acting. <</ br> <br /> The problem I found in the film is overly simplistic plot. A silent morality drama was 1920, it was fine, but the plot was a bit sore (ie "old" - "daytime") according to 1930 standards. A woman wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can not handle it. She gives her all the time, but fancy back to life, and she will eventually be tired! A tad dramatic, huh? <br /> Finally, the fiancé's friend (?) I was very upset and untrue. He looks like Harold Lloyd and has been abused by many friends and others. He took over the film and got any conclusion, his role seemed to be superfluous and the treatment he earned was average excitement. Want audiences want to laugh when he is abused? <br /> <br /> There are very good French movies in the era (Le Million, La Femmé du Boulangangar, Funny, Regine, and others) as well as good silent films. I can not understand the high rating of this film.
