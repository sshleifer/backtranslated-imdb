I refused to allow these relics from the era of the Sessions. How much they are discouraging during the cosmic censorship to ban them in their films, and now they are a big deal of freedom-free freedom that people are predicting, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and other illusions are predictable. This is not a thing, friends and neighbors! It's just peculiar perversion. Forget about the Buells Chien Andalou about David Lynch about Forman and Neoralism and other filmmakers who work with a distinctive beauty. Those people have mastered their jobs - well, you do not! Daniyux and Nicholscus and Sussexus and Murrens, Marinescus and Marginanus and other unmatched old timers, stay alone with us! To watch some Romanian movies on your bit time screen, your immaturity is terribilisms enough! You are not directors, you are ILLITERATE !!!
