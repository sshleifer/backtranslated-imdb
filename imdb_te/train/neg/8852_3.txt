To be honest, I did not see 'original', but it was clear that the first scene I saw was a great movie. Seven terrible sequels had to be done. They started with "Howling II: Your Sister Is a Verwoel". Shortly after Atari became the new film, this film came from my uncle VHS shortly after giving me a group of old films. I have seen last night, and it's not really bAD, it's just weird. I mean, the whole thing with her two wolves with Cybill Dancing is the only thing in three ways that has occurred and is very disturbing (but very hot), Christopher Lee feels like a dead Karen is her vampire, like Dracula's Mish-mash and the Lost Boy's Mash-mash is actually ... along with werewolves, Christoph Ram Lee (who played the Dracula) in the heart of each other vampire film, must die at night in the night life, and live in the Trollslavia ruler of Warwolves). Acting is not much, but it comes from the worst Annie McEnroe. I'll come to town, at some point in the film I saw her hunting for other people, because that terrible throat should always say something. Anyway, the plot is pretty crazy and cliche, so there is no real point in telling you, you can read about it in Wikipedia. By the way, the fact that really makes me nausea about this film is the fact that it is only a picture from seven sequels related to the original (which is not counting Howling IV (1988), a remake of the original, or other words, a sequel based on the same novel). So do not see this movie. There is no real horror, rarely any werewolves, and just terrible special fx. 3/10
