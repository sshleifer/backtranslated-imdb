I am proud to be a dawn of good Danish movies produced in recent years. However, this surge in quality has resulted in the loss of Danish film critics critical, a terrible shame. In fact, it turned out to be bad, and I can not believe Danish movies reviews anymore, and consequently avoided watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> This is a film with unfortunate advances, so let me stress that "Villa Paranoia" is a terrible picture of what conditions. It was hyped by critics that the fuel was added to my illusions in the Danish film. Furthermore, expecting it to be on DVD is much less helpful than a lack of time and money that can not waste time. <br /> <br /> Eric Classen is an accomplished director with a knack for social reality in Copenhagen settings. I especially liked "de frogzarte" (1993). He is fun as an actor, yet he has the same role for all of his films, meaning he is falling on his luck in the working class because he is a slab, largely because of society, by doing good to his community. <br /> <br /> The problem in "Villa Paranoia" is one. Clansen claims to be a peasant farmer, who has never succeeded in achieving credibility. <br /> <br /> However, the rules and turns and breakdown of all the rules on how to tell the story to understand what is happening to the audience. For example, the film begins with a very sad effort to imagine the near-death experience of the main character, with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work. After that, she suddenly experienced her desire to quit a bridge with her friend. This is a feature of the whole movie; There is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and low level clozen resorts to communicate any motivation: instead of showing telling. Hence, on one occasion, it is in a role to speak loudly about the predictable Canatonic person about the way he thinks, because the script does not allow his feelings; And then, suddenly the voice-over introduction, as far as perhaps an afterthought, otherwise notify the feelings that the audience is unaware of due to the incompatibility of the director. Fortunately, at this time you're about an hour spent on the characters, only divide the so-called story. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the case of Claussen movies, often acting is a problem, <br /> <br /> " out-of-10 rating.
