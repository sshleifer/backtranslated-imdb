It's a really cheesy simulator of the Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, the cheese of comedy, and the acting. But after all it's a soft core image, it does not guess because the sex you want and does not matter. It gets me the biggest problem of all, it's just what it is. You feel that you are looking at TV at 3 hours and playing independent films and made with some college children who do not go anywhere in the industry. So long you are waiting for an actual sex scene, many times you are thinking what's going to happen, then just hanging is left. In fact one goes somewhere (perhaps two or two episodes) though it is very beautiful. I can not recommend this person unless you find it in a clear exterior bin for a dollar or two. If you lucky with a plot and good acting for a good image, you do not like it. If you're looking for a soft core les image, you do not like it.
