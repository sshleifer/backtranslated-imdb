It's easy. <br /> <br /> It is not a comedy comedy for two young people and young people. <br /> In the end, they have to do for the last 10 seasons, most likely they defeated Seinfeld's 9 season runs. In addition, Seinfeld has 9 great seasons of great seasons, friends (and I'm very generous here) in most 5 or 6 OK seasons and 4 in the final seasons. <br /> <br /> It was a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled character features, but not the 100th time you saw them. It is difficult to understand how much people can understand why this rate. It's really awful.
