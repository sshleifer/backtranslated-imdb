This is a disappointing picture. Material consideration - military life is always good for laughter - and stars, the film should be a fall of laughter. It is better, a couple chakils worth. Steve Martin seems to be more ridiculous and it seems that Don Ackroyd is committed to dramatic roles, where he plays Robin Williams's lead role and can win an Oscar one day.
