It is believed or not, "The Woodchipper Massacre" gives me full gonorrhea! Right, I played around with a camcorder and got a rainbow of spiching from me, so that I got contracted and distributed with the devil. It is beyond my perception that anyone with modern comprehension can tolerate this pant-load of a film. I wanted to explore the first newly discovered type of boredom because I was first frustrated, frustrated, and the other - because I was sitting by the whole thing (without any suicide attempts) ... The film was about three siblings who left the weekend in their bitchy elderly care "harrara / Comedy ". The little kid will end up accidentally cutting the old woman with her Rambo-replica hunting knife. They then get gallbladder dismember with various tools (clearly do not drop the blood in her body!) And her father heave herself into the timber chipper ... her offender's son ends up grinding so much that jackass kids stop looking for his mother ... I Never remember seeing a cast of annoying actors who caused me nausea. Seriously, a red chicken voice hurt me constantly. All of the actors were apparently outrageous - literally just shouting their cunning noisy dialog and cracking jokes that must've written a chimp that just did not care! Now, I usually congratulate independent efforts, but only those who can understand that people other than their relatives can see it! I have a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of the way of a drive and it does not need a lot to see the painful long lawn, wiping the montage body with some cunning, fluttery music play. Plus, why the hell box of this film have a bloody piano on it ?! There was a piano in a panorama and no one was killed near it! I am reminded of this movie. Except as you are incomplete garbage, I advise anyone with half the brain to avoid this trash.
