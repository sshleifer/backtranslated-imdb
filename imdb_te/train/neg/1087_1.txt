This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The film did not receive expectations when actors acted. The most dramatic thing about this film is music, which offers a lot of cinematic: compensation for the bad and confusing storyline by having good actors, loud and dramatic music. It does not change the fact that it's a very boring image to watch. 1 score earned.
