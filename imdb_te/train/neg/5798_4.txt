The film is a mixture of nude music, romance, drama, and crime of film-noir. It is a deadly pile of different genres, none of which can really be done. <br /> <br /> The film tries to become more intense as an actress by Mickey Rooney. He is a former child actor who always used to act in comedy and musical productions at the start of his career. In this film he chose a different approach (though the musical elements still remain in the film). But his character is actually very ridiculous in the film. Do I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is a very young kid. He is in fact already in his 30s during this film but he is seriously aged more than 16 years old. Listen to him and listen to the tough talk of gangsters who are about 3 times bigger he does not just look and feel right. <br /> <br /> The story moves along a variety of mixes and the story is also really bad. Somewhere there is a criminal plot and it's all about living a romantic plot line and living your dream somewhere but it's no one really worse approach and maintenance works all due to. It's not an interesting or compelling image to watch. Although his career expanded from 1935 to 1957, Laszlo Cordus was the director of only 10 films in his lifetime. He is a hard-working director of hard work. Less script was given to work. His movies do not know everything and are generally not very high quality. <br /> <br /> Do not forget this movie is 50 ', but 40' one or maybe '30's. The film is mostly due to the fact that the film is black and white. Usually speaking about 'black and white films', 50s often have a feeling of inexpensive and the film is no exception. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney and Luis Armstrong and his team are in an order together. It's not the only film that Armstrong has ever seen though and he often makes himself movies, this kind of popup. Since the film has so much of the present, jazz lovers think that the music can still enjoy its music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
