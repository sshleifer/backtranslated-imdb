The city girl Meg Tillley receives a horrific phone call from her mother and moves sensibly, returns to her family's rural flames, confronting a mystery: why all residents are working in bizarre and unsatisfying ways? Radiation thriller is not only acceptable to environmental science, it is a small town resident, which is attracted to two women in a public space, and Tim Matheson to attract the attention of the girl from an office bench. The image words are very silly, it can not possibly hope to get out of a corner while Tillie's wistfulness and wounded silent intensity on the trash. Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography is some good (especially a fire range set in a garage), although he is scrappy editing - and very pretty hamstring finish. The simplest screenplay is surprising or has a shred of realism on its sleeve. **** from * 1/2
