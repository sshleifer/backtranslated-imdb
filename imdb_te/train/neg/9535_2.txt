The film is less than three, the film is slow, acting is very bad and the story is so weak that it's not good to tell about this film. Number three, and I thought it was impossible.This is a very slow 90 minutes. In fact, I hoped to see this film really good. Cheap rental rent (which is for purchase, ie) and maybe good reason. Perhaps for three, the film is the first two.It is the same. I can give the best of the best: 2/10 without warning
