I found this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. Today (sorry Jack Nicholson), this is the dullest movie I have ever seen. It just went to the noticeable point and then - it just ended. The lights have come and everyone is looking in the chaos. Projectionist missing a reel? I never wanted to find. This is because I remember about the film, a drama about some uncomfortable college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the film is seen entirely beside a spiritual audience. Fortunately, this is only the exception to Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
