The film was an NC-17, with heavy violence. But the gore may be pg-13 and there are many standards when Mum is the friend of the original jacket bad-fiery boy. The film has played a very good role in developing, and after returning to life, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of killing. Violence is overly excessive and I have more than twelve in the body, which is a large number of such films. The protagonist (character Lester anything but a hood, but even closer, I know hoods and part hood, they do not have to draw in the class, as it is called "white trash" and "hoodlum" They sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). The teacher deserves a slightly more aggressive death than teacher roles, but cut backwards. There are two suspense scenes in this movie, but not quite scary. As I mentioned, these murders are excessive and sometimes people who do not have a story tell a story cut their heads. If Gore was actually fun to watch, then it was nc-17. Two children describe a body they find in the cornfields, describing the police as they are maggots crawling around in the intestines, to describe them as much gorier than the fact. His stomach was not open, so his stomach did not have mugots, but I liked to see. Acting is remorseful, the characters are lost, and scarlet can make a lot of gymnastic stunts. I suggest to give this movie rent for the death scenes, I see it again anytime soon, but I enjoyed the high violence. Also, do not bother with the sequel, I watched five minutes and was bored of death, it sounds good but not. The real scarecrow made me curious.
