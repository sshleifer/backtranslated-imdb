Two older captives sent to Japan to recover the results of a genetic research containing the videotape which was stolen ninjas to fit the block at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> You are trying to be a ninja-flick enjoying the Sakura murderers, but it will fail seriously. The whole picture is just empty and predictable so the whole picture is difficult to say anything about it: the same plot can be seen dozens of different variations of times before, the characters are very briefly drawn, direction dull and script does not offer anything surprising, <br /> Even the ninja-flick-fan of 80s who understood the heart of the cinematography It will be very difficult. . This is not just a new viewer, it is not visual or imaginary. Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it means that it does not lead to directing the film and the same fight fights numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> It is difficult to recommend it to anyone else. Franz Nero's monstrous appearance also enters the Sakura Killer's American-ninjas. Visual film does not have any balls in the film, it wastes time to find great fighting scenes in this film: nothing. In all, one of the most nonsense ninja-flicks, I've ever seen. I do not like curiosity too. <br /> Trust me in this regard. <br /> <br />
