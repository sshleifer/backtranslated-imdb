No disappointment! I hate mommy, but it's a lot worse! It was very tired and unbelievable and at a certain point I found myself sighing and yelling all the time. People can not really believe this movie likes. Nicolas Cage's character is not quite acceptable. The whole movie is considered to be a grand tour around America's most wanted buildings. Continuous continuous stream of references and combinations is not too intense. I forgot the attention for 30 minutes. What felt a happy night out was the whole disappointment. What to drag ... I guess watching many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
