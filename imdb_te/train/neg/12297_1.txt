Witchly Hildegard moves the crowd of people in a particular hotel and chooses one of the twisted and unpleasant ways. I thought I would see it until an ill-fated crucifixion here and his head was set on fire. Hilly is very prank: she takes a nagging harp and shut her mouth ... then she's hanging upside down in the chimney in time for a roaring fire! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I'm ready to write the most terrible film ever made by potential people ... until the finale. I admit I loved ending. It is a boy and his toy tape-recorder hangs by Linda Blair. The scene will last only a minute and a movie, but you know the old saying: "If you get a great end, people can no doubt forgive you!"
