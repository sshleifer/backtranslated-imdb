This is dumb, in dumb, in black comedy, completely dull. In particular, Chris Klein starts trying to maintain a low profile, and eventually morphemes without laughing at the enthusiastic version of "The Three Amigos." To make black comedy work, it must be worse, not "playing dead". Black comedy to work, it's not enthusiasm, "Dead Play" is this. What's really "playing dead", town full of nut jobs. Although Fred Dunst performs a pretty fair adaptation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "Simple Plan", Jake Bassie makes Jake Bassie's pretty fair imitation. - MERK
