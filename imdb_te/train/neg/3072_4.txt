Margaret Lawrence probably did not intend to adopt for the film in his novels, Stone Angel was not broken. Hagar, as a character, constantly challenged the social code (who dares, who?), And sacrificed his humanity in this process almost. Signs in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) Old and new are these stages, and carnage (talk) are consistent. The film is reasonably confident of the book's story (though it is not really storytelling, is not it a storytelling hero), that will prevent the catch of the movie's soul. There is no haggard's defiance (for contempt). Bram is much more raw than the one filmed, and Hagar's father played "traditionally" to talk. <br /> Why do we need to see cell phones, organic production and other modernization? Do we try to make some points (eg, Muslim girlfriends and local people)? Hagar and co. Everything is politically correct in the book, so why should we see in the film version. There is no need for a modernized low-budget operation, but there is no need to send sensitive political-correct messages that are not entirely unrelated to the novel (and the movie), which will appear to throw away the underclass. <br /> <include the audience. It seems that we are committed to seeing those who are bitter and beautiful and friendly. Why would Hagger laugh every time in his panic attack? Margareth Lawrence wanted to laugh her readers with haggard or laughter. These people are discouraged and eager, and laugh at all we do. I do not think Hagar and other folks in her justice are in any justice.
