A top competitor for the worst movie ever made. The character of the Jonah Flank is as having an I.Q. It is less than 3 author and director. The screenplay was not passed in a high school writing class; "Jokes" are juvenile; The concept of corn. These performers were disappointed for work. I'm late to see if it's worse. It did. Life is very little to spend on any part of this film watching.
