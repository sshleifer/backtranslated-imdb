I see what the director is trying but he will miss the mark. The main actor is very good but the modifications around his movements will get you out. Camera work, i.e. lighting and exposure is a type of enthusiasm, I can forgive if it's more clear in the direction but it's not. The sound is a bit off and it takes you out of the picture as well. I can not see that this director works a bit better in the future, but it does not expect a dv movie after 28 days or anything good, but your expectations are low. At least one and a half hours. Oh, and if you ask me, acting other than acting is very beautiful. But I take that for the value that I'm in a movie snab.
