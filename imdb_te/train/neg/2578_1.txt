To summarize the film: Without a real plot, the 80-minute scandalous character in the film will drink or make bad jokes. The music is just awful, humor is not funny and all male characters are slutty idiots or whole geeks. The film seems to have actually been written to a 14-year-old boy, thinking that drinking is good, women are impressed with the opinions of men and men as geeks. In addition, the film does not have anything to do with the original American films, except for a few names and Mr. Lewentstein. The only good thing about this film is nice looking girls. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by a 5.4 rating because it is clearly overrated and does not qualify for more than 2.
