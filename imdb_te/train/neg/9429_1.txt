I purchased this image for $ 5 at the CD store I used, and I regret it very much. I'm a fan of cheesy horror flicks. They provide a terrible paltry cheap entertainment. The film was entertained for the first half hour, because it was very much fun with the MST3K style. Then came boring. <br /> Acting is a terrible piece of this movie. Despite great performance, it's ridiculously bad and honest and entertaining all the entertainment. Plus the image for this image. <br /> <br /> This film is really entertaining. Writing, lighting, and editing. <br /> <br /> The movie offers a lot more "% $ @ # is going on?" Moments. There are many moments like dinner in the dinner, and there are no consequences in the film. On the occasion of the banquet, it was decided that anyone in charge would be able to enjoy the food for five minutes without interacting each time during the meal. During meals and other unreasonable moments, the scene is far from pure darkness outside the scene. Then it will fall backwards. Talking about the dark outside darkness, one of the funniest parts of the film is the weather, not nighttime unless it rains. And talking about the dark, the big problem with the picture is that I can not see what's going to happen half the time, it's disappointing than nothing. <br /> <br /> In one of the climax scenes, you can not tell you to be surprised. <br /> <br /> When it comes to climactic scenes, the worst in Neinhard. I saw people saying, "Awesome, I'm surprised, good." I can say that the big exposure surprises me because I can not see it coming. The reason I did not see coming is because it certainly does not come. I will not destroy you, but I tell you that my friend and I have found different parts of the movie that I have spent twenty minutes, it's all confirmed, and we found everything <br /> <br /> For all this, the movie is very fun. I love the worst horror movies, but it's too much.
