Oh, I heard a lot about this film. It went to see with my best friend (she was the woman, I'm a male). Now let me tell you different opinions from mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "Take your clothes," we both felt awkward and boring a very strange combination. We laughed (it was not, not it), we (and it's fine off being in bed), we have been convinced to spend money in vain. And we have it. This plot was incomplete, and the group of individuals whom the characters were impossible to care about. Money waste, celluloid waste. This film is not even one of the ten votes, but it is less accessible. I do not know why the movie is amazing. I do not recommend those who have a short part of taste or intelligence.
