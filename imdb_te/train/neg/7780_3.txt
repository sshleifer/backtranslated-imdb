But in the cast of Michel or Caradine, the director is abused at good pedestrians and the most sharp and pessimistic dialogue, when it comes to something of a good look at the monster and "action" , It is also stupidly performed and does not help that only with immaculate appeal. Normally I feel sorry for a filmmaker who has faced many problems in completing a particular picture - in this case it took a good part in the mid 70s - but monstroid or monster or whatever it is called ... nah. <br /> <br /> If you're getting the Elvira DVD double-featured with the blue sunshine (bad print quality), make sure you skip this. Of course, if you're an Elvira die hard and can not help you to hear her sweetest commentary; Personally, I would like to get Joel or Mike Nelson with these robust robots from the Mystery Science Theater in Turkey.
