The horror! Avoid like a plague. I would rate it in the top 10 worst films ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are seen by Day Care Students ... Wait, I have seen better programs than this. In a soft obscenity, a bad nude woman sees the woman and goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but it is. Sound and light issues are continuous throughout the film. Sometimes I'll make the camera motor groan hear. Boo! I want to see another movie in this story, but made by different people. This batch of actors and crew requires more acting and movie making lessons. Voted on 10 to 1.
