Oh yes, Sakura killers a goofy, terrible ninja movie, no mistake. But it's also a wonderful enjoyable one. It is thanks to the wonderful existence of a Chuck Connors, as it does in the film, only shine in some scenes. I suppose he supposed that he is sort of an Obi Wan Kenobi type ("tough ninja buster", shouting a box) but his 'knowledge' is ridiculous. "Move without thought" ??? <br /> Truly, for his two assistants, Sony and Dennis, the terrible conversation called Brooklyn is as bright as we are called Colonel. Look for Dennis' logic about the 'gene saucer' that is particularly associated with Sakura. If you know anything about cloning, you will die and laugh. <br /> <br /> A terrible playful movie I can not end the 'trick' for you either, except for the perfect set up for a Sakura Killers 2. Bad Chuck Connors died. :-( because he has soft ways of blowing ninjas.
