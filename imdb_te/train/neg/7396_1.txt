Unfortunately I have to agree with the criticism Helops wrote. <br /> <br /> Cinematography for a small movie, dress, sets, sound, album and everything else is very good. This may seem surprising at first but it is said that there are technical experts working on this, so quality assessment. The problem is, as usual, in the story. <br /> Thing is not really a story. In a story (or cinematic case, telling the story) you need plot and conflict. Events: You need things that happen to the character. Because the heroine wants something, and for this reason, he can not get it for some reason. Tim Walker has no problems or goals. He is a superhuman company who sees humanity. That's it. So here we have a pure description. Instead of showing a story, we're just learning things about this Tim Caucher personal. In fact, if Tim Cacher and the typical nature of the short run of the film, it is difficult to give him enough background, so the film resorts to voice-over narration. In this case it is the worst possible sense is used to give us the information we never eat. In fact, if it's not for VO we feel just a kooky old man going around looking at the character things. To make it worse, VO also explains what is happening on the screen! <br /> <br /> I can say that this small film is making a band or some good video and it's impossible to tell what they say. What is the measurement of the personnel's technical (not so incredible, but not good) value, but it's fun, entertaining, thrill or at least failing to show the story.
