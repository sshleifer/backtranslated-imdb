The first part, the queue in the queue, is about that part of his life. It has very unrecognized battles and many people do not realize that unidentified wounded (remember that you are a doctor). It ends because the Castro Revolution has achieved; Che Havana never comes. The second part of Bolivia should be evaluated. <br /> When I realized that I should know this "epic" (I do not always know anything but never before), it has a very different notable battles. I think of Laurence of David Lein's Arabia as the greatest myth of all. <br /> <br /> The folk actors who came after that are the fact that many journalists are well, separated. Along the way, they all wear "che" pads and everything else is wearing tired tiredness. Unlike the viewer, Benisio del Toro could not identify with people other than the Fidel. <br /> <br /> Dell Toro's spectacular, "Lawrence" is considered to be the most recognizable character of only Peter Votle: Alec Guinness, a Omar Sharif, a Anthony Quinn, etc. Other characters can be converted, resulting in a loss of instruction. When Che's top assistants are killed, you feel no regrets since you do not know who they are. <br /> When I was murdered (I do not think it was a spoiler) there was no emancipation from the audience - he just kills. <br /> He is very moderate as a human being. In moral ritual Jesus was not only revolutionary and second, but we learned about him, that he was married to five children. What was his inspiration? <br /> <br /> Sunderberg lean on purpose. Like Soderbergh's hand, no one knows about Laurence, Lorraine, the secret man of Arabia. But at least Laurence has a friend (Sharif) and colleagues (Guinness, Quinn). He is courageous because he is insecure - that is, human qualities. <br /> <br /> Previously this war was another war epic, Mongol. Mo Mongol will look at it Wonderful Life.
