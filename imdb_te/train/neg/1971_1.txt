This film is very disappointing. Wenders performs a very limited musical spectrum of blues, which sees his subjective and personal interest in his movies, which brings the film and makes it totally boring. The highlight of the film is the Swedish couple J.B. Lenovo is friendly and displays their private video footage and tells stories. The introduction of the vendors of the film factor is very interesting - the world's travel to the culture of the world (or, of course, American culture), but not limited to his limited scene, as well as the funny or completely lovely reproduction of the stories from the 30s. Yawn. I expected him much.
