I bought this movie because it is Shahrukh Khan's debut. And I liked to see how he would do it. He should say that he is excellent in his role. Divya Bharathi is amazing in this movie. Rishi makes a wonderful job. Akkhei and Mohini made their characters well. Dalip is also good in his small role. Aziks shines in a sample. Average in direction. Editing is poor. The story is boring. Ravi tells us about the famous pop singer. He has many fans. One of them is Kajal. Ravi and Kajal fall in love and get married. Ravi was killed by his relatives.Cajal takes a widow. Relatives of Ravis. They will go to Bombay. She comes with Raja. She is fallen in love with her and she is getting married.Well comes back.This story is predictable.Chimax is imaginative.The first half bores.It is also very drunk.Acted by actors and music. Second half enters. The music is impressive with some nice songs. Cinematography is the first half but it is speculative. The songs are "Soushenge Tumhey Pyar" and a dull song except a rain song. The clothes are old. Give ratings for actors and music ratings -4 / 10
