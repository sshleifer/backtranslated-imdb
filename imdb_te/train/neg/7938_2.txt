A family looking for some old road-side attractions in the father's coffee table book is old, showing an old freak show driven by an odd-eyed man. <br /> <br /> When they leave their homes for decades, they are forced to stay at an almost aborted fishing camp for decades, as their family van breaks down. <br /> <br /> The freak 'subgriety of horror is from Alex Brown's' Freak' (1993) from Alex Brown's beloved 'Freaks' (1932). These are two classics (or soon with 'freak'). 'Side Show,' however, will never exist. If it ever comes to a traditional state. . . Well, the sad state of our style will be a clear clue. The 17-year-old daughter from the funniest bad song is clearly older than her natural mother, which is not much of a movie. The writing is suburbia, but not entirely terrific. . . Just boring. Directing is poor, and rare freak effects are pretty horrific and unbelievable. Acting is endless and casting is even worse. Anyone who is at the age of two camps believes that the young man should not meet the child for a long time. There is no other quality and there is enough distance from gore and violence. . . And when the bit of violence, it did not do well at all. Moreover, I can not forget about full honest action scenes, never before seen in the movie I made. Overall, an easy and unforgettable horror film that deserves to be left alone on the bottom of the dollar bin. <br /> Final judgment: 2.5 / 10.
