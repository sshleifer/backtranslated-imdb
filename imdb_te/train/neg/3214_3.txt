First of all, I want to tell you that I'm in comics, anime, animation and such things. Everyone has his own priorities, but you can trust me in this film. I'm aiming. To start with the story - it's OK. The comic book story follows as long as I get familiar with them. But animation ... well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. They did not try to imitate the anime style and it would be better if the original comic book style draws on the drawings. If you do not want to see the effects of rare slopes like fire and light, you can say that the film is 10 years and longer. From 1985 the original Vampire Hunter looks like a little bit of Hunter D. Check out the heavy metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks good in a hell! In addition, the voice talents do not do anything special, the music is not unique. So all in all - it's not the atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. It just does not hold you. There is plenty of blood and violence, but I do not have to impress at all. This is not the first time ever watching animations that are very focused and may be a surprise to the person who does not see animated blood (does anyone have around?), But I do not think it's audiences for this film. So they can add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer are very tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death her! Some look sexy, but it is not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I look better with hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something good original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards will probably take. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
