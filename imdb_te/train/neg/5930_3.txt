<br /> <br /> Let's try to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen about Leonard Cohen. It's just lynnard filled with anger, and why they listen to these other singers (some of them questionable) go without thinking why they're talking about themselves. The pulse .... The junior is like imitating their diary entries on a higher level - what about you, what about Leonard? Imagine someone would make a documentary about you if someone was "worth". Parading of members of the U2 found particularly insulting if I would add credibility to this film - no. Leonard does not need bono or edge when talking about his spirituality. What would be better for filmmakers to portray a piece of his spirituality through the film. Gee, no feeling! <br /> <br /> I'm experimenting with Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cockers for the covers of Cohen Tunes - are not in the rest of the show, and some are unbearable. <br /> Cohen fans, I'm not warned!
