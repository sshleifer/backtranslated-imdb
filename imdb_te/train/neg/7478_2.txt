I thought it would be dumb when I saw the previews of this movie, but it would be funny at least. Well I'm wrong. Although somewhere deep down producers have an interesting message to leave parents alone and notify about their return on their life, the way they tried to distribute that message is terrible. The first fifth of the couple was very ambiguous. <br /> <br /> I would like more than five conversations and more than anything else, it's still quite mediocre, yet it's still more than I can say for the film.
