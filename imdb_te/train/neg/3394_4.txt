The film is filmmaker Ben Chaplin, a boring bank employee in England, who orders a mail order bride from Russia, Nicole Kidman receives mail and surprisingly, she is not surprised when it comes to surprise. This story is very imaginative and Chaplin is much more likely to be somewhat unwell. Kidman is actually pretty good in this role and plays the role of the only thing that's interesting in the film. GRADE: C
