In the first hauling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves existed and somewhat operated. Part of the film made some sense; A TV reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth. She ends up killing many people, including her boyfriend. Then she transforms herself to live TV and shows her the world they exist. Special effects are just ridiculous in the first film and they can not get any good in this regard. Whether it's transfers or cheesy computer graphics showing bad toys or supervisors. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not so bad; They must kill the hero of the Werewolves for some reason. It does not destroy all the werewolves and this really does not end the threat from werewolves ... they want to kill her. <br /> <br /> The movie will end up with a 10 minute monitor of the film we have seen and the scene of each other is the leader of the female wolves who will reveal his big chests, some of the Devo-Esquire band plays for a group of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The film is also to be viewed by Christopher Lee.
