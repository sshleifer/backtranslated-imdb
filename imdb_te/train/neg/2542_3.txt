<br /> <br /> I saw the "Baggie Creek Legend" and first liked the movie. When I hear it has 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found this copy and saw it one night. I can not see how I can make a G-rated sequel in a horror film. The original Fak Monster is an image / documentary about the monster, and anyone can be intimidated. "Return" is for children and not anyone can view. I see it because it's been a while since I can not see it again, but ... these hunters come to the town and they're looking to kill Bigfoot. Three young children come out of the house to stop them. It comes through a large monsoon. Hunters will be hurt, children are saved. Then they hide the big band in a large plate and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly, Bigfoot comes and makes something really sick. I will end nothing, but it's not scary. Well ....
