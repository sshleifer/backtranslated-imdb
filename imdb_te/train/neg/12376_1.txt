<br /> I really rented. Man sucks this! Faster elegant cuts, a very annoying speaker, and fights with them were heavily edited and reduced (especially in the struggle of Jet Li's legends and Jackie Chance fight from Drug Master 2). <Br /> <br /> And what is the deal with the stupid street makers ?! What's "cool" about it? <br /> <br /> Stupid Collection of Cuts for Stupid People. <br /> <br /> Never buy this image! <br /> <br /> Instead, acquire films, such as fights and battles in the humble geek!
