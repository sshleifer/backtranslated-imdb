<br /> <br /> When I read this review of Silent Hill reviewer, I was initially interested in reading this review. <br /> <br /> With the film being a huge Silent Hill Fan, it was disappointing with the movie's first movie. A chance. Mind and Fearnet will only list this image as "Dark Flores", not a full name. When I saw the name "Mr. Lord" in credit, I immediately thought of the band (I had some friends in college) but it was important and did not intend to put aside ideas quickly. <br /> <br /> The film starts strongly. Despite the fact that the "creepy little girl" was the death, the good use of audio and sense really started the story piece together. The fastest atmosphere was built rapidly, and each references suggested that the film was excellent. Demons like real stars of horror, I did not wait to see what the main characters were lurking in the hospital halls they discovered were trapped. <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed up, By the time I first appeared, I saw that I had come from Megadeth concert, and washed me completely. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere in this film lasted intact, and the story left wondering just what's going on, but scares are pretty much present. Anyway, the conclusion is that there is hope that it will make all the worthwhile. Unfortunately it is not the case. By the time the film reached Climax, I was totally disloyal, and in the end I finally realized that I was a bad guy ... Lardie was the lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> What is the whole film that has been boiled down? Some poor souls followed a hospital by members of the Lord Band? The silly monster design has suddenly made sense. If you want to be that cool, then there may be a KISS or a member of the Marilyn Manson. A few years ago I saw one of the lardy music videos unfolding. Did they have to close it in full? <br /> <br /> When it comes to what I really did, I played everything I could handle. I'm not going to "ruin" for you, but I can safely say that I have a plot device that you've seen before. <br /> If you're not a huge lorry fan, stay away from it. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (it does a good job with other horror movies, especially from Silent Hill). And, I can not stress this, I am the enemy of the Lord. LORDI. Talk about Buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, it is good to make a scary attempt to watch slipping music videos. In other words, this is not possible.
