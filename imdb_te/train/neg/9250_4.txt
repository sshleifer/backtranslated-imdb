The frustrated, imaginative movie in which the woman (McTheer) goes to her daughter with her daughter, because her relationships did not continue and did not get pleasure. 'Anywhere Here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a better understanding of a mother / daughter relationship in this genre. Well with acting.
