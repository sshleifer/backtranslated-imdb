Visually speaking, this film is amazing. It has some delightful black comedy movements. But on the whole, the plot is very cliche, it has its visible message. If you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like Hostel, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at all high-brow, run away. I saw part of Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it because I was confused. In the end, it does not get confused. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit by. If you really want to challenge, look like the last one. If you really want to be charged or tell your friends about the really confusing picture, then it's for you.
