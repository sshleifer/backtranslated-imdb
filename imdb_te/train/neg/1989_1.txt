I would have liked to give this picture zero but that's not an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women can not work. When I see Bobby Brown I know it can be good. No one in my home could believe that the first 15 minutes later I did not change the channel. The idea of ​​black women like gunslings in Western days is ridiculous. It's not a race thing, it's also a gender. The combination of two things is ridiculous. I am sorry because some people in this movie are not bad actors / actresses but the film is awful. It's not reliable as a movie. This may be some people 'fun', but I'm not in that group. LOL. And using a great line from a great, great movie ... "That is all I have to say about that."
