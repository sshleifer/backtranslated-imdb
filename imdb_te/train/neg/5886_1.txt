If I did not like the people I love, I left half the film. The film is based on real events, but it's topped, it's not true. I have a few mental backgrounds, and many psychologists, and I have seriously detected insane, so I do not think that these people are. But in the film, the only characters who seemed consistently human were the father of August (Alec Baldwin) and young Augustine (Jack Kaedin). (Although Ivan Rachel Wood is a secret diversion - a very romantic with fun feeling). There are some fun moments, but the whole tone of the film is terrible, bizarre, and nasty. A fantastic cast of cinematography! I went through their turns, and I thought I was watching the class of acting. It brought home at the time of the credits, when people showed up sitting there just a couple, not acting, not talking. Those moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
