When this movie is really on your abilities, it's just a driving examination, and a formula 1 Grand Prix (I'm the US Grand Prix, Dodgy tires I can pull out and you can just win it) If I do not take this mistake, I love B-movies, my half-scenes are made by B-Movies, but I do not think there is enough characters in the alphabet to describe how bad the image is. The story is not that bad (for a B-movie), it is potential there to make a B-movie brand, Friday 13 does not speak potential, but the potential is none less. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is not the second, but I believe in something, like QVC, which has a huge amount of donors in QVC. I saw the worst pictures, but I can not.
