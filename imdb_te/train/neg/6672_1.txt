I'm 47 years old and spent most of my life, I remember a fan of horror and science fiction movies. They have no silence, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them I can not find something I like. I give this film credit to the good cinema and creature effects. This shows the effects on the story. We are right at a time when the horror film is far less visible. So any film should be a good, original story entertaining. A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting, but bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad image. This film also has good acting and good effects. So unless you can only about gore, this one pass.
