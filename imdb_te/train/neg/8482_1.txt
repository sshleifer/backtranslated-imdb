Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but I had a chance recently. I had a keen interest from Kamal Hans, and I saw a bit of worst camera angles attached to high speed. No message has been understood except in the Hindu religion. I love a lot of religion but Kamal Hassan thought I was a man's role to manage this kind of thought. He's made a horror film than this worst. He tried to change the Hollywood generation of viruses and god, and he did not change that person into confusion and ultimately went for world domination. It's very good for the movie School vs Regular Public. He does not hold up to the talent he has to disgrace him. The intellectualism of the film is one of the most religious cohabitation at the expense of insulting athalism (I once again insult Hinduism but the film is not equal and my humiliation is usually a religion).
