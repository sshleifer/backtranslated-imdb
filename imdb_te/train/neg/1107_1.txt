I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought like this, "Wow, it's great!" I'm very wrong. This story is all gripping. In fact I still can not get it. It just seems to me that all the characters have a drink, smoke (opium?) And sex. That's not good cinematic features, but please! Where is the story I finished the film, and yes, finally it was taken, but by then the picture was almost there. Rent it if you really want. Do not trust the box behind.
