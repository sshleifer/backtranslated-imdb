The narrative story relates to their struggles on two small towns and family honor. David Morse is responsible, directly uninterrupted police and 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, 'bad' boy, former soldier and former culprit. As an actor (especially in his early years), his performances appear to be modulated in Sean Penn's manner. The first time the writer and director of this play, the director, uses his script and characters in the same manner, thereby reducing the loss to the crawl (we can catch each nuance and infection). This approach is lovely if there are three-dimensional characters to care for, but Photonic Morse and Mortensencu really can not convince siblings. Worse, we've come to expect from the well-known veterans-Charles Branson and Sandy Dennis. The film contains the turquoise scenes, the wobbly narrative and the confusing album (always hanging over to lift artistic excess). The pen's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are more embarrassing. **** from * 1/2
