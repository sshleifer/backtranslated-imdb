The film should be shot one day, there are also scenes where you can see the green light of the camera reflections and its red pointer and actors! The plot and lines are really awkwardly awkward (inspired by the least thriller genre). Everything associated with POTO has a bad and kid's approach. The movie is full of cleis and thrilling. If you want to watch a funny b-movie relaxing with friends you Enjoy it (As I have mentioned) there is no way to make this film serious!
