<br /> <br /> "Walker" is thrilling and sinking, but I'm so bad. Pacing is painful and slowly slow, and 40 minutes after the film nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour is reduced to ten minutes. It's slow. <br /> <br /> If any thrills or action scenes are bored then it becomes frustrating. It's also almost shocking that the argument scenes are so plain and emotional. Could this be due to the high social class stiff upper lip? <br /> <br /> "Walker" is such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on poor plots and worse pacing.
