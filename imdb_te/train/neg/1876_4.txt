This is a low budget spoof in the spy style. To help guide your expectations you need to know: (1) acting is very cruel. The stars distribute their lines with high eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and key-keyness. (2) The script is not intentionally intuitive and capable. The earlier lines are finally confusing and joking, as the previous plot elements are not entirely relevant. (3) The shots are often made on off-balance grounds, so the genre is overly fun. <br /> <br /> A pop-eyed Jeff Gold Blum offers a sophisticated and traditionally unorganized dialogue with a sarcastically surrealist. <br /> <br /> The film has a guide to intelligence, intentionally stolen from B-images in the 1930s: a secret code that defines the description by Carl Sagan. The over-the-top performance of the film is used for the most comic effect in the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grimm's son Ned is so often left feeling that feeling sorry for the lad will not help you chuckling. <br /> <br /> The slow progression of the film is not about comedy elements or play elements. The effect of the play's drama has been significantly reduced by early comedy. In addition, the characters and their luck will be much larger when the initial parts of the character are very surreal. The musical score is intentionally with a heavy hand, and I have more frustration than this (and off-kilotore camera angles) comic. <br /> <br /> Over-the-top acting, depression and almost incomprehensible intrigues / countercursions, and slow pacing will grind on most viewers. The film is 158 minutes long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Using closed captions to grab the dialogue's brilliant ridicule correctly. The picture is very slow and the sarcasm is much more heavier than the light. But humor may well be heard on your tastes. The film is a view to enjoy independent films, directors Hall Harley fans or Parker Posey devotees (most camera time).
