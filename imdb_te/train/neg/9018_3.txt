This formula B science fiction movie, and the director did not bones about it. Who restored the life of a scientific team about a dragon. Finished items you have seen several times before. Weak script with original characters. Of course, it is full of stereotype characters and situations. The director made this a formula, did not try to deceive us, and gave a graceful appeal to the film, but you do not have a chance to remember for a while. It's good when you're cooking, cleaning, and working. Sort the mindless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but unless you're all just drunk and do not care, it's not something you sit with friends to see. The collective rating of 3.2 is probably better. I do not think I'm frustrated by most people, but I am surprised that some people in this post feel this wonderful feeling. It's really frustrating for me, because I do not have any effort to do this memorable picture.
