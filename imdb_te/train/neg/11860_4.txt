If you do not expect what's going to happen in the first five minutes, give it two minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been on the shelf for a long time and she wants to go out. She has no younger daughter, it only indicates that she is not a youth. She never killed the world while checking her daughter ... Cabaret, she refuses her money and can dance in her short sequined costume. This image is too bad. It's a tough man's role. Not for money, but just for hell, it's odd like the stoops to jiggle around for Lilia. When she succeeded in stimulating them, she considers herself a woman again. She does not like to be with them but she is a slave to her attention. Other dancers are more likely to be old-fashioned men in old age, bringing their time to light. What I say is not small. Her romance, though brief, is with you imagined .... Here surprise we did not see it coming. Even though the ending is good, you know that you can not end up any other way. Perhaps this film is not my population target - 30 men
