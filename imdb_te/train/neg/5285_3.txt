Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that one should read the best version of Jane Austen's work. I agree. However, keep in mind that we love the simulations of great literature and strike the current writers, without the good writers, that their roles are difficult to get the roles for life. The current version of Jane Austen's effort shows us what happens when you have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version did not compare 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which worked well, periods and barriers on characters (except for a bizarre procession and a kiss on street scene in Bath). The 2007 version looks at a son-in-law Anne. Other characters are not well developed, this is a crime, and investigates how Aston can portray such fairytale characters with carefully selected names. The series of events in the novel thoroughly thrown out, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bed and poor brother walking in the bath - did not seem to be doing a lot of characters. The strength of the character and the intelligence of Captain Ventworth, Anne originally caused him to be loved, not written in Wentworth of Rupert Perry-Jones. Chiran had more substance in Hindus and P-J could give more shape than he could do with his postures. Overall, the 2007 version is a disappointment. It transformed the novel into a controversial and valuable drama. If they want to bring our modern emotional intentions into Aston's work, what do they do with Shakespeare's compliance: get it right now. It's fun to remove at least "Female & Prejudice" from the historical & location settings and look like "clueless". It's not PERSUASION, but they do not know what they call.
