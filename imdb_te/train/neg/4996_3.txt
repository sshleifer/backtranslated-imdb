I really enjoyed the first half hour of this film but, Wow, it turned out to be cool, or I should say, "just plain stupid." This is another example of old humor. It may be funny in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> He is also from Jimmy MacDonald, from the Bunny Berkley musical instrumentation and where he is matured. The cast played just stupid roles, the worst thing for Macsbury House Coffee Company's boss (Roymond Wahlburn), who did nothing but shout at all times. He is cruel to hear and is a huge loss to the film.
