***** WARNING: SPOILERS might have ********* My biggest problem with this movie is completely self centered and how the self-prostitutes wife should be consumed !! Standing for a night with a thick tender, she beat him. He constantly calls her and threatens her and sends a video of their night together. He is undoubtedly crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that he feels dangerous to her (and revealing her mystery). For a second she did not worry her husband. Did she even think of him for a moment probably being at risk from this mental illness ?? She soon realized how much she felt emotionally about her husband's consequences. Perhaps there is not a picture there but what's really different is not what's really.
