For all of the hype about this film, I finally put an open mind on what I think. And, even though it is a bit slower at times, the first 90% image is very good, some "old time" fears, which makes it a junky and unresolved. In fact, I think cinematography is excellent in these scenes. But if Dark Remains fail, its climax will remain. The movie ends and the downtime feels MILES APART from its body. The storyline is totally falling on its face with a logical end and, the answer I ask for a lot - what really happened to Emma? - No clarification on! The principle for negative energy is ridiculous at best, and in the end, I felt very cheating. What a terrific horror film could eventually haunt the end of a terrible end.
