Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. When I heard the first news of Robert Wise's 1963 film "The Haunting", I was scared that it would be a huge cost of summer-film-size visual effects. But, deep down, I have faith. Definitely, such a talented cast is intact ... the film does not ruin the daring and intimidating image of De Bont and the company's sensitive art. Well, subtly, where are you now? My fears were expressed ... a good picture is bad. Yes, Eugenio Jannetty production model is jaw-dropping; The film is amazingly photographed; And composer Jerry Goldsmith never makes a mistake. But, the script puts the good actors into test and makes them distracting dialogue types that are only spoken in movies. In the end, there is always only an amazing actress to escape with some respect for the incredible Lily Taylor ... and just simply. But, the crime of all offenses is shown to us in horror. We can not use our imaginations anymore, fear of fear of unknown. No, we can get some visual effects that show us what to fear ... and you know? They are astonishing ... Visual effects are kind of crazy. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess ... but things have long gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> In this old haunted house maestrocity there are no real thrills or creaks ... I'm scared. Check original instead. <br /> <br />
