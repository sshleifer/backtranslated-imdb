Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto motifs. However, at the end of the series, the studio was clearly stated to "climb the shark", so to speak. The phrase was passed by a major program and the chief executives decided to stimulate the show by changing the executive formula. For example, they introduced "The Brady Bunch" with the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and 'Family Ties', who introduced an unnatural baby for just six years in a season! With motorsports, they came to the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought they should re-practice these brilliant images. In the previous film, Warren Highmer acted as an annoying wrestler. And in the film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone is just one of the most annoying examples of comic relief, and you kill him to shut him up as if someone hopes (preferably the motto)! Although he has to work for the famous Scotland yard, he shows all intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again, again, his sequences are unpleasant and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre is just as disturbed as he stays there, and Buffett sees "law". <br /> <br /> For the plot, this is really one of the best rustic films ever since the opening scene of the Sheba Queen's crown. Moto is an international policeman over the already innocent character, and has to protect the precious thing from stealing. In a great twist, many thieves try to steal crowns independently of each other. <br /> You can watch this movie altogether. Near the WWII, however, these films can not survive for a long time, as Japan has not been accepted into sympathetic US or conglomerate in the leading role.
