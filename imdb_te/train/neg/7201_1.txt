Fortunately I did not pay to see this film. Moreover, I can not reveal any spoilers because I've spent the next few minutes after the movie. This is bad. When I laughed at once, Yahoo! Billboard is lying on the guy, and the theme has got the song. However, I thought it was enjoyable, but I realized that I was still another product placement. <br /> I love the cartoon. I used to see almost religiously. (I missed the last episode, but they showed Dr. Klan and it was not more than class, someone commented on the show page) The cartoon was more than a penny and brain. I hate the setup of the whole thing, remembering Robocop. Broderick screws the whole concept of inspector gadget. He is not nearly as cynical as the cartoon. Another truth is that unless his gadgets actually oil soft, the point I saw was working. He was also thrown into the tone of "Wowsers" used in the activated tone. I felt very frustrated, they killed the cartoon very badly. Everyone felt that way. Our 14-17-year-olds were reminded of the cartoon charm and we loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> When I was caught in the cartoon, I went to the movie with an open mind. I am surprised how the film was retarded. It relies on stupid conversation for gas, and humor. Disney relies on painting children based on pain and physical humor. The product placement in this picture means, and it shows. The wise-cracked car is not clever at the cracking brilliant. The gadgets look nice, but they are almost overly glossy. The cartoon is a good look. The crazy scenes are the worst. In 40-45 minutes, I saw the movie, did not hear a laugh, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Write preview. This film should not be seen by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend "Iron Giant," which is sad, but very good. The film is a travesty for the whole family drama
