"Welcome to Collinwood" is a type of disaster. <br /> It's good to look at it, you may be better off with some confidence. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that is potential, but this is a terrific script and some bad acting was robbed of the horrific and unwanted George Clooney character and Richard Dreyfus. The only saving grace of the film is the weird cono vocabulary introduced. As I saw more criminal cables, I thought about time and time again. This is the only reason I gave the film 3. The story is boring, the characters are nervous, unnecessary objections, and very unlikely. They are in a state of constant stress and are annoyed that they are celebrating their troubles. They shout at each other, disorderly standards. <br /> <br /> I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderberberbr√ºckbobblock and George Clooney are responsible for this. Whoever really remembers this trash would have to try war crimes.
