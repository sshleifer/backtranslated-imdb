This is a shallow hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about the scheme of an envious young woman to run her father and his fianc√©e separately. Is it not promise or just a view in the eyes of a daughter with an electro complex? Who cares? All other characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and unwelcome. Seberg poor (I agree with the "review with the chest" comment before the review). Plot Plowed. This speculative material is about 30 minutes film fits, unfortunately for an hour and a half! If you want to see great gowns and jewelry in Riviera, I recommend "catch a thief" - in which you get an extra bonus of an entertaining story and favorite characters. <br /> <br /> I would love to entertain myself in the movies. I do not really care about the person who sets a movie. Any time or place, good story comedy or drama. I would like to see some enjoyable characters. If I relate to them it does not hurt. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a good performance, and David Chartan is in an abusive role. <br /> <br /> "2" rating For Care and Neven and Cinematography - Faced with rich color scenes and black and white scenes. Unfortunately, not all the great cinematography in the world can save the poor story with un-enjoyable characters. A girl's ear is still seed ear. Consequently, my confusion has been a waste of time.
