The leader of Unasco Inc.'s south lake beachcomber David Ziegler, or Ziegler, is home to Cancun in Mexico on his beach with a large cooperative executive Rosenlski's portrait of the boundary adventure film that contains anything with blackmail. He has handed the CD to his brother James, and three years of telephone conversations between Roseski and the President of the United States in criminal agreements. The CD has given David Edge the following international mobsters. <br /> <br /> The fact that James Rogles is a little more than half a million diamonds trying to diamonds is not just to live his life, but David is at risk of losing him. Ropsenlski wanted talks with David for CD by her ex-wife Liz talking about giving it, Rosnelski made a deal to pay her debts if she came through. David was later killed by Rosenlisky's Mexican Hitman Tony, with the help of a great white shark that did not go into these peaceful dealings on the part of his owner. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> David is under attack by James Diamond's secretly hidden mysterious David now and Tony and his men are aiming to close him for good. David also wants to take diamonds and at the same time lost his owner Rosenlski David lost CD but wants to give it the impression to use that without blackmail, without Rosenlski's knowledge, to use it later. <br /> <br /> The shadow strikes in this huge one-eyed white shark that ends with about half a dozen of cast members including the movie "Night of Sharks" Tony. David, who has a gun-controlled convoy, uses the blades to carry large explosives and molotov cocktails, as well as his fists, all Tony staff. Even the killer ended with a gun, with a shark knife, but by a hunting knife. David did not have a friend when his friend and sidekick paco girlfriend Junyata and his priest's father used guns to protect Mata from Tony and his gang gun; He is a knife and spear man later. <br /> <br /> When the film ends, you can guess that you can do with David, after watching the eye be killed by a shark, leaving the audience, leaving Rosenk to die and leave the village. David is free to live his life and loving beachcomber and nobody looking to kill him and two million dollars richer. David's credit is about to return his CD to his friend Paco Rosenski but if anything under conditions Rosenlski about his cousin, his dirty and criminal affairs to let his big mouth shoot and let the world know where he is.
