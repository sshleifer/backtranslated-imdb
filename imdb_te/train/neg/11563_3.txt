This Italian partial horror movie starts into a very soft core romantic film and turns into a mystery that has some of the most loose ends of good, and it dull actually makes this film rather unwatchable for my taste. The only thing that can be seen in the film is the only breast that is expanded. At the beginning of the story, there is a man in a movie that takes the girl in his castle to his castle, who takes them to his prison and go to Berzer and kill them. They show nudity, but they never really show these murders in the film. Then Guy looks at a nice red head in a party and goes out with her and marries her. There is one thing for red heads as he sees one of his beloved ex-wife Evelyn, she also died in circumstances that the audience could not view the business. Talking scenes begin with murders, followed by snakes, foxes, and so on. It is easy to identify what is responsible for the murders at this point and what you mean is that you have a cryptic ending when you're not good at somewhere. The film did not work for me, it left me with many questions and the first third of the film was not about two-thirds of the film. Describing Evelyn's death, Evelyn's grave is somewhat of a coincidence that helped the film. Granted her title would not be misleading as she left the tomb, completely under her own power. Gore is very easy because it has a little bit of fox and a scene with a lot of blood. I felt that this film was a tad dull for most part.
