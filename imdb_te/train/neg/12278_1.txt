When you look at this presentation, you can not tell exactly which story or acting is most painful. First, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the authors have to use every cliche, not just the usual plot, but also the implication of each character, in some ways in the show where every police series collage there. It's good and good is bad and good at the end of the day and we all love each other, good guy and better people, most of all. "I'm a good conductor" smile, anxiety look and "success is ours" body posture, bad guys "I'm nothing good and I have to remove it from society": after the vehicles of this message and more than anything cast members acting skills , "I'm a Catch A" angry and "you drew me" (this kind of sessions are also common Development). True story or not, the presentation is worse, and yet another proof that the producers are not s ** t about viewers, we are all idiots. Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the brains out of you.
