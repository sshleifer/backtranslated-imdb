Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy have an extensive (specialized) film career that eventually came into the team. Many of Ali's pre-Stan films have billed him as a screen for Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life Hardy was called his friends' Babe. Hardy had an interview with journalist John McCabe when he toured Britain after a battle with Laurel in a music-hall act in Bernard Delphont, in which he explained the origin of the nickname: In the beginning of his acting career, Hardy shaved from a gay hairdresser, Hardy's plump cheeks On his face) and 'nice baby!' <br /> <br /> Hardy's previous Laurel work is very interesting - especially his comedy characters in support of Larry Sommon and Chaplin's imitator Billy West - Hardy's colleagues have included him in the low budget storyline for the 'Babe' - Vim Comedy Film Company His team work with Billy Rouge is terrible. Hardy and Rouge screen names are given by plump and rumb: They have unpleasant names in their own right, but Rouge (though smaller than hardy) is not particularly important. Here it looks, Harry appears to have done with Laurel in his early Hull Roach films ... but without spit curls and fast food. <br /> <br /> 'A lot too,' is a totally distinctive flint and rotten epic, terribly unfunny ... and this film is exactly one of Laurel and Hardy's most hilarious films, the fact that 'These My Wife' has the same story More clearly made. Plump (Hardy) Star Border, a house running in a room by a long giant landlord. Route (Rouge) Porter. With a letter from his wealthy uncle, John, he is expecting his child to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and come to meet Plump's wife and baby. There is only one problem: there is no plump wife and baby. He was lying to his uncle to make a family man appear. Now, in fact, Rant is likely to find a wife and an infant with his little wife. However, the results are dangerous. It's good if those deadly results are funny, but they are not. Here unfunny humor is just a blank slap stick, with characters just placing their arguments by shoving each other to slot columns. <br /> <br /> Spellers Coming Soon. Wim director Will Lewis (who?) Does not appear to be fitting for camera framing: far more than hurdy actress Hurdy and Louie arranges her shots so that she is not in the head frame. This may be funny if the purpose is completed, but it's just useless. At one point in this bad comedy, the round sinks into a black smile and sinks in a gorgeous gag horizon. "I thought, 'they were not very few to laugh.' But they are. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plump gets to the baby's bed, but he still has no baby. Uncle John stepped up the stairs, and the little boy was detained for blood. This gag might probably work with a midget, or with really runt-sized actor like Chester Cancin, but Billy Ruge is only a little lower average. The deceit of the baby's rouge is not reliable or funny, and Uncle John should be a complete moron to fall for it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Hardy's first wife, Maddelin Saloshin, is one of the most important aspects of 'One Too Most'. This marriage was not happy, but Hardy's marital difficulties did not achieve Stan Laurel's epic ratios. <br /> <br /> In this film, one thing has impressed me. The flashback sequence is very brief, reminding the beauty of the hare baths about his seaside love. In 1916, there still was no standard image grammar to provide flashbacks: a linear and simplified one shown here. This image is not too bad. Oliver Hardy's CV is one of the most 'one', and I'll rate this movie from just 10 points. Laurel and Hardy together are more ridiculous than one of them.
