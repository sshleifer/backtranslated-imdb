If anyone of the old old clich√© in the dead man's horror movie is tired, will give us some information and then attack his head without a clear reason? <br /> <br /> In this movie, the use of the film is baseless. If you see the first movie (the first remake I say), you may not know the information given because you already know. I guess, you may think that it's not worth the lead roles ... but why does the idiot shoot on the head? Would he live? <br /> <br /> This is the second film titled "The Hills Have Eyes Two". The first is a sequel to the film 70s. It gets a little bit harder for someone like me here. Look, I know there is a HHE2 to start with a very low original HHE1 people of my age are probably part of the minority. Now we have a sequel to the remake and this sequel is correctly specified as a sequel to the original HHE1 ... it just degrades further! <br /> <br /> The Ways of Craven's original Hills is disgusting. In the end, though, the idea is better than performance, but he has a very low budget. To be very honest, Wes Craven is not good for the horror director. He only made some good horror films (Elm Nightmare, New Nightmare), some alright ones (Scream) and a bunch of horrible ones (The Wicked, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh, and he's coming to Swamp Thing, as well ... the original HHE2 second category. <br /> Now he is the co-writer of the new HHE2. And it's such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original film. It's time. I guess the main characters came with a family, and the fact that beer and pat and sex are not a bunch of teenage men. This made us feel dirty. <br /> <br /> For the first hour, we're in hell, and finally in the last few moments, good boys have avenge the bad guys and feel good. <br /> There is no tension for this new movie. No suspense or no. Just violent things happen to the stupid people. There's no frightening existence here. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of horror films because people die in the places where they die. Samuel El. Jackson walked around the water and gave a speech "Sheep Blue Sea", and then he would eat with a shark, only to be close to idiot water. This is the exact same thing. People know that people are dying, but people have taken themselves back to leak. When you think that people learned then, someone will go by themselves! Seriously, the characters are bringing their A-Game and is not even more frightening when they are still losing? <br /> It is given below. This is the first remake of "The Fog" remake (less frightening than the episode "Baker"). More bad guys. Most of the caves. More tension. <br /> But it really deteriorated. Less bad guys. There is no tension. Certainly we have more time in caves, but a whole lot happens there. In the end, it seems like there are two or three bad guys. The last picture is seen as a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who looks at them through telescopes? Seriously, this film should have brought us, but it's exactly the same "looking" scenario that has given us the final picture with the same promise. Come on! I gave the ghost. <br /> <br /> I do not think Gore fans love it ... I'm wrong! Gore (though it's sped up for the most while in the dark), but without tension, and the characters you do not even mind .. Gore is nothing in my book! In the end, you were not afraid. You did not see (you're an 8-year-old girl). You also feel like you've seen something new.
