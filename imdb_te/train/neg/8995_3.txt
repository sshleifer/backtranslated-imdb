I missed the start but I saw a lot of it. One friend got it on DVD in the cheapest room at FYE. <br /> All of the skits are very small, and are still very long still. For the most part of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something funny! <br /> It is based on racist / sexiest / "gay" humor, sketches used by people's racist words, or skits. , And I'm experiencing difficulties .... The symbol for the Tunnel Vision Network is the lipstick mouth with an eyeball. The mouth opens and ends on the eye like eyelids. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Many actors went to work better, and the bomb did not hold them back.
