Ten minutes worth of story stretched into two hours better part. At least half of the time there was no importance, but I left. But, always hopeful, I'm there. And leave the feel of guilt for wasting time. Actual, but the storyline is so transparent and weak. The script is like a lame like it can get, but again, ten minutes out of the plot does not leave a lot of room for good conversation stretching out.
