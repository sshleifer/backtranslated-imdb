I've also seen this movie, and it's done very well, I've found the heart shake up and it does not recommend women with little children. The fear on this mother's face is that the train really damages the heart when she looks at her baby. And the sad thing - internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Abplastic mountains. All money in the world without making dolls does not hide her grief. I remember her desperate face when she pulls money out of her clothes to have her baby healed. I'm surprised that this film will be shot in Detroit, because I have seen that people come to Cincinnati in Ohio. This is the way to the poor from the mountains.
