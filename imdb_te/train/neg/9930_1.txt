Mel Brooks has a relentless and strongly unwelcome attempt to take the role of Sheriff Bart into her own weekly sitcom from Blazing Saddle, which is really bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> This is especially interesting for Luis Couset Jr. to try. Clevelan is his best to act as Little. His downfall will be displayed in every scene. He is very ridiculous in the HBO film El Diab because he is in the slab. <br /> <br /> What really is Bart's best and funniest thing is his horse name!
