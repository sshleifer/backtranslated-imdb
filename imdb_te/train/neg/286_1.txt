The film's heroine, Olivia D'Abo, played the role of Robin in the box office in the Keanu Reeves box (and in recent rehearsals, appearing only in the Reeves box), which is her role as a star. I eventually realized that this is my name for a long time forgotten school special, but at least give some credit to the woman. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is one of the worst teen sports themes I've ever seen, and it's gymnastics that are struggling with every teen and sports movie Clive Teen love. And, to be released as an amateur alternative to Flashdance as an amateur option, is the closest thing to Michael Zenboo's recognizable 'maniac' with one of the warehouse dance scenes, which is famous by Flashdance or is it another way?). There are also dancing scenes and worse, 80s dancing and sports traditions, the dancing between the heroine and her villain (s), the person who questions her achievements and abilities in the team. For example, it is seen in Trashein (an inversion rump joust) and rod (BMX dancing on campus, which is not much of a competition, but fun). In fact, the film is in the Salvage Army with Robin and his friend, Chok, in terms of airy romance, such as homo-romantic rolling. <br /> <br /> A little girl who came from a poor background about the film. To avoid being as sympathetic as possible from the audience, she is a sick mother, her bad sister and her carefree (and abuse) stepfather. No need to say, the companion is not very beautiful. Mix, add a talent for gymnastics, but many obstacles to join the team (such as her arrogance, snobby team mates and a coach are ultimately suspecting her skills better). And, of course, she's one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating a bad team mates, and can not forget that she is not a steadfast lover (though Kathy is in the movie after Tommy). Could this kid be more curious? <br /> <br /> But she's hard to do it every time she's harder, repetitive, and clich√© quest to disturb her. <br /> <br /> But, the film is not worth mentioning that the biggest combination of the film is terrible acting and dialogue. (I'd like to see how Jim Coach suddenly watched team-mates in the dance-off diner). It makes episodes like 'Amazing Stories' like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can imagine anyone recognizing this movie, which is very serious these days. For that you may be satisfied, but it is also an excellent forced drama. So, Cavette Empagar.
