Dante's 1st season, which I submitted in "Homecoming" was not as intensely impressive as it was not much of a horror story, but a good political statement after death. The story of the virus in the world that causes sexual abuse of men leading to sexual abuse towards women is known as the Screwley situation. The episode screw fly starts all right with a small picture explaining the way the scientists killed. There is a small scene where a man is detained when the female body is found in his home. I think I'll have to show it at the beginning of this outbreak, but this is not clear because it's never repeated again. The episode will last for a while. Blah blah blah. It is cold and mysterious but the episode stars are worse and worse, going to its grief and unsatisfying end. The worst part. Well, except for chocolate.
