First I say that I am a Christian (I work in the movie and TV industry). Hence, I understand that the filmmakers are working on a feature length movie. If I'm true of the nature of life, I'm for positive and exciting messages (this is a fallen world and things do not always work ... even for Christ's followers). I am happy that others have the best reactions to the open Christian message. The film that took place on me was on the face. A movie will live and die on its story, and here you have changes in behavioral character that can not be explained in a dimensional dioriotypes, exposition appetite and mild behavior. I believe that you have a club on the head with a message to get a point across a movie. I'm sure Kendrick Bros. Improve time and their story techniques remain. <br /> <br /> Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but good (Hosiers, Feel of Dreams, etc.) can stimulate in many ways. If you are interested in a PG-rated movie you are inspired, give a look at Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill'. The truth is the truth of God ...
