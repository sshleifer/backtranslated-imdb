After Part 4 success, another sequel is a natural move. However they stopped shortly before they started. Alice fell out of Part 4, and she found her pregnant and Freddy seems to be using her unborn baby to get her victims, which is of course Alice's friends. The Strange Nightmare film is very much on religious images and bad acting. Special effects are good, but this is not even a film.
