The 'Blue Desert' can also be a half-way of acceptance and the more pleasant thriller Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) is not stupid. When she gets another attack on the streets of New York, the comic book artist moves in a small town to Roberts West. In her first days, she is suspiciously confronted by Cherry Randall Atkins (Craig Shepher, running this piece), and eventually she leaves her. Fearing her safety after two years earlier, she was suspiciously confused by friendly urban police Steve Smith (her friend and relationship with DB Sweeney, who did not lose the role, convinced by the writers thrown Red Hering). Because Smith needs Roberts to cooperate, she says, Atkins is a former con and sex offender. <br /> <br /> There is no evidence to keep him out of the film before. <br /> <br /> The images that are interesting enough in the film are made up of at least one interesting film because there is such confusion as to whom Roberts believes. Nevertheless, the intended suspense seems too forceful, since Roberts's character is no reason to respond to the common tasks that are thought to be reasonable. And her delayed responses are very easy and unbelievable, especially in the end that allow a lot of suspense. Perhaps Sweeney's wrong choice for this role. Many children have faced Kevin Anderson's role as recalled in his role in 'sleeping with the anime'. Or, if Lisa Roberts is written as a strong character, it is enough. At this time, the film is not the greatest, low-budget B-thriller.
