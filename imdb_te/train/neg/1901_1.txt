This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> Gone classic 1974 car chase film remake begins in 60 seconds. In fact it is good acting and the plot moves very well. But a big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot is more believable. For those who do not know, there are thieves who work as an original plot inspector. Who can suspect them? But HB Although there is a change to almost every aspect of it. Hali's original, remake is a very good movie, until we reach the final chase scenario, which is part of the 74th edition. One version of this version is just 10 minutes old, and it ends with a monster's special influence, which takes all confidence from the chase. The original chase is very believable, a stunt driver who stunt his own stunt, remake in the last 15 minutes. My suggestion you want to see a classic car chase image, bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.
