I see many people liked this movie. The film and the person who gave me the right to write 101 failed class. From time to time Lindsey Pryce shows up to the most extent of the videographer to the end. <br /> <br /> "If the child is a girl or a child, the clich # 1 movies / TV is always the mother The single father can not get fainting on his dead wife so that his maternal killer will be able to take care of the child and her whole child is taking care of them from my 3 sons to 2 1/2 dodds. A flowering woman is one of her hands If she is an alien in the Clip # 3, they should be Latino origin and they should be illegal. /> <br /> Clichy # 4 said Latino should be the most educated of his homeland in this case he is a professor for 200 months. <br /> <br /> The clearest # 5 The offense is not really a person committed to himself, and he is now working with the most educated Latino as he does not have the brain on his head now and seized the kick on the head of the air. But in this case he works like an awkward idiot now crossed the border and he has put his own daughter in danger of taking her along a useless quest on the border of the idiot, because he has lost all in the sense of kick. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 6 does not walk on a hood running from a crime, but a little too little kid. Because the child's parents have to play a bigger role in the film, because the child who accidentally killed the child is associated with Aphas. <br /> Click on the Clicher # 7 Do not vet as a police angrier and the image in which they can pair a rookie. They are detectives of homicides, the most experienced cops in the Police Force. Sev7n and Copy Cat and Law and Order immediately came to mind. <br /> <br /> Let's look at some unemployed sop stars of Clix # 8. Now I like Lindsay Pryce. But Susan Haskell left the IMO that she could not get out of a paper bag and left her right when she opened her mouth when Marty was used in Live to One Life. I'm sick of the sea. <br /> She can now be well anchored in the landscape, but she still does not work. <br /> If it is not filled with clichés, the picture may be more intuitive. I do not think it should be expensive or brainy to be good. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** *************** Oh heck I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time because they will never be watching this movie. There are clic # 6 and # 7. One person never saw the movie before he could see it. The father eventually flips off the cops and is shot by an angry veteran, who suddenly becomes very upset. She wants you to be innocent of the innocent guy and she mistakenly burned her. When she is not. Now for the little girl who came with him to the father. Imagine what happened to her As the times rise, her child ends with living with her father's family !! Come on! You're all going to happen, because her husband is a child! So she did not live with Lindy Price. <br /> <br /> This film is very insulting to me. Because the film was explored and went out of many places, but it chose one of the clichés. 2 stars stars 2, I thought it was good that the little character, who was the role of annoying Lindsay Pryce but did what she could do with her. My advice is to take a vice and look at this ditch instead of tipping your head
