John Candy. Do we need to say He is the main reason to watch this movie. Most people do not know how high he is as an actor. A witness to change the horn from the poor slab to the jerk. Just a simple (subtle) facial change and we'll go. The film has many bits and many really dumb bits. The best moment for me is that KUNG FU U scenes as well as John (in a trance) stage when he talks about how much he loves his girlfriend, how much he and his civilizations love his girlfriend. I'm sure you read that this sequence is really crude. It is, but it's also very funny because John Candy is doing this bit. The simple story is pretty dull and is not enough to make Eugene Levy and Zoe Flaherty (even for alumni SCTV alumni). Levi has her moments, most notably at the end of the wedding (he thinks Rod Serling) and a great scene when he talks to his mother on the phone. Overall a good picture if you have a tough day and put your brain stupid. I give 10 to 10 people.
