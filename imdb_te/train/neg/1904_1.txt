=== Small spoilers === <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a huge broomer fan So I assembled before all the beautiful posters, and the trailer comes up to MI: 2, estimates are rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer product. Big cars. Angelina Jolie from Nick Cage and an Oscar. What's wrong going wrong? Too. <br /> The script is not funny to anyone (it's really hard) or exciting. Wooh-haa about you is a black man who is constantly doing racist jokes and about himself !! Have you got comedy? I do not think so. The excitement is entirely from the picture. The first of all (and it is said many times) are no sympathetic characters, where are they killed? You know that Kip (brother) is walking back to the streets again when he says that he will kill the psychologically niche brother unless he stole 50 cars in 4 days. Is this enthusiasm? Think not. Then comes the best bit- romance between Nick and Angelina. She looks really frustrated with having these stupid lines off to Nick. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Are you looking at someone?' 'What's wrong?' <br /> <br /> Then there is only one lightning in hope: the car chases. They're disappointed to say the least, because the trailer made it seemed complete, and only one. Caught in a long one, ugly, serious camera movement. I was really struggling when I was following the action. <br /> Is it an action movie? Thriller? A romantic comedy - Decision is not required, just to avoid this terrible mess. I give 3 in 10 stars, and I feel like I am generous.
