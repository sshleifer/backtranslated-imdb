This is one of the 5 worst films I've ever seen. It's not scary or what's included in the Plot Outline. The film was very scary and I was frustrated for almost 98 minutes. While acting is average on average, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and in real direction. Occasionally a strange mood is set only to break some useless line or event. It is not surprising that all actors were thrown up with illness and shots, and everyone should try and get a terrible script. A good fan of good horror movies, I've always been bored with something that's bad in this. 98 minutes will not save you.
