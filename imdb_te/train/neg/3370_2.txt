Just a dumb old image. The first Stanwick son is really in the mood of her feet, then her husband is trapped in another bad path. In an attempt to save him, Stanwick is unfortunate and still forgets, he sees the escaped criminal. She's likely to kill him but it's too much fun in the mood. In the end it tells us through the narrative what her husband is saved, and the mute message of the Stanwick film. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to recognize how an unattractive woman like Stanwick did as a leading actress in Hollywood's glamor-based Golden Era. The nose is so beautiful? So photogenic ?? The film is relatively small and runs a little bit in an hour. Though the director feels that he is worried, he felt better to keep the garbage smaller.
