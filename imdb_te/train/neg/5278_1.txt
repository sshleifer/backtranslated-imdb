A comedy movie is back to its backstage soundtrack when you know that you're not dealing with a top-notch image. I rented this movie, some wanted to get the cookie, but overall I enjoyed all the pictures of our laughs. <br /> <br /> Some of the cinemas may be delayed. First, comedy is painful. Physical clothing is poorly displayed and kept. The fat guy in the movie wants to kill us, but to bless him to try the scene and scene, but he is like a puppy who begged for love. Everything might be bearable if he pulled from the film. There are some funny jokes, I believe a steal of one of the group's parental porn movies stole and it becomes gay romantic. But the best comedy up to the whole I'll say the gag opening for the fat kid. <br /> <br /> Oh, BTW, there are two good things that the film has to have. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time without renting this movie, which did not appeal to me and I Sya a part of the audience (18 males).
