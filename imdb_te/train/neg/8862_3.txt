Christopher Lee punk sunglasses on the pair and tries to insert into a punk rock club, you know you got a stinker in your hands! This film is capable of. One of the best scenes in the mud is that it is not a very interesting thing. The final product is, however, a real mess. Along with gratuitous nudity and some attractive women, the Harring II winds are a ludicrous pretext for the horror movie. Christopher Lee gave it a nugget of loyalty, but he could not make it to the worst. <br /> <br /> When you have never seen other films in this series, this reviewer is considered to be a real continuation of events on a part of the face. We start off with a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight a coven of werewolves. The film is very good, and there are not many dead spots. There is action; It is not well illustrated. A bright spot is the music of the punk band Babel. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this image. First, the acting is worse than the pictorial. Christopher Lee is good enough, but it ends. Reeb Brown and Annie McEnroe are the two main characters that you do not have for those characters. The writing is damaged, editing repetitive, and amateur amateurs. There are a couple nice special impact gimmicks, but the cheesy ones weigh them in the number away. Cybely dancing looks good, but her acting performance is less than satisfying. Zad Woman sees the role he plays, but his voice and acting are unbelievable to say very little. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <I always enjoy true believer stories for the war of seemingly invincible forces of evil. A scene where even a small group of good guys are shooting down a bunch of trekking and werewolves in a dark forest is also kind of exciting. Something like that. Perhaps a big budget or a good director was able to make the rest of the film a bit more compelling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Side note: As of this work, Sensors at youtube.com are on the top of the page while playing Sylw Donn's inexpensive Babel song! Catch it when you want it!
