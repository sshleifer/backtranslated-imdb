I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and it tasted a lot of tape tape. <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> While reminding me to tell the story of the character through a story, it is very hard and almost ruthless, put on top of the soundtrack of the movie and does not seem to fit in. Jaq's version for a man is a major Example: He stops at one While walking around eating and adding some little quips here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was for the longest! And in the ballroom, the old Barn dance type is country music.Although this story is set and writers forget it. <br /> < Art and animation in Cinderella 2 is not even scratched by the original. Ryu is less descriptive <br /> <br /> Film is also a story of my own, I think it's already there, I can not say I hate it, but I believe it has a lot of errors. This beloved Cinderella looks to downgrade in an important way from the original.
