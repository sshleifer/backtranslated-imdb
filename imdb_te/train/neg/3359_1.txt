They screwed this story! Eventually Nell is all heroic and takes the team to protect their donkey from Hill House and such a ball is irrelevant! They knocked the heads, cut the crowds, and the roof turned to a big hand! What about hell ??? I love the original picture and love it, I read the book and I love it! The original picture and the book are so great because it is very scary you even without showing the ghost. There is no gore. No roof is hand. The ghost announcement that ghosts can really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking all the senses of security. Nell is a selfish woman. She wanted only good things for her. Yes, she has little concern for others, but not too much. David Nane and John De Bunt have taken a trick in this great story! I hate this damn remake!
