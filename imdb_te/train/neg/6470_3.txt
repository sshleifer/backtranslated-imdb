Disney has seen so many times that anyone who seemed to be wildly emerging Disney saw the original LITTLE mermaid. Their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric Plan, celebrate the introduction of King Triton. This festival was quickly crashed by Ursula's sister Morgana, who hopes to use Melodi as a means of protection for the king's trident. <br /> Stopping this attack, Ariel and Eric built a wall around the sea, but Melody is wondering why she can not go there. <br /> <br /> This video of the horror and horror is a direct reference to the sequel. Little Mermaid 2 Everything you see seems to be coming directly to other Disney films. I think I can only drive Disney! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include rebuilding between Sebastian and Louie, the Royal Chef. They were drunk! <br /> <br /> The climax between Morgana and everyone seemed another upset. <br /> <br /> I do not give anything away, but in 75 minutes, everything seems too narrow and too much to deal with. Embarrassing to Disney, the Little Mermaid 2 is good for renting and laughing. Then you will sink later that Disney can prepare for the rest of the other sequels.
