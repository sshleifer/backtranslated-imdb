Someone has a great idea: Missy Mundey of Lasi Croft will make his own, R-Rated version. It's really great idea. The problem is that no script or budget that can support the public can not come any way. Hence, we have a "movie" which reaches the medium length of several parts (often in slow motion) and is clearly shot in a garage. Misty Munday appeal is still obvious: she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl-next-door beauty. Nevertheless, there are two female co-stars here and she is no longer in the league with whom she shares a long lesbian scene. When "Mommy Rider" is presented as a YouTube video, I would rate it, but it does not get more than 4 1/2 as a "movie" for DVD use.
