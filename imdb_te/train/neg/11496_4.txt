A documentary featuring one of the most darkest places in Guatemala. A fun and safe shot ... but a sad place where a group of sex workers have been meeting for more than a week to play in a soccer team! The main purpose of this documentary is to prove that these "workers" are refusing society, even though these poor women have never achieved any solution. Instead of exploitation for this reality showlog documentary, It has its own documented reality ... But there is nothing to do with the main storyline of sin. I do not agree to see it again; But I would recommend it for general cultural purposes.
