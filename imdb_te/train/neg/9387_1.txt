I saw it when the film was first released. After about forty years, I remember how I stayed with me. I did not want to believe my feelings about the film when I saw it, and I reviewed a film review that was published in a big metropolitan newspaper the next day, and the reviewer wrote that the film is negligent, unwieldy, and unbearable. A small researcher finds that the producer is a husband of Star Leslie Cuoron, which begins with the horrifying film of Neoptism. Motion picture producer of various potential actors such as Karen, Warren Oats, Skunkman Crotter, Gloria Graham, and James Socking suggests that it has some promise. But the film's death is attributed to its horrific screenplay. "Mystery" was caught and the scene from the scene to the scene was very low throughout the film. The film is cracked between a detective mystery and a spying thriller, but no more than one. The feeling of suspense is totally absent. The main characters resolve to play dry and emotional forms in a fashion that inspires any kind of empathy. Cinematography is paved. The resulting weird lover letters, plots, and finally, loses interest in the film. I am surprised that there is no reform of this tragic image available for purchase. If I find the TCM print of this film and it's safe to broadcast that is slipped to 4:00 am slot.
