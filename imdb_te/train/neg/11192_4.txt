I am not impressed with this film. Originally it was called Sin Eater, and considering all that the last half of the film was considering. I do not even know what to do with the first 20 minutes of the film. It is very slow and chooses Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main characters. <br /> <br /> If these are all things in the Catholic religion, I will check it out, even if the Exorcist or Stigmata does not expect this movie. It will surely come after a few days and the word comes out.
