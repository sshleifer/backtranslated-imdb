If the derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, you're in for a rare trust ... They can not really appeal to me, so I can not find any thing to redeem this strange story. This looks like something else in the 1980s, and it was a different age and it went straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer make a weak script and a tedious scenario work. But what was Gillian Anderson last year doing to film such a movie after the brilliance of his performances on the BBC TV adaptation Lady Deadlock of Bleak House? The director is said to have been influenced by his work on a close rape and documentary, but this was not a strange scene where rural hounds drove Paris Dyer. I do not think I'm the only person smiling. Film Four and Verve Pictures - I do not understand the involvement of companies behind the film. In recent years both have participated in great independent British films. Verve Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road Distributed - No need to mention the same crystal. FilmFour and Verve take note: Is it really the best you can do? What can be done by independent British filmmakers in your artistic judgment? This is a big slot in both your reputation. Listen carefully: Did you hear thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair?
