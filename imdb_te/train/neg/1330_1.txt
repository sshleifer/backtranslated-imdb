Jay Leno has a reason why he does not recognize this movie. It is consistently one of the worst films of all time. Acting is terrific, the script is not directed and the director does not know exactly how to take this film. "A buddy movie," "an action / comedy," "mystery." Halfway through the path will be revealed, he gives, and just along for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a shame that they will waste their time and gifts to make this mess of a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morritas spent their crafts in the Hollywood circuit before being tied to them. Morita has already acted as a star in her own right, starring as a star of fictional TV and movies, such as "Happy Days" and "Mr. T and Tina" since the mid-1960s. And a powerful film, "Midway," "Karate Kid," and other American stars. Mr. Leno can be seen on the TV show of the mid-70s. Best Actor in American Comedy Clubs He can be seen in countless TV places and major films. It's a shame, they agreed to look at this nonsense.
