Over the weekend, I saw this film and I was always impressed with the aesthetic and polish of church-structured films, I was disappointed, failed to report to the members and quit the researchers with questions that are not answered. <Phrase> <br /> The film is 70 minutes short of life in the life of Joseph Smith. The real life story is not because there is no true arbitrary story. Joseph performs good deeds, plays baseball, running races, laughing with children, and often sloooow on the move. What a great, just kind of guy that is just Jose, huh? Look at him as his wife rammed for Emma. Well, how are his 33 plural wife's rugs? Nothing is made of polygamy. <br /> <br /> This film is on such flaws as the flinders. It provides very little information and abandons critical thinking, so why is Joseph's tough and thirsty been imprisoned and why does the crowd want to kill him? The tremendous treasure of Hermum of Joseph and Carlage of the Climax Course of the film (crossing the original United Nations of faces that are encountered from the gateways of Nauva). But there was no mention. The Smith of Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and its press did not destroy the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience is left wondering whether to come to the surprise or to feel more dependent on the church's dependence. <br /> <br /> Joseph declared war laws and called for the Nauwa army. <br /> <br /> I did not expect this church to be a constructive film to demonstrate Richard Bushman's recent biography of Rough Stone's Joseph. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that any material has been presented. Two examples came out of me. The first, Mormon Book of Translation. The film shows Joseph Reading right off their golden plates in their two Ring Binders, the tiles in reality are very much hidden from the site. Joseph buried his face in his hat and translated his translation, where it would be better to walk at the siren stone. The second flaw in the cartage is in jail, where the mob storms cell. The History of the Church reported that Joseph had a six-shooter, and a few rounds of firing in front of the window and giving a masonic signal of the suffering (reported in Times & Seasons). <br /> Although filmmakers have created a heartbeat that shows the reality of the gun, they have been reluctant to history, and they have failed to show Joseph what he really is: with a gun and the ability to save himself. In fact, the film is a good man, but also a hit maker, thrown in prison, and finally murdered by cold blood. He was a long way off; Joseph is a disciplined and determined person who struggles with a lot of confidence and struggles. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, but know that it is cotton candy. <br /> <br /> PS: Church-produced films do not have any credits, but seasoned eyes can choose faces that are familiar. Rick Massey plays a cranky Methodist minister who has failed to show the Christian love of a young seeker following the Truth, where Thomas is loved as Thomas, finding faith in Christ such as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold.
