I start to say that I have been enjoying some bad Italian horror film or wild robbery since the 1970s. Seriously. <br /> Martino has many elements that are trying to do injection, and none of them will work (except for Crock-gone-wild thing). Where there are some innocent westerners who set up a resort in the forest. I do not even remember where it happened ... how sad it is ... basically, people come to the resort to look at this local tribe and its celebrations, but in the end they go to the river 'Alligator God' on a rampage, killing tourists and some The tribes said. Good, yes? Well, do not get your hopes up. There is little violence until the end, with special effects it is like a kindergarten class performed and thrown love story laughing. In a pool underwater a camera is up and a toy alligator, like a dart, threw in the water and attacking the gator. I'm not kidding. In another magnificently crafted special effect, a match box van aimed at the stunning sinking plastic gator aimed at suddenly five times the size of the van. (A few minutes ago, he was big enough to eat a human, but now he dwarfs full size cargo van ...) It's really curious. I think other heroines are very bad, what does Bruno Matte's work, "rats", and plastic rats on the conveyor belt and what's the scare. /> <br /> Normally I see Sergio Martino must be a solid but this is a must pass. Must not buy for $ 15 + sticker price from Shame number. <br /> <br /> These ten children 2.
