I sat in a boring theater as hell and wanted to leave half of the film. The plot is typical of 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings. So they have to bring a date to get married. <br /> <br /> The most dirty thing is the so-called crude jokes ... they were already discouraged, strangely and thrown with your face. The acting was lower-average and I thought about the film not just about a group of unhealthy jokes and speculative stories. <br /> <br /> More than anything, one of the worst pictures I've seen <br /> <br /> Unjust, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br />
