The joke is the largest in the world. <br /> <br /> Imitation of humor in 'brush' and 'office space', the movie entered the appeal of the film and was appreciated by writing legal jurisprudence books. The legal secretary asked the audience to play an unfamiliar role, and was then associated with the legendary hero of the story. <br /> <br /> The whole cinema is listening to music, listening to music, and working on the novel. These are his aims. When you can not imagine slap in the face (around half) they have a job which he will fit three of those standards, but then UP gives! The director and story writer (Jacob Cornbl√ºth and Josh Cornblob) can stimulate audiences to stimulate audiences entirely, or even ridiculing a prophet who has been complaining about his absence. <br /> <br /> The main stumbling block, legal secretary insider comedy fails because they every time they clearly explain to the audience that they happen. Without these sides, audiences do not notice anything special. Humor is only effective if the funny audience does not need to fully explain it.
