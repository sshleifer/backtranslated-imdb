This film is just a shame. Orlando, Florida became a more recognized filmmaker (such as increasing the popularity of Vancouver). The Brothers filmed in Central Florida, and this short film made a little bit of anxiety over the area (with indie film walking in Africa and with great HBO Miniceries from Earth to the Moon). I try to be honest as possible. I thought it was a perfect place for the Orlando film The Brothers. It is possible to give a new spin on the 'boy band' craze. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But due to the weak script, the Brothers will come a long time. <br /> <br /> The main characters have evolved almost (this might be Amyther actors, but some of them are definitely the way the script is written). <br /> <br /> Even the issue of choice jokes. Jokes are very recurring (they are funny first time, but it is a bit boring). <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes in "concert" scenes are poorly performed (and these scenes do not seem to move the story anymore). <br /> <br /> I have a lot of hopes in this regard and disappointing. I hope it is best for the upcoming feature based on this shortcode. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Fig is to move different generations (quickly). Humor is not his strong suit. But, he is definitely one of the more famous filmmakers in the Orlando area (which is not just as infamous, but is currently unknown) with his determination. <br /> <br />
