If you're the kind of movie goer that enjoys the original content and brilliant suspense ... then look elsewhere, kids, the reason Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm eloquent than I am, but ... wow ... it's bad. Charles Tanya is a favorite home while I'm enjoying it, she has deteriorated, and then he's walking. Where is his car? Anyway, do not see it, folks. I really want to be unique, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. One man was cut with corn. Proverb lines up the "wazoo" proverb. It did not see. Wait, I'll take it back! See it for the guest role of Stephen King, author of the cemetery. He is really cool. King also provided the best performance of the film, with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Pearlman. But, than that ... Wow ... bad.
