Oh I need it, another film about the 19th century England. Like the usual England, no one has ever destroyed football stadiums. Lords, Dames, and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsborough In this lovely setting, like Jane Eyre, no one ever reads from the novel. In Mr Rochester's manger she tries to see a French girl from time to time to find a blank chalbor. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on an auto-pilot) fell in love with Zen, but his fruitcake wife's subject was still locked up in the attic. Hmm, it was not in the pamphlet. After some people were thrown and some carefully spread (they probably rented the set), the end of the film was finally over. All looked really authentic, something I was expecting. But again, oh.
