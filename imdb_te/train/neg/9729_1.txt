Seriously, what is this? Hooper created classic films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, when he made a terrific film of this god, what happened? Will he break a little more? The film is entitled Sam, who has the ability to set things in the fire (Firestarter, for anyone?) The acting was God, the plot was the worst, and the special effects were much worse, they saw something from the 70s. Van Dumm√© should be proud that Deeride is not the worst ever, and what is the ending? He began to glow in blue, became a glowing blue blob, his friends sucked out of fire, and the movie ended. What is it Huh? <br /> <br /> When the movie was over, I thought it was Spontaniously Combust to save me from my reaction to the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
