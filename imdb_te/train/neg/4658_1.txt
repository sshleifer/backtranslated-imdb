Brief announcer is a deadly and nonsense remake of David Lean Classic in 1945, based on Noel Coward's play "Still Life". A doctor removes grout's cell from a woman's eye at a railway station, where he has a painful relationship, and she is happily married to Italian ancestor social worker. On another occasion they are at risk, make an instant appeal and arrange for each Wednesday to meet each other. The couple fell in love, but after a few afternoons they realized that they were not happy with any real possibilities. Coward's original one-action drama will make two common people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, the two superstars and the veterans of Hollywood Epics, are not the 'common people'. Particularly Loren's misconceptions - it is not true that Sofia Loren is working as a volunteer service activist for a short time in Citizen Advisory Bureau, like one million dollars in full design. Burton does not get your average general practitioner, wearing cut hair, colorful hair, very makeup and stage venues. You can not really blame them after dealing with their wives. Burton is married to a literary critic who spreads poisonous reviews in the evening and deals with her husband's utter contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Headley, is housed around the house all day and is boring in the end: the most exciting thing he has done is dealing with nearly six years ago. Their last sequence stimulates nausea ("You'll be long, far away", etc.). The great British job actor, John Lemessarier, has a three-minute guest appearance as a friend of Burton, and appears to be a little alcoholic when he speaks his voice in a voice that is just heard. It's a sad and unforgettable appearance in the tedious, awful rehash of a movie classic. Avoid all costs.
