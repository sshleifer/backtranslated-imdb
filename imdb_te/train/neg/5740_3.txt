I found Darkness very dark. It's a cool idea and some ambitious ideas, bad action sequences and a kind of some elegant moments you make to go to UGH! However, it was confused. You do not really know what's happening in the dark scenes and the movie that has been filmed in the Super 8 movie, you are already dealing with that nasty grain. Like Nathan Schiff's movies, it's much more. Director Life Zancer looks to be the original film, but he does not know how to do it. The camera has never been seen in the right place, lacking any fundamentals to how to shoot simple conversations and how to hurt the film. All of the actors are pretty disparate and guaranteed. But despite these disadvantages, the music is great, gore is plenty and from the crazy flower to the really good accessories. Is this classic? What is the value of the two prizes worth of praise? NO. But this is a good first attempt. Now these guys are back at this moment (from what they've understood after they're done), back again, and try again, they can do better.
