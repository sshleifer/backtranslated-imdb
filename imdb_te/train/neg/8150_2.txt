If you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so, then this is ok to see. It's not really bad, really. Yes, I got more errors in logic than I care to explain and people's tolerance may be taxed - like me, I accept - those who are inclined to throw things on TV during the occasion, but it is at least funny. <br /> If you read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmere - maybe you'd probably be avoiding the best. I read them all and I deny it when I see this film. I've described it in detail and trash in a great length on another site. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> If this reads the book, then Submit your comparisons and your judgment.
