<br /> <br /> This astronaut is in there, he goes into space with two more people, do you know me? Except for anything, he is exposed to radiation, and when they come back ... Well, do not imagine what happened to other people, but our astronauts were melt! No, just do not burn, but MELT! Like ice cream cone in July! <br /> <br /> Anyway, he is red & nesting, and the fact that he is melting is not the fact that makes him really mad. I also checked the "melting man" handbook because he had to eat the human flesh so that he could not completely dissolve, so he began to intimidate people. <br /> <br /> In a film where other characters, but one man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any other? What's the most important thing to do after the WHO, and what of them remain? How long will it take for him to dissolve? Why was this film in first place? Where did you earn money? <br /> <br /> "I'm very slow, but this film is very nice, gross, makeup is fine but the rest is ... SPLAT
