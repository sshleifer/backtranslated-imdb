I mean the word "pedestrian". The filmmakers have forgotten what's happened. Faith Domagog can do better than this. She is the mysterious and venerable Cobra goddess who is torn by love for Marshall Thomson (a thought, eh?). Instead, she is a regular household owner of her fifties, and single, flat expression is worn throughout her film, and believes that Faith was shot dead in the morning before her coffee. For the rest of the cast, they are all excited by the enthusiasm of "All-Americans". It is more constructive in Wall Street in "The Cat People". I should be "Cobra's Culture" really called "Contract Obligation Cult". Why else are the talented people slipping on their way, even though they are slow-moving, predictable, and failing?
