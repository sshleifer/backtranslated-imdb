I saw this film with great Doctor Uwe Bol, who attended the Edmonton International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie is very bad. And, the usual Uwe boll is "not really, it's really fun", but just plain bad. The plot does not get a job that leads to a terrible life (apparently because of the past criminal record), and the story of a fated 900 pound fraud. This man changes his cult-leader in a plan to steal the load of trucks containing a bird flu virus. Al Qaeda has models to steal toys, and it is only two hours totally incomprehensible to sex and violence. Acting is terrible (except Dave Foley), jokes always grow on top of the children filmed in the chest in slow motion, and take a poo to the people. <br /> "Airplane!" But the creators of South Park, and without any jokes.
