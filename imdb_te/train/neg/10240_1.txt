I love all kinds of movies, especially horrors. It is said that Survival does not live in any of its neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> I can not give any points on the original. It is wrong to explore the same themes or recycle others. It became a cop to take us on a slazer voyage by indie movies, forests, a crazed killer, and finally throwing some crazy family. I would like to compare it to the likes of Texas Chainsaw and Wrong Turn (though twist in that turn is clear) and others. Survival comes up against comparable images. This plot is no real. Some pictures can be obtained with a weak (and up-to-date) plot, featuring amazing acting, exclusive FX or other factors. There is nothing in the bank for Survivial. If you like, note the following: not in the movie. I do not blame or blame those actors, or director. Conversation is the best, and the actors have never performed (not to mention) the talent it has removed. I mention 2 stamps. The veteran in this movie will have a look perfectly, but he needs to consider further training to get ready for a film. <br /> <br /> The actor who played the role of Greg also had the probability, but we could not see anyone (why do not you believe in the movie?) <br /> <br /> Graveni Film Look. Oh yes, the little bid making a magic film designed to take us in the fame of the "Grindhouse" films. In today's film production, it has become a gimmick. It works or it does not. In this case it will not work. There are too many errors to occur, so the attention and attention from this movie are not added to it. I'm saying, I think I've done a good job of adding that grain. It's some good, quality grain. I'd like to try another "grindhouse" attempt with a different script, better direction and possibly actors. <br /> <br /> Until tech things, in my opinion, they never impressed me. The improved attention audio (which had gone straight into the camera, but there was nothing wrong with that) and was portrayed on DV, which was very tender to my taste. It's all I say .....
