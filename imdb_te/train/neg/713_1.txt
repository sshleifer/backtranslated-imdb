Can you say everything first? I felt very strong about this movie, and I reviewed it individually for IMDb. And my review? <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is interesting - Nazis, occult, time travel, but these films can not be properly combined. Do you remember the mannets of Family Guy using 'idea balls' episode of South Park? Have these writings also written unholy? With this the author wants to add all the different ideas like this, but it is not known how to combine all of them, and then to understand less of things, Danny Darco-Esquire Time travel plot and chronicles the chronological order <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> "Special effects are a bit less budget than direct to DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm proud of Nazi paintings, they are crazy, but the evil Nazi butcher is just a joke. <br /> I'm not against this film or anything, but to be honest But not for the horror genre, but the movie is not a thriller or drama.It is a good movie if it is well known, but it's a hype Indi. Waaaaay hype over.
