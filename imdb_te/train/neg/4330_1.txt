Last night I decided to watch the prequel or prelims called Carlito's Voice - "Carlito's Way: Power to Rise (2005)" It went directly to the DVD ... No wonder .. it's totally .. and I totally understand S% & KS! It's time to waist and I think it's a pure waist of writing time ... I agreed with this sh # t-fest production de Palma of the film ... I'm just covering my hat ... the role of young brigant Jay Hernandez, who plays ... In The Nero Godfather II, I find out how Brando's shoes got Don Carlion to play the role of young Don Carroon De Niro has made a difference ... but it was fantastic and even got an Oscar !!! Jay Hernandez is very guts for he's trying to get a young Pacino .... I do not think he will not play in the movie anymore and I see this sh # $ ty film, I sit down and get the original carlitos way to get the bad taste from my mouth watched.
