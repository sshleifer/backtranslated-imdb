Oh, my goose ... I have seen CBS primetime television shows <br /> <br /> Gerald seemed macarani <br /> <br /> Four people control a crazed mind <br /> Computer. <br /> I saw one of its many titles "Gray Matter", which is a recent memory in the worst films. <br /> The reviews are right, it's awful. <br /> <br /> The shots appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> I can not stress how terrible it is. <br /> It's physical abuse, some gun violence, lightweight <br /> Gore, some obscenity, and some adult conditions
