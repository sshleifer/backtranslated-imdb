This I have seen in a long time. When I was looking for "28 Days After" and "Magnolia", I hated a lot of movies. Gillian Anderson left the road beside the road and did not have any method unless the word "F" used every word of the dialog used at least one "F". It's two times. It has very little acting and has a very low budget. My friend and I finally picture off half an hour later. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crude. Do not look at it !!!
