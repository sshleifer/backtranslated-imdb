"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for Interpol Bureau's London branch, which specializes in specifically (I think) the occult criminals. <br /> <br /> The bureau attracted a satan from 17 California, Hyde (not associated with Dr. Zekel). Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD will go to England to bring him back to the US. Lutz's connection to previous Witchcraft films, played by Stephanie Beeton in midwife 9. Lutz played by another woman. In 6, Lutz was a man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lutz ' Despite her high heels and small skirts left behind, she still exposed a tops. And this time she has nude and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> As always, there are many sex scenes. There is a deadly threesome with an anonymous clown two vampires, a satanist and head vampire to some people, Lutz is an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, is absent in this regard, but Lutz refers to him as the bureau of the 17 Agent Dixon in the conversation about the vampire. She telephoned her partner Detective Garner (Part 6, 7, and 9), but we can not hear the end of his conversation. <br /> <br /> The Rao headed vampire group Hyde is redeemed from prison, for a Walpurgis ritual that has something to do with God called Marsheba (I think). Hyde presents all his lines in a very flat manner, while Raven makes a camping degree. <br /> <br /> The audio from the film is pretty poorly recorded and not properly edited. In addition, some dialogue lost music or sirens. Cinematography is not great. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good at Celeste, but the film in the UK is actually an actor. Attractive, absolutely, but more importantly she is easily the best actor in the film (even if the bad fighting sequences). I am very surprised that her filmography is very small. <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available on its own or DVD. <br /> <br /> "Collection Hunter with Hitchcock XI and Two Unrelated Movies.
