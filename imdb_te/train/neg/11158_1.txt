What a terrible, terrible picture. I have seen for a long time. I saw a lot. I left the screaming theater after 40 minutes in search of a sturdy drink to relieve my nerves. Meryl Streep is as terrible as ever. How many deaths and torture expressions can have 1 person? Aidan Quinn's talents - often - completely waste. And who told Gloria Estefaan that she could do? The movie is trying to be politically correct and executes racial stereotypes. (Brave beginner isolated music teacher teaches violin to underprivilegded children in poor neighborhood school). The kids are not even beautiful! Just written in accordance with the terrible script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me one time. This is a real scary!
