Well, the story of the 'Indians' in the story is not just plain. I agree that Elvis is good here, but yes, his skin color is changing in the film. I'm thinking, ok, ... he's never been tan in real life. It's some of the obvious brownies 'Indian' decoration I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is Jewish and Italian-American actors who are 'F-Troupe' and 'Indians' on the old Hollywood Westerns rather than real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> The film is okay, but usually the lame story and the usual songs, like all of Elvis's films. Colonel Parker made him the longest film contacts to make Elvis's money as much money as possible as he did! I think Elvis never stopped doing long movies ever after this film and thank you 'thank God'. It is character actor Jon Blondel, Katy Jurado, L.Q. The film features Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' makeup is completely AWFUL. It's definitely the worst of the bunch. What are the filmmakers thinking? Is Mr Meredith doing a lot for money or just for this? I love some Elvis movies, though. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. <br /> <br /> I also love the future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, who play Elvis City Doctor, 'Change the Habit' <br /> I love Elvis. Thank you very much!
