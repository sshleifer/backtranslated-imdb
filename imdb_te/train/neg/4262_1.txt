It's just the worst picture I've ever seen. It lasts 2+ hours, and the box art is completely misleading. My friends and I rented it because we believe it's a 300's of the poor. Nothing is funny about this film, only pain. Then, the film starts, and they speak a different language. We 'oh it's only the beginning.' But there, the picture from the plummets of the film and nothing becomes more like a super boring book you've read in grade school, where the literal hours will take place, and the battle scenes are the two kids struggling over a playground. Cinematography will be abandoned and the movie will be in the trash compactor. Such films will lead to the world of viewing in Wall-E, which is a good way through the way.
