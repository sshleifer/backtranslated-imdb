This image is pure ganols. Mom always say if you can not say anything nice ... but even Mom I guarantee this film I like this movie. <br /> Others would say that I have to do my part to warn Jeffrey Rush wishes just go away. I hope Greg Kinner has shot his agent .. From a cannon to give the script. Then Ben Stiller probably prayed to the pyramid, "Still someday about Mary." I was always a fan of Wes diegi, so you probably could not recognize the movie with him because he wore a mask by the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts with promisingly with a stylistic cinematography sphere of Batman Films and then just like something like a coherent plot ... and loses half decent effects. Before the punchline comes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An hour telegraph, and even then they will fall flat. <br /> <br /> You see the potential exploitation of the comic book world "Chasing Amy". <br /> Run! "Mystery Men" should not come out of it!
