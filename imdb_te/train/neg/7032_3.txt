When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) looks towards her brother's death, she begins to suspect something badly than "natural causes". As she approached the truth, she became alarmed by her sister-fitia (Hellga) and local devotees. <br /> If you are in silent, satinic-themed movies, black candles offer a lot of money. The film is full of nudity and traditional soft core sex. A scene involving a young woman and a goat is especially important for belief. Unfortunately, not all sleaze black candles in the world can not be saved. The whole image is a whole bore. Other than a scene already mentioned, many sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Acting is the best place. Even the favorite favorite of the genre hell will give a disappointing performance. The plot does not really matter. Its main task is combined with lazy romantic scenes. I'm familiar with another movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraas. Compared with its Daughters of Darkness, combined with romance and horror, the Black Oddus of Apprentice comes in. 3/10 about the best I can do.
