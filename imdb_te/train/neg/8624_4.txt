Performance is not great, the story is filled with simple turns and transparent characters. It is about the Moroccan people living in Antwerp in Belgium, the right-side Flemish Black Voters on one side and the consequences of the fight on the other side. Is it political analysis? Which of these is the Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer two questions (the director's questions are also expected). However, some scenes can be a kind of Ken Loach film in Antwerp. After all, this city has been struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between the Femish Black Party's initial position and various populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and unfortunately this is not a success. Still, it tells a story about a real and complex situation in present-day Belgium. Seeing some foreign audiences should try and enjoy it and Belgium is not the most important backward film in the 2000s, but the social divide lines. </ P> Dongen
