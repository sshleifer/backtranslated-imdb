I searched the video story everywhere to find this movie, and I was an Elvis fan, and I was disappointed. Kurt Russell has many "Elvis movements" and voice simulation is great, but dubbing in Elvis's singing tone did not work for me. Voice has not always matched with Russell's notion, and it is difficult for me to lose a plot due to the sadness that it is noticeable. Also, there are so many freaking variations in the film, people who probably do not know much about Elvis will probably think of them the facts. When he was wrong with his first guitar, he was buried in an unmarked tomb that his brother Jesse did not bury, not with the big headstead of Jesse Garrow. I know this is just a movie film, but they have crossed some important scenes, such as the ones that came back and some scenes were dragged out for a long time. If you want to see a good image that shows Elvis in his main rental it's a different way, or another Elvis concert. The only way to see his unique talent in real Elvis's earliest hearing and seeing. (I know the brilliant statement, but still ... go out and rent a good Elvis flask.)
