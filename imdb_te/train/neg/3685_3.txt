The main reasons for "red eye" are Rachel McAdams, a stellar performer and an assistant hotel manager. On the other hand, Sillian Murphy is going to be very hard to become a cartoonist. <br /> <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is harder to deal with the holes, and I will explain about it. <br /> If you do not know what happened, do not read more! Summary of the plot. Rachel McAdams' role (Lisa) operates a hotel where the new hard-hood homeland security director plans to make that night live. Although Rachel returns to Miami for funeral, she will make fielding calls from her assistant until the aircraft flees. At this time, someone was ready to kill him when his father, Joe (played by Brian Cox), was out of the house and called Silly Murphy (Jackson). <br /> <br /> There are plots holes or absurd races here from a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to Lisa, the hotel and the director's suit to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> Jackson Eventually Lisa calls to call, and in the middle, the phones in the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to call her herself, but coincidentally, a guy from Jackson is calling and calling him to bang his phone to indicate that he is dead. <br /> <br /> Jazzan catches the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At one point, Jackson's head-baskets Lisa and she, in fact, knocked down ... but only 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Jazzson (exceptionally large) writes a note on the mirror in the mirror, and he bang her a bit around. <br /> Surprisingly, 11-year-old girl is the only person who can listen to anyone. Liza meets the race with a pencil in the gas when landing landing, steals his cell phone and performs a mad dash, seats and walks between the 18 rows of standing commuters. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that his throat is a passenger with a pen, Flight Attenders are locked up by opening the door to the jet-way. Okay, all that's reasonable (if not very rarely). But here it is where it really gets stupid. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is a cell phone signal (every major American airport has a great cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> <br /> She runs Jackson in hot pursuit. Security officials will not delay them. <br /> <br /> When Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport, walked out of the gate outside the terminal, his voice lost little from the pen in his voice, but he still understood something. However, Joe does not bother to shoot his man outside the house. (PS: There is no train in Miami airport, but what they have shown is terrible like Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> Lisa steals the car and goes away. During this time, when she went to make a call, the cell phone called "low battery" and was shut down soon (will stop using this early plot device?). <br /> 9. When the phone is still "low battery", the director and his family moved to the director and his family to save the room from the guided missile to the window on the 40th floor, opened by the director and his family on a sailing boat. In fact, they do not expect the hotel to be seen on the 3 sides of the ocean, so the missile may be opened at the first suite and there is no need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What is the story here? Is the hotel's actual room on the 38th floor of one of the same rooms in the hotel? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, everyone gets out of the missile hits. Joe goes home to save her father to see the killer outside Lisa. <br /> When she was traveling to her home (as she was going to her) she drove her jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood could find or bother to stop. Jack's come home and Jackson hits him (we can see how we can see ... maybe another head butt). <br /> <br /> Lisa is not killed by both, but he is not killed because Lisa is the first to die (give me a break on Saturday morning cartoons?). The rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she fights bizarrely. In fact the real killer (ie, played by Jason Statham) is the first 30 seconds with Lisa (or not the trained killer). <br /> <br /> In this chase, Jackson asks Joe at least once without hampering him to kill him. <br /> Finally, Jackson meets, and when he was killing Lisa (as you might expect) he was shot by Joe. <br /> Here's my advice ... Tell Wes Craven to frighten. Or he would have to live with Michael Bay (equivalent to Stupid "The Island") and "Red Island".
