This is a frenzy in the brutal guinea pig series. A younger-fashioned Japanese TV show has been abandoned after a mental perspective that has inspired in killing a young schoolgirl through the show. This is the smallest in the series, like all other movies in the story, practically without any story. A group of boys captured a young woman. They closed her and killed her while she was filming her. They beat her, pour the boiling oil on her, use the plaster on her and eventually raise the needle through her eye, in the "loving" closet. It is the most straightforward of all Guinea Pig films and is the first one. This is probably the film, more than anyone else, gave Guinea Pig laughing rumor. They are definitely the image of Nicholas Cage "8 mm." Inspired. These films are very popular in horror circles. They made more polished, such as "Naked Blood" but were evenly adapted to graphic films. They probably filled the vacuum of the Mondo films, turned it into a little clean and turned into reality TV. Not recommended, but it will probably attract the viewer once, and then I know why I did.
