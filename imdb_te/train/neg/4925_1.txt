Please do not waste your time. The film is reprinted by Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (Rock Music and Silly Biblical References) and Blade (High-Tech Toys). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are a lot of good stuff. But this is not a stinker. Soundtrack is also not helpful because film resorts are the reason for the ridiculous horror classical music than "kick-ass metal". Sometimes I did not hear any metal; Mostly violent violin. Avoid garlic and crucifixes.
