This takes cake, though I've seen good young wolf movies in my time. Comedy is better than horror, "Full Moon Hai" puts "C" in cheese-fest. The quality of the film is not bad. The way it is made is sent just to go downhill. 50-year-old American-American high school football player Tony plays the role of Adam Arkin, who is not aging due to the Toddolf bite in Transylvania. The most unpleasant part of the film is the violin player. He drives everyone's bag! Ed McMahon plays his own bullet with his ultra-conservative father. Adam's father plays a shrinking role that Alan is not on top of his game. This seems to be a long way since Tony's attack after years, and then he gets the chance to capture his state. Luck more than blood, the film opened in just 80s, "Teen Wolf" is an improvement! 1 in 5 stars.
