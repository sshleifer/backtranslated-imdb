When I was watching the film, I knew it was just a movie, but I allowed myself to encircle as many people as possible. We are mentally reacting to these tears, shouts, laughter, or audience members, yet we know that deep down, it's just a movie. Because of the quality of the film I can not make it in the above mentioned enzyme because I do not like to remind myself that it is a movie. The film director often chose to use multi-angled camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's me, but I should have this terrible vision and clear irritability. They may even run a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen reading, `Attention: It's just an image. Do not make yourself more or worse. If I want to be in 'film-film', I will activate it from my TV remote, but never in the film I would ever like to enjoy.
