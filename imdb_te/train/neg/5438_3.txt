I'm a fan of novelist / Michael Chaban. His novel "Wonder Boys" was a wonderful film of Kurtis Hanson. His master novel "Cavalier and Clay Amazing Adventures" won a Pulitzer Prize a few years ago and he has a much better comic book movie in the script of "Spider-Man 2". <br /> Director Rolson Marshall Thurber also directed a striking comic strip featuring gut-busting "Dodgeball" and intellectual short film series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". <br /> <br /> With a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it's like a no-brainer. <br /> It is. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster is portrayed as Art Bessstein, son of a large rubber (Nolte), who recently graduated in Economics. Joan is in the development of arrest: he has a minimum wage job at Book Barn, his girlfriend / boss has a fondness with Flax (Suwari), which is slightly more than the sums of sex, <br /> <br /> At a party One night, a former roommate introduces Joel (Miller), a beautiful, violinist. After that night they went up, and Joan asks him to move out of his emotional state in response to a question, "I tell you that I did not tell you a soul, and this night will get damaged." Jon then returned to her by looking at the faces of strangers traveling by herself And no one of them will be seen in the eye. <br /> <br /> The next day, Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland kidnaps Zonn from work and takes him to the steel mill immediately abandoned, and soon Jones, Cleveland and Jane spend every rush time, going to punk rock concerts, Doing and alcohol drinking. It pushes the jaw for a more personal relationship, and does not sit well with Flax, which allows her to meet his new friends and his father. The film tries to take us on the journey of Jon when he breaks the sounds imposed on him by his father, Flax and Cleveland, and his dead end job, which finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Jane. <br /> <br /> The problem we have to follow the zone across the picture: he is completely uninteresting. He has no goals, desires, or goals. He walks through Jane's invisible Vrithu life, described by the night they met. Initially it was not a problem. But he will never be interesting. He is a totally passive role. He only follows Bohemian Cleveland and Jane's, but does not give any indication that he wants to take care of himself or anyone else. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film and its supporting roles do not go anywhere and do anything for the party, have sex and get the arguments. In other words, there is nothing more about Ado about. Here we have nothing to do with the depth of the good image of the film. Jane's ambiguous actions at the same time were confusing at the same time as the obscene portrayal, simple homosexuals, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death ... "What's going on in the zone?" He asked. Yes, tell the zone. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" is the title they refer to as characters, because they are. They are all facets, one-dimensional stand-ins for real people. The film never permits us. We never know what to do with any of them. We'll see many things for them, but why do not we know. And the lack of "why" is one of the worst things that have a picture.
