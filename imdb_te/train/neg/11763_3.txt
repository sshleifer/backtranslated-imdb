Yes. I accept that. I believe in all the hype surrounded by the surrounding environment of about 6 trials and tribulations living in Mexico City related to sexual life. So I finally want to see a Mexican movie (in the ages) and it's interesting and interesting to see. Unfortunately the film is totally disappointing. This story provided us with two couples and very clear marriage problems. When the third couple comes into each couple's life, their problems reach a crucial point. Or absolutely irrelevant. The plot then turns into the battle of the sexes. The attitude taken by each group (yes, they are literally the girls, girls with girls and boys with girls) is blatantly stupid and childish (I guess there should be humor). And it will be worse bad. From performances to good (Miss Zavaleta) mediocre (Mr Bichir), Serrano is doing an acceptable job on his opera prima. However, in the flat conditions that show the plot, one-dimensional characters, and the very poor (otherwise stupid) perception of sexual maturity, the film fails. Badly. SPYL has a good reception at the box office (impressive). Believe the hype at your own risk.
