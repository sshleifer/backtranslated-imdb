Barbara Stanwick's 1933 "Stella Dallas" is not exactly right - if anyone thinks that partial-updated version of the story is now working, now real paslaler. Maybe they thought jauntty, cheerfully brash Bettle Midler could do something out of it, but this Hoorie script loses her. She has a shot in a good life because she can give birth to a married man and give her a year to a wealthy father of a girl, and can not escape the old fashioned trap and sentiment. Midler works best with his power-restricted film director, but it is not here; Stephen Collins was the man who changed his life, but the trio was cast as the daughter of Alvado Midler. It is used to refer to a "women's image", which is very confident in the foundations of 1922, because it does not. **** from * 1/2
