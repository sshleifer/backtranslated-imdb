<br /> <br /> I am going to admit to my mistake first. I did not realize it was designed for a TV movie. I was "thrown off" by "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is 40 minutes long. Direction and continuity are excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The film is down to the perfectly "chic flick" style. Despite some violent scenes, no violence should be called for a "R" rating. No nudity or inappropriate sexual scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. In the SG-1 series, Alla Graora, Christina Copeland, Sonya Saloma, and Glenis Davis were all guests, but the film did nothing to improve their career because they were supporting low-cost actresses. Robert Patrick is fantastic, he's usually and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin. I am not very challenged to show me the talents of the talented Megan Gallagher who came to respect the actor in the Millennium series. The great disappointment of this cast is Tracy Polon. Unlike a bottom-average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is totally annoying. I seemed to be muting the TV during her conversation. I would recommend this film to anyone enjoying the lifetime TV series. But I do not recommend paying any money to see this movie. I can not find anything that causes sensation, it's a movie that's only suitable for watching in TV, because nothing can be cut. As a TV movie I will rate it as 5 out of 10. I am rated as ten in a movie like "R" certification and strong cast.
