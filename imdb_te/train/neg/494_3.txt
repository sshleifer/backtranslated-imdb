"Classic" is a ridiculous comedy that spoofs about 50s "alien invasion" films, but not much better than the technical segment (good makeup effects). And any adultery is worse than its goal ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the drawn voice of aliens, you are begging for some peace and silence. (* 1/2)
