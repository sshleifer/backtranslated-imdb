It's very bad that I have to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some saves some time to view and do something more interesting, instead of looking at this "movie" ... nothing will do, Because I wrote a minimum of 10 lines, you also have a low budget movie, bad acting, no name actors, stupid mott wolf, and so forth ... ID is not the special effects are made in the style of the '80s. <br /> <br /> The film "Megalodon" is almost as bad as the movie. <br /> Enjoy! ;) (Not watching this movie)
