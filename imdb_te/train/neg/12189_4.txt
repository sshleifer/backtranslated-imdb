If I go to the distinctive grade level 71 is a C- or D so that's probably right, but this film is rarely just a simple thriller, except for slow and airy. A typical thriller is not realistic, but this attempt seems to be trying, and the rapped woman did not press her allegations because she did not want to cross a court, broke her arm and raped her in her life, protecting the lawyer who had feelings for her and her family Also come Iyadu. There are some other moral questions that are morally morbid to stay away from the film, but there are other ethical issues, such as whether you try to kill / beat a yoke before being illegal. Kady just can come up with something realistically Would be a bit absurd to be presented just a yoke just a yoke just out of bending just a crazed bastard justified justifying his family from waiting for the rape of his daughter. So now please waisted your life at least so I waisted more of my life for this stupid film and please do not see it so that my 2 1/2 hours or something does not understand.
