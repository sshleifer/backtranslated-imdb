The last good battle is usually a general promotional film. But there are a couple things that hurt me. The first ever injected subjects were used. On both occasions, Scott's character was one of the first when a Bombardier was a pilot ("s *% t") when the bomb started off its target at the bomb-off ("dammit"). I may be wrong about the second case but I have rebooted it several times and how it feels like I am. The character of Anne Shirley is the third case when the character of the O'Brien desires to be happy and good luck ("Give 'em hell") on the rod of engines. She should be considered too unladylike because she is clearly saying "heck". I also found a very interesting role that has moral problems with the bombing, especially the bombing of civilians. The Avonal High Officer assures me that military targets are only hit by the accuracy of the bomb used. We learned of Lemi's strategy after the Japanese town of Oblivion, the scene was not a minor irony. I remember Lema's quotation in McNamara's "The Fog of War", and I thought he would be a war criminal if America did not win this dispute. Ending with this image, is in the end. It reminded me at the end of the White Heat (I'm not looking at the movies, the end only!). Maybe this is the reason he 'blows. True good bloop up !!!
