It's a picture that says 2 things ... 1) I can do better than acting, writing and directing 2) It's very bad, I'll leave the review and warn others ... <br /> When it's shot with my flip video looks. I also believe that my friend, who told me this, had a tremendous reaction against me. I have seen some positive posts for this home video; Any band members or people with this image should be let out by the public. One of the worst films I have ever seen. Hopefully authors and directors will leave the business. There is no commercially enough expertise !!!!!
