I thought these films were depressing to predict that it was much better than I did. I'm glad I did not pay to see this movie and I do not sit in a movie theater for this. Where to start in the film, the acting is average, the humor is horrible and the overall storyline of the film is not unique. I thought this film was great, but it was not more than a cheesy waste of time. I think acting in this movie is terrible for the actors in this film, chemistry, it just is not. Perhaps we could have been better if we had a different actor than Kir Barrell but it would be good if I saw this film and I did not think that he did not act in the film. Now, Alice Eve has done a great job as an actress but she does not have chemistry between her and Jay. Not all the actors in the film are named and the film has little impact. The humor in this movie is not funny, some liners are right in this movie but nothing is worth to tell your friends. Jim Field Smith was very hard at work because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or comedy. I honestly think he should adhere to the commercials of Burger King. If the authors go to another director then I think this movie is good. The story of the film is just like every other hot girl like a love guy like the Love Story, I think it's good if it's more realistic, but nothing discouraged. Honesty does not recommend anyone going to see this movie. I think I would be more entertaining at the dentist than in this film. So save that pain and do not see it.
