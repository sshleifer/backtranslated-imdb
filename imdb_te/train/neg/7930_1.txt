This piece of garbage has been praised 60 years ago, but this is one of the most racist films made by local American Indians who played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart is a big racist in real life as his spouse John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart's actor, Hal Williams, removed Williams from being "the Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series). That's not bad enough, this film is very dating and boring. <br /> <br /> Stewart is in his forties after making this awful movie, and with his furious wig he is followed by pedophile after 16 years - Red Debra Paget. <br /> <br/10.
