All day I'm looking for dinosaurs, all day they have a single primary problem. <br /> They do not trust guns. They just do not seem to be _told_ about them or something. Bullets of dinosaurs _bounce_ off! Millions of years after the disappearance of Gunpowder, the laws of physics are just different ... Ah, no. Come on. If they are closer to chemically working today, they think fast (also subsonic) are the main projectiles. It's easy. <br /> <br /> See, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, crocodiles and crocodiles are completely exposed to basic gun firing. They are not magic. You can shoot a large pistol round to the back of the back. They do not take armor-piercing bullets or special ones. Small bullets penetrate them, but they can not kill them. Some (but not really) big bullets are preferred because the challenge (such as most games) kill the animal with one shot, so it will not run. <br /> <br /> You can easily repel the animals, including hunters. Among the noise, and even a deadly injury pain, many run away. Exceptions are large bears, fearful that they are simply angry by human traumatic events. Cape buffalo is considered to be the most dangerous because they are well charged when they are injured. We saw a video of a large buffet of Cape Buffalo, who preserves a calf from the whole lion of the lion. If a big cat can do it, it can not be charged as a final act of disappointment. T.Rex does not know that this spectrum is sufficient. Their behavior was not observed. With these larger animals, safe hunt can be used to run large and powerful projectiles and / or run them faster to deal with its charge. With a T.Rex, of course, it could be a serious problem. I have a big gun that I have seen and seen as a T.Rex skull (they're one of the museums in downtown). It may be a more favorable approach to breaking its neck with small fire. Smaller bullets will still be _penetrate_, so they do not bounce just because the animal is too big to kill! <br /> <br /> Here we have Cortez and his men (this is an American Mexican campaign, which is apparently famous) and decided to sacrifice the pyramid. The human sacrifices seem to have touched the blood of the pair T.Rexes fearing the continent in the day. Instead of cutting off their hearts, eating lizards, letting carteze and all Aztecs catch them and kill them. OK, maybe they do not have M-16s like boys in the "Carnosaur" series, but they have _do_ flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made of trees) and swords. Probably a little less disparate than soldiers with full auto, but they've done many boys and I'd quickly bet them a dinosaur. Oh, wait, about a _cannon_, 4-incher. It is only a ticket to devour Thrannosaras purur! Hence, men should scramble in the cannon and screech the first T.Rex using a beautiful brown girl. Cortez pointed out that they will not be reloaded from time to time, so they need to close the scope until they have some of their aims. T.Rex completely ignores the volley of their flipkock fire, and we see both a crossbot bolt and _bounce_ off the cannon ball! Forget this. End of credibility. A 4 "artillery ball can penetrate the layer of a wooden ship that can beat a crossbow bolt carteage and it will definitely come through the skull of any animal to ride on this planet, rebuck or the animal's skull.What a _whale_ a 4" artillery ball can resist? ) Here T.Rex is still standing, not even bleeding. So Cortez takes it into the valley, where it comes to the angles where this (I guess with magic) will kill it and kill it. Yai, drawn sticks! <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs can not be completely attacked by gunfire - they have a second eye with a gun. <br /> They kill a second dinosaur with a bomb from a pump filled with a gun and a gemstone. My money is still in the cannon. Targeted - This is the engineering work which focuses all the gunpowder's energy in one direction. A more expanded application of a bomb force. A _real_ bomber (a pump bomb) has the steel casing of explosion for much tension. (Think: Pipe Bomb vs Pfizer Cracker vs.) fire shot to fire and set fire to just POOF. (Trust me that.)
