The first thing to attract attention in "Ever Mozart for" is the lack of a plot summary in the IMDb. The narrative is easy to recall as the story, screenplay, plot or the minimum structure of the image is recalled. Jean-Luc Goddard is one of the most overrated and well-known directors in the film industry and this nonsense is one of his Hematic films. I do not understand any of this story. But there are intellectual intellectuals to justify or explain this outrageous movie and it's hard to read their reviews. <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Sepper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
