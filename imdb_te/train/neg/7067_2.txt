When one passes five passengers on a bus depot, they tell their frightening dreams. <br /> <br /> Lucky me, five bad movies for a price! Each segment has acting, special effects, and has the most worst in music. And did you think this was scary? Hmm .. I think the Teletubbies have been more freaked during an episode. I will make a promise, I'll sit there with those I love. No trouble. This will never do. In fact, I also stopped accelerating commercials, because they were more entertaining than the main character. And the ultimate cop out of the end. Yep, it did not happen. Only one day if I set my VCR to record this idol worship. 2/10
