I rented this on DVD and I feel kind of daasan and lugacy dictate about it in DVD comments. This is not exactly a bad movie, but it is one of those films that wants to make an in-depth comment on human nature, even if its story is practically not a genre. Plus, it is quite simplistic about the problem in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often causes confidence. I told you that if you do not have a movie / TV / Literature / Life of Life, you'll get something (to be honest, as I have seen almost the same story in horror comics). Otherwise, its point has been made more and more artistically. And it's a big problem, it really does not have a movie interest in the movie. It's the basic story is surprising and comprehensive, and it's very fair to invest in the idea that it really does not pay off.
