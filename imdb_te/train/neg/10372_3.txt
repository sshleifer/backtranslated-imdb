In the early 80's, I saw the first review review comment because I saw in the second running theater. I was impressed with the careful tailoring of the most closely dressed clothes after tennis drawings. But for me, the actors are bigger, their personalities have been hiding through the masks, but in the direction I am exceptionally stable, photography is different. <br /> <br /> At the time, the rating did not fall, "it's not worth sitting at once". <br /> <br /> Even though, I might also have a second form.
