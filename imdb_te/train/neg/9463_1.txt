A proper cocktail adaptation of the classic children's story does not have the charm of its fathers, but never has any talent. Mike Myers does not need to be ashamed himself for his awful performance, even if he breaks clear from what Jim Carrer has done. He is very annoying that you want to beat the worst out of him when he's gone right in the movie. Sets ugly and cinematography is very poor. This year I saw very bad pictures, but it only takes cake, but it's one of the worst films ever made.
