This film is perhaps one of the 2000's most boring drawings I've ever seen! Especially music people failed to create a suspense when suddenly disappears. Similar things like marshal can not be treated with the required intensity. The story also has issues: the United Nations is not allowed alone, because the UN, China, Russia, Japan and other countries do not allow the UN to bring the world to power forever. It will also play against anyone trying to take over the world that makes Nicola Carpatia. This is reminiscent of James Bond movies, that only have more action! Naturally, the film is made only for Christians and Christians and they can enjoy it. Since I can not count as a Christian, I have found the whole idea to be ridiculous. If the prophecy is still true, the fate of the world will be closer to other prophecies. Such a possibility is scary, where we can live as long as we live
