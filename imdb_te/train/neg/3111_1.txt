<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I did not get out of the first five minutes of the film. I went with my nature and left it right away !! In our theater many people hurt me and unfortunately I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story does not have all the standards. No Plots Horror acting! Robin Williams was also disappointed, he could never see another movie. A single relationship in the story is not beyond parlor discussion. I liked the tazer scene. Too bad it does not have some meat shock into the senselessness of the plot. The author and the director of this film need one another.
