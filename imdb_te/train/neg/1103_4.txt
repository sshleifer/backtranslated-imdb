I'm always looking for movies that reflect the experiences and lives of people like me as a teenage black / late woman. I thought I was enjoying watching this movie in the video store. Unfortunately, I did not. While the content provided in the picture is interesting and relevant, the story has not been improved. The film is simply missing from the screen and the duplicate characters are left without a lot to contribute to the whole movie. The director did a good job of connecting the scenes, perhaps just a bit of pleasure. Honestly, I would recommend this film like "Rising Victor" today. I'm not too impressed.
