Treasure Island DVD is a must watch for any movie production course! How to make a film is a textbook. Watching the film, the author / director's commentary listened to widespread disclosure of what he knew about the characters and to tell his audience about them. Call me old, but I think about the movies as communications tools, and the communication is complete if the audience does not know that the director is talking. The purpose of the director is to create the vacuum of the film "Hollywood Conventions". In those sessions, alas, the character of the concept and the consistency of clarity. Audience often finds himself unable to understand the escape points of the "Hollywood Clich". However, he realizes that he has clues for a reason. They are brief to express complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's good to avoid them, but they need to change a little more, just do not delete them to communicate the same idea. The film is made in an exciting spaceship, rich. In the end days of WWII two puppets are employed to create a personality and background for an unidentified corpse used in a false information. Soon each character begins to diversify their personal fantasies and their discovery is a real fact. A lesser inefficient personality for the "Hollywood Convention" of the traditional heroine can create an amazing film with this idea. This film is not perfect! Puppets make everything according to these roles, but they are lost by a very confusing and confusing script. In particular, I was impressed by Gonz√°zz and played a living body. In many Muppet films, he is always a very attractive puppet.
