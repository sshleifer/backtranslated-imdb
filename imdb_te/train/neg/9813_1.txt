<br /> I do not think it's good to say about this movie. As expected - acting by Jennifer Tillley is weak. <br /> <br /> Daryl Hannah does a sub job, but it is not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in the movie is the weakness of the film - although the authenticity is based on the premise - the writer approached the "stupid heroine trick" to create a crisp suspense. When all Daryl Hanna wants to be done, she runs before it. The hospital scene is irrelevant. I think it would be difficult to take a pregnant woman out of the hospital without noticeing a bloody pet without knowing much about what goes on for a plot. Lame. Very lame. <br /> You save yourself some time and take another picture.
