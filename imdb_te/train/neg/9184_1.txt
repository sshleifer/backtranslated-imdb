F * ck Me! <br /> I honestly say how bad this film is. Along with the plot not really there, humorous worst acting, ridiculously scary excuses for zombies; You know, I'll go all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid, meaningless, worst or awkward. <br /> <br /> I would like to express myself to anyone who wants to see this film. It's hidden away right away at the bottom of the curse of God's huge pile. I could not give this horse sh * t sorry for an image away. How bad it is.
