First technical review. The script is very slow, really 1 minute and 40 minutes. The conversation is very flat and really a dimensional. The "acting" was remorseful, and they actually dropped students from Class to read some lines from the Idiot Board. For the entire "point" of the story, that means "war is good" (oh, there's a shock!) Really does not exist. "Shock 'and without a great campaign," no one talks about this film. It's very bad, it's what money I've used. I believe I have seen some bad "Emperor's new clothes" images but one thing I can say for them is that they wobbled the camera at least two pictures while they were well shot and well made! Read all other reviews - Avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
