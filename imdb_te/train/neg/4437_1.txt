"The Triumph of Love" has not succeeded over anything. It's a plodding, wonderful, violence of 4 hours. Actually it was less than 2 hours, it seemed too long. It's also sad to think about good actors' performances like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Assistant players are not too awful. Perhaps they are trying to climb up, so clown, but if so, I did not see that. Mira Sorvino does not make a single point of view or one. She (he) is right there. My imagination was a play by the same name, written by Marivax 270 years ago, which is very good. This should not be worse. The author and director of the film, Clarepip, was inspired by the recent production of this play. I do not know what she thinks when creating this bomb. <br /> It may be lost in translation.
