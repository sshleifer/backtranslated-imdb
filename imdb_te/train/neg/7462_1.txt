There should be a problem here. I was just talking about a song for John Claits Faith Towers recently. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch is very affordable and not funny. The second branch is very tight and funny. The third is just weak to be funny. There is no such kind of detail in the "Corky Romano". No matter how insulting the comic bit is, it is not stable, and the cutting room does not leave the floor. <br /> <br /> A value that I find in the movie is like a study of a very flawed picture that I have escaped from repairing. <br /> <br /> Here I scanned dozens of other reviews. The number of reviews that appreciates this absolute waste of time is strengthening my suspicion that some people are paid to promote titles. I can not imagine anyone at the age of 9 can rate this title above 4, MAX. I mean, come on, average 5. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has earned this money, I can not even imagine. And, hey, I really like the three Stooges and can even tolerate Ed Wood!
