In a paceman game, Butrew Demillale (aged a Peter Fonda), aged gambler, young teen wanda "Nevada" (beautiful, but unskilled brook shields). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ It is not just. The performance was very weak, the fact that Peter Fonda's leadership led to a surprise. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the film, good looks and some of the young Brook Shields are great. Her role is quite irritating though (especially in the beginning) and dumb, she never comes off too sexy or attractive. Very bad, but, given the story, I can not doubt anything else. I'm surprised why Peter Fonda has acted in this film. He also talked about his (Henry Fonda) role as a (useless) in this ludicrous mess. Unfortunately, this is their sole image. For instance Henry is not in EASY RIDER? 3/10
