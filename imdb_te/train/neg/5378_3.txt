I'm not really looking forward to this film, I put in 5 packs of films, all of which are pretty terrible in their own way, so can I guess? And I'm just curious about it, and the problem is that I'm not just trying to build any kind of tension in it, The whole thing did not happen and when it was completely frustrating (n I did not mention how cute he was too much a hell, so I thought he was a bit like a meercat, all this was the one that was ready to hit a lot of cinema, but it gave a go) and seriously the band's lead singer looked great And I do not even mention the killer, I'm also gonna have to go into it, just explaining its worth. Anyway I worry that the star and London are the only reason to watch this and except London (which is actually quite fun) because it's not their acting talent, I have definitely seen a lot worse, but I've also seen very good. Stay fine without your boredom looking at the paint powder.
