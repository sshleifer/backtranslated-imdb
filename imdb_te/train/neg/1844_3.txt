Personally I seem to have made this show much cheaper. Some actors are terrific. They can do this and make a duplicate. They are clear transparent as I always say how to watch for the first 10 minutes or so. It's not well written. I love to see and laugh at it. You know, "It's good because it's bad". Well, this time applies to this program. When I assume that I'm going to finish it all, I want to see if I'm right. So far I'm right every time. This sounds like a little game I play. It's fine when you're bored and you're feeling smiling something.
