With a long opening shot of assembly line workers at the assembly line in a Chinese factory, the manufacturer landscapes seek to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and industrial traditions. While industrial development in China and elsewhere has never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, Karl Marx has never visited the British Museum. <br /> At the same time, experiences of industrialization and wealth and current appetite and terror have never been mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Edward Burinski's photographs are somehow "beautiful" of industrial waste. Slideshow show these pictures with many images. They are well produced in museum size and are clearly visible in many shows. However, they only show me that if any single photo is beautifully presented, it looks pretty. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. <br /> <br /> The nations do not mean real and sometimes undesirable issues when rush to industrialization. Landscapes made, however, only provide strange and bitter disappointment. It's a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. The American (and Canadian) left fault can have some value as a performance.
