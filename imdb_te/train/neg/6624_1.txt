This film is totally ... ugh i can not wait Oh wait ... wait! I understand this when it starts, yes it's nice, it's nice. I was almost asleep and I was late because I was completely dead. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best but never lived up to the cast of the original remake and I understood what he was thinking he was remaking. What is he trying to do? Do you like Sanjay Leela Bansy and want to win all the awards next year as he did for the block? Ajay and the other person are particularly good for the other person who plays Raj, because they see it all because he is the one to see. What did Amitabh? He is destroying all these stupid images of his own honor. The first Nishabd was then Jeebabarambu Jummu and then I had to move away from Bollywood away before he lost his respect to Hayes and now I'm telling you he's half past his way already. The reason for Amitabh's recent decline is that it is good for all other actors like Shahrukh Khan. I really did not like him because he feels like God and I know Abhishek will be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75, and spend some good time. Hey baby because it's always ridiculous and it's topping the charts!
