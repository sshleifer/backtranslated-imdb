This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This film is nothing positive about it. Some of you like this movie! I saw a lot of Dracula movies and liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this film I told myself, "What is this hell?" No stupid image. He has now become Dracula because he is Judas. Who does not know who Judas is, he has betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt guilty so that he hung himself. You play me. I have heard the Dracula badly anytime. Who asked for a reason? This film is part of sh **. Anyone who apologized for a movie anytime? Even Dracula is terrible. If you ever see this movie, it does not even think of Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Did that title impress me? Do not waste your time or your money in this trash.
