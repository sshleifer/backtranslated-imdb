<br /> <br /> When you come to the pictures of Albert Brooks without his shirt <br /> <br /> I love Albert Brooks. I did not see much of all of my movies, but this was the first time. Modern romance is interesting about love affair. Winter scenes of 1979 Although the winter is very close, there are some pictures of love being upset or modern romance. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The two are already in the relationship because the two are related and are. <br /> <br /> It is a cinema released in 1981, with styles and similar words. I am the main reason for this film. <br /> When I came to the movies, my fundamental rule "If it's historically occurring, it has some historical relevance", you know the capsule of time. <br /> <br /> For me, the leads to the horror scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt. <br /> That man hair. Very hair. He wears a black curly-bearing sweater-hairs. And it's worse he is almost the victim-hairy hair. It's not a pleasant sight and a shirt and sequences with him will continue. At the beginning of the 80s, handicapped men were common and nothing shocked. But in 2009 it was just plain revolution. Sorry, Albert! I said somebody at some point "hey try this scene but you're wearing a simple t-shirt, I mean you might scare people". It's really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress who has to deal with the Albert Brooks naked body above her. <br /> <br /> It is a sole film. It may be better if Albert Brooks does not have 10 long continuous minutes without his shirt, because the film will never let me see my view.
