<br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter a Notorious Liar, not a murder and a crime. New Jersey state was only 20 years old, and it did not go for the third time. Carter came in offer in 1976: "A lie test and go free". He did not take it. This film has never been made, but money talks. Most people have spent their lives in jail unjustly and are in fact more black than white. Why choose a fake story <br /> <br /> Jens
