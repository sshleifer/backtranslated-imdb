I might have given this movie a high rating before Peter Jackson's trio came out, but there was just no comparison seen on both sides of the side. The pace of this film has moved, leaving many important scenes from the book, and has little character development. I saw this animated novelty of the traditional cartoon drawings and the live action scenes shot. And the most disappointing thing about this film is that the story is never broken and never finished. There are some good points - war scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue letter follows a very good book. If you're in a hurry, you can not spend 10 hours looking for a new trilogy. If you read this book, you probably get confused because there are not many people from this version. 10 to 4.
