<br /> It has a rating of 1, but the fight between the robots is okay and surprising. <br /> <br /> I realized that some films have bigger budgets than others. I do not have that problem. Unfortunately, science fiction films are very distressed in the small budget for obvious reasons. But the film is a way of failing to see almost every piece of each set is cheesy and cheap. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this movie is that it's awesome, I've just seen the movie and I know what to expect, for which cheese factor I can enjoy, but at that point, I was expecting a good picture and it's really terrible Do not have the clue <br /> <br /> Thankfully, the experience ends only 85 minutes.
