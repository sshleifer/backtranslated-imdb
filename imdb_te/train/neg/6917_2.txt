A man who sells his soul to the devil to seek his most hope in life (the author here) once again known the same story: Success. The absurd script ("We Go Home and Write Better"), hilarious lines Agent Hopkins Devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is all sexy) to understand the "strong" "christian" message (our only desire in life is to recognize love, respect and good friendship) Or not bad) to eventually scene the scene for this rare role Ina all bad deeds. Baldwin's efforts of actors (as Baldwin's director, Katrale again in the role of "Sex and the City", Aykroyd with some fun lines in his limited role). Try a very popular film from the Greek "Aloeimino Stouse Neus", a fantastic adaptation of this myth (the old man gives his ghost to the devil to restore his youth)
