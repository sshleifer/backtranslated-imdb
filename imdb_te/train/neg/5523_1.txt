Georgia's rule is one - not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole picture makes a very serious feel, which made me gap, "What's that?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the two-hour course of its ceremonies, at least 7-10 times out loud. <br /> <br /> Lohan as the daughter of Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and her daughter Lindsay <br /> <br /> Lohan as a rebellious, sexy, younger grand-daughter, is a clich√©, flame, chic -Filk, thinking about family mingling. <br /> <br /> In the context of "crucial" scenes, "funny" animals did not mention all five minutes of attention after a number of shots of animals and an elderly woman who came to the doctor's office. In fact, Georgia Rule creates its own genre: her diaper has changed or the character of Lindsay Lohan is actually sexual abuse of her foot father: the profane, terrible acting, and inappropriate comedy dealing with the most serious problems is the most embarrassing, surreal, and strange way. If Gary Marshall wants this movie to be a play / comedy, he should look at Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. June bug. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I can get a reader to understand the horror style of George Rule is to create an imaginary situation. He is said to have played a major role in the film 40 years old Old Virgin, because he was sexually sexually sexually sexually abused. Instead of making a more dramatic turn of the film, the umbilical laugh and the comedy characters reflected, the fake, the lifeless, the human and the diligent characters. <br /> <br /> Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney is a flattest, very dimensional character, believing and morality that he has been thoroughly cut from this poorly written script along with a female character who throws away all of his religious beliefs, no one shares the same interests , As well as an unnecessary car chase scene, the characters trying to get to each other's relationships are dubious moments, and you get Georgia A trashy, too tanned girl rule. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, and others felt that the film was insulting. <br /> Do not look at this picture: My rule. <br /> If you should, get drunk enough before hand.
