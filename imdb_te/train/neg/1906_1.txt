They played this role in the July 4th Twilight Zone Marathon, and this is the worst Twilight Zone episode I've been doing, hands down. It is totally in sync with the remaining series in its tone. Although the Twilight Zone is a pretty disparate series and many episodes are confusing, it is not entirely space. <br /> <br /> You can compare it to the mythical episodes like "A Stop at the Wiloughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you will find that it does not match. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton was able to do what he could do with such a terrible thing, and it clearly impressed me that anyone in his historic comedy stomach crossed this episode level. Although he seemed to have some effort, he needed money ... there was no other explanation.
