While I do not claim any sort of expert in marine life, I have a clue about the vengeance of a whale (and even the mother!) Anyone with a nuance of intelligence that can not buy to this notion has seen his dead mate to have it abortion forced with humans! Really, I mean! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris was very difficult for the characters to accept this waste. It is a bad movie and you think that if you pay 50 cents to see it, your money will be demanding.
