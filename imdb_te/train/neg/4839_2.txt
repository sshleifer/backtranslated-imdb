... and less than before. I do not make any direct references or anything here, but at least say, this film is curious. If you are trained in military training, it's not hard to see. I've put 2 friends on DVD on the ones who want to watch a slightly more interesting action / war film. <br /> <br /> In the first "Bomb" scenes, the film has heavy glitches, and they become bigger and bigger. My 2 friends were not connected to the army anymore, as far as I was concerned, I saw the filmmaker's mistakes as a couple and asked me if some things were realistic. <br /> As you might have guessed, they are not - at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film unless you are able to do this completely idiot and repeat mistakes. First grab my interest 2/10.
