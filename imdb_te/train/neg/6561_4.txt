The Legion, which entered Paris on November 13, 1918, began to be present. These forces jump up on the train - the uniformed French army merged with Legion into war in 1914! A sign you will see in this battle is turkey. (By 1915 the French army was not going to war on red pants and dark blue overcovers) Metropolitan French troops were changed to "horizon blue" and colonial forces were kept in khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remake at least uniformed more or less right . The directors are very bad when they go to all attempts to correct other things when making these mistakes.
