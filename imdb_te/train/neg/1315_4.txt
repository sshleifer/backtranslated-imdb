Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and learns that his uncle is coming to see Olly's new wife and baby. The problem, they do not exist - Olly apparently made them! <br /> He and his friend have a woman with a child who pose to her family. <br /> <br /> It's not a particular storytelling idea, but a couple other silent stories with this exact story. The best of these is Bobby Vernon's DO NOT Kid ME. It's better than most - this is probably a decade later - the comedy is a bit more sophisticated and less reliant on the nonsense slapstick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people who started shooting guns are crackling and slipping each other. Sadly, ONE at the very end, they absolutely know what they do. It makes no sense and it's like they'd run out of story ideas. <br /> <br /> In total, entertainment is not exactly a milestone. You do not have enough merit to watch it except for a steady quiet fan like me.
