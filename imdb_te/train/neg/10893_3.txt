This is one of those movies that's way better than it turned out. I'm afraid of blockbuster-approved editing because the director's cut is bore of epic ratios on DVD. Naturally, you do not want to be "The Godfather", but an acting class or both may come into use. <br /> Also, there are so many cute guys in the movie, but they are suffering from grief. I'd be watching a bit of hotties around in their BVDs as the next figure, but also I have the right to expect a little more. It's not a total loss, though; At least we saw a drew fuller (cover) junk and really suddenly saw craftsmanship. And Henry Ritter also watches Carrie more than what he did on "Bring It On" (and acting as well). There is a silver lining, kids always. You have to work really hard for it. And occasionally, you need to use your interval button.
