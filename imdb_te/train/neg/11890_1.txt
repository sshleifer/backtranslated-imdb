For the first time I've seen this guy I've seen the cover of the film box and the expanded photography, 'Swaver' this friend should be 6 foot or 6ft 2in. <br /> 5 feet long. No, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> In any rating, I had a cold night film in Tucson, a good cigar, and a second story-deck, let it roll. At that time my wife had an affair and I was hit down the hill, so I needed a good diversion. But, as bad as the film ... I completely enjoyed it, with a bottle of merlot, I might admit. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not 'too difficult', it's not that 'it's very close' to hit the mark for an action film. And then really clueless. Then again frantic. It's best when it comes to slow chase scene. Wow !! I did not feel safe in my life. Very warm and happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this direction 'actionless' action and combat sequences are required for choreography, or again the dance is directed and tightened up, the sound delivery is off you do not hit, it's just going to be the other way. The 'locals' of the village, not just the town, were 'off que', they did not even see what was going on well and would also see the camera lens. A smile is like a deer of head lamps in some of the laughing deer. <br /> <br /> I am in Colombo 'because I have a good heart and a diligent spirit for America and its own nationals, because I feel bad. <br /> <br /> "Barrettas Island" is very depressing and unbelievable. Still I like it a lot. My now wife x hate it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is when it comes to movies that I like or 'Love'. All in all, I like Franco. So it is. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to kill a few hours really fun to watch, video-b movies or 'bad movies' to your small library collection check it with' The Big Sets' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar. ' TANGO & CASH 'is a big person. 'The Big Sweat', the story of a storytelling story, is a real plot and has been such a sluggish, they also ran out of money at the end of 'crutches' and 'The BigSet', they had a picture of the cast and put it on fire And let's burn during credits. -Good happiness. <br /> <br /> It's not good at all, like Burretta Island, which gave it '1' and gave the 'awful' overall rating for the awful-good B movie. Barretta's revenge on the Mantzuma (Franco's vacation in water, declaring war on water coat) or 'barretta powder war' is the largest pharmaceutical lord in his country, chewed in genetically-spicy and coccine fields, cocaine eaten and hydrated super bug (worm) Creates a coke, eats and travels through the bug While, it becomes pure powdered sugar to a chemical reaction of coke. Then another sequel is needed to protect young people from excessive sugar addiction. He can accept a large ivory paste company and partially fund the project with a product placement on this feature. Right? (*)
