Returning to the cabin through the lake does not stand in the original. With only one main character (Stanley) coming back for the sequel, the value of 2 hours of your time is not even worth it. I am the first heroine of the film, the storyline and the acting are good, but one film I never seen again. It is equivalent to the sequels of Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but very bad acting. I personally saw good performance in soap operas, it's very laughing, you just have to laugh. I would, in any way, recommend this image to anyone, looking at it first and then removing it.
