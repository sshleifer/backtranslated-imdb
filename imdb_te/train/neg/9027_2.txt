Probably the public viewing of us is a revenge. I sat through this 2 hour movie and in the second film I waited to live up to that title. But Costner kills her lover's fate and she dies and the film ends. I was surprised to find the rest of the film. Even though the film is called Revenge, the hero will get better at the end of the film. Thankfully for watching this or black rain in the film, I see other brothers in the film. I was caught on video with this turkey. There is a good thing about the film and its beautiful theme is tune up. Listen to Cd.dont this to see its awful. 10 to 1
