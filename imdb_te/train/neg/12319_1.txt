I smiled and I feel like watching the movie ... beautifully cast, tat, engrossing and terrible thing! Two hours of extreme curve in all basic, all-inclusive sense, such as sexual violence and violence, rape, decapitation, corruption, corruption, direct mausoleum, abuse, misuse, abuse. There is no redemption. I've got fun. I could not stop seeing it. What this says about me is about the kind of stuff that produces such things, and that the real scuff films in the world are ultimately unbearable. And I'm puritanical or ridiculous, I have not tried to hide from the dark existence, and I did not necessarily lead a shelter, but it's my shame. And I'm sorry to see my British relatives dragging sewers into something that makes my own tribe. It does not need to be cool, but is it falling into an alternative inquiry?
