Actual Secret Watch, some really memorable animated scenes. Unfortunately, the sequel is not full of lightning, even if it is not the worst of the DTV sequels. <br /> <br /> The biggest letdown is the lack of a story. As Belle's Magical World, the characters are told in a series. Magical World, however marginally better, still manages to make the story mess. Among the sounds, we see mice at work, and I personally think there are liberation qualities of this film as antics of Jack and Gus. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, Cinderella is a princess. This is best, because rats are at their ridiculous here. The worst of silence is beautiful at times when Jaq turns into a human, but lack of imagination. The last vignette is also beautiful when Anastasia falls in love. There is a problem, I can not imagine being friendly with Anastasia Cinderella, as I thought from the stairs she had stairs. <br /> <br /> This is a ridiculous subplot that is about Lucyfer, who fell in love with the sin of papa. <br /> <br /> <br /> I am very happy to listen to surprising music, but I hate songs, they are really uninterested, beautiful melodies of the beautiful Tchaikovsky. <br /> <br /> These characters are the most powerful here. While Cinderella still takes care of her, she has lost her honesty, the original is from her, but she wears a very beautiful dress. Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the film, as well as with Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, rats have the film's redeeming qualities, because they can help cinematize the film alone. <br /> That animation is colorful and average, and voice acting is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful, uneven sequel, songs and a story. 4/10 for rats, voice acting, animation and some beautiful dresses.
