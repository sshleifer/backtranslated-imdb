I loved watching it though and having fun with an image's overall badness. I have this DVD by the auxiliary irony of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 I have the DVD. If you flip to the other side of the DVD, they show the true picture, so I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> Actually, special effects and plots are very cheesy and unrealistic. Watching how Crow could still speak on the head, "she does not need lungs", it does not have a body, and Tom Servo just wistfully "No, she's got her neck!" Commenting. The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved "cat fight" between two strippers. After that fight or scene, "Meow", the classic, classic. So, in some ways it's a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you probably enjoy it. For a good time, look at the MSTK3 version, you'll get a great laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K Version: 10/10 Brain Will Die: 1/10
