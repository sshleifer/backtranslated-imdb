This is one of the most ridiculous and badly directed films I've seen in a long time. I did not like Spike Lean, but I thought I would make this effort: bad mistake. The film was to show how Sam's real life murders affected the neighbors in the summer of 1977; It really is concentrated around their characters, because I have taken care of their medicinal problems, marriage issues, etc. The scenes shot in murders are just and nothing; One shooting and it is back in the Saturday Night Fever! Spike Lee's choice to show as yet a fairy-tale filmmaker: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, get out of the movies and make them even worse. The dog must have spoken in a goofy voice for a very close scene, which was filmed before a scene, where was it shot dead? Spike, what do you think when this film is made? I do not think it's my opinion. People who think they will see a crime scene will not take my advice and waste your time or money for this defeat. You're better off watching Jerry Springer in this regard! The waste of the film, I gave 10 out of 1: terribly rubbish.
