For the most part, on demand offers some pretty horrible horror movies, and offers horror imagery that has already seen everyone, and already has an opinion. This is often in the movie I have not seen, because it often happens to be a million times, and so many movies, and I'm not very interested in new movies, and boy , This film made me regret it. I'm not going to keep in any spoilers, I'm going to tell you that the very few actors in this movie are only FEW, half way better. I'm the main girl, looking at the dead man who killed everyone, it's very sad to see, but convincingly; I will take her for eighth mental bitch, so that it is better suited to her roll, even though it is dirty. Blood is not great, only a few are killed, or I say "wounded", but you do not see much part of it and there are no evidence of body parts in the film to make the injuries more rigid. While stopping my girlfriend and being a member of the band at the end of the film, it's really not interesting to share about the recording, what really happens is when the record takes place. If I want to see it, it fits for you.
