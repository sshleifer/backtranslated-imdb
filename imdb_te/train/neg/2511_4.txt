Director Fred Schapiis (Roxanne) directs this good idea, but the epic comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthew) attempts to get his classmate niece (Ryan) with a simple guy Tim Robbins to rest and enjoy life in the 1950s. To get Robins like Robbins, Einstein Robins is trying to look like an amazing scientist. The idea is very beautiful, but the movie is flat with flat applause and crazy dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the superb assistant cast are fine to retain this lovely comedy, but can not save the film. Its unfortunate very talent went into producing such a poor image. I do not recommend anyone if Meg Ryan's huge fans.
