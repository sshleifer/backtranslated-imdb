This film is unbelievable ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Gore, but not many of the dead in this movie. It just shows the dead bodies already, and the only death scenes that actually show up in the film are terrible. Graphics so clearly look duplicate. Actors are also awful. None of them has a real emotion. I did not waste my time watching this part of the sh * t movie, but initially I looked at animals. If I could rate this one -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's the worst. <br /> Do not look at it.
