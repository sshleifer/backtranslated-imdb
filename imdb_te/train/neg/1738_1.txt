This painful movie is a remake of the 1927 film. <br /> They have no huge bomb! Douglas Fairbanks is not absolutely attractive here. Caesar Romero plays a real jerk with Bette and Betty Grob sang with a chorus - Hungary I Who Do du Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The funniest plot 1561 Rome painted by a woman in a castle saved the day by killing a winner. (Fairbanks) Now, let's speed up after 300 years, where the wedding of Count Romero is faced with this situation, and her fiancee Hungaria soldiers face an expedition. Romero struggles with cowardly and flees before the army comes. He is disguised as a gypsy and is prepared to stay in the castle when his violin fair pleases the banks. When Jeruble met Fairbanks to report the good news to Fairbanks, it was worse than a full-blown film-an outraged Romero aborted the marriage. <br /> <br /> The poor performance of the film took place in 1948. Harry Davenport, a prominent assistant athlete who died, died in 1949; This should be his last film. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel can not do co-stars but with such poor works. Clothes come from the stone age. I do not know what the fairbanks wear.
