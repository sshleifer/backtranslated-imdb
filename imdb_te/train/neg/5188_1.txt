TV pilots, do you love them? Quin Martine successfully tried this after the success of other TV detective films, but it does not go anywhere except in the MST's range. Head of Roy Thimps Diamond Head, find Super Spy Lovejoy from Aunt Mary, I understand the tree. Jules and Tso-Singh race are funny humorous and quite different. The tree sucks as a bad guy despite all of his disguise as he looks like. There are more striking garments than you could ever imagine (in the 1970s), the exhibition was not so bad. Why did not it go to the series? If you find it, it's very blatant. Again it is fun for MST, but not much else!
