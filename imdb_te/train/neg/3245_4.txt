David Mammoth's first film, as a true contemporary-man movie, has been praised by everyone and everything as a movie you question. I have seen it for the first time and have not felt so great about it. </ P> <br /> The film is a female psychologist named Margaret. Margaret became fond of her profession and her inability to really help someone. She attempts to intercept it by helping her solve the patient's gambling loan to Mike Shark (the only reason to watch the film was Joe Montegna). Mike realizes that she is actually a professional loyalist, and soon she meets her immediately after meeting her. Surprisingly, she comes back to see him and asks her to show her how Kon Artists work (she uses it as a subject of a new psychology). <br /> <br /> She has brought herself up and will go with him for a long time he and his colleagues arranged. <br /> <br /> The events of the entire film were extensive contracts for Michael and his friends to betray Margaret from $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First, the big twist in the end is very predictable. Can visualize any scenery theatrical acting and the strange line that men work. Moreover, they know the audience (and the main character) that they are dealing with cancons, so what's such a big surprise when Margaret is aware of her? Furthermore, Margaret is an intellectual psychologist who has read the public, yet she makes her much easier - and Mike remember, Mike is fully aware that she is an artist. <br /> <p> Second, Margaret believed to have been very early, and eventually the canyon had to do many things that she did not expect. First, she had to help resolve the patient's debt, allowing her to meet the first con men. If she does not, the whole con will fail. I have to say that a psychologist is pretty unreasonable to assume a patient's gambling loan is going to take over her to settle. It may not be, but Canon men are in the right place at night, and she has decided to show it? Every day they come to the bar? Another point is that Margaret is back in order to see Mike again and asks to teach the ideas in his trade. What is the imbalance of this incident? The whole con is in this premise. <br /> <br /> Another issue that I encountered was endless. Margaret finds out what she's doing and takes revenge on Mike. First, Mamat is driven to believe she believes that she is not a con, but as it falls, her ultimate finish is her gunning mike down the airport luggage area. Some viewed a film about Con Studios by running their trade to be a clumsy and ineffective way to end. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film seems to be empty and unfulfilled. And if you predict Margaret's commitment to me, you will find that this revelation is simply unsatisfactory.
