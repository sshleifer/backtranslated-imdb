This is kind of good but wants to suck the type of image. The first thing is, what is the punk that hell is trying to do with school? I feel like I do not realize the gravity of the situation of children. The girl tells Daker Guy that she is responsible, but when he asks why he wants to get them back, but he has a wheelchair with a gun and he wants to repair the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors pay their food, but why not give that money a stupid image or give it to the charity. Oh and no one knows what to do with them. Stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria do not get anywhere like a crazy. They all want to look professional but they all suck. Many of the children are trying to find out that I do not believe there is any emergency departure at school but they are locked up. What happens if a fire and dumas security guard dies? This is illegal for emergency departure at school. There is a lot to say, but it will be too long. I spent some time in my life.
