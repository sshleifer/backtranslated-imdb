Though it is not a "great movie," it is compelling and memorable. As another commentator in the film, I saw it in childhood. It has been thirty three years since 1952, but I never forgot the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. See if you have a chance. As you evolve for decades, you may consider the visualization of small urban life. Earlier in the twentieth century it brought a human face to the "progress" historical drama. It is engaging enough for a young viewer and enough memorable for an old one. In addition, it's easy to see the characters and watch their clock in time pass.
