"Darkness" is a little fun, but it does not have a plot, one of the other films that have been accused of torture; That means "Bad Taste". It's great, as it drives something from one. This was the first few minutes of the film, but after a while the film became entertaining at the Gore level, although it was difficult to make some points due to poor lighting and terrible recording quality. Because of the juvenile acting of the film, it is difficult to believe many friends are talking to some video cameras. It's not just a plot, but a movie without any kind of script, and ended up. As mentioned earlier, Gore is the only drawing point of the film, it's hard to make it longer.
