I thought the brain was dead, and I told you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (In my ignorance I thought Peter Jackson was the same name). The performances are very ridiculous. Special effects do not stand on time test and look terrible. The script promotes that kind of TV movie, watching the middle distance in action. The actors appear to be taking lessons from Joey Tribune, who see each and every one of them. Plus I never get confused by an image until I sit to watch this. It is so dreadful of a dream or desperation sets within a few minutes of any plot. Avoid a plague.
