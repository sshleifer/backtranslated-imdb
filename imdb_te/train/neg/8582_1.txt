<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> msgid "" "The film is a duplicate of The Ful Monte about unemployed men in Sheffield. <br /> <br /> She was born in Sheffield, still with links to the city, I was disappointed. Someone told me that it was set in Oklahoma and that's what I'm about to bring. It's the US It looks like the scene of Northern England's romance for the market. Perhaps most Americans - and many southern English people - is a large city in Sheffield half a million residents, not with a sophisticated urban culture. In the middle of the Giants it was portrayed as a poorly-dead-end-rural small town where everyone in Sheffield appeared to be drinking in a single old pub, and the idea of ​​a village people to be identical in some village hall. <br /> <br /> Labor Sheffield men were completely different from their real-life counterparts. Dry comments. <br /> <br /> They seemed to me alien in the rural areas in the Peak District. I realized that I had used some places to go hiking, but thousands of people recollected me with some conflicting scenes. In fact, in the credits at the end I spotted a reference to Wales, Guinness. In the summer the peak district visits visitors, walkers and cars. It is located between two big cities. <br /> <br /> If a young girl is falling in love and having sex, Pete Postelwive, it's ridiculous, and just a male dream. Her reasons did not appear to be her lover. None of the men showed partner or families; <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see the film about unemployed Sheffielders. Sheffield had only the minds of its middle writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It's the biggest duplicate! <br /> <br />
