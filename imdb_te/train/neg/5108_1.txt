I can not help people with this presentation heart-moving and tear-jerking but can not laugh. <br /> <br /> After these new families these people have perfect lives. It's very spurious. <br /> How will these families benefit from these new mega houses? And what about their poor neighbors? After this, property tax will increase. Plus, the noise hurt me. <br /> Second, how does the reality television program grow? It is practically the same repeat waste week after week. <br /> <br /> We are introducing the affected family, rebuilding the house, family surprise and everyone breaks the Kleenex boxes. <br /> How much of a reconstruction part is boring. <br /> <br /> "Executive Makeover: Home Edition" Be hearty but it comes flat. Skip this. If you like reality television, "Survivor" is very high and moving.
