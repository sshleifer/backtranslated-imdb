This film is very powerful. Those who follow Jeffrey's story know that the details that are ignored in the film are ridiculous. Dahmer had a long time and effort in the film on homosexual trends and his use of alcohol. Where is the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer is no exception. Where was he in his adult life when he started killing and destroying children in the film? Instead, we offer the turbulent sequence of glasses trying to explain the emergence of the killer, but fail to resolve the main point in Dahmer's development. Furthermore, the story of the country was surprising with the story - the measurements and actions that he had stored in his apartment and how to achieve him; His desire for his cannibals and meat, etc. I could not go, but the most lagged points in the film, focused on his sexuality and was not enough of the gore - the good thing is that you have the title movie "Dahmer."
