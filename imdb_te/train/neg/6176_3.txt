I'm not a huge fan of the slugstick of Stooges, but I found their history interesting. I've recently tried to check stuff out of every stolen period, but it's not easy to see Joe's stories; <br /> <br /> Some people say that the quality of the shorts in the Joe-era is not really Joe's fault. Joe as an actress is not too bad in this regard. The thing that made me more concerned about it was indicated in another comment: the moral breach of comedy-team / stooges pitting the whole of other guys against the third. Perhaps Joe's style is actually not suitable for those who charge - there are no real-camera contradictions between him and others - it's their way to work around them. What are these titles and other last stooges shorts? There's definitely going to be creativity; Is the sort of thing or shorts market drying effect?
