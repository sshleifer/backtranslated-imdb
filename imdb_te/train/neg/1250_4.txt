I have to admit that this "imagination" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Especially when considering Tim Burton's film. <br /> I personally was a great fan of his work, but something went wrong with his latest film The Planet. Of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original image. When it first came out, people just estimated another science fiction 70 science fiction, but it is very surprising and completely clear that the theory is wrong. It actually has a clear cut message. A clear anti-war message. The cold war, which took the world and feared the use of nuclear weapons, was a major part of the filmmakers' minds. The reasons for this film have evolved over all expectations and this has become an instant classic. Nevertheless, the new film, "making it back" or whatever, we will miss nothing. No doubt, there are no ideals behind. It's just another boneless summer blockbuster. <br /> Visible Tim Burton does not deny you. The dark and creepy settings are amazing and of course make is amazing. <br /> Clearly not enough to keep people intrested in an image. There should be an amazing plot or storyline. The plot is the most anticipated in the film and it is very bad. The script is too lame and it is full of seams. The film looks like a huge hurry. Why the monkeys there, and why the rulers who ruled were very stupid and explanation for the script-writers proved ignorance. <br /> It does not have much questions, <br /> for example; Why do monkeys speak English, why there are other elephant species other than the chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in the spaceship that crashed land on Earth) where all the hell from that hell? Within a few thousand years, there are some chimps to grow to a large extent of all kinds of monkeys. <br /> <br /> 'If the original film had such ending because it probably just threw, then they were the same kind of audiences Thought to be expected. The conclusion also raises a lot of questions, which I know, is not the clever answer. Did he learned to work on the Thide Space-Ship ?, it was power-less, and went back in time and learned to seize hand alone on the ground, and, what is he, all women breed? And I say it's going to be, I doubt that I will remain historically, like Washington, that's right now! <br /> <br /> Do not have heavy bananas instead of a memorial? <br /> We are sorry about this film. Some cast is great. The role of Helen Bonham Carter is interesting and good, like Tim Roth Dayd. He is very cool, a little less than a few points of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan is also good. I'm not happy with Mark Wahlberg. He is not an actor too and plays a very colorful, colorful role here. Nothing compared to the role of Hestons in the very unplaylevable and original. And there is no reason or place in this film in the lead female role. She just stars for her looks. <br /> When people in the future think about the Planet of Monkey, they think about the original. The latest is soon forgotten.
