Okay, here it is: "Nazi mountaineer friendship with Dalai Lama." We do the first thing as a mainstream actor without thinking about what we're doing, Germany's slogan, and we turn around him for 2 hours between French, German, American and British. Then we make a series of disorderly incidents that will extend them widely, and the plot inches are almost perfect. But to make sure that the viewer is sleeping, we have denied that our leader was cigarette smoking at a height of 22,000 feet, worse than the absurd details. Naturally, remember that we should not read many subtitles for our target audience, so we have a very small farmer in LASA, where Lasa's prohibited closed city in 1943 is a character. In fact, we are doing what we are doing: So what we are doing: Dalai Lama is now friendly with Nazi reform because second projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other equipment represent Western freedom of capitalism. Instead, our hero has never really learned from his youthful progress, really learned from vague, broken Buddhism, or in a serious manner. All heroes, heroes, and heroes have a lot of scenes, as long as the rest of the Tibetan community has the best of Dalai Lama, and these heroes and their spiritual leaders have a deep respect for the deep. In other words, we believe that the audience believe that he is his own, in his own way, in his own way, yet we do not know what his variant is, or how far he wants to go. Finally, not the last, we are stuck at the end of the film as it is unclear how Chinese Tibetans are (obviously this), so this is not the case, although we are accused of making a "political" film. So, Jat is my opinion ist. Do you wat? Can zoo make a movie?
