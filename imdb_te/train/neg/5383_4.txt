I'm starting to say, what kind of work is entertaining in the party. The real test This is from start to finish, I gave a similar title for this review. Many of us agree - even for me, many blogs have enjoyed reading - blogs do not match for a number of reasons, writing a good novel. Similarly, for many reasons Fem can not compare with good film making, and I believe it is a poor example of the independent filmmaker. From start to finish, the fame feels like a commentary. (Heck, even MySpace got some pimping.) If I wanted to see a lonelygirl15 an hour - I did not go - it was going to see. Fem, the bubble gum of the above media is certainly strict than the atmosphere, which is indistinguishable without an interesting story. It's like watching the foundation of life, I think most of it is very naturally boring. And yet the creators of Fem wants to inspire us, their most sophisticated film to make the film. <br /> Finally, I will not ignore it anymore. I'm also really surprised by the interest of taking time to write this review. Because it's not FEM, obviously not bad is bad; It's a few moments I think might or maybe smash a smile - just maybe - something about the interest to happen. It's just obvious ... mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope the creators / "actors" will get out of debt from their efforts in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not have to worry about it, do not worry about it, and you have lost some great, undisected talents. Not really.
