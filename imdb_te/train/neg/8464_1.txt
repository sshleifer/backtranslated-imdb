I have been very patient with bad science / fiction and horror movies - I have been watching them since 4 or 5 years, so I have seen some really bad things but I will not face it. I have also seen a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I do not expect much - a usually funny movie that does not end up to talk. Hope the eternal springs, I guess - or the success of the hope upon experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the beginning and I know, but like a moth for flame, I'm thinking of something, anything, something interesting, going on. It's not. All of the actors give a good performance - given the script, I do not know how they all kept the faces straight. This is a slow human race, associated with collagen-hungry worm parasites that have one body at one time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who works with the enemy by giving the human face the external look ... do not worry, he will come to what he's supposed to do. Slug people do not really know where they come from, they think they can reduce a ride on a planet, but ... no one knows about slug royalty members - the slug princess knows that her worm is the queen and her self managed to breed with a man she loves her ... oh, should I go? Please, I pray you, do not waste your life for 2 hours ... Anything good ... It's bad that you're spending two hours, think of something that's enjoyable ... It's fine.
