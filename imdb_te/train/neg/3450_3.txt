Here one is actually comparing this picture to High None in some ways. Now is the real stretch! I am a big Sinatra fan who has some of his acting roles but Don Knots is the only person who played this role. First, as someone has pointed out, Sinatra is not built for Western bad-haste. This time he is just 'quite a bit' in his life. Perhaps he's about the same height that Audie Murphy says, but Murphy has a pretty solid build. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and reliable. I do not want to spoil it but I think it's not how I respond in this story and make no sense. Another thing is that these people constantly allow themselves to be completely captured by some 'bad man'. <br /> <br /> This is just a small town, so I can not get that attraction or understand why people are dominant. <br /> <br /> The love interest in the story I followed it, and she was disappointed when the main character agreed to kill him with some bad guy. Now you have real love. 'Stand up for you! Tell him your name, so he will kill you! 'LOL. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough and they do not have a logical way to follow something other than a wastebasket, even if they try this story. Want to see why this is not in the video and why it's never shown on TV? Critics clearly panned it in 1956 and they were right - this film is very bad. <br /> <br /> I would bet you would have to pay someone as deep as possible to a deep six. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good Western country? Try tension at the table rock, or at gun point - both really, really those Western themes. Johnny Conco is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you're the best singer - but you are not from this movie.
