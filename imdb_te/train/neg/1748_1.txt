Do not waste your time with this movie. Acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack is the total thrash ... good actors are some of the show's waste. The film did not do justice to Paresh Rawal in Bollywood's most talented actors. Akshay Kumar has done a very poor job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Are you calling acting? If he has such awards in Bollywood, he wants to win Razzie Awards in India. <br /> <br /> There is no mention of a break from the 1965 Boeing Boing, which is very bad fiction. First, people in Bollywood can not do something originally. On top of that they do not know how to copy well. The jokes in this movie are very much exhausted, and it is sad to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be an actor in the south but he is not good enough for a Hindi movie. Sound editing is amazingly crappy. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is to be shy to Bollywood movies in this film. What's wrong with you guys Where is this Bollywood? You know that every year there are more movies than Bollywood movies than Hollywood, but most movies can not be heard abroad because these images are like. I am an Indian and totally insulting to Bollywood to produce this kind of thrash. Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan are just amazing. World class films from time to time in the best of these decades. Garam Masala is one of the worst of this century. <br /> <br /> I've given you 10 out of 1.
