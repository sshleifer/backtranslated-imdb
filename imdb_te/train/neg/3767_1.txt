Budget, good actors ... these things are important. This piece of junk does not waste your time. The worst of the effects. Acting is even worse. <br /> <br /> In this 20 years the cheapest T & A and it is less than 20 minutes away. <br /> <br /> The quality of the ransom quality is only awkward and unpleasant about this film. They have never cursed forever. <br /> If you want to see some of the bad suits, look for older wedding photos. A big budget and some actors are the only good way for a Bigfoot film to fall from the Frogballs Community Theater.
