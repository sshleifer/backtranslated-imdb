This film is like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot is tremendous, and finally all the way. It reminded me of something that has erupted for home video market in the 1980s. I would have given one, but you could see that the actors were really stressed to do this valuable thing. I think the worst thing is that the underwater dock has been organized. Underwater lighting does not appear from any kind, and this air tank looks like when we're out of gas, to anyone we care about. Unless there is anything else on the shelf, I can avoid this. Good Day.
