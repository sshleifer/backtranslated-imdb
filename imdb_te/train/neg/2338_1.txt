How does a different journalist or critic think about a comparison with other good Flemish film "Conga Express (1986)"? Some of the characters in the Kongo Express really sat on each other: Jean, (de Congolese), craftsman, two taxi-drivers, street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucien and Gilbert. However, Tom Burman is not a star and Luke Gabbels. Whatever air blows (if script) is not a reason to forgive errors in the script. The ice in the refrigerator is taken from the joke in the party (the only one!) From the distinguishing feature "De Witte (1934)" where de Witte puts a lot of salt on the potatoes. There are some hazards in the film, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman offers us a movie like an experiment to watch television on theaters in theaters here. Another is not possible for Flemish.
