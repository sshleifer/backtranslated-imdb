This film is one of the very bad cases I have seen in a long time. It's terrible, I'm not sure where to start, or even though it's worth it. The plot is a real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' when he keeps in a better performance for his role. But that's the plot ... oh dear oh dear. While on the way to the helicopter, I love the way to the end of the mountain to pap the top to the top. One day or two climbing takes five minutes for him! I can go: but it is not worth it. The terrible startup (which can also predict the outcome at five years) remains the other. Sorry, but this movie is bad as it gets.
