I advised people who made the film, if you create such images, you have to back up f / x. Also it does get a bunch of z playlist actors. Another thing is, as seen in the Juicassic Park, it does not blatantly copy all of us. All sucked in this film, f / x sucked, acting sucks, the story is unreal. Let's talk about the second acting, in the career of Guerrero Guy in 1984, he made "Revers of the Nairs" (actually a great comedy). He can not properly z list, he can work. He did not just say this s - t bag. He did what Marc Hamill did after "Jedi's Return" and walked quietly at night. He made his mark a "tell me" and that should be. I mean he has bills to pay, but it is rarely savor this s - t bag. Will I still call this film? As well. I wanted to be sure. If I heard a small enemy, I apologize. I may spend 2hrs of my life wasting doing something productive like watching paint peel, and I feel cheated. I will close that note. Thank you for your time.
