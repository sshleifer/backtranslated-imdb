Your models have never been model models and playboy bunnies! Bob Fossi's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten is a bit more interesting than Dorothy on the silver screen, as Bostonovich is interested in marrying his sister after her murdered her low-husband husband. Patty Hansen is not an actress. I want to see the masterpiece of Los Orson Wells instead of Andre Hepburn's jeans and a terrific "poodlesque" hair-dow .... Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I'll see again. This clunker I could just sit through once. The film was not prominent because Shri. Strong's long life is brouhaha; I think the original reason is that I was really bad!
