In my opinion, the film should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "About About Lane". A few months ago, I went to the film's screening and the result was very disappointing. The lengthy talk in the film industry - though I was a bit out of action in some parts of the film, I congratulated the director for making a movie about 442th men. Mark Dessuscos, Tomlin Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee performances are great. However, the director did not play a major role in his role. Sorry lane, you're not just an actor. Theater acting - stick what you are good. Gina Hiruzumi's performance in this film is also terrific. She has never given a spoken role and she looks unfit to play part of Miss Nisei Queen. Other young actresses in this film are naturally beautiful and their performances are amazing ... why did not they play for that role? Another major problem with the film is its action scenes. Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to be facing German soldiers ... divide each other. This is a low budget feature, but since it's a combat-based film, is it not really important to show some battles? This image is a valuable effort, but certainly not a major distribution value.
