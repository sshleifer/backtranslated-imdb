The position of Wolf's original novel - in fact the entire story's position - is due to the careful considerations of the subject matter. This goal is to survive in a particular lifestyle. This novel is totally jealous. Empty truth is only Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and only when it touches. <br /> <br /> Wolf faced criticism for hitting every social unit in New York City for everyone. . His reaction is rejection. After all, he stayed in New York and belonged to a neighboring development committee and other admirers, and he deserved good qualities about his resume to refuse the New Yorkers. (PhD in American Studies from Wolffel Yale and is not fake). The novel that feels the weaknesses is memorable. No one is good. And Sherman McCoy was injured, a professional protester for social justice. The film throws away and merely imposes a moral frame on an inadequate story. Wolf has done his homework. This novel actually ceased. Not every event is possible but absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> Wolf may be a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get in a system and record its details. <br /> <br /> Yes, Sherman and his mistress, South Bronx, blackmailed the blacksmith and attempted to escape after one of them jumped. The scene is transmitted from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> After the scene, the film did not trust his audience, and sometimes it became frantic in an attempt to explain his message, but the message was unclear. <br /> <br /> Sherman is suddenly detained by a child and is arrested for being in the novel, but his release from jail immediately goes to his expensive expensive condo, taking a gun and shooting it on the roof as he moves. In a funny scene, the ceiling plaster has fallen to all the guests and they stay away from the scourge. It just did not happen. The film has left the novel's remarkable detailed reality in Dum. Wolf's sensibility, he missed the task of capturing originality. Instead we have a sound, wonderful and silly scene that does nothing other than waking up the audience. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because of the entertaining story of ethical nihilism that makes a lot of sin and redemption. Here we see "Don Juan in hell" in the opera. We receive lectures for liberation from the poet with AIDS. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge delivers from the bench and gives us one of those last lectures about how we all start to behave nicely again. Sherman was sorry as a reporter after a sacrifice turned him into a sacrificial lamb. And Sherman is a happy ending for violating an idiot laughter law. This scene is like a thin cap on the head of the circus elephant. <br /> <br /> As the film is unable to detect audiences, it has already been made mild and unrealistic. <br /> It is acting or not the direction that is poor. The film is not bad in those matters. And photography is very beautiful, including two rather spectacular shots - Chrysler Building's gargoyles and Concord landing. This is a completely corrupt script. </ P> <p> The first half of the film is almost identical in feeling and execution. This puts little details from the novel. Sherman and Judi's dog marshmallow. Who is the name of the dog named marshal? <br /> <br /> Wolf's stubborn redneck right-wing was dangerous to many, but he was forced out by Kojones to lay himself out. The authors and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thereby had the opportunity to study the New Yorkers with a fascinating study.
