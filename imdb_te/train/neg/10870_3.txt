Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York to experience life before earning $ 25 million through his uncle (Richard Tucker). His uncle did not want him to drop three females Jacqui (Catherine Crawford), Maxin (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carol Lambert) and he missed the foul of the gold-diggers. Such a woman, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), comes to the scene for the disappointment of women. We follow the story as the bill brings more money to participate in a show instead of their relative's role as the bill to meet with Cleo and another woman for a three-month stay in New York. In the end, love is a bill and a wind. <br /> <br /> Film quality and sound quality are poor in this film. The story is composed of musical numbers but the songs are bad and Catherine Crawford has an awful voice. Rogers is not as good. He was happy enough, but the only real life comes when playing drums or trombone. There is a very irritating role played by a cab driver (Rossco Corns) and the film is just dull.
