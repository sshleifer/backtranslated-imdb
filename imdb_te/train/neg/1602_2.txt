Anyone who thinks the film is not appreciated for its comic intellect is to smoke with two stoners in the film. This film is not underrated-it's a bad image. <br /> <br /> The movie and the naked gun or airplane should not have two similarities. Class Reunion is not those things. The sad thing is that it's good (good actors, good story lines) but good jokes are low. The scenes that should be fun are more unpleasant than entertaining. Stoner boys, Vampire, Blind Girl ... is not funny. <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has produced some good pictures (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I'm definitely more guessing from John Hughes.
