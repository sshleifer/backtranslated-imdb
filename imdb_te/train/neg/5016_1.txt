Nick Stall, the youngest cast and the attractive cover of VHS wanted me to see a good teen slash film, bought and looked at the film. What's the worst! Clippings screenplay, dialogues and demos are terrifying, horrifying, too bad, terrible, terrifying? Extraction, complete waste of time. Horror, black humor, which has insulted plot points, is a completely boring story. The film has six characters, originally a group of friends alongside all three friends, but really nasty people appear to be enemies, a humorous game that is called "Tabu", and everyone has some taboo problems. That is not the previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their intentions and the relationship. Then, one year later there was an Elipseis, and the same group gathered together in a New Year's Eve party and was insulting each other in a very wayward manner. But there are no additional lines in my review, as the plot and turns are very ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unreliable. One suggestion only: If you do not waste your time or money in this trash, you will definitely worry. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Tabu ?? Jogondo cum an Assassino" ("Tube ?? playing with the killer")
