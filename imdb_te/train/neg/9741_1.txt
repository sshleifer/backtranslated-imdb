(Spoilers) This ever-more blunt episode in British cuisine, cleaner of steiner's henna, is one of the worst colors ever. That, and the amazing caterpillars on the old evil man who steals Steiner's innovation. MST3K does an excellent job of making a wretched boring and gray movie funny. When Mike kills Mike with his 'touch of death' and especially alive in the theater, Mike "Guys, I am dead is eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this movie ..." It's discouraging, let's look at the rest of human beings. The film being sold as a sleeping assistant can do the future. Some of the hits in the film are bad: the police inspector - "Electrostatic!" Crow - "Shocking, is not it?" Police Inspector- "LOVE it, All right" Tom Servo- "Very little, right through the floor!" Inspector of Police - "Can I Find It?" Tom Servo- "He's dead, but kicked yourself" MST3K is absolutely the only way to watch this snoozer.
