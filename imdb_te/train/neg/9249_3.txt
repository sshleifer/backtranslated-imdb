When looking at the movie, I do not know what I should take. If a writer does not direct his work and has a reason to work in it, you can not do this. The film has really enjoyed the story because of the director who wore a lot of hats. Mrs. Mactor movie. To add to her incredible talent, I am engaged in this woman's role. Here the British actress can do anything. In my view, the controversy makes drama and a great story. I thought this film was not for me. Everything is somewhat easier for the characters, chhactractors are the real barriers to preventing them getting what they want. Look at the picture for sweet, but most of all Ms. For McTeer's brilliant performance.
