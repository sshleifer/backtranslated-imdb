First of all, I believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the bitterly emotional imagery of the 70s and 80s, the films in this area really have a bit of humor. Imagine .. the real comedies were made! <br /> <br /> In the 90s and early decades, many good films made the filmmakers' new generation. After the film critics received acclaim and loaded the money. <br /> <br /> * Small spoiler * It's not just fun. Not once. Never. But the thing ... we think its funny. Because we used Norwegian films to be funny. Especially with some really funny comedies cast like this. But .. they do not tell anyone funny or do not! Where is comedy Show me the humor! The hardest clerk played by Harold Aiya? Will it totally ridiculously overturn the unreal football coach? Does this mean by Arne Schick? <br /> <br /> But it's not my main play about United. It is predictable. (I'm still scared of fake comedies since I've seen it in many other movies too), and you know it's undesirable. All characters are displayed correctly at the beginning of the film, and they eventually fit to everyone. <br /> There is absolutely no room for surprising things! <br /> <br /> When I see this film, I can say I'm feeling bad. This is a film that we probably know that Norway needs some new blood in the film ... again! <br /> <br /> <br />
