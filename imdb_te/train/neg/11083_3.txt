The movie was late at night when I saw it. It's interesting initially but it does not convince me overall. I'm not a Tyson fan. I do not really like boxing. <br /> <br /> But I thought the film was just beginning. Actors alright, especially George C. Scott (Cass D'Amato). I do not know how reliable this film is. No books or books about boxing or tyson. <br /> <br /> In this film, I lost a part of its appeal and thought that I lost interest. I was awake but the last hour was just not good enough.
