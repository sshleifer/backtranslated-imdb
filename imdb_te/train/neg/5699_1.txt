Wow, this movie is terrible. I'm so happy that I do not have to pay money to watch this horrible movie. It's like a history chicken coke went on! It made it look good in the previews but it was really bad. I think the idea is good but alert. It's really bad. If u sit and think about it, you also know that it is not irrational. They come back in the day and think they have all the stuff to work. Ben Franklin did not like to sit on a day and made a terrible riddle. It's totally ridiculous, and if you want to see a bad image see it all. All and all the horrible film actually have my top 10 WORST movies I've seen.
