Okay the best film I have ever seen, but at the same time I could sit and watch twice! The story line is pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what hell I was looking at but at the same time it was so awful that I liked all the way cheaply. <br /> <br /> Zebidia is eligible to star in Oscar for her role in the film . <br /> <br /> In total, the film is pretty perfect, but after looking at your cheap laugh, look in the pounds of land.
