APES is a big fan of the "other" Planet of the pictures, I rent this DVD despite all the things my aversion to Tim Burton. Once again, he was disappointed in his uninspired direction. Also monkey makeup appears in the second rate, which is unforgivable considering the brutal budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves that once and for all he is not an actor (not as good as the Buggy Nights TV). I'm embarrassed to have real talent like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. It inspired their cleake theme because it does not have a clich√©-rendered screenplay. I rent this DVD for a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off.
