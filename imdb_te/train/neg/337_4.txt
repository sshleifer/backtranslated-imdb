Well, what to say. The Gold Child category is "very bad, that's fine." Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes very annoying lines), but you still have fun. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance was never worse than the villain Sordo played the role of Namsappa. <br /> <br /> This is the name of the golden child ... <br /> <br /> < br>
