I could not help but think behind the mask: Lesley Wuverren (the heavily magnificent film) when looking at the scene because of the real feel and the great innovative idea. It's a great movie. Acting is alright from some actors. <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is very good, but often the big blows Logical mind. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this restructuring ... it's a fantastic movie that really wants to be. (And this is not really wrong in the minds behind the picture) this is clearly built on a shoe string budget. And FX damaged the overall image altogether. <br /> Great picture. ... if you have to do some better acting and swap for a little better fx. <br /> Whoever wrote it should continue here even if it is a good idea.
