When I was younger I remembered watching this movie, but I found it, and by horror movies I saw it, "What is title?" The film is a combination of disaster starter / insect attack with fewer stars in the film. It's also somewhat boring, as you have that televised stare, this movie can be seen as commercials and the like. The plot is attacked by resort ants. I'm disturbed by something going on a bit of construction or near. In the whole movie I was the first to involve a kid entering the swimming pool in a very memorable ant attack. What is going on in this case is too slow to use surviving airplane cardboard hoses In the end, it's not too scary and very scary if you're not afraid of ants like most television films.
