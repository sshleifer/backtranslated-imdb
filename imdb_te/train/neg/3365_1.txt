This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then the muddled and meaningless special effects supplement the suspense. For example, Nell and Theo are one of the original, most chilling moments when the sounds outdoors outside their room, side by side towards the couple's beds, listening to the tear. Nell tells Theo that she should let her go to her. Nell then appears at Theo, who is several feet away and finds Theo not holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, suddenly when she dives out and slides on the floor. It tells us what is happening and does not seem to stop pulling her. <br /> <br /> Nell's final words are "nobody's about the family," says nobody. <br /> <br /> The performance of a ransom is Lily Taylor's performance, but it has not even saved this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again demonstrates herself, she is pretty externally, and has a low depth. Originally, Claire Bloom indicated her lesbian persuasion. <br /> <br /> Zeta-Jones, for example, asks Nell if she has a boyfriend - or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The naked remake of the nonsense must be a must.
