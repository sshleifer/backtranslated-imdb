<br /> <br /> Sorry, folks, reality is a real one, not just trustworthy, this film often describes Quantum Mechanics to justify inspirational ideas through such opinions. <br /> <br /> "Anything is possible" does not contain water in close observation. If anything is possible, contradictory things can happen and nothing is possible. This leads to postmodern nonsense, which is less of an attempt to relieve the established facts, as all the ideas are well-established and stupid. <br /> <br /> Science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who put it well, "Reality is it, when you stop believing, do not go away."
