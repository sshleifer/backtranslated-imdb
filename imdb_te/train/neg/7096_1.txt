It is incredible that most levels are successful in being terrible. The script, acting, direction and cast option are all terrible. Clothing, sets and fake medieval language are also absolutely awful. In an odd way I enjoyed this movie, once I agreed that I would not be good anymore. It's really shameful to see the time and effort of producing too poorly, really they are very pretty in the campus (not too incredible!), But instead we are very bored and the story of the cheesy dragons and knights, which does not seem to be in any other fictional charm. Let's hope that the Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like a man. It does!
