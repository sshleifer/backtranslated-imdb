This film is what I want the viewer to say is an emotional rape. The film supposedly caused a lot of critics in Cannes in Cannes, but the last scene for me was a newbie director just to get him out of curiosity. A voice (or any other issue for that matter) in the debate on the original violence, drug abuse or juvenile offense issue is toxic to the victim. <br /> The metamorphosis of the main character from the good but I refused to comment on the problematic boy rape scenario (the over-pulling, exaggerated version of the rape scene from "Clock Orange") and its cosmetic values. There are a few things an artist should do and try to do his / her accomplishment. . <br /> <br /> At least it would wrap up: A frightening, brutal revolution and not your time. See "A Clockwork Orange" or "Le pianiste" instead.
