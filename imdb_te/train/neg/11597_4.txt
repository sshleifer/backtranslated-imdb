With the previous installment of the Nightmare Series surviving Plas Alice, I'll find Fitzdie's once again dying dreams. This time, the murderer by Alice's sleepy child was killed by a murderer. His intention was "born again" to the real world. Who is the only one who can stop Freddy from his dead mother, but can Alice be able to release her soul to save her son? We sat in Alice Kruger's room and Amanda Kruger's room with 100 mics to the hospital, but she was not a pregnant woman, but Amanda again found herself <br /> <br /> Alice and two others who were returning from Don 4th cinema, Freddy gets some new friends before it starts to kill again, other deaths or dreams cooking Not good. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself does not look scary in this movie, the nightmare is not just scary, they are not all scary or creepy at all. /> <br /> Okay for a 5th movie in the series of acting films but overall I think this movie is really dell. (Not yet the worst film of the series, Freddie Dead is even worse) <br /> <br /> 4/10
