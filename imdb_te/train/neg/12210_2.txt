The film is a joke and one of the worst films ever made. This is a special 80s movie. In this you will destroy one man and the whole army. "First Blood Pt 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but where Arnold killed you terrorists, where you showed bad guys as a particular country. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet campaign. True, this is the peak of the Cold War, but I'm ill with the Communists or the Nazis as always enemies. There are many common American movies in this regard. Why is not an image showing Americans as an enemy? Who believes that a single soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think that something really happened? As it appears, an average, brain-cut American spectator will surely make it.
