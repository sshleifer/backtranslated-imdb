"Horrible Peoples" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see the common people common things, see your window in real life. If you want to see people who do not like stupid things, you have to look through this horrible movie Mike League. Letters speak at length, but do not actually work to communicate with each other. Why not? Probably all of us are things Lee that his characters are ineffective and curious, and he wants to portray real life. But we did not, and he failed.
