The degeneration of Monte Carlo's three Russian noblemen was eventually down to their last frank. To support their luxurious lifestyles, all four use counterfeit services and use notes in casinos, hoping to exchange bogus currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American ambassador, arrived at Monaco with his wife Helen, and decided to pulse with three visitors, hoping for financial assistance. Count of the Russians, Count Sergius Karajin, are planning to go forward to Helen, while Count Sergei Curtis is in despair. In the end, the conditions play three hands against the upper class. It is clear that Van Stroeheim is trying to convey a message (with the American women's oddity and the illusory behaviors of the elite), and the film really liked me as such a modern audience. The great performance of EvS, just like the Greed and the Wedding March, also runs just here in the mill. The image can be used to make improvements at various levels. Rating, 3.
