Jack Black is an annoying character. It's an annoying indie film for 14-year-olds. Do I want to write eight lines? Ana de la Regera is a Mexican nun, Jack Black's chaotic advances. The film is a PG 13 version of an indie movie. I really like a movie that is daring to explore Mexican culture. This film is deep in Mexican culture. I'm choking on its cultural vulnerability: Jack Black is just rude. White, like Jack Black, is not my most valuable representative in Mexican culture. Mexico's wrestling culture is not a warm place for me, a white person like me. I suspect Mexico is culturally more opaque than Jack Black <br /> <br /> I think IMDb will change my review. Has anyone reviewed his review too? Just one question.
