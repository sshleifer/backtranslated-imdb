Perhaps Elizabeth Ward Grassen, who is only reminiscent of Bill Clinton's "Bimbo Vispotations" (they now have pills for that!) Is perhaps the weakest part of the show. It really continues with the tired formula of the Highlander series- Hero immortality is another immortal with a flashback about the last time they met, but there is some controversy, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special special sequence. <br /> You have the role of Nick Wolf. In general, the 90's hero hero with your distinctive "sexual tension" storyline. (Why do you think the Hollywood type of sexual excitement is more interesting than sex). It is a joint Canadian / French production, so half the series imitates New York in Vancouver, and the other half is Paris ... Just like Highlander.
