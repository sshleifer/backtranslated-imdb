Clever Young Adam wants to be a feel-good underdog story of a lone gas trying to face some mental-sexual problems with his dead mother's next to David Mackenzie's. It wants to be sandy, realistic and mysterious. At the same time, he wants to be funny and reckless as a distorted leader. <br /> In this order, the film tries hard for the young. Its poster has hand-drawn characters that look like Juno. Its original soundtrack features fast paced indie rock, which attempts to convince the audience that it is Halal; Just a little bit misleading. <br /> <br /> As a young adam, the central secret of the film is related to the drowning woman - Halam's mother. Young Adam keeps its secret silent, meditative, and well enough to press you with the truths as they come from. Halam makes the opposite of the enemy. It is mentally preoccupation of his character and in advance he can not really do anything outside of his expectations. In the opening scene, Halam is looking at his sister home with his sister around with her boyfriend. Halam was rapidly interrupted when stressing his presence in the home. <br /> <br /> Let's see if his mother sinks in secret, whether her father's suicide or suicide is murder. Audiences can never really believe Halham, because aside from the creepy, we think his invasion led him to insanity. Halamam is very simple and it blocks my mystery. When he finds some evidence that supports his argument, he flees home, and looks like it looks for the police first. <br /> <br /> When Jamie Bell brings some very graceful features in his lost character, he is limited, but he is very bored of a girl who looks like her mother. His mental needs are clear. This film is not mysterious, but it is not blunt. It tries to find reality in dealing with such problems, but it adds a lot of self-conscious spock, which itself represents as an opposition. This will help audiences look out for audience sound for a soundtrack-heavy, traine spotting attitude, camps for audience, moves, and temporary movements. This urban tension has been involved in the Talal Adventures Halam, a very young boy in a very difficult place and they are not sexy, grass or pleasant. They are neutral than anything; Does not promote the character or story. <br /> <br /> He hopes that trials and hardships of Hallam will enjoy you without much theoretical justification. The film depends on the perspective of a person who is involved in a view of airrealism / engaging in the audience's view. Clearly, most people hate it. And Halam Fai recognizes that, but Halham does not see the morality of his decisions. He goes from person to person, tries to fill his deep vacuum. Halam's love interest is a particularly disturbing line from Kate, where she says in anesthetics, "I love the creepy boys", perhaps asking the audience to do the same. She tries to advance her understanding of the line (her inspiration is obscure) and tries to get us more out of judgment. It's not hard to like Halam, but it is very difficult to participate in his adventure - even if it is an adventure. <br /> <br /> The weaker third law from Mackenzie, with heavy motion through the muddy development and the film with vague direction, is heavier. Recently, the film was renamed to US release and for what reason? It is even more obscure, but hard truth is not to earn the title 'Mr.' by the title of Halam.
