My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a major disappointment. This is a native American version of Magu. He is a zealous father, failing at everything he's trying to do. Fishing, hunting, in a clear way his family fakes his forest. His "scenes" are not ridiculous, and in this process he has asked his son several times about many obvious things. The film can not express how bad it is. The film makes it even harder, which is very real for both children and wife. I can not get humor ... if you do not like to laugh with other people who are fooling themselves. I do not want to go to these awards. Save your bucks, which is not a rental value.
