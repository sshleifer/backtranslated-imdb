Souza Honey Movie Vera-Ellen is a movie that is very close to ice skating: blonde, pasic is always happy to see, but is not a good actress and is usually filled with a weak point. When I see Vera-Ellen's sexy pursuit dance with Jean Kelly in 'Words and Music', I can not help her notice that the blouse (yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes) is made from the South Vietnam flag. For some reason, most American Vera-Ellen has appeared in two concerts (several years apart) in Edinburgh, including 'Let's Be Happy' and 'Happy Go Lovely' for its cast. /> <br /> In the latter case, Caesar Romero plays the role of an American Impressionist who is responsible for a musical performance in Edinburgh. The Edinburgh Festival has a vague attempt to link this presentation, which is nonsense: the Festival is not a show for Splash Leg Shows. We also see some of the Royal Mile's stock shots: Unlike some highland voices, there is no attempt to inform the Scottish climate in the film. <br /> <br /> When Romero's show title is 'You Frolics to You', the funniest gag occurs at the very start: it's not the Britons and the Yankees. <br /> <br /> Vera-Ellen, as always, is a pretty, attractive and impressive dancer, but very few musical instruments in the film are boring and bad. This theme - a mistake between David Niven and Reporter Gordon Jackson - is misplaced, even though it is more than several dozen Hollywood musicals. <br /> <br /> Romero suffered less than usual, perhaps because he did not have to persuade him (for once) that he was interested in the heroine in the bedroom. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest crime is Bobby's misuse of housewives. Sally Onhouse's father is the lead actor in West End musicals; His confusing role in "Shis My Laugh" in Britain in 1937 was a big hit. Here, he shows up in several scenes like Romero's dogs, but it is not possible to participate in the musical number or any kind of romance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ The character actress Ambrosin Phillips (whom I once worked on) shines in a restaurant sequence, and has a glimpse of Doomed Beauty Kew Kendall. Vera-Ellen's confident, Diane Hart, is one of the most annoying tones I've ever heard: Jon Greenwood and Glenis Jones are the same as the attempt to follow, but it does not match. The Val Guest story is credit, but the film does not come up to its fantastic comedy. Color photography is damaging, but post-war Britain has not been able to do the work of Hollywood. 'Happy Go Lovely' is the most fun time-thunder, and 'water' is an operative term. I will rate this movie from 10 to 10.
