** Spaniers ** I've rented "Tessie" (or "Thesis" in English) on the strength of Alejandro Amanabar's next attempt "The Others". A striking, measured, and horrifying effect of the film is that his earlier efforts are of the same quality and I'm in a mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with a lame-brain slasher image that I saw from the German movie "Anatomy" (which is a kinda remind me) is very tedious, no need for inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Plots are potential but it is thrown away in the first 20 minutes. This revolves around the innocent-n-beauty psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper Denginger) on the topic of violence in films. Too much to go in some distance situations, she seizes a black tape, on which two men kill torture, cut and kill a young girl for the camera. Both Angela and her horror-buff friend Chef (Feale Martinez) are surprised, the tape is surprised and decides to come down to those responsible for it. <br /> <br /> They can not give you any reasons why they can identify the girl's killers (despite denying the police at all of the events they end up with), mystery even bunny girls in full room graham There is a limp like Norton. There is only one correct 'clue' (used killers camera type was detected) and it was a) a really weak and b) cycles in the first 20 minutes. The luck of the rest of the so-called "unraveling" occurs through rising ridiculous plot turns and SLEW of the awful, transparent and totally nonsense red herring to get out of running time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenbar learns about ghost stories about his stories but never reads a detective's book in his life. Prior to having a large group of absolute suspects and going for the final turn, it is crucial for a good use to eliminate one of the clever exclusion and the one that regularly finds more evidence. "Tessis", * Pacific Spoiler AHEDED * The recognition of the killer is almost exactly predictable by the 'detective' and the writer takes 100 minutes to refuse our fragrance until it runs from those ideas. Hands up and says "Okay, I got it, it's all after him"! Such luck - for what kind of logic or motive behind crimes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that pulls "Tesses" from a dumb, unfortunately written thriller is that it really tries to do it. Some ridiculous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. I do not know what kind of attitude I'm taking on this topic, but it's wrong in a ton of confusing, chaotic manorabules, between the remaining songs and "Look at me! I'm politic!" "He said. The final sequences, called "point" of the film, are totally absurd and shrewd, and if Amanabar is in trouble now, she can not help her. If he does not, he must be perfect. <br /> <br /> In total, I wasted something two hours (at least six), and I believe that anything can happen. Movies ("Videodrame" for anyone?) But it's not easy to step down as a child, "it's all about the film's mythical" frightening films "(and the film, mainly because they are trying to make this film look like the world's criminals!) Will it be cold? ' The landscape (ie: "My Little Eye") ... "Tessis" is the lowest of all time for the "Black Picture" style. At each level, this is a good dead and buried. I'll donate it to a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but it's all getting there.
