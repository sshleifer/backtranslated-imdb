I loved the first two movies, but this film is a waste of time and money (for myself and the studio). I'm still wondering why this horrible movie. The thing with the toy car, which goes into the plastic gun and into another car is ridiculous. The first two films Joe Pessie and Daniel Stern are very funny, but this one is not so stupid and funny as terrorists. The time I believe in this film is just waste.
