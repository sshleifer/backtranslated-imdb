High heels tricky things. They take a touch of forward and brittle elegance with a sharp statement of style that women (or cross dressing men) can lift new heights. Alternatively, they may be a dangerous foot injury that can lead to trips, waterfalls and ultimate tragedy. <br /> <br /> Almod√≥var's mother-daughter play is certainly stylish, but in terms of plot it is the tongue tongue and tedious affair full of confusing complexes, characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments next to comedy, Tacos Leganoos is not interesting. The best bit comes in the beginning of an amazing MacBar case of a manslaughter driven by a boy. Black comedy looks from this amazing bit of things, but then the film comes into the heel. <br /> There are rigid enough acting appearances and some stylish, art direction that you expect from Almodovar but otherwise the Toacans are not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. It can be a dramatic powerhouse with murder, showbiz, femininity, broken-maternal-daughter relationship and alternatively a judge who is a judge, a protagonist and police informer. Instead it is poor. High heels are obvious.
