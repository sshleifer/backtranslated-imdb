From the '70s, author / producer / director Charles Band is responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror B-movies. Some of them are excellent examples of how to use a small budget for a maximum effect; Most of them are very bad. Transformers (1985) is one of those rare gemstones. <br /> <br /> Terminator style tale of time-travel and action, Transformers Tim Thomson portrayed Jack Death. Whistler who traveled past by living an ancestor's body. Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers, turning them into obedient zombies (titles of the title) and attempting to change the change in history by killing the ancestors of future heroes. <br /> <br /> This jana is still living in Jack in 1985. Destroying Whisler, he married Lena (Helen Hunt). He helped to succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things are not calm for a long time, and trouble is Whistler's brother, E.D. <br /> <br /> Trunkers II is not the attraction and simplicity of the original and the huge disappointment of how good it is. This story is difficult to see if the first movie (or at least for a while) can not be seen, and there are non-standard actions and some poor special effects. Trancers has inventiveness and wit that made the most fun; Instead we get the script that feels like a leaner with some cheesy and it's written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give this film to fans of this genre is the cast, which contains many names for the followers of science fiction and horror films: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crofton, Richard Lynch, Martin Bevicich. Unfortunately, most of them appear to be an 'off day' when filming the Truckers II, and the performances are the best. <br /> <br /> The trackers have fans in the series; Four subsequent sequels erupted. Unless the quality is taken up with a swinging swing, I can not imagine being good any of them.
