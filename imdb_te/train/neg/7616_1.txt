The good news was portrayed on a film Aztec legend and unusually Aztec-American (such a word exists). <br /> <br /> The bad news was found dead at birth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> 'The Legend of Diablo' 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' The future versions of the apparently animal feed. <br /> I do not think this is a 'B' image too. Product values ​​are very different, I have a feeling of looking at a long ski from different shows or looking at a backyard 8-mm film shot by a group of school students. <br /> <br /> "A rural California sheriff finds a box containing Aztec troll and unintentionally impedes it in society." His daughters, a hot and a nun, a gringo FBI man <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene seen in the previous movies of the past is re-implemented again. Nutty professors walked like an army, rather than the one who did not! The imaginary infrared scenes from the viewpoint of the demon were nothing special and he / she / it certainly looked far behind (as opposed to moving around) and the scene from the cave climbs the swiftly moving from the cave to the funniest It's actually done for the comic effect I do not know it! I started to run Benny Hill theme music & chase the whole priest on the beach for a whole gang of zombies. <br /> <br /> Darth Vader / Field of Dreams Voice, Agent is obviously ridiculous. Then again, this cheese ball is too much! The screenwriter and author of the screenplay Robert Napton must win some of this effort! (How about a lifespan like 'Hollywood 10'?) This one, I see now, is rated at a 10-level 1.5. I fear this may be a tad generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this film? Well, Lindsay Lofaso looks pretty hot as the sheriff's young daughter of the dead. Perhaps the biggest sister of her home (Calvi Pabon) really fled away from home! Fred Estrada is a good FBI agent. Mario Soto, who played the role of Father Rodriguez, was not the same Mario Soto that competed for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have difficulty with baseball. <br /> In fact, they went with a baseball plot and were able to say 'Demons in the Outfield'. <br /> If I find this is actually a community college film class, I will apologize. It may be better for B or B + until the college's Camcorder campus returns to one piece! 'The Blair Witch Project' has proven that a cool, campy movie can be grayed out. 'The Legend of the Diablo', however, did not appear to work from a shoestring or boot! It's low-budget, low talent, low-sum. Final view-and the final 10 seconds mean to me-just a little creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> For this rent, I paid $ 3.45. I spent a good hamburger!
