This amazing overtime television series (26 episodes, 25 minutes each) is about a 14-year-old boy (and his two girl's classmates). Angels have given a very low explanation or their number has increased in recent years, and they just do not seem to pop out somewhere for no obvious reason (why do not you attack humans at once instead of trying to destroy you?).

Universal appreciation for this piece of garbage is just unbelievable; and this series "One of the greatest achievements of mankind" is probably the most stupifying comment I've heard on IMDb - the fans' ridiculous ads and I've seen some doozies.
