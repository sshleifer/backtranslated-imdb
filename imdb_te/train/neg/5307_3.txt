What happened? 'Doubt' was great - it was a simple movie - but it failed with a simple plate that I liked to watch. The only thing that can be done for the film is the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who deserves Oscar-nomination to Dusbard. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and honest role, which was blown up by the screen. <br /> <br /> However, the screenplay of a screen legend did not continue with the film downhill. Without boring start, no power or punch - less than the end of the deal, the film was really disappointing-especially through its promotion and trailers. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the director is facing difficulties with simplicity. He was very much overwhelmed by the movie, with a lot of discussion and not enough action. <br /> Furthermore, the Oscar-nominations are less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a good performance, it was not an Oscar-worthy. (Especially Wil Smith, leaving the shows in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams is not eligible for nomination. Seeing Amy Adams is like watching a cardboard box - it's one hand and plain. She would have more sense to be nominated for a Razzie, because I can say that she had been successful. Viola Davis gave a small but honest performance, but questioned whether the length of her performance was really a nomination for the academy. <br /> <br /> Overall I was one of the disappointing movies of this film which is very cumbersome and I do not recommend it. Meryl Streep gives a spectacular, solid performance - the only shining light in the film is not enough to save the movie too. *** / 10.
