... it's definitely not a ringing endorsement. Overall, "dinosaur" is a better image. Sure, the film portrays Matt Bolenghini in the full-fledged bag-bag role of a full-fledged film about his little brother Dino Crock eaten. But special effects in "DinoCroc" are good, plot lines are good, and acting are good. There are problems with "blood surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Bollenghi & Co. Get a shipwrecked on a deserted island, in which they encounter an extreme group of ugly Filipino locals who try to force themselves onto the women in the group. This is complete waste within 15 minutes. And 3) there is not enough crock time. There are a couple of vomiting features of "Blood Surf" - actresses are pretty attractive and eaten by Crock at the end of Matt Bolenghi's film. But if you are on your death and have only enough time to see a Matt Bolenhiye / Killer Crocodile film, skip this and shoot "DinoCroc".
