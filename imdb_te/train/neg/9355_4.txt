Recently I have been able to meet Marilyn Miller's movies since I have not recently shown in TCM in the UK. I have been amazed for so many years because this is one of the 20s superstars. She 's really what .Some stars of this era like Jalson are still shining, but not for Miller. But her dance is awkward and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited and she looks like Ruby Keeler Hepburn. For all the people, the movie grew tired of musical. In fact, we have removed all the music numbers. So we're with a little real appeal with the comedy of that time. She paid $ 500000! So I have two finishes. She did not work in the film or she did not have any talent. I think the truth is true.
