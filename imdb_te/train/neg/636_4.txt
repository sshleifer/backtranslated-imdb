Farmers are struggling in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys his wife, Looney Rainer, O'Lan. American stars appear in the main characters, speak fake tones and emphasize old stereotypes and patriarchal doctrines. People have a good wife, many children and land. They see as property and capital. This is a huge budget film because there are many additional collaborations, big sets have been built and special effects, and filmmakers can not take a risk of appointing lesser-known actors. Louis Rainier has won an Academy Award for the show, which is definitely the worst in the film. Her unforgettable face has produced a barrier between her and the audience. The O-Lan family has a good role with heart and sympathy. On the other hand, Paul Muni showed his talent again and gave a better performance. Another problem with the picture is ending. Franklin does not know when the film ends. The film may be dangerous if taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
