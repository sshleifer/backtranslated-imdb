If you have not seen this yet, I just say to move, take a walk in the park, do not waste your time. The scenery or acting is not worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not judge it badly: film or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is questionable, and I hope she can improve over time. The storyline is unbelievable. Are American police criminals fighting a loose cannon in his own Europe? Infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks ??? Is a emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police executive dubber than hammers sack ??? Will you be. There is only one good thing about this film, though: at least, the cost of production should be lower than "Ocean's 12", which is meaningless and above what is above.
