Axis & Allies will certainly take the time to play spy sports across North Africa and the rest of the world. It was not in the best films, but it was not much worse than the budget films, which was previously described in the Compilation War Classics. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was one of the first to make one of his first films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Park (ParkerCarcus). Why he always had big characters crossed me. <br /> <br /> The film is part of a super class package in the Super Class package. Eight films for eight bucks, in which some good-to-be-feature films have some good actors trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script is not good. Editing & Cinematography ... is worse. If you want to pass all that and see the future Cisco Kid & a great sidekick who has never fulfilled his true potential of sin, pick it up perfectly! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> Thunder.
