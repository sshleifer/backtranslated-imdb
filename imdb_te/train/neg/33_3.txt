This is a remarkable TMNT franchise. <br /> <br /> When I liked the original cartoon, I thought this kid was Deuce. <br /> <br /> Mafia Ape is the man who explains to his followers. It's brutal. Most fans hated the series including a female turtle, but I do not care. I did not remember her until I read about this program. All in all, it is badly forgettable. <br /> <br /> The same thing is the theme song. Guilty happiness, they call ... Nananana ninja ...
