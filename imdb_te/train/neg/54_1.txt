The only good thing about this film is that Goldie Hone is struggling to keep her little French cut bikini drops and keep a dozen other damaged women from her removing her skimpy little cotton top of the cooed. Ooooof! Nina Hart's rival rival. The film came out when I was fourteen, and that shot almost killed me. I remembered Godi's smokin hottie of a lady, and I forgot all the things that were in my mind's mischievous rodoods until the other day in TV that was in the obscure TV, In the 80s. Kurt Russell should have a fun life.
