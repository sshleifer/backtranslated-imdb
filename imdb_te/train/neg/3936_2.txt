Wow. I thought this was a tragedy but worse than expected! Sometimes I want to see a good "car-crash" movie: that's so bad that you probably can not see away if you want to see how bad you can get. This is the only reason to really leave the television - morbid fascination. It is not just mediocre or slightly worse acting than the ones expected from these actors, but the plot and plot never to see the day's brightness. The script, also, is gusto-motivating. For cinematography, someone found that they used a "currents drawing" segment device in the old "TV show" ... but without parodying? At first I thought they should be funny but the picture would take even more seriously when used in this way in the cheek manner in a tongue. Do not ask me about the score ... The final song by Morsheba is the final song. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for $ 8 for them ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just crazy! Am I wondering whether Timothy Hutton is struggling to find a lot of work earlier? I guess if you do not expect too much, and want to see a mindless thriller, which is better than spending an evening clip on your toen, which is why a 2 greatness.
