Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and others are among the most talented black directors who bring in well-deserved credits. Then at one time (15, years ago) there were a very funny television show 'In Living Color', which included Weimans Brothers, and Jim Carrey's career. Now we have a ridiculous alternative and the voices in the standard operating system (toilet humor). They are not as foolish as they are portrayed in 'The Little Man'. Is it just a month old for a baby with a teeth and tattoo? The baby comes with a five-hour shadow, he kills. It is said that the baby had sex with her pet mother, behind Darryl 's back, behind her husband .Oh, it is just hilarious. A Master Criminal "Little Man" is stupid on planet earth. He stashes a stolen rock that is just too big in a woman's purse and sustain her. Co-star Chazz Pammini, Why Chazz, gives the best line: "I'm around Moorens." Based on, without credit, a Chuck Jones cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny. It is also very fond of being remotely funny. The film Damon Wayne is so bad that before the Clay Awards, Jay Leno's other night did not even mention this horrible film. When the Hollywood green lighting trash from the Veyron brothers stop trash. In all likelihood when they kidnap their white man.
