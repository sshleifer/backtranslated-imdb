I'm starting this review with the big spoiler about this film. Do not read more ... Here comes, rotate your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always existed in other slasher films, killed here. <br /> <br /> I saved you for 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> It is one of those cheap films that were thrown into the middle of the dark era in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Two priests and college students got a nasty rap here. <br /> <br /> They are sophisticated morons who face many internal problems to deal with how the junior college campus finds life and college students get worse. <br /> <br /> It 's good to see your head cleaner tape, but it' s more entertaining. <br /> <br /> It 's a strong physical abuse, <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
