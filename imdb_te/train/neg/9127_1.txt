Well, here's the basic plot. It was 1933, Peter Sellers Da Fu Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived a long time. The film begins with his birthday in which he celebrates his life by drinking a special dish (not even mentioning the film). Well this is the Ambition Assistant (if you remember the Pink Panther Movies) and he ordered his servants to find 6 rare items to make commands. This creates a world war hunting that attempts to sell sellers to diamond engravings and entering London, with Dr Fu's Numismis, a retired Scotland Yard Detective Neyland Smith. <br /> It is a full-length film full of sellers that he has died before he dies. Terrible tragedy is that he is in it. There are characters in the memorable 'funny characters' and 'party' in such a wonderful comedian Sellers and Panther films, but there is something in the film. The film was full of torture and I could not finish it. I kept cringing when he looked completly DIES and sellers performance. After the great writing of 'being there', how can I do this, how can I do this and how to do this? <br /> If a person says the first 10 to 15 minutes is correct, then it is everywhere. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague.
