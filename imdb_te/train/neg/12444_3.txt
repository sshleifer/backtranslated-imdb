<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I love 50 science fiction, I also love cheesy 50s science fiction, but this movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> Ajax & Costello's best "hip cat" seal are the bosons virtually non-existent. <br /> <br /> Chessukeux is usually the cheesy science fi, but "Moon Cat Woman on the Moon", but this is not the case. <br /> I see Gloria and Dolorres walk around an hour or so before the spaceship.
