I caught this film in FX last night, and I was sitting there watching it, it probably happened to me that it's probably the worst film ever. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely unbelievable combat scenes, stupid characters. All of this made me the most ridiculous movie ever seen. It's very bad, I wish there was nothing semi-excellence I'd be looking for ... and they did a sequel!
