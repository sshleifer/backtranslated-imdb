The words are bad and the words are not really explained. I thought Zandalee was evil, but at least stroking the moment here and there to stop you from having some nice shots and shakes off occasionally good gud. It's just ridiculous! Terrible script, poor direction, terrible acting and what do you know? I can not think of one thing to recommend about it other than that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself at the dentist and do some root canals - more enjoyable and better value for money (if you want!). Incidentally, I must type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this image. It's rigid!
