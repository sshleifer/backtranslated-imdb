The film was written and directed very badly, and it acted in a befitting belief. It should be rebuilt with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals on a polished, professional and absolutely believable side, and on the other hand, Richard is quick and agile to this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levin are just scary for slaves (and keeping) the couple. Actors (and the director) did not try to do all of them - they were incompatible and unreliable. It is good to have a good job in real English. Casting is ridiculous. Children of an "African" merchant (therefore less socially Gays de calyuri society) were cast with very light blue actors, but socially desirous Marcel, exactly the African features, which clearly has a delicate "front"? The casting directors will not be able to read the script they are playing, and it will not be possible to pick the appropriate actors from a large pool of talented and talented actors. It's just weird! It is a great movie and must be reproduced, but can choose people who respect things and choose appropriate and talented actors. There are a lot of good actors, and it's fun to see how to do a good script and a good direction with Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunzata and Gloria Reuben's right cast.
