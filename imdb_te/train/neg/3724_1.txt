In the 1970s, Nayanimo BC saw this film twice through the Pentecostal Church, my family. I am 6 years old, my brother is 4, and my brother was eight when I was 8. This film is my brother and I am worried about seeing the world with distrust. It's not just a movie, but a "sign of the beast" and a lot of "Christian" sinking philosophy about the rapture. This film, church, and unstable negligence can lead to serious mental illness in the future. For years, I lived under the impression of the church and fear of the forgotten by Christ. I'm 40 years old now. The counseling went through years. I once described a film psychiatrist about this film and the church and family's trust system. I was pegged with a fetal disorder. When I actually started believing this, it reminded me of my brother, this cultural philosophy actually took place. In the future I'm scared and afraid of all church members. I have taken this experience to accomplish a purpose, and I am attending my license as a psychologist in particular with childhood injury.
