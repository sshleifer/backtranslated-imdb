The plot was alerted as promised. I have not seen the whole movie to be honest. About an hour later I had to make a decision. Is not it worth watching this movie till the end? The answer is clearly NO! It is not true that the human body is refusing to change from different species. He does not mean that he has been pursued by secret government officials for a human / wolf exchange. Because the film was badly bad, there was no emotion for performance and I did not understand many scenes with wolves and buffalo. He walks through my bored mind when he walks the zoo with a dog pack and leaves them in front of the zoo gate "If you can not walk with big dogs, do not leave the elder." Save yourself time and skip this image. If you dare to see me, I'll promise you, why do you think I'm thinking of waste, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema.
