When it was released I saw this film and it was reluctant for me, this year is with me. <br /> <br /> Graveye's goal here is to take every literary image in the tempest, and it seems to be genuine. If a character says, "My heart flees," we are shown a true human heart, attached to the winged pair of wings, flapping across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes for some lush teal stuff, but ultimately it is a simple exercise. <br /> <br /> It is worth knowing that I hate other audiences who have appeared in the film, but it is not for everyone in the audience.
