For a while I have not seen this movie, so I'm afraid I will not be too specific about the details ... it has some interesting points. Jeararar. Ralph Bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of Tolkien's writing is a very prestigious plan. Hence it went bankrupt at some point during production. Hence, the second book of the trilogy will end somewhere in the middle (with a shadow of the never-ending sequel's reference), the image is even less complete. Some characters seem to be animated when others are filmed, but it's hard to say intentionally. The whole thing seems strongly prepared and canceled, especially the Orcs and Nazgul. Another problem is, in fact, huge gaps in the plot. Bakshi is in a rush to complete the film and he hopes to circulate a book and a half more than two hours (the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does that twice.) Most important bits are out (and I was lovely in the book, but Which will see crazy in a movie, which, Tom Bombadil, does not only see) and of course Ka, the end, and suddenly there is a place completely. <br /> <br /> If Baki first wants to end the movie, or if he has any sense of what he will end, I'm not sure. <br /> The characters ... well, most of them are okay. Habits do not look too bad (you know that you are a Tolkien fan (like me), this movie (even though I'm not sure about the purchase of the DVD version anyway, even if you're the producer of the new trilogy actually wanted to make Sam woman) , What special features are there?) But you are the Lord of real Ring's cinema 'but not much more than a historic curiosity that's not much better than the 60s version, the Beatles continued with their plan (I think it was actually a Psychedelic LOTR as Gondal, Folto as Paul, Ringo Sam and John) Whether the book is read or not, or the animated films do not like or half-complete If you do not want to see the trunk ... stay away.
