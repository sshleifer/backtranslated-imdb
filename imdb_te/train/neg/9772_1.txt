<br /> The movie goes from one scene to another. Nearly every violence takes place. <br /> Now I'm tortured, and it's something that does not make me a film without a fight. But, please do not have another one. My reaction is not shock or horror, it is: "Here we go again." <br /> <br /> There is some resemblance to a narrative in the midst of violent scenes, but I can not wait until about two-thirds by this movie. <br /> <br /> The best filmmakers can do that, they want to do with their vicious lives, make shoes or deliver the mail.
