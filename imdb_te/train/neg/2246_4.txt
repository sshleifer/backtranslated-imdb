I've never seen the original 1954 version with Judi Garland, and it does not match. भी, it's been a few years old, but I found this story gripping or romance attractive. The film tells the story of two viewers. Yohan Norman Howard is a wearing, fanciful rock star, passing romance with the latest, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Chris Christopher Farson and Barbra Streisand are in their roles, but their chemistry or plot have a lot of mark for me. The film's Oscar winning song Evergreen's Straussand's beautiful composition, just one aspect, is only noticeable to me. She really has a powerful and wonderful voice.
