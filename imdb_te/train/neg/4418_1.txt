This film takes some digestion. On the one hand, we offer a tough outer shell, a story not only derived from the Catholic Church, but crazy, and do not know. In an inner layer, we offer an ugly story on orthopracy, what happens when people blindly follow a belief that people do not understand? <br /> At first glance, it's a comedy. If so, Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. Jokes are pale; Humor is frustrating and poorly distributed. Specifically, Ms. Keaton's performance is on the top and bottom, she has less quality than Annie Hall and Sleeper Days. Jennifer Tillie is again her stylist model, with her high-pitched voice and elephant style. If it is not the last 20 minutes of the film, it will be forgiven for all, this is clearly a controversial game created in 1981. <br /> <br /> It begins with the show of four ex-students of Sister Mary Ignatius, by the Ignatius route, a male name, Shows that untold research has begun.) When they agree that they do not live up to the teachings of the church, the sister becomes irrational and encouraging the audience Dhanga corny, sepia-tone all too clich√© is believed to have returned to her when gatavalo. If one of them has two abortions, the nun will become more confusing, and the student pulls the gun. After sporadic away from her, the nun is killed in the preservation, perhaps killing the baby. She slays a gay student because of her sins and goes on a screaming rampage. The last shot was a woman who was dead in the pose like Christ, like the shadow of a cross that was dead on her. Can you say <br /> <br /> I know that I have been murdered in the past, and I know that many have been mentally hurt, but this plot is almost every other shot off in this train of the film. I heard from the writer and the director, why the film is about the stupidity and why not a religious tradition should be followed religiously, the pun is not intended. Nevertheless, this explanation is hard to swallow, as it has never been given an official perspective on anti-Catholic bias in one explanation or another. The film is just a Catholic anti-Catholic, which is enthusiastic and hateful entitled Simplicity and Equality. <br /> <br /> This is the film I will recommend to the hero, the facts of any hatred and ignorance they face today. If it says 'Rabbi Ray', or 'Imam Muhammad explains it,' riot in the streets and Showtime loses its subscription. <br /> <br /> But sadly, because the movie that is fought against what is considered a majority of the film is also accepted and appreciated by those who share the same hateful view. <br /> <br /> I would give it 5 to 1.5 stars not because of its objectionable nature, but because it is poorly written, poorly directed and usually a bad image. Do not waste your time.
