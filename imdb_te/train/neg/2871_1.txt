I rented this horrible movie. The worst I've ever seen. I believe that I have done a good job in a 1st grade class. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. I paid 1.50 for rent and it exceeds 1.49. The acting is terrible, the characters are terrible and the film is the worst piece. The SlatHouse House scenes have a very low budget, which makes a B Movieview look like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is if you like to waste a good evening and go to rent a little money this horrible movie. Rather than sitting through this flap again while sitting in a bucket of razors I'll see killer clowns from outer space
