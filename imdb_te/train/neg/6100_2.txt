The next attempt (which is not a review of good intentions, the final product), the film is poorly written, overworked and poorly directed. The story is clear, but the story is not in this film somewhere. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton is a human being. Her desires, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and the rest of us are similar. You never know this movie performance of the main actress. In fact the film applied for each role, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. A legend on high speech from the inhuman robot. The fact is that the only one on the board meeting will play well, and I realized that she was making a speech! Every idea she has is unbelievable in her case and she comes up with ideas that she thinks as she took a lifetime of the soul she was looking for on the spot. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she begins pontificating about the needs of the battlefield, and protects the soldiers and starts white flags. In the film, she does not come in any detail as she does in the movie <br /> <br /> In the end, the film unveiled her fighting Clara Barton. This weakens her humanity, and this is the least bit of her for the script written in the script. Author Clara Barton is unaware, and his script is based on an encyclopedia Britannica article. (Yeah they came back) But hey, good technicolor! (Who cares)
