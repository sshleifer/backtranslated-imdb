I bought this DVD set, have not seen sight, and wish I had it. The script requires some serious reprocessing, which seems to be completely in no sense and compares with the book. Lighting is awkward, very incomplete, but just as if I could overlook it. The script does not have enough attention to the characters ... it is hardly a introduction to various characters making a tad difficult to separate (who no idea who dies - especially when the planes). <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfMcGGGGG&feature=search&id=1&lang=http: If you know that you do not have anything. You do not have any focus on all the characters - you never know them - who they liked and what they did. The series is divided over 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet they wonder what they do with all the time if they do not have the characters in detail --- they put a lot of filling .... I spend at least a full hour looking at them land and take off in their flights LOL (I really need to see that over and over again ???). I've given this high rating they have developed our knowledge of the characters.
