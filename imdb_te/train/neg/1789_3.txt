I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, but I hate this film specifically. I'm from a different era and a different country, but I've found Crosby's continuous instructions for the first time in Good Old USA, shortly afterwards and finally irritating. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American - but the English feels they are not right and / or this brave need, oh so smart American visitor to show them. It is a "water out" story, but unlike these films, this time it is the upper hand "fish". <br /> <br /> As for both me and the cinema, I've been emptying a few times in a few years and at the same time every time you get the same impression. <br /> I saw another Crosby movie last night - Emperor Waltz - and that, even, produced me the same response and my surprise even my wife - is American for what it is worth - American Crosby in "Your Face" Attitudes should be irritating. Roosevelt, as she said. <br /> <br /> For the premiere of this movie, it is unique to its day and a supporting cast is very good. <br /> <br /> Even though with a previous reviewer, William and Bendox is the wig Harrid (film Mo Off the Three Stojes), the scenery and the music are good. This is a more enjoyable film without Bing Crosby's attitude to me but it's pretty hard to sit through this movie because he's in almost every shot.
