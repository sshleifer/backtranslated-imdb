There are many movies featuring Bigfoot, the majority of which are good but most of them have goofy attraction. Sasquatch Hunters are not even going for it. <br /> <br /> Saskatchet Hunters are talking about a group of paciologists, primoologists and forest rangers who come into the remote part of the Pacific Northwest Forest. The exceptional large prisoner bones were found in the region and the North American monkeys were not natural to lead the scientific expedition. Sure enough, they immediately find the entire burial ground full of skeletal remains of these enormous monkeys. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film, combining their gear, hiking through hiking, relaxing, hiking in some woods, pausing for a long time to examine and discuss some research, and further hiking into the woods and disappearing Searching for a member, more hiking in the woods, dirt, accidentally digging, and weekly Meet around a campfire to discuss the actions of the day. Sasquatch finally shows that it turns into stumbling people around the darkness at a time (made in a blink and you missed the fashion and the actual killing camera takes place). <br /> <br /> The film is intended to take seriously and the director is obviously trying to build a suspense but no one is visible, so we are dull, people are getting somewhere and scared around the woods revolving around the woods night trying to work. <br /> <br /> I have said that it does not use the simplest use of fast forward button to speed up these scenes. <br /> <br /> Saskwat himself does not have much to do and does not have a special personality. It looks like a shaggier version of King Kong, which is not all bad except for the scenes they used in CGI instead of a person in a bigfoot outfit, which is obviously clear during daytime monster scenes. A tad is not sacred to use a computer that has not helped me a part of it, but also using computer effects to bring Bigfet to life. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, It really is a premise, which is a premise which involves stretching to make a feature length motion picture without having to bother to add all the ingredients to make it a worthwhile film.
