After reading the book this week, I am very happy to see this movie. My 13-year-old son is looking forward to a lot. <br /> <br /> "I've rented the boy and this film will again go out of the book again, George C. Scott But it's only about 20% of the character in the role, he's a lot of time. <br /> <br /> I realized that this was mostly made in '84, pre-CG effects, - Movie is quality, <br /> <br /> The Christmas presents a scrooge in the tornado tour of the world, with the light and love of Christ's era <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott's "reformed" screw end <br /> <br /> I wish that Bob Crochet was filmed a bit ragged and down-treaded and short Tim ... Oh bad children's actors did not start me ...
