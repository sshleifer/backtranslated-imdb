When I was about 10 years old, I saw this movie. My mother bought it in our local camera for selling $ 5 on VHS. She thought she was a good Christmas movie to watch me and my brothers. The film, however, was scared of hell from me. You may ask yourself, does anyone need to scare someone about Santa Claus? In the attempt to kill Satan and destroy Christmas, the landscape of the film sends his followers and pitch to the ground around Satan. That's true, he sends a ghost from Satan's hell to kill Satan Claus. When Santa is trying to catch him on Earth when Christmas rises, the sach pitch stimulates throughout the Christmas day, because if he does not come back to his home, he turns to dry. I can not get it wrong, the film is funny and quite entertaining, but the depth of hell is the image of demons and devils (which occurs at the beginning of the film) is just crazy.
