It's not true silence - it's frustrating. Brits will just be able to make the truly embarrassing picture with no one of the American version's over-the-top highnnics. The combination of both the original series lighting and the settings combined with creepy stories and the subtleties of the show. <br /> <br /> Another poor adaptation is accompanied by a terrifying application of "cracker". Watch for delights like BBC, America or BBC Canada, Walking like Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Look for original touches, and then look for "Blood in the Blood" for Robson Green's really poor and elegant appearance. Hollywood must have a look to this actor!
