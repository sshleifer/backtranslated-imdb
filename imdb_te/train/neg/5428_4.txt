Another Priyadarshan / Vohra TP Another film that was unlike the original wish for me, I saw this film because the film (Akshay Paresh and many others) did not have regulars, but I did not need to say that <br /> <br /> There are fewer estimates from this film. <br /> <br /> I am happy with actors, Rajpal Yadav wants again, but he removes some laughs, but this standard strap stick non-genuine jokes, in fact this whole movie is like Doll Play, which I did not make any big noise Do you take some sort of talent, or have you played odd good beat at Dale? <br /> <br /> For any other device, Druroe does not need any talent, it does not have variations. , And it has enjoyed a lot of monkey dances (like Rajpal Yadav, a good analogy), but it will not be entertaining for you anymore, or you may even dance like Dhol. <br /> <br /> The film is like Dol and Dumor, sometimes Dol is played with Durro, sometimes with the two together, but mostly Dumor is acting alone and the Monkey has danced. <br /> <br /> The film has some good good moments, but after a while I have a damn dowry (initially entertaining), the bigger episodes are really "Mere Insurance KO AND KYUN MARA" <br /> <br /> The film has moments, except for Rajpal Yadav, actors have done a good job. I said it and I have said it again, especially Sharon Joshi and Tushar Kapoor, especially in multi-star comedy films. <br /> <br /> When a girl tried to miscarry, miscarriage, and try to make the movie more intuitive with mystery, Later, 45-60 minutes are being tortured, the climax "its bid at almost good category", I mean they are very imaginable, a scene you can not imagine Can not imagine and you break into a sudden explosion of laughter? <br /> <br /> The film looks like it's coming and starts to laugh at almost the gag. <br /> <br /> The film's odd Bump, down or up, leads to gradual decline in movies, and then quickly down the hills they make girlfriends. <br /> <br /> Most bad scenes are very eventually, the mill tries to do more than this movie than the comedy run, reeked of old and repetitive, last 10-15 in particular is inseparable and completely spoils this <br /> <br /> I did not play Tanu Shree Datta's many female sisters, and her acting talent, especially with her insignificant view, is a hot <br /> <br /> Technically weaker Â£ is the constant gaze of women and shoddy lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The song song is not good when the songs in the 2nd half enjoy mass gas from the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are not in a hurry, </ p> <p> <br /> </ ref> <p> <br /> </ ref> </ ref> </ </ p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> I am trying to be a target here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie is very low Meets the expectations, so I will give all the doubts to the fullest words The film is a 4 Not)
