It's not all the time that slasher movies are very well made, but for what it does, it is very amusing. This theme is dull, but killing is not too bad. If you do not follow the bands that appear in the film, you have to be honest, you will see the movie as funny. I saw this movie and I know that the poor quality of the film is really disappointing, but understand that it was made during the vacation time of the tour, friends start to play down and drink alcohol. .. It is not taken seriously. It's punk's best and more than 100 people have been killed, this is a very ultra-scary movie that has friends to watch, drink, and hilarious!
