When you buy a hallmark card you will know what you get. A sappy, simple poem and that is $ 3.99, thank you very much. You're the same with the Hallmark movie. Here we come out of a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgin retirement, in fact, he does not die as we think. Poor Ernie, a poor spirit and marriage that he had married several years ago at Ethel Mormon lasted for a few weeks. In this film, Ernie described the grandfather who jumped in the first feet and bonds with his long lost grandkid. We have seen before. You can enjoy this movie but please do not tell me that you are not warned.
