<br /> <br /> I saw this in science fiction channel. It came right after the first. For some reason this film made me curious. <br /> --- Spoilers --- Well ... I saw how to do this movie. In the first film, he has a "cause" to kill people, but in this sequel, murders / average murders are not the cause of half. Because of creative differences, Stanley kills the director, who has seized the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal that tried to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted to "see the truth when they died"? If it is considered such a high budget film, use special effects, MAN. In fact, the first is that the captured girl is away, and Stanley goes into confusion and exasperated. Wuovo (irony). The potential probability of this movie. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I'll see a "Lake 3 Cabin". Since I liked Jade Nelson, he is the only good part of this sequel.
