For the last 20 minutes, I think this is probably the worst movie of Jackie Chan (I do not know, except for his previous 1978 work). The final fighting range has changed all of this: it's long and good and intense - in fact, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that is five years old (oh, look, someone threw a tomato at the face of that person) and amuse the endless "football" scenes. Dubbing (where "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - see what to do with it). The "Lord of the Dragon" is worth not only for the last fight alone, but for the rest of the jockey collectors, and only then only those who have seen at least 15 of his other movies. (**)
