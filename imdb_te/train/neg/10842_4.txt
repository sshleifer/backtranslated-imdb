The cast was recently seen in the TCM recently, with the expectation of a low-valued gem, from about 30 years to many films. It's not a gem - semi-precious. Unhealthy clothing and rolls Royce lemon of the 1930s you hit immediately. Casting is also amazing. But mostly, there are very dumb and unnecessary plots. This film has a basic plot that has good ingredients and promise, but the components do not mix according to the right recipe. It just might not be together. And it is a shame. <br /> <br /> The film is about the American showgirl (Jean Harlow) who wants a great American British husband - the upper class. She meets Franchot Tone and his friend, who is in a lark in Rolls Royce's owner's owner. Harl mistakenly thinks the Lord is the owner of the tone rolls, and she sets her attention on her. This first part of the movie is a light comedy of real distinction. <br /> However, Tone is unaware of the fact that his owner is actually a German 5th coincidence during the WWI, and the film alters the tone altogether and begins to decline. Tone and harl, but he is wiped out by the Mata Hari-type (Benita Hume), as the honeymoon begins, and Harlow fled that scene, blaming her for a killer Tone's murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> She fled to France in Harl, and she fell in love again - this time with a wealthy French coat (Carrie Grant). The tone, now in the army, and Harl is accidentally reunited at the Grant Hospital room where he is rehabilitated in a plane crash. In the following scene, Torn blames Harlow for leaving her because she is a gold-digger. She never explains about the evidence in Harl, who blamed her for killing her! <br /> <br /> Then Tone re-introduced himself with a baked woman (Hume). She was with her to see her Priyargender, Grant, to test the new aircraft sent by him from Tone England. Incredible, hume and tone are both identical to each other, but can only be loaded from where! Well, the tone was shot dead; Perhaps his memory is low. But how many men did he know that she could forget one of her marks? (It does not seem to be removing her memory. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Hulme should be fully aware of him, but when she realized that her tone could not keep her it was shy. <br /> <br /> That finale is very unsatisfactory. The film, Tone and Harlow Cad, was designed to protect Grant's good reputation, leading to his fraudulent burial. <br /> <br /> In the Harl describes her face as having fled in panic, allegations of murder; Tone forgives her and shares her love with her silently; Although she helps her run the crash site to save her reputation, he takes the fire for her. Meanwhile, Harlow finally finds his way to Cad Recognized. Then, when he was a brave and noble man's tone, Harlow said his feelings. Chitra end, while working together to care for the look of the death of Grant reconcile with both of them. After Grant's hero buried, we see them hug and fade out. It made a nice little picture. <br /> <br /> For Carrie Grant fans, the tone was killing a French assassin and attending a longtime first husband with Harlow. <br /> <br /> Francht Tone starred in Irish, Cary Grant, a Frenchman in England. The film was contrary to the characters they played well. That's also the image that was more compatible ...
