Alisteen (Laurel Barnett) recently lost his mother for young Rosalie Norden (Rosalion Cole). But Rosalie keeps her dead mother long and visits her tomb (in a cemetery behind the house comfortably) and nighttime ... she also meets her "friends" ... a really strange order in the cemetery starts off good. Then comes apart. The story is narrow and the tone of the padding to make the film 85 minutes long. The performance is terrible across the board (Cole is much worse). Some bad painting with the worst pictures I have ever seen in the bad movie. Scenes (and sound) are simply cut out without poem or reason. <br /> <br /> This is a reminder of blood and violence. There is very little and what is very fake. I did not see such fake-looking blood - ketchup looks like! Boring, pointless - the image in a characteristic forgotten drive. You can skip this.
