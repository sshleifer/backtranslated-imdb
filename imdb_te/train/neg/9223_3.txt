Another waste film was found in the fancy wrapper from the world's neoplastic capital. "CQ" is a little more than a group of folly mess, a short story, a lame, confusing mess with a toddler, and a story running around Man Davis trying to make a stupid science fiction film. I think nobody wants to spend time with anyone making this ridiculous effort in film making. (D)
