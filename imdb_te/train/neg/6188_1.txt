This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I saw. It is unclear whether the screenwriter's author BrontÃ« has ever read the book. George C. Scott is funnier and foolish as Rochester - just plain old acting is not angry. Suzanne York has seen the 1970s hairdresser I have ever seen in the Victorian film. The characters do not speak to each other, and therefore the great sensation in the book is the foundation for their deep intellectual and respectful love. <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version. It's very true to the book, it's like the novel you have to read aloud. Dalton Rochester is amazing. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
