I can not believe Guillermo del Toro's likes and Kim Bassinger got inserted this piece of rubbish! The script is less likely to be written and directed to be very weak (by the same person) it is difficult to identify the higher-dimensional characters in a single image. These dialogues laughs from some fools who enter the theater. Setup It's tricky, inviting you to believe that you're going to see a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns into a very stupid persecution picture. Bisinger's character was too dumb, she really stopped to tears to God "Where are you!" She can follow her after people, and then take a leak !!!! And then she clearly got into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs all the place and the killers never keep track of her loose, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really surprises me, the best work in Hollywood is the fact that they will spend millions of people they produce.
