And when I see Sarah Silverman, I will get the same results. I love quirky, nonsense humor. But this woman B-O-R-I-N-G is so intimidating, annoying, and enjoying. She also does not have anything totally ridiculous. She's trying to deliver her lines because she's not fun deadpan is just dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> Geez, my child (aged 19) saw her promos in Comedy Central and said she was a "mute chick". I thought it was good. She's really convinced that she would "watch my show or kill my dog". I know she's a comedian. She only comes across a chefed case. I always wanted to see my dog ​​around.
