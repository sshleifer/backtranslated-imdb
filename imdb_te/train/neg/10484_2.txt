Being an Elvis fan, I could not understand how to do this project. The very worst Elvis is all-time cinematic, totally unfunny, crazy and plenty of mistakes about Kings. Come to the grave of Elvis in a public park? Should you mention suspicious minds in 1958? ... These are just two examples. In the cast, some try to do their best, Mike Star Fanny (specifically a hyphen), Tom Hanks Kamio is a surprise but young Elvis character. Overall this film is not fun and a minute of more boring minute. If you want to see the ultra cheap, mad, but absolutely funny little picture of Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
