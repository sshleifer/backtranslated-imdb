Wow. I can say now. Who is writing this stuff? Who produces this stuff? What does the self-respecting actor do to 'take action' in these matters? Oh god! I do not know how I did it through this movie, but I have coffee coffee for 8 days, I think the key element to wake me on that day. Good God! <br /> This is one of the most drawn and imaginative pieces of the movies I have ever seen ... and for the record, I have not planned to make it 'witness' again. The movie when I bought the DVD (Mistake # 1). I mean ... I hi! Julia Styles. She loved me. She looks good. I'll see it as soon as I get home (Mistake # 2). I tried to watch without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of garbage came to an end, really I did. But I did not succeed. This is one of the worst things I've seen. I mean ... will he return to real life with what he has imagined? Ten years ago when it was used as father in 'parent' it was very painful. 'Jokes' - and believe me, I'll take a long way to call them - stupid, characters are soft and forgetting, the story is entirely imaginable ... altogether it's made for the movie history records! When I learned that I never heard of this film, something was wrong. This was a direct DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who thinks about this, I have a suggestion. No! For the love of God ... no! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get it off ... no one, and I want my opinion to buy from me! And I'm talking about second hand and thrift stores that I can buy your hands and stick in the store window. It will tell you how CRAP is.
