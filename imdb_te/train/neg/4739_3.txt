Asumi's fate as a murderer, I had the day to witness as a last resort to the end of my role, and to endeavor to get me deep into the compassionate world in the first saga. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I talk about Death or Love I will compose, because I'm crying about the huge feelings of flying Dogars House and after watching Aiyyam, when he complains about the credibility of Uto Yo that filters the bloody murderer <br /> I have already begun to congratulate the previous shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The purpose of each murderer is slow and unpleasant, and many important things have been removed from the overall experience. In Assume 1, we see that the murderers use different stealth strategies (and their top priority) and logic to speed up the simplest tasks in their secret ways and to avoid rapid abilities. But too much to hold against this film because many of the story revolves around this time and many obstacles are planted in the way of Asumi from exhibiting nothing signs of her control and carving any signs of carriage. By the way, he broke into the movie with a stupid and furious play and was primarily playing Go's little noisy version, minus cool weapon and insurance concept. <br /> <br /> This is the act of disguising myself in the title towards the death of the final theme. In the first half of the film we look very pretty at the earliest and elegant looks and glittering weapons. No one is surprised that the picture gets less when they meet their end one way or another but each one of them starts to die very fast and very easily. In Azumy 1, young murderers have largely supported the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfactory struggles, and the final showdown between Azumi and Bizamoor is at least climaxed and better compared to Azumi 2. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to make a discovery due to the compression of each encounter. Samurai images were unable to withstand their traditional and realistic wars with their quick and realistic wars, but the characters in the Azumi films were very predictable and straightforwardly unfair, the rules were broken and the action was more prosperous. <br /> <br /> Azumi's romantic side is to fill the time between the action scenes and unfortunately in the end it provides no benefit or much more solution. <br /> <br /> An open mind for a wide variety of movies and animation, I am not lying and I admit to my neutral and unimpressiveness towards the first Azazi film, but I step right up and look after the Azmi 2, the original as a flawless masterpiece Made. Azmi 2: Azmi 2: Death or Love With its invisible richest budget, it is a dare to die trying, with a failed capacity to add or extend the unexpected killer uneven voyage.
