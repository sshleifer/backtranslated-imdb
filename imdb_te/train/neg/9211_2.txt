The film reminds me of the anti-drug films of the 50s and 60s, as they are made by people who have never experienced social evil. Tom Hanks and his friends are "playing the role", but there are no dice, there are a lot of candles, and then you are slipping into a bad montage that shows the horns falling on the crowd. Very funny but misleading. I was told how many poor children have destroyed their D & D stuff, and their intuition is to use the road to destruction. As a film, it is mainly after a special school, bad acting (although Hanks has demonstrated his talent) and relationship talks, and no one has any happiness. These films have a psychological perspective in adolescence that leads to older people, which is very intense and clear, and you need to do everything and make everything. Despite my vote 2, watching its unique style, scary movies, I personally looked very fun.
