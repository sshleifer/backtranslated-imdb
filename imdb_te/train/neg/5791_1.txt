Honestly, as a Native Film Professor, I can honestly say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'll get the root canal instead of re-viewing this image. The traditional coyote stories and generalized use of poor camera work, the use of unruly attempts was only worse by Gilbert's unreliable stroke-line and bad script. The writer and director demonstrated the worst episodes of a colonial policy to portray local people and communities. If this person is Native, they go home, apple and they apologize to each other for their inner racism and the humorous sense of humor they have developed. If this person is non-independently, they need to seriously review their white right and they question themselves if they are unexpected, random racism, or intentionally intelligent. My only hope is that local actors have a good time in this film and at least for their efforts. If you want to see good local images, check: Clouds in Christmas, drive me outside, Beauty River, Pove Wave Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
