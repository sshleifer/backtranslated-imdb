In an interview, David Duchovny said he can not see even the first hour of this film - and you have to be. In the scene where he was asked by a home owner, he was committed if he was murdered - change his name and he just lifted his presentation on the episode of the X-Files. He is in the autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt deals with exaggeration.
