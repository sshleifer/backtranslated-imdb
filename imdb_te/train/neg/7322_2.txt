I give credit because of credit, and Linda Fiorentino gives me a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who can do whatever she wants. Her brush, sassy, ​​hard-edge and very sexy; <br /> <br /> The film is better than the meaning. This sluggish suspense film is a turbulent mess, a thief thriller simultaneously, a murder thriller, credibility and betrayal, and an inconsistent romantic thriller tale. <br /> <br /> For instance, who is the idea of ​​acting as the leading figure of C. Thomas Howell? He is not ugly, but the strict cookie goddess of Fiorentino appears to be crying out loudly with a kindergarten teacher. Howell does not have power or screen presence to act in the role of the official. <br /> <br /> The script of this movie is very bad. Fiorentino's character Euree does not have any tension with phone calls, there is no mystery about her guilt in the murders of the film, and there is no redemption that Howell can lose its restrictions without the liberation of Fiorentino. <br /> Watch out for an interesting but poorly-finished comos by Adam Ant and Isaac Hayes and really good sex between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first inspiration is to scare this forgiving piece and go to another rent.
