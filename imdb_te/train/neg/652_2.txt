I think an overrated PG-13 is the worst! At least Brittany Snow's performance is good and some good like IDRIS ELBA, but some youngsters in the promotion that lead to friends do not have that confidence. The killer was very thin and very stupid. Deaths are stupid, boring and totally emissical. The image is very boring and very overrated. It's not curiosity at all, I almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a horrible movie IMO. The ending is so stupid and the climax is very quick and boring. This movie is very slow. Perhaps the only good thing about this worst fest is that I probably think she gave her a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but it's a completely horrific film and a terrible remake that Brittany is bathing. Well my opinion. I gave a 2/10.
