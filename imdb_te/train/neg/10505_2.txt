You liked "Blair with" you'll like this one. It has the same lousy camera work and soundtrack, and it has the same existence of plot and curiosity moments. <br /> If it's also Romero's "dead dawn" or not Tom Saavin is Tarantino and Rodriguez's "From Dusk Til Dawn" for you for a treat. <br /> He is a very good actor. This film is definitely the most secular film I've seen in a long time, and I've seen quite a few movies - bad ones as well. I'm very entertaining in some of the horror movies, but I can tell you that it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave this film 2 instead of 1 is the hot action with naked chicks and all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... no, I'm funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> If it's sexy girls with teeth on the cover, stay away!
