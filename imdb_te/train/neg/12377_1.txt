Anyone younger than 10 years does not mean that they are stupid. If your child likes this movie you'd better test him / her. I am constantly surprised by how many people are becoming bad. This "movie" is a show for digital tantric and athing illus. The writing is awful. I can not remember when I hear such a bad conversation. The songs were damaged. The acting was sub-par, but later the actors did not give too much. Who has decided to appoint Joey Faton? He can not hurt, and he is so sinful. <br /> It is different from that. The writers are coming out of their way to do as much as possible. In recent years movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, great children's films to tell about the past two of Willy Wonka and The Mats are full of bad, smart and intellectual. But the slow downfall in the United States is the slow-tracking trash, such as slow-tracking (yes, that's right), recently Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and Red Riding Hood.
