The simple general mystery plot with a dead philosopher is actually a head-painting story (a giant star in the gigantic role giant Rogers) about a group of characters residents in a small cast in the civilized house. These letters are completely stupid and have a clear meaning. The cheapest part of the action, Rogers and her leader (some man, I reason that he really sucks) is talking about their different possibilities in solving the crimes, cut off his head an absurd detective in his butt. Honestly, I did not see this kind of old B-Rated movie worse, and I saw some real headphones. <br /> Oh, and Butler did not do it, because there was no butler. But pay attention to the person close to Butler. <br /> <br /> <br />
