This is the first film of the horror fest I have seen and I do not have to look at any of the others after I think almost. I was told it was a "horror movie of ideas" and I thought it would be like the publishing / gore films in this collection. <br /> <br /> The story does not hit a lot of gore. <br /> <br /> The storyline is a lot of art for arts. Camera effects and music do not exist all the time and the characters are simple to say the least. Many characters and scenes appear ultimately worthless when they start to reveal some hooks of "The Hamilton". I found Lenny about half an hour when I found this movie. When I look at it and I'm confused by Lenny, I know it's totally emerged. I think what I've done but they are gone, actually all the gore is flat completely. With movies such as "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to come out a bit better for a film that "thinks some graphic or very unpleasant for some good audiences".
