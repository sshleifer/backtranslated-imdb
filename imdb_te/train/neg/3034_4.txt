The film is slaughtered by great adult actors but fails to get you interested in an adult movie. Your scenes from all the stars can not get your scenes. The film is depicted in a dream like set middle age, which is awkward cheesy. This act is worse than the reverse of the revise, it's exciting to hear sex scenes from your neighborhoods in college, and in the dialogue I movie. This is ten times ten times more. I'm committed to an amateur path. It's not an audio commentary from a skin image, but it's also bad. Here is less than your Jenna Jameson fan. 4/10
