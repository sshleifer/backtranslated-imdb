Wow ... what can I say? First IDDB says this in the late 60s ... Carlito is very close to jail, he fell to 75 and said he was in 5 years. None of them used a group of actors, and a story did not even make sense. They bring back only one actor Gujman and he plays a completely different person. Why is this with him and this Puerto Rico chic? Wearing Gayle? He said he was in love with him. Wein Kleinfeld? He says he knows him forever ... you think he's in this case. And if this is the concept, where is the first one where the Rocco and the Black Dude? It's just stupid ... it's insane to the Pacino and the first movie.
