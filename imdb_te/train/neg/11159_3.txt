I saw this movie in 'Sneak preview' and honestly confess that I do not like the pictures with Merle Streep. This movie is even worse. Half theater break did not return the film after half. If this is not a true story, I can not convince them that the film does not need the second half. I expect the credits to appear before the movie goes on about ten years ago.
