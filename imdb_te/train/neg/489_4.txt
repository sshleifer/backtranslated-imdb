Acting is good, women are beautiful, and men are beautiful, if you're looking for a soft romance that you have played well, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you're wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the titled leadership, is often a mystery. She may have just said the truth - the truth presented in the film, the historical truth is not required - and her lover was spending time in jail for a rape that he did not do. When she walks out of half-confidence, protecting her father, when he promotes a malicious suit? When she suddenly wondered about her art, she could only protect her if she could only care for her art. During the trial, this strong self-believer woman turns to the cush before our eyes. In contrast, her boyfriend begins as a narcissistic jerk, an unselfish leader during the trial. At least his inspiration is clear: he sacrifices himself for love. Naturally, it is said that she has never seen any good deed but it is not damaged.
