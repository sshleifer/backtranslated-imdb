Camera work - Why does the camera work in this movie? It's annoying and disorganized. Editing - The images of the images are still very small. Other scenes are too small. Just flash. Sound - The background music is way too loud and the voices cover. Do not rewind to catch what you say. No one has to check these things and make them do it again. Reduce the size of the background music in the future. Relief sound levels editor, Julia Wong adjusted the job? The plot is way too many loose ends. The probability of the basic story line is the probability. I think the film needs more work. Was it moved? Perhaps they lost money. Like most of the movies, it started great but just petered towards the end. I can not understand this, you know that you have a story board before you go into the product board, so all loose ends will not be taken care of on the storyboard. <br /> <br /> Sorry,
