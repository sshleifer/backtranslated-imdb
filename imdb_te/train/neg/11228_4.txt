The main flaw with the image is its enthusiastic script. It goes backwards between the stories of Batemi's story and the remakes of the Claw Small films. Klaw reconstructions are well done and unnecessary to rebuild them in their amounts. Page Richards, though not a brilliant actress, makes a good job altogether. And, sometimes, she has a very unusual comparison with her. Even some of the noticeable details are attentive to the faithful. Costumes and costumes are well done, some set direction. The sets are generally small and feel stage-ya, but they have a sense of time. It is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette is apparently the whole look to give a powerful, retro feel.
