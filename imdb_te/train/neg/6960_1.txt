Blanche first saw 20mn (sorry I did not do it), I have now confirmed she does not. <br /> In general, this "film" junk is an insult to true French actors who participate in this vulgar piece. An historic tone with anachronic tone / dialogues: It starts from the concept of French comedy successfully used ("Dukes hours moins lay the Avant Jesus Christ", "La Foley des Grandeurs", ...). Brilliant actors and terrible "heavy comedy" stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the donkey faces Lou Doillon everything and Blanche, instead of a ruins comedy, just turns into a horror movie. cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching Decaune, English or Rochefort frightened in the middle of the flamboyant ridiculous kitchy-prissy farce of fine actors.
