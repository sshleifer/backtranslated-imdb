The second image on the box set. First Bloodsuckers, the film is pretty average. It's very boring in some episodes but has some good gore effects, but they are not great. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. Vampires are pretty much taken around the world. V-SAN (Vampire sanitation) Squad has their own space ship and headed by Churchill who acquires vampires, receives a message from the Earth and the team, Quintana (very hot Natsacea malkhey), rookie officer Damian and rebels Rosa and Romans (Aaron rarely attributed to Aaron Perl from) The vampire who played Michael Ayrshire from the tale recall meets with the protagonist of Mucco. As he bent on world domination, he has no plans to live peacefully with humans. <br /> <br /> While this film does not waste time, I'm going to be back at the DVD player anytime soon.
