So, Steve Irwin. You have to worship a man who does not want to throw himself in a river, but not everyday, filled with the reptiles and muds from the soil, the snakes, lizards and tons filled with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The movie does not come into my parallel universe - the films of earlier people do not have their teeth drilling, migraine, or movie sensation, and therefore silent mediocrity (now in well-Disney movies). It's very noisy. Well, Steve is very noisy. He is very happy all the time, and blas√© 'will be right cut by the teenager (I can hear now: "That movie is so stupid") or tailanol with codeine. I tell him to get my enthusiasm, but if it is, I have a full room of snakes and this has not happened yet. <br /> The plot is indeed predictable. The bad guys are very bad, and for a minute I thought I would shop at a consumer electronic superstar. But the movie is filled with animals, and Steve and Terry, I see why. The plot (if you could call it) could be a reason for throwing another croc in a truck. <br /> <br /> Steve and Terry have worked on a sequel with a sequel (who worked on their acting skills), a real plot and more animals with fur. I can not believe we can not see Steve anymore. I hope Terry and the kids are at the Australian Zoo and at least in the Discovery Channels. It's hard for me to see crocodile without some member of Irwin's family. Crikey!
