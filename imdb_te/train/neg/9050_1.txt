I saw the film in full in the 1960s and 70s, it's fierce, and the progress of the famous "Death Faces of the Series" in the 80s and 90s. If you look at the condition called "Driver Education" today, it should be seen by everyone who learns to drive everyone. When you see a violent death in all the Gore & Horror, you will definitely get a perfect perspective on the responsibilities that you need to safely run (if you have any sensibility), without thinking at the wheel or instantaneously. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s & 80s and was appointed to maintain a security class at one time. I found this picture in the company library, showing it in the session, and many people were physically ill and left the room! Surprisingly, most of them later said, "I never said a car accident is so terrible!" This film and another "RED ASPHALT" is certainly true in its most graphic form. I never forget, I found a copy when my children attended "Drivers Ed" High School!
