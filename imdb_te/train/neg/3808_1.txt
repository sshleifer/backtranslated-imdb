Warning! The end of this review image is "scoop." <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think the "Annie Hall" is foul. <br /> You get a star because you see Hugh Jackman's naked chest. <br /> <br /> The stupidity of Woody Allen, and his stabilization against the youth, ridiculed his ability to make films in order to be his granddaughter at this time. <br /> <br /> The plot promises: A prostitute card killer that directs Scarlett Johansson, a soft-headed student to examine whether a ghost, Ian McShann, English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is a sensational tarot. The magician Woody Allen helps the girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It's also wonderfully made for anyone who made a previous film, dozens of innocent people do not mind. <br /> <br /> If Woody Allen is now a septuagenarian in his earlier films, the actual young man does not. <br /> <br /> Johansson did not have any grounds for the film, but allowed him to be drunk, and attracted by a powerful, old director. What is happening is "eccentude" is a euphemism. It's a "slam, bam, I've gone" moment. This does not have any relationship with the plot, and it makes the eye of Johannson in the eye of the viewer. Why did Alan add that unnecessary scene to the film? It's a powerful director - as is the same - has sex with a female lead. <br /> <br /> Allen has his cake and eats. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not an actress yet. She does not know how to command the screen rather than by tying a tight, low cut. <br /> <br /> It does not help that her character is scripted as a devil without a ghost or an elderly. <br /> <br /> She is about half the age of Jackman, and in their scenes she has a very outdoor screen presence. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Hugh Jackman has been cheated by the script as well. Allen can not see clearly, Jackman is very pretty and young, so Jackman does or does not. Like Johansson, he is just used for his good form. <br /> <br /> Here's where Jackman, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", shows what kind of productions he has shown. <br /> <br /> Here's the big story twist - Jackman, the beautiful English Lord, is really a killer. So, if the film says about allowing someone else to be more than Alan, no one can get that girl. Jackman, the man she loves, the one who killed a prostitute. Nice, Woody. <br /> <br /> Final note: At my screening, a single audiences can at any time laugh at any time did. Never a bad sign when promoted as a comedy.
