Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a dusty piece from the troma. This building is a short, vulgar and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls at the weekend. Professor's nasty assistant girls use a brain implant with a hideous plan and she transfers her victims and their dates into zombies. "The Nightmare Weekend" is a completely braindead piece of garbage that has nudity and some cheesy gore, not to mention a ridiculous musical score. The horror and script are completely incomplete.Why is such a bad crop widely distributed? It's like plague 1.
