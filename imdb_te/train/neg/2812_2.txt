I recently saw this film at a Film Festival. It's just a big disappointment and a romance of a former alcoholic man who came out of a middle aged woman who works in an employment office (INM). The story is very simple and I have found the story of clues, taking the 'social' background of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The main actor has done a good job, he certainly looks like a alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not a believer as a working class lady, she looks and acts as a 'high-standing woman'. Ana means Benan plays its role. However she is doing all of the films. The film's total mice-n-scene is very poor. Photography is okay, not all of the distant aspect of the proportions. Conversations are full of script and dull times too. Comic conditions are distinct from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not all funny and are not properly resolved. In my opinion this movie is not worth watching. You'll enjoy a little bit only if you really like Pareira's previous pictures. I walked out of the theater because I thought my time would be wasted. The filmmaker is through the door. I wonder when a director sees a person coming out of one of his paintings, a person who has been specially prepared for everyone.
