This anime series starts great: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully executed and executed. Danging a proverb carat before the director, not everyone immediately explained the viewer's eye to see each successful episode. But imagine the disappointment of finding that the psycho-fiction thriller / giant robot adventure is only a psychedelic and semi-religious teaching exploitation. You say, "Well, you're fine." After negative slogans and letters' embattled with negative emotions, then for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie that is fun to watch, forget it. Both the original, and the alternate conclusions were very disappointing to me. Everything, and this movie is very preachy.
