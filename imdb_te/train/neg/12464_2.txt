The film, with a thriller, features five sub-plots simultaneously developed for the climax, but ended with more. <br /> <br /> This writing is uncommon, the pace is slow and confusing and the characters are boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon damaged it and others seemed to read their lines from a telepromptor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is that it's carefully designed and politically correct and does not say anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries offer more enthusiasm. See only if nothing else.
