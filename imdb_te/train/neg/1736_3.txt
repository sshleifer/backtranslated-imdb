I started by telling Betty Grebble that she really used it from the "Den Argentine Way" but when she came to the end of this disaster, she also had a "round" and apparently the whole film was embarrassing. Douglas Fairbanks is expensive with JNr (very upset), the story is bad, the colors are good, and the picture is too long. Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner have old standbys, stimulated interest and have not succeeded. Music score is painful, and I have to say that a tune is unforgivable ... Because I'm a fan of Miss Garrell, I have never seen this!
