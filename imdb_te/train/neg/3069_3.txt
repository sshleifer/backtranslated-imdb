Yuck! And again I said ... no! The original version of the film is already well directed by a man who has already been dead and driven by a purgatory. The original film has a lot to say and did not go out of its way to say. <br /> <br /> This version has acquired me producer rights and lost her displeasure. A group of people has deliberately changed to fit the nineties and the changed species and transgender to be just beautiful. In the final act of defiance, the film is not related to suicide. This is about a man trying to go to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> The film is angry with me and there is no reason for me.
