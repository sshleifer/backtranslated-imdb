<br /> <br /> When I was a part of Clean DOLAN, Clean, Sheaven (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely fantastic, completely understandable and flat. After the scene Sean is randomly thrown in mixed, without much thought to the story or role. <br /> <br /> Claire is a prostitute or trying to escape? It's hard to say. If she wants to avoid that life, why does she choose a trick at the airport? Why does she not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we see her hair in a real color? Why do Claire accept some Johns and not others? <br /> All seem to have improved. (Although I can not understand this) and the filmmakers put the camera on it. <br /> <br /> After watching the screening, Karinan defended the mystical choices by denying the cinematic criticism of the film politically. It is learned that the rhetoric is similar. <br /> <br /> I am portrayed as a film producer and Shave will go to such a lazy and tired savior in this film. The old "political" clich√© trend.
