The horror horror sequel to "Howling". It chose Karen White's funeral (who was killed at the end of her first film). Stephan Crossco (Christopher Lee's sad) arrives and Karen's brother Ben (Reeb Brown) reveals that Karen is a wolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Cybely Dawning) head Wolf. Ben and Caren (Allie McEnroe)'s co-worker were with him. <br /> <br /> This single sinks a horrific script, bad direction, useless album and horror acting by Brown and McEnroe. The effects of wolves are mostly dark - for good reason! They are awful when you see them. Supar also has special effects - although I'm like a cartoon lightning from the fingers of dawning. There is also a werewolf orgy that takes his top off at least eight times in particular during stupid and dancing end credits! <br /> There are some good things - I have found in the Transylvania amusing village - it seems to have come from the Universal Horror movie since 1930! There are interesting camera tricks among transitional scenes; Brown and McEnroe have a good body, Lee and Dancing are good in this matter - but can not save it. Really - why do they do it? Where are they hard for money ??? This is one of IMDb's lowest rated films. You must say something alone. Danan was scared when she saw the movie - I understand why Miss a must.
