I'm honest - I rented this movie from Kyle Chandler's huge fan (most importantly from the Early Edition). Since he is usually a good person, I wanted him to see him in a different role (curiosity). The plot also impressed me; Evidence against someone in "family" is that they must kill a person (or Tony Greco-a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) a man before a witness's life-or rather death-liable. There are no movies as I suspect. It is ill, I hate the ending (if you see it, you will know why), and there are many unnecessary parts. Generally- it's dirty, and has little sense. Yes, it's a mob picture, and yes guns go boom. But there is more than one image. The film has had no time to go into detail - deal with it and understand it. Acting was really made - James Balloons was the most entertaining "The Rose". Sheryl Lee seemed as incredible as she could get. She surprised me. And Kyle Chandler was equally new to "family" as anxious. Only the actors do justice to the actors.
