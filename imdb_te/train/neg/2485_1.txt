The film, like Bulletproof, has only one use: it's bad bad. We've seen pictures that are often described as "pretty awful" or "not so good", but you'll come across a movie like this and all the other images are not "good" but are soft as bulletproof. The birthday gift from those who have less than two seconds is' a DVD bargain bin in our local superstore to give me a fee (ie giving me a gift). This may be a suspiciously detected but not: It is rare, very bad writing, very poorly directed, I was very surprised, not everyone was arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it is awful. I have been very suspicious from about 30 seconds, but sometimes - bad movies are very bad, they are enjoyable. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped watching 45 minutes later, and tomorrow I'll throw in bin.
