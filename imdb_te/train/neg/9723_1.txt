Jeux d'enfants or how the film was mistakenly translated into English Love me if you have a movie made by the Dar studio people and stupid people. I do not know how I can imagine a look from a movie with a similar story: the two stupid innocent children are "coolers" for each one (of course very idiotic). I will say some things are exaggerated but that's what the whole picture is. <br /> If they are older ... and they realize that the unfair Veerados couple continue their crazy pursuits, thinking that they are great people. <br /> Hollywood, but not France? It is more dangerous to see the film in the country that Amelie created a few years ago, which, btw, tries to look like a movie but is far from far away. <br /> <br /> Avoid the Avoid. Avoid.
