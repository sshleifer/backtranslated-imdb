Terrible, terrible TV show! Why did the Comedy Central decide to repeat the old episodes of this program? It really sucks! After the first two I was talking about the seasons. The first two seasons were Golden, and I was talking about those seasons specifically, the show earned eight out of ten stars. The comedians are no good after the first two seasons since the original cast. They are, and awful. Humor is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The original cast was filled with artists such as Artie Lounge, Phil Lamar, and Mary Scarr (or whatever name she is), with whom they have made good deals after leaving MAD TV. This program is much more valuable than your channel surfing than another charity show than Saturday Night Live. Go out on Saturday night and enjoy it, leave MAD TV and die, it is worth it.
