This is a terrible disappointment. The most violent adaptation of my favorite novels. The conversation is terrible. I can not understand any sense of the words expressed by the letters. The lines were distributed very quickly and exposed from the place. They are only referenced by idols. George C. The chemistry between Scott and Susanna Yarks does not exist and an American Rochester was astonished. He tried to make the British voice at least. I'm George C. Scott liked, but it just did not work. I felt like looking at the highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main parts of the story are randomly coincided with the flow of the story. The scene and music are all very good, but I feel no love and love that I want to stay between Jane and Rochester and the film leaves me completely unmoved. <br /> If you want to see a better version of Jane Eyre I see the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Gela Clark or the 1997 version of Ciaraan Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now both of these are excellent adaptations.
