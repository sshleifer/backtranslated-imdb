And in the fun-to-looking way. It's just bad. People are surprised to have posted positive things about it here. The story sucks, bad acting, it's not scary, special effects are not exclusive - oh no! Blackballs do not come out of it! A GI - the mirror has become water! Hair, clothes and makeup are not accurate in the 50s scenes, and he is a middle-aged man with a reduction hair to support a high-school version. This will be followed after the nightmare on Elm Street Stuff. I am happy to sit with a cheesy horror movie to see anyone, but there are good cheats to choose from.
