Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this really takes the cake. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I have ever seen in the past decade. Not exaggerated. <br /> <br /> With the full experience of the US Army in Afghanistan, I have done almost impossible to see these ridiculous images, which brought back memories - from a long distance - but there is no attempt to "reliability" in the movie. Not so fast as small pieces. This appears to have been written by an eight-year-old child who received all feelings (and behavior of soldiers) directly from comic books. <br /> <br /> The film is in Honduras, which must have a clue, but it also describes the worst product values ​​of this cliché-ridden garbage piece. <br /> I'm endless technical errors, but actually takes forever. The name of the character is the name of the character, such as the original Column Pulse, which did not appear or worn from WWII, and is named "ColCollins" (the character "Colonel Collins"), which is actually a revolving, mirror-image of the "N" Russian alphabet (not the US alphabet) Just goes and goes. <br /> <br /> Uniform, material, plot, behavior of the characters, especially each scene, are ridiculous bugs, bugs and thoroughly clever cliche. <br /> <br /> Or letters are at least a bit loyal or believable. It's all laughably childish. This is clearly a film intended for appeal to early adolescents, and I suspect the film is totally inaccurate. <br /> <br /> In short, this film does not have fully orthodoxy features at all. Total waste of time. I'm reading that hard about reading this trash. It really is not really worth a moment of your time worth.
