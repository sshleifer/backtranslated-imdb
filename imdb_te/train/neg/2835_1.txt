<br /> <br /> I have worked for a sea park in "Florida Keys". One day, the "Ghosts Can not Do It" was trained in the "Fish House" prepared for food for the "Dolphins". A scenery there - Dolphin-proposed propositions were asked to bow (or bow dolphin), "eggs". <br /> <br /> "We do not close any part of this film at our facility, even though our dolphins -" The Big Blue! "<br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn should be very close to the end of life, and I hope he's funny in this movie because it's not exactly his legacy.
