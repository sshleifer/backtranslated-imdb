Denario is a master ... one of my favorites. And I'm not good sports movies [baseball, but hey, its sports movies, right? I had hoped for a lot of this film. It seems to start well: DeNiro I guess, Snipes {who I really do not like} spoiled star is very good. Barkin's character, me, okay. She is a good actress but does not appear in this role. For me, they always seemed to rush screens, and it drags a bit in places. It seems to me uneven! If the cast and plot are taken into consideration, it may be very good. I rate it '4', I'm generous ~ I'm stuck with the numbers!
