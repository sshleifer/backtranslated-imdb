I do not know what the other person is thinking. The fact that this film is made independently is less terrible. You may as well be a believer in the movie ... most of the film is foolish. I feel ashamed by the first 40 minutes. And there is little feat alone. Performance is not terrible, but the plot is not close to development. There are countless holes in the story, and you can not even call a story anytime. I never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but it is the first review I wrote here, and it's only an hour and a half to save your audience. Last time I could not finish watching the movie. This will really take a cake.
