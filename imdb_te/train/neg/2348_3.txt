Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think she is the first acting character, this slow-moving feminist soap shows her real-life rebellious nature in the opera. <br /> <br /> She must have loved this script for her since she was a very strong woman in real life. Wonder Wing critic Roger Ebert did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Unlike reviewers here, Judd is happy to praise himself from these film makers.
