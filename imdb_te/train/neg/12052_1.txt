What happens if you hold him in a rat race for a free man and give him just enough money to look hard? There is no answer to the homeless. They are not mortgages, rental payments or idiot officers. Homeless individuals do not have to worry about IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. However, rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly give them enough money to have them enter the rat race, buy gas for transport, pay their car insurance, and worry about working for someone else. They get the chance to be a "productive citizen". The film is exploited as a movie. This is a way for the rich and the middle class to tell us what happens when we try to help the poor. <br /> <br /> "What happens when you remove a rich man?" Why not?
