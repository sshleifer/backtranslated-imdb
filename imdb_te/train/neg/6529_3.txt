This film is funny and painful at the same time. "CinemaMak" almost gave me a restraint. Despite what they mean, "Cinemagic" is not some new technique. They were used because they were "developed" as a result of the accident, and they disguised the fact that its "demons" were so stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not think Sid is "Pink" the author of this film. <br /> <br /> It is good to laugh this movie. It's fun; At least I can say about it. Highlight the bat / rat / spider.
