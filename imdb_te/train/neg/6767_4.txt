I once sat through this movie, but I suspect I can do it for the second time. Lindsay Lohan is mainly entertaining to be physically fit. Matt Dillon's fun (about Something about Mary), and the more radical acting is the emergence of Michael Keaton. This love bug is not a fun move, but it is worth watching. One of my main trends from this film is the Herbie much like the R2D2 antics. The 30 or more times I used were bored with the headlights of the second time, and the Bend Front Fender caused the same reaction from me. Watch it with your little kids, which means "single Digest Bracket" kids and most people do not expect from this movie. <br />
