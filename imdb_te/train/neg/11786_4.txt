This program has great episodes, not one of them. <br /> It's not a terrible piece, "man called death", "by all the house", and "eaten the cat, he's gone real." <br /> <br /> About the couple who married this episode Peggy (Amanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Schellen). In the first five minutes you realize that Charles has married Peggy for his money. Both go in their honeymoon and break their car into a dirt road and they will seek refuge in the old exhaust building. <br /> In my opinion you should see this episode, but you can not imagine the feeling of the rest of the first season episodes.
