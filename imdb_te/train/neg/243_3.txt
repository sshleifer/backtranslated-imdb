William Russ is the main character produced for the TV movie. He again turned his family back and began to pay his debts. But he tries to keep him away from his family. Peter Faulk (Colombo) plays different roles and persuades him to come home. <br /> <br /> These stories are average and they are actually a very good degree for the former star (Peter Faulk). But William Russ is not really a star. However, his performance is still okay. <br /> <br /> I have found that the delivery and story are all too cheesy to imagine. In fact, the term for the term may be nearly dated 20 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system, it receives "D".
