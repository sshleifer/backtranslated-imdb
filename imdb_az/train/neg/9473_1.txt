As a great veteran, I was thinking of very ambitious French films that I was offering you the worst and managed to stomach something. But that's not it. Inefficient, relentless, severe, unpleasant, meaningless ... There is nothing presented by the film and it's an act of aggression, such as casual hatred and ambitious art. Avoid all costs.
