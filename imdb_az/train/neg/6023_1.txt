This reminds me that when I am a believer who is able to become a minister. Indeed, I did not think that I would be a minister, even graduated from school because I almost had the pleasure of salvation, at least before that. Before that, I saw that a lot of Christianity was garbage. Now I became an atheist and only Christians told us that "once saved our salvation" proved to be more real than a elf. If so, why did I become a religious believer many years later? Yes, it really was saved. <br /> <br /> If Christians read the Bible, they think of their God as aggression, genocide, abortion, and many other things. They may be surprised to learn that the word "drag" is nowhere to be found.
