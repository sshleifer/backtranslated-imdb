Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedy of all time, so it was interesting to see what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, this is unwatchable, because the jokes are not funny - some (I will not say most), and Mike actually made a good job, making mental unbalanced poems a visual gags. The horror is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, edit, name it) is God's fear, the film is unbearable. A number of products, such as "PKO Productions", take production credits, but they are generally not produced; Mike stole one of the SNL kit cameras and did everything in the afternoon. Mike's goal is to torture viewers, but such a thing deserves some basic standards that can actually be seen, heard and understood. Still is not the total waste of DVD DVDs: a story for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Mike's At Least Loved Bedtime Stories" from SNL. Moreover, the film's "cats" section is a beautiful scene to watch if you want to run one after another. 3/10
