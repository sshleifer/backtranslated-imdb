Today, Bea Arthur died, so I walked around the IMDb site and somehow appeared on a show called "Gloria". "The whole family" was a brilliant show for the first four or five years, and I watched every episode more than once. But I did not know it was a show called Gloria. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's not a TV watch, but a young adult life <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the franchise "The Whole of the Family" has become worse that it's <br /> <br /> <br /> I appreciated my student for two reasons - The system did not allow me to vote and did not allow me to vote. <br /> <br /> Shalom, Zwrite, Zwrite, Shawl, Zwrite, Zwrite,
