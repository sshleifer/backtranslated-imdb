Yuck! And again, I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film is a well-directed story of a person who had previously been drifted by dead and sliding. The original film had many words and it did not go wrong to say that. <br /> <br /> This version hits a producer's rights as something that he / she bought and then refused. A group of people, consciously, decided to adapt to the nineties and changed their ethnic and sexual habits to become sweet. The film is not related to a suicide attempt on suicide in the last action. <br /> <br /> About a man trying to go to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no other reason why this film did not blame me ...
