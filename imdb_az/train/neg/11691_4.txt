Stephen King's "Bachman" pen name was a way to extinguish the cunning, hero, some of what he wanted to write 'without the contamination' from his "brand name". If you look at the Bachman Books, you will find that they feel stuffy and hopeless about those who are different from the King. In the first novel, in his first novel, we talk about a man who dropped out of a dignified balloon, talking about a bloody, emotionally injured teenage girl ... but the general king has always had some elements and characters that have a bit of at least some hope and has a person's sense of achievement. Bachman's books are just plain and always bad. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If the BKM could easily have a Bachman book, the King had not been fired anymore and the "Black Half" was at least partially his "Bachman" Thiner, the latest Bachman book, This is bad with the subject of human, class war, revenge, and starvation. Thus, the film should not be surprised by the suit. <br /> <br /> What is a surprise is that the adaptation film is a talent, not something worthy of theater freedom, if it is shot in the "TV movie of the week". (These days, such a thing will go directly to a DVD or cable). A make-up job and a striking motif (starvation in abundance, a metaphor for a long time, and less feeding in the American middle class) is something that watches the arrogance. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this? My first idea is to go to the director's bad Bachman vibe, but he also has all the curiosity of the movie with some of the worst casting choices - where the actor (except for Joe Monetegna) can not just film. And then the rest of the film was heated with heat and vitality pacing and scene structure. Moreover, he did not leave the area indefinitely and the changes really did not help. Scenario and dialogue should work, but basically the film is just there. Everything is eye-catching, boring, stuffy and not funny ... except for the exception of the main character, which is exquisite, delicate and delicate. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, Thinner is the worst movie (or even worst second) ever. Thanks to the theme and careful makeup, this is a terrifying, wonderful fascination. But for the first time, viewers need to come closer to reducing these expectations.
