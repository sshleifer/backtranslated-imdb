This charming movie resembles a combination of music clips on MTV more than a real movie. You do not have a true story and as the film continues, ask yourself, 'What will it be?'; but nothing happens. Eric Cloeck, the story around the angry writer is just a good thing. Others have nothing to do with partner: why not bring them together in a movie? You can watch the worst movie with music. When you open your fist and water with Bach music, most people would like to look at it, but this is not a movie. The filmmaker must learn how to write a movie for 100 minutes or more before starting a film.
