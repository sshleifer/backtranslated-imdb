Under the influence of a woman Mabel goes insane, but I can see why she is going to my mind. If I were to live with a family I lived in, I was freaked out. Everyone in the family is a guide who has nothing to do with them. <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> < He always shouts to him when he is at home to stop living his life and to act impeccably. The rest of the time he has worked long hours in his work and does not have to support it when he supports it. There is always a person in his life who is supposed to be there, and if he does, it just feels even worse. She relies on her for supporting her and always behaves improperly and goes to her when she does nothing to support her. <br /> <br /> When he comes home from the hospital, he has to imagine how he should do it, not to comfort him, but just to him and tell him what to do. <br /> <br /> Other great people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life. Mabel basically lives on, because they are afraid of standing up and standing with him. Finally, he does not even want his father to stand up and do not understand. They do nothing to help Mabel or protect her from frustrating her because they did nothing in her time. The only person who wants to do something for her is Nick. Nickin's mother is related to Mabel's case. He does not want to agree with Nick, so the doctor is following him. Everyone seems to be against Mabel and they think they think it is a good idea because they are not dealing with them anymore. Everyone does not want to live their lives and do nothing for Mabel and already feels something wrong. Therefore, she went naked and why she should commit, her whole family was innocent.
