The first 45 minutes of the Dragon Fighter are completely acceptable and can be surprisingly watched. Symbols are convincing and interesting. The cloning lab really has a high technology. After that all will collapse. Cartoons begin to act violently, and from nowhere a new subplot from a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly the "present") is brought to the ground, only the ground-based reasoning of the dragon is required - just 't. Finish is incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> All heroes except Dean Cain are Russians. <br /> <br /> Vessela causes some strange situations and details as Dimitrov's "Bailey City" character (although once, with inaccuracies) * Due to a good start, I've rated this movie on 5, but it really was more disappointing, I just gave it 4.
