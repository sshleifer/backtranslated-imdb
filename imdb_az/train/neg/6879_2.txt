As Rosie has a superpower in today's Puerto Rican dynamics, she has wasted many television times when talking about Tainos. They were not. In fact, it was Africans and Spaniards and knew it. What he kills is that he looks at the true essence of Puerto Ricans today, as they appear on the screen and appear a little dark green chicken (with light black tasty brothers and siblings), and the Africans imagined how Spanish was affecting food and music . He is typical and I have lost a lot of respect and will not support anything else. Also, if you want to dance around Africans, darkness (ie, Lackawanna Blues) should not play more roles. <br /> <br /> You will soon find a proud black Latina in Portugal (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). ...Thank you very much. When we say "darkness", of course, it has nothing to do with "you," so there is no love for it. However, because you are in the United States and enjoy the Civil Rights Movement, you would want them to accept any good human treatment, because there are bloods, strikes and tears coming from the "black" that do not share anything with them. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that Puerto Ricans has a terrifying picture in the media, but our brothers are not trying to disrespect our time because we know that the media is trying to protect the generalization of minorities, who love to use low points and behaviors. But, obviously, you benefit from something that is wholesome or superior ... You are not. Also, you have to believe that black culture is BET ... you are still wrong, and you do not have to strike a headline. Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. None of these brothers want to claim your "culture".
