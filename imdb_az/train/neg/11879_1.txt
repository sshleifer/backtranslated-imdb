My husband and I have rented this movie because some of them have been paralleled with "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB remained an "invitee" option even when the "Office Space" liked it. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen Office Space 15 or 20 times. I love her. Probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Show off tempting, humorous, and reminiscent of people who work for years. "Haiku Tunnel" is also similar to "Office Space" because it is a "movie". This is where the analogy ends. Perhaps we have been sitting in the first 50 minutes of HT, and we should ask for the benefit of the doubt and blessing. * He did not do it. He could not get more and stopped the ribbon. Unfortunately, God was a free lease. If I were actually paid for it, I would have p *** ed. We have to sit with it. Now that we do not see the end, it maybe miraculously comes together and returns. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe what's being produced. The film is very foolish. Already send friggin letters! The release is insignificant. Sugars are terrible. We came to the "printer does not work" field and we had to stop it. We can not get it anymore. This is a statement for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of the Bureau of Space ...... do not waste your time with this hurricane. 0/10
