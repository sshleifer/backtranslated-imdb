Priyadarsha's HERA FERI was a beautiful situational comedy, but there's really no story in the movie, but it's funny, but not logical. <br /> <br /> In fact, they are not a good story <br /> <br /> In the first half, there are two funny scenes, as Akshay and John invite Neha to dinner and where Paresh will enter. <br /> <br /> The first half is slowly digging, the second half <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> Her film is completely shadowy and everyone else. <br /> <br /> Generally, John screams and fails in comedy. Paresh Rawal Cheerful Rajpal is good at E eras and extreme too Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only visible from Neetu now) are good, but often confused Manoj Joshi is good
