The Cold War America and Aqata Kristi are faced with a major, major problem with an anti-Nazi music (!), Mixed discombobulated turkey: this deadly unfunny. Single digit S.Q. field and dialogue, the most beautiful part of "Lady ..." is a binder cast. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) tries to do all of this: she is a romantic lead (she plays with her looks and age! She and Woody Allen should open a club for unkemptly aging comedians) to be moving and funny, fast and clever and tries to sing and dance, and achieves no place! <br /> <br /> <strong> Mel Brooks breathed a good old days with her. <br /> <br /> For some time, everyone in the movie said that Cherry Jones is a pretty hot chick, Cumpsty is an amazingly beautiful stallion! The man playing Claire Bloom's secretary secret is an object of sexual desire and a passion for two leading ladies. When you see Mike Starr performing as the most advanced, best-selling police officer, he has been ranked among the 10 most hateful performances in the latest movie. The most miserable celebration is to see beautiful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa, who are totally horrific and unfounded. At least I hope that both stars have returned home with this flop (and later their agents were dismissed). <br /> <br /> When Sukowa returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had for her, she was not surprised! <br /> <br /> If you really know how bad movies really are, then film director, do not stay elsewhere! - 1/10
