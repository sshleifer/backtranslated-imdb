This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's all fair and beautiful. I do not think filmmakers are typical of Hollywood's so-called quality. It's just a strange movie about the serial killing of a toxic waste burden, and it's a reaction to it and snow as the middle of winter. He is then turned into a murdered snowman, who is enough to make himself laugh. This movie is really stupid but funny. Crimes are hilarious. I do not advise to go and get it (like I looked - the cover looked good!) But if you are going to be a nightclub and stay tuned for a night, then stay.
