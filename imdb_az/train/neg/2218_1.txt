I admit that my review could have been a brilliant horror / tension movie since 2006, about 30 years after the film's filming and during the conceptual period. <br /> <br /> Starting with Halloween in 1968, 6-year-old Michael made a brutal killing of her 18-year-old sister. <br /> <br /> Michael is committed to a mental institution and runs after 15 years and returns home to kill him. <br /> <br /> From this point it is clear that the film is predictable at a high level. <br /> <br /> The beginning of each stage can easily be predicted, because for every scene in Michael (murder), music is exactly in the same movie and warns the events that are likely to follow the audience. <br /> For fear / tension enthusiasts, despite the amount shown today and at the age, there is a serious deficiency in blood compared to modern day movies. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It's pretty cool for the horror / thriller movie and therefore there is no shock for modern day enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> The film's positive side is its shooting cameras and the frightening fear of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Michael, who gave tips on the probability of a second positive story, may have been a doctor's character. However, it is clear that star, Jamie-Lee Curtis <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to judge this movie as it is on its own, but it's really one of the other horror films. The 80s and, to a lesser degree, the 90s, can not really stand up to a great fear / tension movie. <br /> <br /> I offer to move from the 1980s and find the classic. Applause!
