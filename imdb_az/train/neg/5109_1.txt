Extreme Makeover: Home Edition shows that it's time to put ABC together for another 'fe'l-goody' and estimates called 'heart warming'. <br /> <br /> Understand the challenges facing these families. I'm sorry for that. But do not you think that there are four wide-screen plasma TVs, three flat-screen PCs, a pool pool that holds half of a garden, and expensive designer clothes for any family? Of course, these families have been in many cases. <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> This show What really makes me angry is that Ty and his crew always have a good deal about every little thing about the family or of the family. After a while, the person with a wheel chair is "very strong" or "very brave."

This comment is a guide for what you just watched.
