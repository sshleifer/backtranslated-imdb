Claire Denis's films appear to fall into one of two categories: severe and bloody, or calm and sincere. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as terribly difficult as "Everyday Difficulty" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> We now have a point to see every new movie by Chocolat Denis. And I have always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" was not an exception. Still, the film is like an individual and acted as the first. <br /> <br /> Denis is regularly getting a lot of things: in the film, only a few beautiful coats in the film, showing only the full lips, the gap between his teeth and his wide spaces, but still spectacular Béatrice Dalle in the movie; "Everyday difficulty" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin and black boy from Lithuania or Russian girls. The character of Michel Subor was quite interesting, but it stretched out to him in the length of the camera so that I would push the hair of his hair hanging on his forehead and think of somewhere in Korea that he finally cut. <br /> <br /> Certain actions, of course, were horrible crimes, the search for a boy's son - even a plot, but one review is not enough to understand it, I'm afraid of the question. For one thing, the score was shaking and obtrusive (like "Beau Travail"). For one another, the seasons have changed suddenly and made more mistakes about what has happened. Oh, there were some nice shots, and if you love Thursday, you can appreciate L'Intrus aesthetics with heavy coatings and curls on the sheets. Otherwise, turn off your calmness. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I have left something in it. However, the dialogue in Denis is rarely more than 5 pages, with double intermediate boundaries. The silence in "Chocolat" is magnificent; In L'Intrus, it's just boring.
