How important is it that Richard Attenburg will decide what to do to direct the most personal feelings on Broadway for many years? He is the Academy Award Winner. Yes, the win for Gandhi! Jeremy Irons actor-winning actor, want him to play with Roky Balboa? Has music experience. Really? "Oh, what a beautiful war" did you forget? Yes, to answer your question! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. It is not an ounce of living energy, but a serious threat to the processes. Each character dance beautifully, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film should be raised with stars, unknown, newcomers, even stars with the group's most invisible compelling unforgettable faces. Great actors who can dance beautifully. Well, there was Michael Douglas. Actually, I've completely forgotten that you're wrong and that you're absolutely right. Richard Attenborough is nothing like Michael Douglas's music.
