This film shows how John Singleton is racist. He describes the nonsense and other races that are not as bad as existing in our education system. He remembers what is happening and the same educational system that ensures his failure. Ice Cube's character is the epitome of a dark man who is responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton only touched the relationship between the white and black characters they were trying to reach. Omar Epps said, "I must be with my people," said a racist remarkable volume. And John, do not think for a minute, the picture on the Thomas Jefferson tower ladder did not draw my attention. Beautiful touch!
