"Drawing Restraint 9" is a favorite or hate; Fortunately or not, I left it empty when I was completely filled up with the "killing of whales". From aesthetic point of view, the film, especially the first half, could have been unpleasant that every action described is something related to whaling. Since then, it may have been a little fun to look at the daily work of Japanese employees, but then something that appears on the screen is propaganda and no framework is exception. I use the word "propaganda" in the film, because the film uses old-fashioned ghosts, which are not usually found in the "good" and "bad" movements. Perhaps it is only me, but I consider this kind of art to be irreverent and unbiased, even if it is a noble quest for environmental protection. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a guilty blunder, the movie outfit stretches not just for any reason. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could easily fit within 75 minutes, but it was tortured 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but it was not enough to leave any spaces for 15 minutes without warning. The film does not have any standard scenarios, and the characters are not evolutionary, but what is not a documentary, but rather a conceptual structure. It is an unusual form of the film, but the concept can be seen as art, though simple and straightforward, as it is here. OTOH I think the director should have some honesty and did not claim that he could be delivered in less than 135 minutes. <br /> And yes, the music ball is like whale voices. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
