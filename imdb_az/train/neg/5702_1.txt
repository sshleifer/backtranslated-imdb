What a disappointment! I hated mummies, but it was even worse! It was very tiring and incredible, and at some point I always found myself crying and yawning. I do not believe people really love this movie. Nicholas Cage's role is not very convincing. The whole film felt like a great tour around America's most wanted buildings. Stopping hints and joints is not very convincing. I stopped my attention around 30 minutes. It was a disappointment to be a happy night. What is dragged ... I just saw numerous movies to use from the National Treasure.
