If the IMDb rules contain 'spoiler' in your comments, it means that we have to declare it. <br /> <br /> Behold, this movie is one of the spoiler ... a clever fairy tale of something protected, a tale of a missing young man who does not know what to run. <br /> <br /> I just saw it at this tribeca film festival. this movie was not only bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The player is inactive, the heroes are clich√©s with very little depth, and Farnsworth's player was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From the divorce habits to the meaningless plot line, from the 'graphics' elements to repeated dialogue and scenarios, he had a great deal. <br /> <br /> He was looking for a strange, updated "drugstore cowboy" with the touch of "naturally-born killers", but there is no place where the heroes are past and somewhere sensitive, like shocking stairs (some of the frat-level abdomen). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If he had fallen into a base, he could be passive. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I would have gone down from 1 if it was like a zero kelvin.
