How surprised do you think the Pacific owes to the heroic sense of Black Americans automatically? regardless of ethnic background? This film will not respond to these often-thought-out questions, but it will provide a great case study. <br /> <br /> From its start, this film acts as a kind of "Old School" for the Pacific Islander New Zealand, and immediately asks what the task point is. Does it mean to protect the Pacific Ocean's rooted stereotypes of the New Zealandians? or is it going to exploit this potential market? Story is weak, jokes are joking and end is expected. This film has done nothing for New Zealand movie because it's just a special romantic comedy that lacks any dignity.
