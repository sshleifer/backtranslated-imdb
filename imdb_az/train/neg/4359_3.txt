Wow, after about 15 minutes, when Timo Roses dropped out of the Rout City drive (South Park is more than crooked smile ... Some people do not know it) I was interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the morning, I read very unpleasant things in front of the film and its appearance. <br /> <br /> Surprise: The film is not a garbage but a problem. Timo Rose, Olaf Ittenbach and others like the German Horror / Splatter Cinema. That is, "Barricades" are very strange and detailed. Gore FX is not really convincing, but OK, the player is good, but in some cases it sounds flat. <br /> So what's the problem ... movie is frightening, there's a typical German underground vibe (including the classic). bodily shots), OK FX and advanced packaging? <br /> <br /> 1. The scenario is general BS. You lost a forested story with a hillbilly / some guys fired + gal camp out and responded to a degenerated hillbilly family. Everything moves towards torture / disability scenes and looks incredibly casual and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Barricade is the first thing that does not remain half. 2. Random is also a great illustration for most camera work (I like the recurring cutter for long-term torture tweaks ... or there's no outfit and the editor works on a hardware store). It's even worse to edit ... I'm sure that it's better and better than many movies in the genre, but RANDOM. You've been taking this typical exposure effect anywhere and with no sense ... just ... everytime. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> There are many things that are recurring here as the above-mentioned effects. For example, the majority of the killings are repeatedly repressed by stabbing and shooting. His once, but here it is annoying and counterfeit, especially towards the end. Annoying also incorporates "music" constantly used without any change in the background. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> All of these are the biggest problem (and in my opinion, the majority) of the film. If you make a splatter movie with a trash, I feel quite strange to curtail the special FX and new school adjustments. Apparently, they are doing so seriously. Unfortunately, there is not much fun for the FX to spend in that content simple. And the classic gore FX is OK where scenes like gunshots in the mouth knife or the latest appearance are very silly on computer fx (and 3D splatter sucks for me in movies with budget and decent 3D craftsmen). I'm often out of serious splatter movies and the complicated "barricade" is another example, which can be time to put the grave. It has no entertainment, no character and is very difficult for its appearance. The scenario is a cheap experiment that the "wrong turn" and "TCM" will not bring anywhere. You can get it in its fullest sense ... the end is just casual as well as there and many other things ("I love you" splatter flick ...). "Barricad" is trying to combine many things and fails ... in a film (bloody, shoulder), a few widespread, boobies hooray!). But it's really hard to come on. Particularly, something may happen that may occur.
