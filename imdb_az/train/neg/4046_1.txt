What insulting the film industry in SA! I've seen better SA films. The comments on Hijack Stories are very scary, saying that he deserves one of them. Regardless of the rating of a movie .. "OH, THE FILM OF THE COUNTRY WILL COME." TO USE ANY CHANGES IN THE WORK. We have experience in producing good movies. Do not judge the film industry about how people think about Hijack Stories. We can say great stories like Favorite Country and Joke Zulu. I'll give 10 to 9 countries I love. Great directorship by Darryl, by two older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories .., I'll give 10 to 1. Only this person can be involved in the project at a high level. Without my movie, I would do the same thing.
