A friend once told me that a craft independent film fled in the cinema - during the closure of the film - the audience was very angry before they broke down the movie halls. Of course, my imagination was trying to get the content of such a piece of work. <br /> <br /> In my life Andrey Tarkovky and his dear admirer. I met many people who thought Tarkovsky's films were moving slowly and inert. The thoughts are theirs, I do not consider it inconvenient to the miraculous works of the composer, the wonderful works and the beautiful works of complex philosophical questions. When I called Alexander Sokurov's successor to Tarkovsky, I was excited to shoot his films. <br /> <br /> In these areas (Stalker), except for outdoors, this film does not have Tarkovskiy's brothers. performed. Even at the level of a complete stupidity, I do not even have the slightest meaning. Probably, "gorgeously stark" cinematography is deprived of any compositional art. There is no equilibrium, no proportion, and fewer workers in terrible snow battles. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Many non-linear fashion. But there is no story here. Tarkosky would have to enter a crowded head of Jerry, when it was time to get out of nothing and if nothing went out with anything, as if the tempo would be the only possible answer that would seem like a tempo that would seem like a timekeeper! <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not rule out that Sarkorov could be one of Tarkovski's Solaris, but based on this film, one of Tarkovsky's heirs, it would be possible to call Paris Hilton, who inherited Aristotle. C'mon guys, do not be afraid to say that. None of the great striking words would bring the corpse of this corpse to life. I do not believe that I fully understand Russian culture, and I do not have Russian values, but in Tarkovsky's case I have immediately raised a magic, a pleasure and a gift to the audience. <br /> <br /> Sokurov did not name it, and he released a live broadcast on Saturday night, and I'm pretty sure "to read" this giant anti-gigantic analysis of anyone's spectacular analysis.
