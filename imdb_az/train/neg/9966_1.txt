It is a person who denies someone's private taste, and if you want something, it is good. But this movie was terrific and there is no way around it. I do not like Ani Farranko, but a great guitarist and songwriter, I can accept it. But I do not admit that this film will not give any indisputable quality. Many people are thus able to properly describe the challenges facing high school students. Perhaps everything is far-sighted. "Naked Gun" - there is an attempt of the comedy esque, but the timing is switched off; There is a lot of space between each actor line, as they do for laughter (nothing happened). Everyone who wrote the script was on the ground. In one film, they tried to tackle many controversial issues, and almost all of them (especially the girl's empirication) are not fully developed. Not all this once did not laugh at this movie. I was very insulted by this positive and negative attempt, but I just kept my eyes on the screen.
