I'm sorry, but hoping to escape from a festive fiasco, as I have now, I'll give you a cunning line, and I will put an end to you. His father is about to die and Santa writes a letter to Santa for Christmas, while Santa is doing it. Dad is unafraid of the fact that he is a compassionate, happy, healthy and completely dead. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> Now my son is sure that everything he needs to bring his friend back to Santa! Do not defile the will of your young soul. No conviction is that she is only a movie and that her dog does not come back for Christmas. <br /> Do not deceive you in the name of all believers who have lost loved ones in recent days. It is enough to complete a child's loss once, but there are some desires we should not describe as a probability.
