Last night I saw Brigade on TV (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and I watch movies as long as I can remember it. Indeed, I can say that the Brigade is alone as the worst film ever gone. The accents were fiction. The local children's club produced better sets. The heroes were so wooden that they were probably drowning with the tears of cartridges that were unpleasant to watch them. The stars of this film hoped to stay alive enough to protect themselves from the embarrassment they had seen in this film. The owners of this trip must serve a great deal of humanity and destroy all the copies of this film.
