Okay ... it seems so far, only Barman fans have commented on this movie - time for a mutual point. Please note that this post is for a long time. For those who know (mainly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, the director of this film, is the leader of dEUS, well known in the late 90s rock bands are here in Belgium. Basically, they created very profitable and innovative albums and quickly gained national glory. Then the ego pain began, and the group was divided basically, Barman and others continued to create an album under dEUS-monicker. In such cases it was always the case that the dive after dEUS was much fuller and less interesting than the original. In 1999, their album, The Ideal Crash, attempted to make an international breakthrough, offering a very sophisticated form of the song's previous style. They are not enough. However, the teeth seemed to be as big as it was - enough to make Barman a self-sufficient artist to film. <br /> <br /> It is often a big mistake, and this does not exclude the movie. And Barman clarified this art, it was another big mistake. In short, he is not a musician, but a film director. According to one another, dEUS has created the best entertainment and entertainment, but I have nothing to do with my art. <br /> <br /> So, what is this movie? Basically, in Antwerp, which is totally inexperienced, explains the story of an entirely unsophisticated group, making unreasonable things on Friday, because they are less interested in unnecessary behaviors. The heroes are indifferent, the plot is completely meaningless, and there is no other quality of payment in the movie to overcome these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie smiles about 3 times 3 times and actually provokes a 5-second hero (not loud). Mood? The film does not just show any feeling or feeling. Mystery? Well, the idea of ​​a "wind-man", the idea of ​​inspiring the name of the movie, is astonishing as a banana-pizza pizza - not many, and it was made less than a minute ago (everyone Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino's worst images in the film so far) * END MINOR SPOILER *). And well, its * artistic *, so do not expect any real action to do all the previous things. <br /> <br /> As long as it's a few smiles, it's stuck in my shirt. Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from the same problems as other OST has shown recently: First, this movie does not look like a commercial for the CD. Secondly, Barman's impression of the content of the songs that were just not worked out is that the film's weaknesses and emotional content are impressive. As a result, the film will look like an example of songs. And, unfortunately, Barmans has its own contribution to the most noticeable noise, though this is a weak part of all the soundtracks I am concerned about. Generally, Barman simply stands to show that music is more than movies. <br /> <br /> What I was watching in this movie was just a vision factor. Since I came from Antwerp, it was fun to play some kind of "guess-the-location" game. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is more chance for the Flemish film. Recently, I will note that the best Belgian films come from the French part of the country. At least, at least, they have something to say and manage as they say, both sharp and emotionally (when the brothers come to mind). Perhaps the Flemish art house should do the same.
