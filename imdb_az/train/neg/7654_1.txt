I recall that I read all terrible, horrible views for the emergence of this film. I was thinking of seeing how awful I was, but for three weeks she left the theater. Gigli is just a movie to handle. <br /> <br /> When the movie went to DVD, I saw how horrible it was. I did not think of horrifying ideas about getting this movie. After seeing, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that this movie is not without some cool pictures. There is a nice shot at the top of a bullet that has been thrown out of the weapon. I thought it was neat. And in this movie monsters are perfect to look at, to die; but only after seeing it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If wrong behavior is a sin, Hell has thrown Tara Reid out of the way that this movie is incredibly terrible. And in all the roles, he plays a curator. Now, if he plays dumb, empty sex toys, maybe I can forgive him for looking at his character. Apparently, if Uwe Boll took his shirt in the movie, people would think that they would see it. She simply did not realize that she was doing a good movie in the middle of the movie, making it a good mistake. And on a dry sad scene is a Mexican poem or something? I can not say. <br /> <br /> It brings me the following complaint: Uwe Boll shows the worst directoring skills you have ever seen in a movie. I would like to say that I'll give the House of the Dead one F (and I'm doing it for only a few films), but HotD calculates at least one B. The film begins with a very long story that is immediately confusing (and read by a terrific narrator), and from there, the clippings are really dumb. Slater and Reid have a look around a destroyed building and darken the screen. When it comes back, Slater and Reid fired everywhere, and suddenly their whole army joined them. Huh? <br /> <br /> And someone is not concerned about checking errors in this movie. At one point, a group comes out of the glass, but the glass breaks down before touching it. Tara Reid's earrings change in the middle of a scene, and Slater begins to climb her away from a dead friend. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really defeated. Something about an old tribe that releases darkness and someone "leads" or something and all the evil monsters open. BORING very easily, many of the gun scenes are an excuse (developed by the technology that no character needs to re-download this movie). <br /> <br /> I hoped to laugh at how incredible this film was. I did not laugh, but still think foolishly. Very, very, very stupid.
