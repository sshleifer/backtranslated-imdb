Indeed, a seemingly infinite film worthy of zero. The presentation looks simple enough: Yentl, who is interested in learning talent, wants to go to school. Only the boy is allowed to study, and after his father's death, he decides to hide himself as a boy. She approaches Avigdor, who is about to marry a beautiful woman named Hasses, and becomes a close friend. The Hasses family learns that Avigdor's brother has committed suicide and is delayed by the wedding. Yentl, now called Anshel, is then selected to marry Hasses. It does, but never ends. Yentl / Anschel and Avigdor went for a few days, and Yentl / Anshel informed her of her secret. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The film ends with Avigdor's return home (and marriage?). Hadis and Yentl continue to continue their education in America. <br /> <br /> For more than 2 hours a movie, but there are a few things that violate it. For beginners, there is constant SINGING. Yes, I know that this is a music, so many songs and dance numbers should be. But the film was already directed and the movie could be improved. After a while, the songs are tiring and you can expect more dance. Most of the songs are unforgettable, no real memorable lyrics and those of no importance can easily be replaced by noise. Only one song from the rest, "Papa Can You Hear Me". Obviously, the majority of the others are intentional, so Streisand can only be able to show vocal abilities in five to ten minutes. Luck is that everybody knows who this movie is and how it is an actress, so the songs are not really needed. Secondly, Stanton's appearance as a man (lipstick, advanced eyelashes and wrinkles) is the character of Yentl / Anschel, who is really serious and believing that he cheated new friends, colleagues, and even Hadassus . But we have to believe in many things and not to expect it. Although she seems to be confused by her characteristic remarks or more, she does not think how to handle her, but it is surprising that everyone seems to be deceived by wearing men's clothing. It means that we have been expected to believe that the other characters are so naive, that they do not see other differences, such as the obvious differences. The fact that most of the other characters in the film do not have a beard or other facial hair, the immediate relatives or friends can not just be included in the face difference. Nevertheless, in the 1900s, when a woman was dressed as a man but wore a lot of makeup as Strixen's character, and still tried to pass on to men because of men's clothing, it was unacceptable and anger. Of course, will have to leave the country. For this reason, the "woman" on Streisand does not lend credibility to the makeup character and only weakens it. When it is only used to make the Streisand look better, it must be missed. Thirdly, when Yentl / Anschel puts it to an end, the other characters are not as wise as Stryscend, and only "truth" is a little clever. <br /> <br /> <strong> Saudi Arabia> Institute for Peace and Democracy </ b> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; no fault with this movie, its structure or songs I do not have to agree with respect, although I have a great vocal and acting ability, but I'm not the "admirer" of her performance style, but I'm very glad that she has many features, including music features, "I'm not, or I'm against it, I've written this review from someone who does all he can to watch this movie - and even a few times - from an honest perspective, and he notes the problems that are in. If Streisand is interested in creating a great or sensitive movie, it must not prove that it is powerful, beautiful, and intelligent, and should not show it. not to harm her husband, to show herself, and to transform the film into a laugh-fest, which is not worthy of heroes or spectators.
