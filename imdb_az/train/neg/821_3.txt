Stanley Kramer focuses on the backdrop of an activity and performs two basic things: action and excitement. DOMINO PRINCIPLE gives you the characteristics of a prisoner Gene Hackman, a prisoner of war, to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are likely to work for his employees --- but they are not always clear as the film's most-drawn line. Hackman asks for a number of questions that will never be answered because he will not go anywhere. NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO PRINCIPLE blends uncertainty and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film draws very good pictures, even works against it. The direction of Cramer is deprived of any style. This is a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> Hackman said that the player who claims to be too bad can not be too bad. Widmark and Wallach are in good shape and Albert is as good as Widmark's brutal neglect. Mickey Rooney hacker is pretty good as sidekick. But a strange one is the fall of Candace Bergen, Hackmann's wife. We seem to have been taking time in prison and trying to put that kind of south dark. It's up to Kramer to put an ugly brown wig on her mind as she looks like smuggler. It plays a more prominent role in Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell's love.
