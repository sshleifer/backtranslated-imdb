If it is not for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this B-movie would not have been a part of my Tivo disk! What was the lowest hire, portable space port in the back lot warehouse? "People of Sustainability!" This is the main principle in a real movie! A cosmic port at night and a barn at night (at night and at a space station)! ?? People! The only thing that praises this film is the wardrobe department. For the durability of your Natassia clothes in this intense form! Even the women who have seen these bombs must measure their suit for a certain period of time, each shooting day! Sci-fi channel would be better than showing SpaceBalls! <br /> <br /> P.S. NEWS: Following one of the Allies, Michael Ironside, Please turn on your ASAP agent! You're better than an actor, even if you're at this level of the movie.
