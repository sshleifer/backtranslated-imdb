Really bad slasher movie. A psychic person escapes from asylum. Three years later, sociology professor, the end of the scene. Yesterday, after a semester (hey, a title card), a new sociology professor at the school. She works with a professor of sociology and another professor who works there. <br /> <br /> The disciples, as we are, are all bored. <br /> <br /> There are many headline cards showing how long they have passed. Səhnələr olduqca qısa və fərqli bir simvol üçün başqa bir yerə kəsilir, hər cür kiçik inkişafa səbəb olur. Many of the scenes, walking and talking, sitting and talking, and symbols that serve little purpose covers. Despite the passing of time, many characters are always in the same garment. Sometimes it is not clear when the switch means when you see a body, we ask ourselves: What is the body? <br /> <br /> At least one of those killed has not been kidnapped by others. <br /> <br /> The killer stabbed birdəni fell, killing one, the other stabbed and killed her mouth and the other to cut off his forehead. Is the knife poisoned, or is it something? <br /> <br /> There is a crazy man in the video box cover: there is nothing in the film. The back cover in a bedroom, a group of abused women dressed in a graduation cap and have a photo. Photograph red hood film, but nobody even if the outfit does not disclose such a scene. The killer is definitely one.
