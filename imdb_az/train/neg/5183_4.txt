This is the first of what I've seen in "The Movies of the Dead 8 Movies" and, of course, I do not want to see any of them ... though at least a few of them are good. I do not know, it was terrible, but it really did not do much for me. One of the main non-working family members in the suburban family was a mother, and the father died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco. The best part of this was a creepy Goth sister, of course, invites a friend from a never-ending school. In any case, of course, the basement has a butcher shop and so on. This family resembles Sawyer Clan's white bread version, they are bad and they do bad things, but they do not go to anyone. I have looked at many people who love it and did not know I was leaving, but I found it very mediocre and I do not recommend it to anyone. From 10 to 4.
