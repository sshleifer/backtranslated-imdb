I've seen this story as monotonous and not quite interested in the fact that it is not true, hasty, neat, "innovative". After the weekend with horrific events, hostility and bad news, these characters are just fine, an interesting movie is not my idea, and I am tired of the topic of "a note" and did not wait for it to end - in fact I almost stopped half. The whole movie was just trivial and surprised, and most of the characters were surprised and unpleasant, but the player was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeals - I'm sorry, but I did not do it with me, and I love good, little movies! It was not just jell, though I was expecting it and I hope. Especially after two local researchers put on their "Top 10 Best" list I was disappointed. Instead I strongly recommend the "The Sand of The House" to miss - now there is a good, small movie!
