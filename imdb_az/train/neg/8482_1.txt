Some of my old friends offered me to watch this movie, but I recently had a chance. I hoped to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, and they saw the garbage camera angles blended at high speeds. Decreasing Hinduism, I did not understand what another message was. I resemble a lot more religious, but Kamal Hasan is a person who organizes such a thought. He could have shot a horrible film from this crap. He tried to add Hollywood's viruses and gods, he did not turn the boy into a mutant, and eventually went to world domination. This is a film school and a very useful movie for a regular public. I'm sorry for him to keep his ability. The story begins with the fact that Chaos is trying to pay their thoughts with the Butterfly effect, and then less religious misconduct in insulting Hinduism (One more, I insulted Hinduism, but this is not equal to the film, and my insult is generally the same for religion).
