The Rainmaker, 1956, is one of the best actors in history. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are prime players. Even this melody can not be completely saved. First of all, Hepburn, as an actress, is ill-treated as a shy spinster, even though it is not shining. It is so powerful to be as simple as it is, and it's too old to be part of it. Lancaster, against extreme movements, and Earl Holliman come much more commonly like Jethro Clampett. Only bridges and trustworthy Wendell Corey come on a bit of cast - but they can only do just that. It was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread his wings as an actress in the 1950s, and that's a wonderful thing. He just made a bad choice. Fortunately for his admirers (I am among them), he did not do much of them. A-list cast and good production values, though, do not work.
