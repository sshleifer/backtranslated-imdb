<br /> <br /> Get your brewskies and enjoy this flick action flick. Speakman's important kempo skills (nice spin kicks, decent with sticks - bad couch!) The quality of a movie that cries only badly. Half of the land is not bad; only exceptionally poorly executed. But if you see this movie other than the art of martial arts, you will not lose the ship completely. And for a movie that will take place in Koreaatown, the way is very few Korean actors (even extras).
