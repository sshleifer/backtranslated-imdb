In my opinion, this movie was pretty clever. If you are looking for Cheesey, you can do so. I myself do not expect a fair amount of cheese, but it was ridiculous. The development of the film made me sad and the story was very weak. <br /> <br /> It was a fun glo zombie about the movie, but that's not a good reason to see this flick.
