<br /> <br /> I love the Toxic Avenger series, but this weak suggestion of the Troms people did not make any sense, and I was always strangled. <br /> <br /> A teardrop of Tromaville youths joins a gang, makes sexual intercourse, high nuts causing the explosion and causing anything. There's also some kind of monster training in high school ... God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The players have stopped their efforts since then and they need it. <br /> <br /> Disappointment. 2/10.
