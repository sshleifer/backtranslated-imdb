I am not an artistic person. I'm a scientist-minded woman, and I felt that this movie was one of those attractive films in a budget. I watched a part with my fianc√© and my future step daughter. In this film that interests us, we have worked hard to find something. My fiancee and her daughter sang it, and we moved to the ocean 13, but that's another story. I woke up next morning to get in touch and gave another shot to the movie. I started watching this movie more seriously. I just can not get it, I want to get it. I thought the funniest part was the washing of ashes, and the fireplace was used as a vase, which looked like dead flowers. Interestingly, there were still dead things inside. It was a strange and strange movie. Maybe it is, but for the second time I will not be fooled!
