This movie reminds me A Mary-Kate and Ashley's movie are just bad. Although Alysons is more and more actresses, I think only rich sisters, Amanda michalka was sometimes okay, but Alysons was moving stunk. I think that after high school music they had to come up with something better, and this is not necessarily. The storyline was not so nice and I think they have won two players to play with Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka, and this movie did not make me a better one. I do not know if they should be sick to watch this movie and when you do not have anything better (I just did not)
