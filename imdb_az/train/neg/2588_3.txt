The Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a bit better, and the third American Pie franchise also appears to be the same quality as the DVD predecessor. Basically, Eric Stewart (John White) has lost her sister, and now she and Mike Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining with Erikin's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. At Beta House, there are fifty-listed tasks to accomplish in order to be the only exclusive privileged member of a large number of parties, plenty of liquor and enough hot shepherd promise. However, rivals, the GEK ("Geek") House, are facing greater and better threats than the Beta, driven by stronger hungry nerd (and shepherd) Edgar (Tyrone Savage). Beta and Gek went into battle with the fortieth years to defeat Greek battles for one and a half years, for the sake of solving each other. The latest champion of the game, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (only regular Eugene Levy) shows people swimming, gladiator dwellers swimming in the water, catching greasy pigs, riding with Russian roulette mouthpiece, old horse trail, spouse full of cockroaches ( without disqualification). All of this results in a sudden death that a man takes the stripper skirt and Edgar resists the Betma House win when talking to a girl dressed in her lap. As well as Flubber's Mr. Stifler as Christopher McDonald, Ashley as Meghan Heffern, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power by Denise, Andreja Punkris Stacy and Rock as Jordan Prentice. The amount of nudity grows very little, it is similar to jokes and I value a star of five, but I love it. Enough!
