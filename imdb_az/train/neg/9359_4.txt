This film is probably anti-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing? The main character is a Muslim father and a Christian mother. The first 20 years live in a Christian village. As it is seen at the end of the film, he is a Muslim because he is wearing a headdress, lace, and general clothing. Although her mother is a Christian, she has a six-year-old boy who is wearing the same head dress and probably a Muslim. Thus, the main character is chosen, it appears to be a Muslim and his child becomes Muslim. None of the main characters of the other Christian woman gives birth to a child. At the end of this film there are many Muslims in the world, so it seems.
