Despite being a fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, about six years ago, I said, "Follow me with Filo." <br /> <br /> I knew all the songs from some Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but I did not know anything. Unfortunately, if songs are charming and Ginger Rogers's character is sweet and funny, it's not just like "Bake Baker". While trying to create her longtime partner, she is constantly sabotaging her career. His character does not have the usual humor and other Astaire characters. <br /> <br /> Looking at Ginger Rogers for a great deal of criticism for songs and audiences.
