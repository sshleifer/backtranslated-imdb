A group of models are looking to live in an apartment and displayed by a local real estate agent. Models and agents are not known, but the "hell of fire" is in the apartment, and the devil is called to kill those who are on the way to "Dethman". This story is explained by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of crime. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a champion of low budget, microbudget and independent films, I praise this movie. Creators are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor has his DVD running, but I can not cover it. If an additional one or two hour arrangement creates all the differences, why do you need to shoot a movie within 24 hours? <br /> <br /> Please note that this is a pessimistic, unusual action, and leads to the delivery of several fraudulent lines? <br /> <br /> Most of the models are a real estate agent. The dialogue is clearly advertised, because no scenario writer can do so with empty arguments. The agent also did not know anything about the apartment ... He does not care about anybody, he is paying attention to the direction of a house explaining the wrong source of heat source (not seeing the radiator) and tells the basement problem to be solved when they say "terminator". Please write a post - some deviation is good, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> Why did girls move on models? Their employers had no point on the beach, and it seems like a violent situation. At one point, an actress breaks the character and says, "The bad guy is saying something" more naturally sounds more "(" saddened ") than any other place because of the other bad dialogue. /> <br /> Demon did not make any sense. "The Eve of Hell" jumped to random places on the earth (including the fireplace), but why does not it reveal what the devil is? There is a man who is lovingly killed by another man on his backdrop. How is this a devil? <br /> <br /> Why do not we need Viktoria flashbacks in an unnecessary field of dialogue and expectations? This was often the case. <br /> <br /> The dramatic suspensions between the lines were terrible. The character of Sam Bishop was the worst, behind the meeting very far. Each question requires a pause, a funny face and response ... after a break, a funny face and one answer? I was very upset. It was just a matter of time for me to dive ... but I'd like to deliver an hour out of the horrible submission (and more often by wasting twice with the same loans) for an hour. Anyway, who was Sam Bishop's character? Allegedly, I "saw" all these and charged with killing girls, but never been part of a fairy tale with girls. How did he see them? And if not, did Detman know that he was killing them? If he does not see the detail, how does he know that the Apostles have a spirit? I've lost a lot ... when there was a line for a trick when writing? <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed in this movie was a scene from one of the models in the bathroom. It was not really important or anything, but only a break from the boredom I was given. I think Fiksi Diaz is the director. His music is very good (though his DVD is the scene of his performance) the best part of the DVD was a trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (although the trailer was better than this time). <br /> <br /> I must be very strict. . I think this movie was a trial that could be done within 24 hours, or maybe a fun experience, and the idea never made a good quality movie. But if Superhero Excelsior is any indication, Diaz can be quality ... why he chose to escape from here? Perhaps the world will never know.
