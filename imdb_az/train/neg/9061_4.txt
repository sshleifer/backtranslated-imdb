What can you say about this movie? Not to be afraid, but not good! Two days ago, I watched the Lillies and was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay flick. <br /> <br /> This story was foolish and the actor was OK. Not bad enough to quit, but there were some bad moments and some terrifying stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Is this movie coming? No, you will not lose your time and money. I do not understand why films like this have been pulled out and financed by them. Instead, spend time watching Noah's Ark on the logo. Despite this movie, I have not gone here.
