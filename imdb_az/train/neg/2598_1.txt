Even in a bad movie, usually there are some retrieval features, yes, it's terrible, it's almost a thing, but it's a performance or a part of a script or a special effect, it was terrible. Tiffany's references to many unexplained Breakfast Breaks, a strange player, was funny, and even special effects were the best. It was a very bad movie, and even Drew Barrymore dropped his dreams. Describe where you want to: a) Tough to hurt yourself. b) See how bad the film is. A movie that can use a clich√©, "I have ninety minutes of my life, I will never come back" on some basics!
