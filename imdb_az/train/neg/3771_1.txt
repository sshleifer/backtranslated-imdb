It should be one of the worst films of the 1990s. My friends & when we watched this movie (targeting the target audience), we just looked at the first half hour we were sitting and our jaws touched on how bad this fact is. The rest of the time, everyone in the theater began to talk only to each other or they started to explode, in fact, to earn money to watch these delicate excuses for a movie. It did not seem like a great idea on paper, but there is something in the film as it is in the invisible movie. Crap acting, crap suits. I'm not too far from watching something so heartwarming. Keep an eye on yourself and save some of your life .........
