Yes, they say that nymphomania remains unsatisfied with you. Stella James (Sean Young) is known as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she does not know if she has sex with men. He is still trying to find "more information", so he can see what he wants from life and his men, even though he's in his age should be a good idea. (But we can not agree with anyone who says that it is too old for the role of Young.) If he had all of us life span. Most of the movies have put me in the cold, though you will never see the worst of its kind. Unlike the latest "Eyes Wide Shut", at least this happens.
