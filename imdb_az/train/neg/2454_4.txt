For a while, I did not see this movie, so I'm scared that I will not give details ... There were some interesting points. An attempt by Ralph Bakshi to master the masterpiece of J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, in fact, was a bankrupt at the time of production. Therefore, in a single place, in the middle of the second book of trilogy, the film itself appears to be less than the end of it. As you can see, some characters are animated when others are shot, but it's hard to say if they are deliberate. The whole thing is prepared and taken back by the hawthorn, especially the Orcs and Nazgul. Of course, another problem is the large gap in the plot. Baksi was in a hurry to finish this movie, and he hoped to write a book less than two hours and less than two hours (twice a day, about two times a new trilogy by Peter Jackson). (and I do not just appeal to Tom Bombad, so it's nice in the book, but I'm not as smart in the movie). Of course, it's a sudden and sudden end. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if Baker did not know whether or not to finish the first movie. <br /> <br /> The heroes ... are good, most of them were good. Hobbies do not look so bad (except gay Samin) Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy first wanted to make Sama a woman?) If you are a Tolkien fanatic (like me) follow this movie (though I'm not quite sure about getting it) But we know in advance that the true "Lord of Rings" is not much more of a historical interest than the '60s of the film, but that Beatles will implement it with plans (really a psychedelic LOTR can be quite cool Gandalf, Frodo, Paul, Samo and John Ringo as Gollum.) If you do not read or love books, or if you do not like animated movies or do not want to see a semi-funny movie ... stay away.
