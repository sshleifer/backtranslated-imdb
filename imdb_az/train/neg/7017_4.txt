If you hit teenagers in the 70s, you remember stories about Studio 54, like me, whether or not you liked the disco. The exclusive club was a perfect symbol of cultural self-restraint and self-consciousness in the 1970s; <br /> <br /> There is a very good VH1 documentary about the club where everything you want to know about the statue of the club and stories is quite interesting to shoot a very attractive movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not it. 54, followed by a few of his employees: a bartender named Shane (Ryan Phillippe), Greg (Breckin Meyer), his wife, cheerleader, Anita (Selma Hayek) and, of course, the ceremonial itself, Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers). <br /> <br /> If the movie club representatives are very well represented, this film is more interested in the personal life of employees, following the story of Sheen. Sometimes it is a perfect way to have the night culture (for example, when Shane was taken to a dining party and when he did not know who Errol Flynt was) and then turned into a hockey melodrama. Some of these are premise? After the confusion in the rich and incredible world, they watch jewelry? but most of them are related to the gloved treatment of the club and Rubell during the movie. Rubell, of course, narrowly focuses on the spread of drugs and sexuality, while involving the scene in New York with the above-mentioned spectacle and its selective celebration every day; and Rubell himself, the limit is obvious, a liar, a cheat, a drug addict, and a hell of a betrayer for all hell. I'm looking here for the man to have a pillory, but his ego has helped reduce the night culture that helps him to drop and lift the club directly. <br /> <br /> Meyers Rubell is doing everything she can to capture, but little to work with her is something that surprises her. impressive; but it is good and helps to close the film. In general, Philip, whom I find to be a good actor, is here with the insolence and folly of his character; a deer-in-the-lanterns are limited to a smile or a sudden disturbed spoon and can not even turn it into a powerful performance. Hayek and Meyer are recited by Neve Campbell, also by posting? Attached to the DVD carefully? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Even though this is a similar trend, especially when dealing with me is not a movie. If at that time, or if the club has any interest for you, you can almost certainly see VH1 rather than the midway track.
