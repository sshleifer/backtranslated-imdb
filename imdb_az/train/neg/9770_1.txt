This is a version that hates such a writer, because it is so modest. They "have come to a happy end" and have changed the majority of the dialogue, and it was only a large pile of sakarin. The "scene manager" is pretty good, but I believe it's a role, but everyone is in the style of a 40-year-old player. One great feature - music. It has one of the best recorded results and is worth a look at at a record store. Generally, the version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller 1989 is very high.
