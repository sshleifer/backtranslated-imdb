Terry West had a good idea of ​​this movie. He did not just make the meat. There is infinite shooting outside of the gloomy school and it is possible to make the film's filming. And there are only 2 students at this school. Misty Mundae is as good as usual, but this movie is always owned by Ruby LaRocca (the only reason to watch the movie at the outset). If the screenplay focuses on its fascinating character, we'll shoot a movie to watch. It's so terrible! Good news for DVD receivers, a special feature of Terry West's earlier (and better) film, "The Muse for the Blood". I would like to say that when this movie ends, it feels the same way as a person who is not good at delivering a punch line at the end of a long joke. Then follow this for Ruby LaRocca again.
