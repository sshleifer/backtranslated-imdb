With a Bo Derek movie, the audience just gets what they expect. No paper in a dress is gentle and a few shots, Mrs. Derek. 'Ghosts can not do it' only. The first fifteen minutes is the usual television drama because Scott (Anthony Quinn) is still alive. He is a very good actor with many different roles, but even the famous actor should sometimes work for the money. Bo Derek, on the contrary, always plays a beautiful young woman stunningly dressed or without clothes. The movie is full of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Arabia Lawrence or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or behave badly, please rent any porn movie.
