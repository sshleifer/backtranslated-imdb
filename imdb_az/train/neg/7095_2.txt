"Sexual Ascend Agenda" is a serious dramatic attempt on sexual compulsion. Perhaps a movie marketing scam, this flick goes for a stylish shot with a good cast and less for the other. Bottom line, "Diary ...", our sexually addict character has the most terrible spouse in the world, believing that the stability of the babies on the side is nothing better than giving up her clothes in her sadness and no work, despite being a restaurateur. In the best way, this flick could have been a good drama. The worst, cheapest softcore. It's not a "diary ..." or anywhere. This is for dumpster. (D-)
