This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the film was to get Angela's high body number. The player was strange. The crimes were very bad. I think Ally is in an abandoned cabin as it is full inside the toilet. But when it comes to the end of the film and you see Molly and the other man in the cabin, you see Ally, but Angela did not go to get her. The black girl and Angela were really in the cabin and Angela took the guitar and tore it. One was a terrifying player, and why two did not just go around and fast?!?!? Then, when you are pursued by Molly Angela, why do not you turn around and stop him when you have a neighbor? It's stupid. This movie sucked ...
