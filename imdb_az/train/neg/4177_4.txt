The second film on the cassette. Originally Bloodsuckers, this movie was pretty average. Some parts are bored, but there are some good effects, though they are not good. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. Vampires are very close to the whole world. The Vampire Sanitation staff, captured by vampires, receives a message from the team from Earth and Quintana (played by Natassia Malthe)), rookie officer Damian and rebels Rosa and Roma (Roman Aaron Pearl was mistakenly charged). V-SAN is then facing the Muco leader of Vampires playing by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He does not plan to live in peace with humans, as it is wrapped in world domination. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not waste time, I will soon be back to the DVD player.
