The previous comments encouraged me to come to the TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is very good, but can not take enough time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette are familiar but play a promising character, but the script puts them curled. <br /> The film turns around the ego of Lee Tracy's character, is the best self-centered, physically and abusive word. "People's" reactions are weakly thought and incredible, "shenanigans" seems to write a bad post. <br /> <br /> Lupe is a characteristic of Velez's character. <br /> <br /> The "single liner" that has been considered once again depends on the waiting person because it is even attempted.
