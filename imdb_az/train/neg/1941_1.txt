I do not believe that he spent five hours of my life on this trash. The author's proposal in the previous five days was quite pleasant and I was really looking forward to it. But the majority of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones is primarily guilty, or murmured or gabbled in his lines, but most of the rest followed his example. Notable exceptions Bernard Till and Anne Reid were formerly trained exemplary teachers. Manufacturers do not produce before they are broadcast so as to make sure the dialogue is heard? As a result, I have lost the trace of what has happened, and as soon as the original plot line appears to be a standard thing between Muslims and the rest, I lost interest soon. The latter was a complete anti-raid. Full dud.
