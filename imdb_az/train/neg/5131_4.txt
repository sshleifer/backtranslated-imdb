I liked it, but then I think it is ironing at the same time. This development of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a completely unusual, formulaic romcom, which has been freed from straightforward-to-video respects from the release of Janeane Garofalon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Interesting movie about Chaplin's exciting career. A middle-british actor drew the Hollywood treadmill with this movie. Though Terence Malick can create an important attraction in his films, he is predominant and his anonymity in his studio production is not surprising. Uma Thurman ditzy turns into the autopilot and Michael Lehmann collects all this together. Though the phone has a gender. 4/10
