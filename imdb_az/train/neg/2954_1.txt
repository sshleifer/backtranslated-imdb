I'm watching most of the bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's really a hobby type. Almost every Saturday nite is a group of comrades and I come together and watch the trash all over the world - ANYTHING. Turkish super hero films, vampire ghosts from Brazil, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Costner films, ANYTHING (Perhaps Helen Raising), but I have never seen a film worse than THEODORE REX. Never. And an Ed Wood is kinda even funny - not just SUCK. Now that this film was popular in Hollywood, WHOOPI took the gloves to the press and everyone would CRAD THIS REGION TO MAKE THIS REGION = he tried to abandon the contract, he moaned, but still this leather skin strange futuristic police uniform, his oil butt To see the shed is terrible, yikes !!!! And you just see that during his seething - doing everything, but looking for a camera for his agent can shout at him. There are three facial expressions in the dinosaur, and the scenes of the scenario are as terrifying as the third class class can do a better job.
