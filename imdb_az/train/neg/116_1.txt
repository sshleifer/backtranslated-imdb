Those who appreciate this film do not consider another movie. I was prepared to suppose that this would be terrible, but the script (or lack thereof) also considered a movie as senseless. Moreover, the overall level of creativity of actors and technical staff is very important, but you can not do a silk bag when you come to a seed to work with you. I'm G's supporters, who should remain after staying in any movie. Dorothy S fans must stay in Galaxina. The fans of Peter B must show their last picture and target. For those who ask for it, fans of the cheap laughs must remain loyal to the terrible book of Peter B's unicorn murder.
