I have recently seen this little reverend for the first time ever, and I'm not going to be one of those dollar DVDs that seem to be everywhere these days. For those who have never seen this spectacular martyred Mexican import and want to see it without fearing everyone's orange interpretation, there are undoubtedly the following spoilers. So, if you are one of these fearless individuals, stop reading at once and go and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Start by starting a place where a person can become a worm after the orphanage ends. No one in the film explains how implants of these species can occur, and that the rest of the film is more hopelessly unusual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Naschi (our werewolf) has a look of a man who is struggling with a toothache, where a bottle of wine (or anything you drink) in a city is the only dentist He sold Novocaine as a cheap whiskey and has been drunk since then. Nasser's face has never changed, whether in make-up or outside, and no-one taught him to act as a werewolf. Sometimes he is Lon Chaney Jr. She tries to imitate crouch, but she just walks around in a black mafia shirt. To be fair, makeup is actually better than the actor, but sustainability is infinitely worse. Nasi's victim believes the shadow of changes can be thought twice. From a black shirt it goes to red, then black, then red, then black and black, all alone, a dark night. Interestingly, he always walks in a red shirt while wearing Chaney Crouchu and a black friend wearing a black shirt. And just see that he is very angry aluded in the head while wearing red shirts. <br /> <br /> So, after being crushed by a blooming little boy, he returns home from Tibet to find out that his poor wife is his wife. lay down with one of his disciples. Two illegitimate lover is trying to kill the brakes in his car. He escapes from the swamp and is home for a full month. Then, after checking his spouse and girlfriend, she goes back and pushes her electrically. But is it enough? Could it be that permissible vulnerable people in peace? There is no chance. She was resurrected by a female scientist possibly with a hardcore S / M fetish, known as another "The Doctor" (and definitely not a new embodiment of Doctor Who). He drags him out and drags him to the stranger, takes him to the dungeon, leads him to the wall and gives him a damn good penalty. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, such inconsistencies are enough to create a bit of anger for any hero. <br /> <br /> After two hawks, our wolf will spend most of the film around the castle to find a way out. (And who blames her?) During her picnic, she was a medieval armored person, an unexpected Phantom of the Opera Symbol (likely the Doctor's father) and a heavyweight <br /> <br /> < Someone has something to do with the control of the mind and takes an indefinite impression. The doctor includes something that he says "Chemotrodes." (I guess I do not know how to write it) <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is no sense in any of these films, of course, anyway. you can not expect a bit, but at least for a laugh, it's not the same.My friend, it's about laughing on this movie, from its textile-tequila-drained air, cinema and teasing music score to one of the MST3K types There is a reptile anarchy against the hell of the most talked about, and why is hell good if it's not good for it? The revenge of montezum is somewhat digitally remastered and a DVD, exactly like this movie.
