<br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to release a terrible update from another classic? <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd was terrified of this role I enjoyed on behalf of myself. The dignified "Uncle Martin's" manic description is unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminals. <br /> <br /> The headmaster's quick actions, shouting dialogue and "somewhere" were similar to the slapstick comedy, as it seems that ANY AKTORUN tried to act as they were red ants in their trousers. <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Since the 1963 classic is manic, it is a well-deservedly misleading script. it's better than a cover - actually looks pretty good compared to one another. <br /> <br /> The most sad thing about this movie is probably appealing to young children, and I'm not sure if it's just for her kids, I'm not a boy who does not respect himself, knows the kidnapping! <br /> <br /> If he did not want to make "my favorite Martian", why Unfortunately, IMDB.com does not add to its readers a rating as "zero", which is the only rating that comes to mind explaining this travesty. <br /> <br /> One good thing came out of this movie, actors and crew were paid - I think.
