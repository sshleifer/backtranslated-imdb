When I heard the concept of the film, I heard the film "The filmmakers were attacked", as a majority, in the video showing that the filmmakers were being persecuted by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> Then, what does it mean to "watch the film shooter" to watch and discover the movie? Some guys were drowned in a rock and some people complained loudly and "Someone overcame these two children." The picture on the cover was like "chase"? General preparation. <br /> <br /> I guess the relationships with the subject of the film, I feel a sense of lying and manipulation, feeling more money and time for stupid children. <br /> <br /> What's great about the viewer is far from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me," but "Roger & Me" mock Flint people. Completely incorrectly directed and completely believer. Amazing! Wow! Do you believe that those under the yoke of communism will have full-fledged markets? What tension! And not so much, "look at the effects of capitalism and the western media blah blah blah," because not because of their fraudulent market opponents, because many in the film say that the prices were absurdly low, some were denied for how much they were charged for ducks should know. <br /> <br /> Small people will go to a store with low prices, bravo guys look like people at the bottom. <br /> <br /> The way to play a stupid practical joke is to the elderly people. You must be very proud. About your next movie, you will take a documentary about Iraq and show people how to excite them home without the holes of walls and then "HAHA! THIS IS NOT HOUSE HOUSE!" Morgan "Looks Like Me" Spurlock is a giant of a movie and it's not a surprise that this documentary, like a Hit from Spurlock, seems to throw her weight down <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is no need to stay behind in a world that is not needed by any ridiculous concept, > <br /> Avoid as dead.
