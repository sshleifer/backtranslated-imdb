Where do they get the money to make such films? That is, there is nothing about this movie. None of the actors are known, the writing is horrible, the photography stack, the story is a bad version of Repo Man and is played between a nicotone western and the actor is incredible. For anyone who likes good and bad movies, I must admit that this film is in the worst case I have ever seen since the Eye of the 1950s. I do not want to spoil the efforts of people who want to ban some fun or paradise, art, but this movie will not appeal to anyone. The story boils down to a mysterious discovery of a bad version of Celtic Soul Eaters, although it acts as a succubus without a person with more sexual overtones. Bad guys have to unite with good guys in a city that can not escape. Get it, it's the best part. My advice is that if you do not get into bad mythology, amateur writings, non-sincere actors and awesome devices, it will be best served when you hire video on the shelf.
