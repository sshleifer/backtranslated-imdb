There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no way to spoil it. A person living in madjik Amik proves that he can act alive - no talent is needed. Just a shimmering point is a few liners delivered by Alice Krige very well, but then again Alice Krigedir. His gentle noisy voices give a single indication of how dangerous these creatures are. This is another incredible plot that is creepy. How is it a matter of agreeing on this project? Scenario writers must be medicated when presenting this script. There are great sustainability problems, superficial stereotypic characters, terrible formulas, and nothing in the sense of nothing. Creations do not explore more than just where they come from and what they are when they have neat skills like "dim". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this subject.
