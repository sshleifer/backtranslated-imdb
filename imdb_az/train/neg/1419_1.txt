This is a terrific movie - and, unfortunately, this short few other companies have developed. It's a strange idea that you're not interested in getting started short-term, and it can hurt you too. This, of course, is very young children (most nearly 2 years old) watching and acting like adults - in this case, the dancer girl and bar room bosses disturbed me. This is a kind of humor that you can be forced to laugh when your children behave like adults, but I do not want to see anyone - especially a very young Shirvan Temple, acting as a pretty reptile outfit and vamp! And then, other kids move in adulthood as adults. Since then, they did not try to talk to pedophiles, but I am sure that when you look at it, it comes to mind immediately! Therefore, this boring movie ALSO compressed me and I will never see it! Quite strangely and terribly.
