Robin Williams and Tony Collete failed to score a bad rating or worse for two reasons. There are some elements that are as light as psychological as the film has the potential to be a tension and that the film is a little bit more focused. Robin Williams, a story from personal issues, plays Gabriel Noon, the nightmare: his lover goes out of action and appears to be a form of Gabriel's story block. One day, he reads and reads a story by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete explains the story of her life and the misuse of her parents in her hands. She lives with married mother and social worker Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Jabrayil is amazed and friendships with Pete begin, but Gabriel tries to meet him, and when Pete Boland finds the possibility of being as such, everything seems strange. I do not want to spoil the film, but I'll tell you this: it can be predicted pretty well. Robin Williams and Tony Collette are an exciting atmosphere to tell a story and good performances I think is the main character of the movie. Collette does not ask one of the most talented and sincere actresses. His ability to touch his heroism and personality is very illogical and his achievement is better than an Oscar (hell, I think, the script is a little less likely to get a good assistant actress). The film begins as a psychological tension, but it's something like that. If you see a movie you're wondering when the movie is finished and twisted, I'll give another predictable romantic rent, Hide and Seek.
