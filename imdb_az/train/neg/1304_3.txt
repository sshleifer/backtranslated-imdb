A very low-budget police procedural film about detectives about the murder case that tried to kill a woman who was stolen by a car stolen in the Central Park, and their only idea was a tattoo on her arm. Although issued by RKO, this is a view of independent production selected by the studio for distribution. Except for a few of the sea and crew, among them young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and operator William Steiner - are and are full of unknowns. The performances are at the universal level and will not be forced into a secondary school education film, the direction is stodgy and desperate, and there is no chemistry among the leading actors as mentioned earlier. However, despite the many shortcomings in the film, there are a few good points. In New York City, the filming place and the ultra-low budget of the film give a dark originality, such as the "The Naked City", which is very superior, and a skirmish in a dark basement takes place properly and some research procedures are smart. Otherwise, writing about home is not much. However, in the early 1950s, old car enthusiasts have to watch cars on the streets in the 30s and 40s, despite the appearance of New York's seafarers. <BR>
