Terrible, awful TV show! Why did the Comedy Center decide to repeat the old episodes of this program? It really sucks! Of course, I'm talking about the season after the first two years. The first two seasons were gold, and if I only talked about that season, this show would take one-eight out of ten stars. No comedy after the first two seasons is good. They were and terrible. Comedy is not funny. ALL !!! <br /> <br /> After leaving MAD TV, the original player is full of very talented comedians like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or any name). This show is too exaggerated and worth the effort on Saturday night to channel your life to another vibrant show. Get on the Saturday night and have fun and leave the MAD TV and let it die.
