I saw it at the Marketplace of Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is a real cheapo product - there is nothing wrong with this, but you need to deal with it with a little sex or a brother or two. <br /> <br /> Consider Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - good work has been done to shut down my words to the producers. <br /> <br /> The scene in the cosmic boat is not fun - the whole crew is shaking around their hands! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people good - at least not ambitious.
