Teamo Supremo is three of their leaders - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own warrior (Buzz! Chika! Woopa!) And with the outfit and actions. They worked for Governor Kevin and hired after becoming a hero and wanting to play in the game. They also have a normal life, they have family and school responsibilities, but most of them move away from the fight against school. All of his friends know what Mr. Vaqa and his plans are, but they are, as always, the most unique and unique features of those who act. From a bad robot to a bad bar, you have to face up to three and stop the evil and often get strange, gain power, revenge, and so on. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is pretty nice and smooth, but the style is simple. The backgrounds look similar to each other and the buildings look futuristic. <br /> <br /> The conversation is generally not very nice and style is not my favorite, although the show is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The fields are almost always unusual and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and you can not blame them for that. But this will not be the same with Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
