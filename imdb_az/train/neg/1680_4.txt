Wonderland does not give a deep gesture to this film, with a cast that has generally credible names like Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow. The night of July 1981 complicates the surface of the events. Kilmer continues to do other actions, such as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth; Holmes's wife and old girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the rash has such small roles and it is impossible to obtain any measure from them. The film is also strange from Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and Paris Hilton.
