The film did not lose its missiles on Mars, but began with people who discovered that they were drifting in space near the planet. Once taken, one crew member is ill, one is alive, and two are missing. <br /> <br /> A group of Mars survivors had been attacked by pretty stupid bogus monsters. Surprisingly, although the gangs were pretty good, monsters were one of the series I've seen in the movie. Moreover, in a strange attempt on realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, when this amazing novelty was just on the surface of Mars, the movie looked pretty cheap and the intensity of frying was practically bleeding - it was bad! Despite all the cheeses, there was an interesting structure as well as a good message about the film's journey to space. It's worth seeing for those who love the genre. <br /> <br /> Compared to today's standards, this is not a particularly good movie. <br /> <br /> When watching the movie, pay attention to Dr. Trema. From the cartoon "Jonny Quest" Dr. It looks like Quest's saliva image! Moreover, it also sounds and looks like it.
