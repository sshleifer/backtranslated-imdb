The movie looks superb on the paper. <br /> <br /> A romantic comedy with a little lover being driven into smuggling, especially with this excellent romomic castle, should be a common cross gold. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that Lawrence Kasan just goes and goes for a while, though it's just a rope with two stars. Adam Brooks's script can be a good thing to blame, but better than Kevin Kland, Wanda, A Fish. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> in my heart and in my opinion, it is a part of a star. O Pink Panther remake (s!) Went to make it, so maybe it was OK ... 3/10
