I do not think it's a masterpiece of Sunset Boulevard, Double Claims, or Malta Sahin, because I'm Malice's movie copy, nor do I compare Becker with director Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer and Louis Iseel. I only have a protest against the darkness that extends this film from the beginning to the end, which often happens simply. We can understand darkness in night scenes, but this film was so dark in my sin, because I did not understand why. Nevertheless, Becker did not notice that she was in full darkness.
