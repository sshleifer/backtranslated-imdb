I came to the Hostel in 2005, but most of these naked donkeys are bad or bad - still the "Live Fodder" is my first 30 minutes. She started with many sex and sleazy settings, followed by a Chinese Organized Crime Group and some seven-legged butterfly butterflies, some of which were good death scenes ... The hero, who was hard to unleash me, was the gun and the fear of the day ... They called this movie the best I'm interested in a picture of young people who do not want to be abandoned in a two-story porn pedestrian theater, mainly as a shelter for a mafia. Only if torture was sufficiently effective, my rating would be very different. Unfortunately, some of the majority merge the rest of the film on a scene to read it as a kind of revenge scenario. Thus, basically, the low cost budget "Hostel" is abolished by the use of almost unequal sexual exploitation during the first half of the film ... Generally, do not worry about it.
