<br /> <br /> It's an astronaut, and he and another two children go to a space ship, you know? What happened to other children, though it was not something that caused radiation and then they did not come back, but our astronauts melted! No, just not burn, MELT! Like ice cream cones in July! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I am also a "melted man" I checked the handbook, because suddenly he knows to escape from the melt that he can eat human flesh, and he starts to break up people. <br /> <br /> Other characters, but one person melts and melts and melts (and melts) a movie really needs any other? What's important is that he will give the Cerebellum next time and what will leave them? How long will she not marry her? Why is this film primarily designed? Where did they get the money? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> total revenue. Makeup is irrelevant, but everything else ... SPLAT
