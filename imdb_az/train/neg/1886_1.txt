At one time, I promised not to come out of any of the films (no one from Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact), but Mr. Seidle almost succeeded. Hundstage was a really terrible experience. Everyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians are an old, gruesome bunch of old people. A world where love and humanity are not present, people are only one reason for humiliating one another - to avoid their troublesome existence. Non-professional actors (most of whom choose a documentary style similar to the Austrian shock-cartoonist Deixin imagination) Seidl wants to convince us that there is a real life in the Austrian (European West) cities. The audience faces images of sexual organs, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not a public criticism. This aesthetic is purely worthless shock. Instead, it's bad behavior, bad cinematography, bad movies. If someone needs such a movie to understand that something is wrong in our society, that person should live with invisible eyes. It is a word-social criticism with a hammer hammer. People are somewhat humiliated. It shows ugly people - I do not hate it. But it describes the average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that's why this movie really hates.
