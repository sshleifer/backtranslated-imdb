A beautiful television mini-series runs desperate to pass through as a 16-year-old woman by a 45-year-old woman! No exaggeration - the movie is ACTUAL's age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when Pearl Harbor opens before just a surprise attack. <br /> <br /> This television mini series is really the most classic example of this post, and one that I refer to when it comes to topic. <br /> <br /> It just makes it unnoticed, though the WWII 's' global' drama, which has been filmed the best, has never been televised. If there is stomach - or a good progression - you can enjoy the late Robert Mitchum with a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by some of the comments on the love story. Have they filmed the movie with their eyes? Otherwise, they are not old enough to be surprised by the "selective memories" and "selective looks". I'm not a Boomer, so I do not think I'm a little hubristic young punk. 45 ALWAYS 45. Buy this. Do this. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> The more we talk about today's mini-series, after 25 years, it's a very important and critical role Had ACTUAL ingrowing? At the moment, the recurring patcher, with old excitement, excludes the most remarkable aspects of The Winds Of War.
