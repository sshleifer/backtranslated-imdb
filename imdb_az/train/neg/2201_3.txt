Hero / Sci-Fi is as fun as this ridiculous. F / X is pretty good ... why not see it. A was prepared for the excitement of TV not as bad as the worst. Jeffrey Coombs is brilliant despite being a cheating scientist engaged in stem cell research and manipulating human DNA with a hammer shark. The terrible consequences are a hell of a murder machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a distant island to test the brilliant new experience. Of course, after laughing and shouting in fear ... Coombs's creation is so empty that his son is united with hammer, and his father's friends are hunting for one another. My intruder does not always reward. If left: Elsie Muller, G. R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
