<br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with pop star stars in this movie, rescue yourself from time to time and do not stop posting this review once you reach the end of the next sentence. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is illogical. It is an infinite sequence of happiness to tragedy, from joy to joy, expressing different feelings. <br /> <br /> You will be sick and tired until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Dramatic" event may occur. These foolish, lanky, girly stars face. <br /> <br /> Because I have spent some days in smiling, screaming, crying, mysterious, being "serious" and touching on any facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Because the "spirit" of any "work" must prove something that doubts that the trailer and countless commentary on this site can not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only this movie is just "translated", foolish minions.
