When I chose this movie for the first time, I was interested in the main idea and wanted to see what would happen. I am a fan of animated animation and I love it when it comes to live shows. However, I like the animation shown in this movie. Actors should be said to be good. Visual appearance - including animation - resembles a beautiful piece of fabric for the piece. However, this was a quality of heart failure, on the contrary, in sight and scenarios, on top of the head. The harshest thing in this regard was that it was not relatively important to the area. As you can see, the area was a horn in illicit periods, creating a massive defective impact with the movement of the piece. The sound is from Felisberton - and especially at the end - I felt as a hopeless attempt (even correctly directed) to fill the cunning gaps that would be taken into consideration as side-by-side problems. I'm afraid that all the work was best viewed as a "reasonable first attempt" by a teenager who spent a lot of time reading DH Lawrence. You do not expect anything from an experienced film maker.
