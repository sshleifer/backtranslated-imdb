Friz Frelengin's "Quick Gonzalez" was the second cartoon character after Robert McKimson's "Two" cat tail. In this cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little monster with a huge golden teeth, but the popular design with its second appearance has already been adopted. Despite the fact that it looks even better, Speedy has not become a part of a character. A great hat, big speed, and bad Mexican accents are not a classic character, and that's all for Speedy's. Nevertheless, the rude little mouse was pretty popular and, in the last few days of the studio, she performed on many shorts, including some really terrifying movies. These Early Speedy shorts are often better off than what's happening with Daffy Duck, but they still leave a lot to be desired, based on predictable gags based on a similar follow-up formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is hired by Sylvester to steal cheese from a local factory protected by other mice. In addition to transforming an extra starter into an animated film, Sylvester's role can also be easily filled with any common cartoon cats. His identity is forcing him to foresee his predicament. the main role of the follower. It was also a problem in Tweety animated films, but Speedy's vulnerable coskunessi and the inability to capture her make even the widow's rival. The weak old Sylvester would have to be seen with Speedy in the coming years. Despite the very basic formulas and minimal humor, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won the Oscars and was born a worthy star.
