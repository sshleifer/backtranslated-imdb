Unlike many, I do not find the basis and theme of this show at least insulting. However, its execution is a completely different matter. Like most B-minus films, all the worthy sticks appear to be mounted on trailers. For a very short period of 22 minutes, we look forward to any nickname of real humor. Or at least one thing to keep away from the distance or carpet fiber. A player with several exceptions; some team members may be eligible for comedy and gesticulating late night infomercial, but a primetime sitcom (even a Canadian). Although passionate about the original cultural point of view, I can not help but this is a shot shot by the CBC for copying a Corner Gas success. Unfortunately, they have received the tone - and the script - for those who are completely inaccurate. The recent insults seem to have prevented the location of a small town (Why is it hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think that the audience would be deceived by the city of Regina? Hopefully, as an honorable Canadian, this thing flies away and the rest of the world made by CBC advertisers often forget about this great embarrassment of the sitcom.
