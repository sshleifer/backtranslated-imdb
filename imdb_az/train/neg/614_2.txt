I'm watching it on Sci-Fi channel. He is so afraid that I can not ignore it! I'm not a Videographer and this movie is upsetting me. I feel bad about everyone involved with this movie. Some of the camera work is good. There are many doubts. Flick has some good players. Leader's relatives should be covered with what is too bad. The only way to be worthy in this movie! Music was better than a player. If you turn around to watch it, I hope this is another choice! It will come later (yes later) .... I think I will jump! Jason
