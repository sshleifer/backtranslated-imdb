I was 13, and I hated the film's worst movie on earth, and I was totally wasting my watch, and it looked good on the lid and back, but my mistake was wrong. but when I saw the delta, she was totally different and was a bad actress, and I did not know how old I was in the two girls that was so mixed. the film was confusing in some parts, and I did not like it, but watched all the movies to see just the best, but it was boring, boring, and BORING.and I do not think many people liked me
