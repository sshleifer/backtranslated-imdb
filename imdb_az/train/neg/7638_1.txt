He could not even bring myself to watch this movie until the end. I did not tell the whole movie and did not explain the reason why I could not see the "actors". First, they looked at most parts only strictly, and their scripts were only in the hands of the frame, but I am convinced that this is a minor issue. My main problem with actors is not really their fault ... those filmmakers! Come on, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought the young people were out in fashion in the old 20s, with a new wave they played? A older man than me is "I'm 17!" I can not watch a movie that is one of the first lines. How can anyone take it seriously? Do not be a victim of this movie, take a 90-minute walk and get nothing from this movie.
