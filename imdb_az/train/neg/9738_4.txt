Honestly, (so much worse than Hooper) is that so much? more disappointment for me. Indeed, such a creative concept that Hooper never found in economic terms and even less foggy (punla excerpt) writing. He is very trustworthy and loud, laughing and laughing, he telgrafs all the pessimistic mystery / conspiracy, and ends the whole thing. Therefore, the pacing seems pretty tedious and Brad Dourif seems cool to have an off-balanced performance despite its quirky character digging quirky intensity on his non-colored character (cool to see him in the lead role). Even though it's cheap now, there's an authorized technician. However, he wants to go beyond the ordinary idea and to squeeze in bad things (in some cases) and instead to put special effects (flames, flames) everywhere. Hooper demonstrates some chic frenetic shots (later to the end) and manipulates the camera work quickly and shake the scratching account. The performance brings together spectators with performances by William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis are small, but amusing crowd? especially Landis. Nothing is a surprise, but it is attractive.
