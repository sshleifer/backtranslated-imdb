I made a special effort to see this movie, and I was completely disappointed with the result. The script looks hopeful in the paper and the choice of actors comes with hopes - I love Pacino with a female fragrance and have met Annie Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 80's in the '70s. But I forgot how important a piece I'm going to play in a movie, and in this movie they're definitely ..... rubbish! Filmmaking sites were also attractive, but hopeless, ambitious and compelling dialogues lowered all the sub-zero levels. At the same time, I'm allergic to the world of motor racing and I'm not interested in this sport. Even the good dialogues in Love Story were better than those in this movie (and that's one thing!). I really was expecting something better than this movie and was very disappointed with the fact that I'm getting a lot less.
