A terrible life of a woman is afraid of being alive. The betrayer wants his life to die and puts him in a coffin and puts it in the basement and decides to use his phobia. Of course, B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens is the only reason to see this amateur disappointment with Delia Sheppard, a really small community and two sex scenes, Michael Berryman. And the last twenty minutes of Brink's bloody rampage are fun to watch. For example, laughable special effects are really horrible. Re-scan at "Scalps" or "Alien Dead". Of course, I do not expect cheerful fun from Fred Olsen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is very unpleasant.
