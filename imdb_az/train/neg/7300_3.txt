This film is a group of five friends who rent a cab in the woods. One of the spouses has a terrible nutritional virus. <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is a horrible film. First, it tries to be a genre at a time. Do you have to be a scary movie with a compliment, a slasher, a black comedy, or an unusual comedy? No one can say. The first is a serious scene and there is a second change, it's funny. When the movie tries to be fun, it's too soft, except for humor to end. <br /> <br /> To the end, I was very embarrassed and hated. Violence is more than scare away from the screen. At each stage, the tone is sometimes funny, sometimes scary and sometimes very casual. In fact, you see a girl who is a karate in slo-motion. What should we get from him? This girl will end up with one of the symbols. Was this funny? I dont know. <br /> <br /> Some speeches were worthy, and many were enthusiastic. I did not care for most of the characters. He was very pleased with me, but there were many things to do. As a horror movie, I did not know what I was trying to do. I could not find it laughable, intense and scary. In the end, you are indifferent, you think, "What have I just done?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
