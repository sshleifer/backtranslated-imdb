The prerequisite for filmmaking is that Nietzsche's work and identity, psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history are incomplete. Just imagine that you can not read it, describe it as demented, add crazy doctors to treat itself, play a little well, play an actor with a big mustache, show each character the strongest emphasis, show the ridiculous dreams, Another influential person who has nothing to do with is to say a few words used in his works, to discover everything possible, especially music. Spectator, stay away.
