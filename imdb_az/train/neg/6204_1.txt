Reality or violence does not always have an impact. Violence in this film is like whispering as you can. In the Great Reserve, the director has shown the ability of people to demonstrate their abilities. But what happened? Violence resembles a mix of NoÃ«'s "Returns" and Kubrick's "Clockwork Orange" ... both are remarkable films. Do not get me wrong, I do not object to violence, and I have seen some bad things in films, but this is a whole movie. The story does not develop enough to justify extreme violence, but the simple reason for the death of Robert's death is its application to drugs. Danny Dyer plays partially responsible characters for Robert's drug killing, but less than 5 minutes on the screen. Lesley Manville, Robert's mother can not cope, I'm not sure what these actors are doing in this low-caliber movie. The player is painful to watch on the wooden, TV-cooking scene in the kitchen and, for example, if his wife is not much more than the shocking record of the dialogue? In some comments, boys seem like 'smiling', but many people who want to laugh because she does not want to be bombarded with the lifeless images of crippled female genitalia. <br /> <br /> Why is there such a need to present sadistic pornographic illustrations to the director's adolescence? ... it can only surprise the young psychology. <br /> <br /> The 'political meaning' of the film has repeatedly drew our attention due to the number of scenes; in the bar, outside the house of a television chef, war reports in Iraq, perhaps in my opinion. Yes, war is severe, public disintegration is frustrating, and you are prone to frightening violent movements in politics or in the street. It's the essence of violence in people, emphasizing all of them as part of the same basic issue. <br /> <br /> My idea is derivative, badly prepared and meaningless.
