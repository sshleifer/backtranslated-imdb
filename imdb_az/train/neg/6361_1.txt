Wow this movie sucks a great deal of time. I've heard that this movie is a very good expression of friendship. And what's figured out in this movie can go wrong with all the internet hype? But the movie was just bad. It was awesome and the character's development never happened. Space Aircraft was a horrible film if it did not like the movie.
