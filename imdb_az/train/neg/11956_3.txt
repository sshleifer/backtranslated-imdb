This movie is incorrect. I did not see any movie, they gave a shock. The area was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super smooth and the actor was soft. It could have been a good movie. I think it was just based on strange visions. I usually manage graphic scenes and human taboos, but it hit me like Miike. Only a poorly executed movie. If you are not fascinated by anesthesia, pedophilia, necropolis, aggression, self-injury, parental and sexual abuse, and open scenes of najis dispersion, you should not be entertained by watching this movie. I think I sold the movie to many of you, but I said it was wrong. He succeeded in other films, but I think it would be better for someone to be pooping.
