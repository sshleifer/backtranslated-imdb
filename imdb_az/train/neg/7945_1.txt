The film is satisfied with religious etiquette and ideology, which can not create a consistent argument against any death penalty. By presenting the legal execution of the crime condemned as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film raises the homicide to Christ by martyrdom. In any case, according to the plot, God chose to fire himself as a fanatic who started a fire and killed his parents when he was defenseless. However, there is no anger for the actions of this selfish murderer. The starting character, the woman who committed suicide, is ultimately the one who succeeds in trying to get rid of this convicted murderer, but gives her life in an unsuccessful attempt. Elsewhere in the extreme ammunition, Jesus symbolically appears as a weak and desperate vagabond to overturn God's wrath. The contemporary incarnation of Christ does not only irritate him, but also teaches all religions the ideal of Christ. Humanity can not influence humanity in order to have good and unbelievable disadvantages of life waiting for human self-destruction. At the same time, a mentally unstable pregnant woman with little help from Jesus finds himself capable of reacting to a newly born soulless child, and this saves all the people from the wrath of the Gracious. I also commented on some levels as a statement to support the abortion. Wanting to make many religious issues a tension, this film does not give me any religious meaning that I can interpret clearly, apart from the beliefs of the insulting people. This creates many questions that even try to answer. It does not take into account the religious values ​​of the audience while trying to describe a version of their fulfillment. Silly
