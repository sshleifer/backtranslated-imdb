First, let me start with a friend's suggestion while watching this movie: "All of this movie was brave, you know," DUDE should NOT DIFFERENT. " With this film, they made a good effort to get this name. Impacts, of course, are poor. The plot / dialogue resembles a collage of bits stolen from every B horror film. Actors, I think, should be in college. However, parts (especially at the beginning) appear to be at high or middle school. It does not matter. Korkmaz, who continues to kill people, is not welcome at all. (SPOILER: In the end, when they sing the name of Lester and appear again, the black boy and the Cowardly laugh, probably on the final scene, are in comfort and cheats.)
