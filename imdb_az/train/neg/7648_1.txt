As a result of patriarchal and male superiority, every public disorder is considered a fashion to celebrate, but it can be an illogical "logic". But the story and the subject of the movie, there is no gray sphere and the woman who has to be called the film's antagonist is the "betrayal of the story." In any case, it can be justified. Sexuality of women in this situation is only sweet and has nothing to do with its relevance. This is betrayal in the last row. The man spent his resources and time deliberately raising the rest of the human race. Despite all this, the most controversial evidence raised by the 3 "free" female characters in the heart is miserable. There is no pretext that the sex needs of a woman are her fornication and her husband's constant betrayal and that there are no other children. So life lost her life. In some societies where justice is still prevailing, such cases lead to the execution of unfair ones.
