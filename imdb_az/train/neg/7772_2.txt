This is a low film. There is no basis yet. We do not need any motivation but wealth. Symbols are some of the worst actors to be filmed. The danger seems supernatural, but then it is managed by a three-year-old man. Why they did it; to frighten other members of the group? I dont know. There is a little fog from a smoke machine wandering around jewelers and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Is he doing something? I dont know. There are some nudity for him. I was always amazed at this old movie in this movie. In fact, things have been solved this way in these days. In any case, people work as chickens, ready for ax. They do not have a plan; there is no resource; nothing. The film has about five terrifying avalanches. Who are these people and "there" is a spirit or a devil. What happened to other people? I challenge everyone to say this with any confidence. What a bad thing.
