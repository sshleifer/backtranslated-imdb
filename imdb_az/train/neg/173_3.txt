It is not a good next, but original punch pack. Heroist writer Judd Nelson accepts new novels to manage his novel GLAVE BEAUTY. Still kills ruthlessly, but the film looks very tongue-in-cheek. It's not a fun type of humor. The overall project has a quickie quality, and sometimes Nelson goes off the top. This is a script that is rewritten before you go to the screen ... it happened in that script.
