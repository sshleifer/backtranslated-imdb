"Re-imagine" is a great word. Is not the murderer called MMW (2004) called Dawn? A really clever word - hides the word "repetitive" that everyone hates, and almost sounds like creativity and imagination. Yes, curse, I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> However, why can you re-create a reaction? "The director really does it for a number of reasons: for a modern audience to refresh a movie or to personally love the original and make a tribute, but if that is the case, I usually accept (I accept exceptions) It stops: someone stealing and rebuilding (or "re-imagining") anyone who does not see or do not understand will pay money to see it, such as Coles '/ Cliffs' notes, a blender poke everything, even more surprising and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In fact, we can get the chaos of the zombie genocide Romero minimalist We have seen the city in ruins, in thousands of zombies: chaos and death, two remarkable things on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not the place to go. The film is about to do almost every remake. It adds more to everything than character, atmosphere and story. It is silent, (in some sense) bloody, and full of visible key symbols to die in the unhappy land. The center of the story and the important role of the original film is entirely coincidental. This idea went right here with the pure ecstatic joy of being a mall in the Romero movie. In addition, this "re-imagine" moxie, there is no spirit, no ball. It's probably something that does not pay attention to the audience and is not afraid to make us interested in characters or stories (probably very rightly). The film fled and missed the quieter interaction of the four characters of the original. In fact, you were paying attention to the people in the Romero version, because despite the horror of the shopping center there was a certain realism. <br /> <br /> What is the situation in the Caucasus? </ P> <p> Film is not scary. There is one or two "jumping" scenes and the rest of them want to prepare with high sound effects. As a story, it is really much more follow-up and conflicts between symbols have developed very little to keep it. Humor is also reduced by a few liners (and really good character: Andy). What is left after that? An extremely ridiculous and extremely low end to the unhappy, inevitable uncertainty of the original film. However, it should be remembered for something that is pretty bad (though not quite as bad as some other remakes): This Passion of Christ threw the number one spot in the box office. Zombies doing good deeds.
