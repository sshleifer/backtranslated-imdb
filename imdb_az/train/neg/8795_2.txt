I've seen almost no quality in this movie. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's misfortune ... There were some attractive women in this movie, and maybe this is a good quality. But in general, I found this movie true and ridiculous. The handheld film, combined with gentle motion and other kinematic gimmicks, was gloomy and pretty, even painful. Generally, the music was terrible and overwhelming, even reminding me of a military psychological warfare against the various officers. <br /> <br /> The film's set-up and non-fulfillment of various vignettes have not been settled in their content and "results". A painful movie (not a protected word for true art, not a true movie) left me with a bad feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the content, form and outcome of this film is unblocked, of course, though it is an isolated element of that film, do not believe in the various people who want to try and throw it as a "romantic comedy". <br /> <br /> Despite IMDb's and other rating sources' seemingly positive views, it offers to stay away.
