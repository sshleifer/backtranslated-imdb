I think I'm watching this movie, but I do not quit but though I'm asleep while watching it, "I can keep my excitement and imagination." At least I know that soon I will not be watching him again. Or always. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about the elder ... It's really naked. Completely naked. It will not even reach the age of six. It basically had no dramatic effect. Zil√ß. Nada. Only lock is turned upside down. Comedy? Should this be a comedy? <br /> <br /> If we were to suffer terrible injuries just like the Foreigners' Critters movie, we would be forced to make human beings a bit deeper. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It's a good idea. It is not worth the effort. Find something more interesting. It's like drying the paint. Or fall asleep.
