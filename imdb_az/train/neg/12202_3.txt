Rightly, it has never been "The First Part of the Blood II". "The First Blood," the original violin film, John Rambo, committed suicide at the end of the film, but not because the producer wanted to continue, but the test audience was changed to allow it to live, not because they found the exact end. Nevertheless, as the one who is openly thought, the character ended up as the protagonist of the two films in the eighties and the fourth paid hero in the past. <br /> <br /> The official title of this film was "Rambo: The First Part of the Blood II", but it is known as "Rambo". It begins with the character of the hood in prison, which is likely to be the case in the "first blood", although it is never clear. Former Command Officer Colonel Trautman is being jailed for a secret job. Rambo will return to Vietnam to investigate reports of American soldiers still captured by the Communist regime. He is under great strict limits not to attempt to save prisoners or engage in hostility; <br /> <br /> <strong Your mission is a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends to prove that the mission is no American soldier in Vietnam. However, this part will improve relations between the US and Vietnamese governments, as partly facilitating their lives. Unfortunately, Rambo for Murdock, Americans are still kept in hell, not just prisoners. Certainly, he is a hero for their fate, and he tries to save them. The rest of the film is a long and long battle between Rambo and several allies (including a beautiful Vietnamese girl) and badly funny soldiers and Russian allies. Of course, despite the fact that the number of deaths is less than 67, I was surprised to learn from the trivia section, but most of the bad deeds were lost. Sometimes Rambo is the Vietnamese army. <br /> <br /> The tone of this movie differs from the first one. Rambo was undoubtedly a criminal, though in the first blood, his responsibility for his crimes was reduced with severe sabotage and mental instability. This is the American hero in Rambo. A few years ago, director George Pan Cosmatos prepared the "Cassandra Crossing," an illusory part of the "bloody anti-American propaganda" from the left. But when Cosmatos was not versatile, nothing had happened, and proved that Rambo could turn his hand into the pro-American propaganda, which was right-wing. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> The political opposition movement was controversial when it was partly responsible for the problems faced by Vietnamese vets in adjusting civilian life, but at least film wars, social attitudes towards war, and roots of violence in society. "Rambo", on the contrary, has few advantages, except that the exception sections are implemented to satisfy those who want something good enough. In fact, this is a fantasy of sexual revenge for Americans without wounding the Vietnam War. Rambo is fighting again in a single fight and this time winning the right. Take it, Charlie Cong! <br /> <br /> At this point, I realized that the fans of the movie (and many more than 2000 voters already given ten stars) understood that I was a liberal comic darling pinko. I do not get away from it - in fact, I always chastised Communism as an insulting ideology. The thing I do not like about the film is its politics, not the sensitivity and the solution of all problems, including ideological disputes, to extinguish all weapons and kill and kill as many people as possible. There is no attempt to understand the political convergence of Southeast Asia, or anyone in the region is not an American. For all anti-communism, the film is a good thing to drown Communists themselves, and accept all the world's problems as capitalism, or imperialism, or revisionism, or any other name. Compared to "Rambo", "Green Berets" was a spectacular part of the political analysis. 3/10
