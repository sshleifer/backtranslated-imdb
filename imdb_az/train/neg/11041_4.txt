The show is average. It does not particularly laugh at me. However, I think Courtney really brings it down. It does not seem natural. There are three ways to talk to all his robot. He speaks silently (with no intonation), speaks normally (with no intonation), or does what he has just started talking and gradually begins to shout. But it looks like "I'm shouting that I should not be too loud in ablution." <br /> <br /> She knows this cute actress who has done this funny thing and constantly knows himself. This is boring. You can not really get his identity because he really does not emotion and is not disappointed. There is this husband who has done all these stupid things and has no reaction to it. Very dry and straight-moving.
