Actually, really well-done Canadian-German joint production, always beautiful Rosanna Arquette plays a certain actress with her teenage daughter's "problem kid" term - a few uears descendants before the "act" in which the child was killed by his father. Now she has moved to North America, but there is a problem with her child's mother. <br /> <br /> As long as Mandy Schaeffer (his daughter) kills more people than he is - he has repeatedly written the inaccurate script, unnecessary direction and terrifying music (for the first time ever looking at the bikini do not show any clothes, do not help); we need to find his sexual and fright, but he counts both counts. Not only is it bad enough to be almost entirely noticeable and even bad (Arquette and Schaeffer are not really happy to be as mother and daughter), but also deserve condolences for Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, <br /> <br /> One of the first production companies is one of the top quality international films - three-hour 'Love'. , Lies And Murder "(in short, from Volunteers)" had to be such a "joke" loan.
