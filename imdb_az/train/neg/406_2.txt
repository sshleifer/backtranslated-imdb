The filming of this film has always been about incredible graphics that led to the disappearance of Kevin Bacon. Unfortunately, they stopped there. The script should disappear, then give it a clever set, and eventually continue with every visible element of this movie. Because there is nothing else to show. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe were listed as a credit for this movie. I do not think they really exist. I think these scripts have been downloaded in "Scripts-R-Us", where you get a standard blank "Monster Movie" script and you just fill in the gaps. Waiting for a monster. Let's not split. (In fact, "share" in this movie). Hit Alien / Giant-mistake / Monster / Invisible man suddenly. I still do not die. The burning large rabbit / shark / unseen man does not burn. I still do not die. You know, standard things. The least number of elements that are related to an invisible human film (such as IR eyewash, painting, etc.) is also poorly designed. <br /> <br /> It's a sad thing to have an interesting movie for that. The psychological issues on the subject, the worsening of the mentality of the process, the treatment of an invisible subject, and many other ideas, usually less than 2 seconds, would be more interesting. Without Kevin Bacon's desire to save, it would be a better movie. <br /> <br /> I will mention some of the most stupid elements in the film, but I do not want any spoiler. It is enough to say that these symbols are such a fool, that they do not think about putting the plug on a machine ...
