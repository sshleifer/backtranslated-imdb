The never-ending rage of intelligent visual styles does not necessarily produce an attractive movie. <br /> <br /> Half of the film, half of the "blond fly", could not have been very much appreciated by the producers. <br /> <br /> Wong Faye is more appealing than half (Karen Carpenter looks very entertaining, Faye Wong). While all the ingredients are there, the rich storytelling member who meets the girl will sit on the back of craftsmanship. Character development is uneven. Emotion is incomplete. For famous lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Canton version of Cranberry's Dreams hit) is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called "Zhen Tuo". Both the CD and the Mung Jung Yun film were found on the official movie soundtrack CD.
