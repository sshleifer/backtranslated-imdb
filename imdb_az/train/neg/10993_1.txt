Of course, we all love it as bad movies and we really love them. But even if it were not a sinful pleasure, it was simply twisted. Perhaps, a highly esteemed man offers a great idea to make a movie when he is drunk / high, and is a great idea to shoot. Then he began showing the script to the same degree as high / drunken. Generally, this movie was predictable and unoriginal, before it could last about 20 minutes. It serves as Citizen Kane looks like. Bat Man? WTF ... A man walking around with a bat, the original is original. It's almost as good as he calls him Fat Man and rides around an oily man in a superhero outfit.
