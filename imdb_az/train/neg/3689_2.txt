The main aspects of his subsequent stages in Superstar films were a movie and a lacuna from the next. A good-looking star of Southern Indian cinema, Father's backgrounds, was great. <br /> <br /> Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he has played in Tamil as a hero for 11 years has been eleven. All this was a great hit. Many thought had an appearance that could not be easily abolished. <br /> <br /> However, after Padayappa (1999), he was now in a state of hibernation. He was ready to watch all kinds of movies around the world, especially in South India, with superstars. Thus, the Tamil cinema decided to come with Dad. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers thought that the fans would get everything they did with Superstar. But that did not work clearly in this film. As usual, the awareness of the media and the expectations of fans were beyond the limitations. <br /> <br /> Rajinikant's description was completely damaged. Fans turned out to be nuts. The movie collection did not meet the expected level. The response of great people has dropped. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was the song by A. R. Rahman. He knows that he has developed good music for bad movies like Rehman, Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu. Well, I never thought that this movie would be part of this league. <br /> Because the film is bad, you feel very much because it goes from a superstar image. It took him about five years to completely restore two films with Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give back the viewers to a superstar movie.
