My dear ... Peter Sellers, was one of the most bizarre talented actors. But after 1964, the selection of films was very unsuccessful. He did not realize how to use his talents. The film world would have been better than Kubriks who worked harder. <br /> <br /> Only the "Nine Science Optimists" and "The Being" were influenced by what I saw in subsequent films. <br /> <br /> Behold, Boultings and Sellers have already shot several films. it sounds so bad - yet "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - At least the sellers use a degree of degree. However, "My Soup is a Girl" is a really poor movie and a terrific choice of character in the Sellers section. In films of 1955-64, you can usually expect at least a lot of ingenuity and always a mysterious condemnation in his roles. Here, Peter Sellers tries to play a typical romantic device. This is not a sellers selling a nevin cad is joviality. She certainly does not agree, she can try or create an interesting character. <br /> <br /> He spoke about Qafqaz University's famous playwright and comedy roles, Cary Grant. This is an easy, attractive romance developed by William Powell and Myrna Loy. This is very artificial, the whole way - I know that it is part of the character of Danvers, it is a dry victim of the ladies, but this will not really change in a convincing way. Sellers also have a very scrupulous playing "charm" ... this feature does not really have depth and really does not win the audience's sympathy and interests. <br /> <br /> Remembering "glory" in "Lolita" at a double session, it is impossible to think in the least possible way. <br /> <br /> Of course, they do not seem to have the slightest impression or impression. This is one of the most kinematic, unbiased, mistaken and lightweight dreams I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Price: - * 1/2 / *****
