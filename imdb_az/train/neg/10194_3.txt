The 30-minute documentary of Buñuel, one of the poorest parts of Spain in the early 1930s, is one of my weakest films. First, let's say that after 70 years, Spain is still richer (and, while saying this, richness, excessive individualism, and consumerism, it can take on the problems of a better situation than extreme poverty). And if poverty was eliminated in Spain, it was equivalent to western European style capitalism, not by the type of socialism that Bünual did. But the shocking thing about the movie is that at one scene, the author teaches Pi to children if he / she studies at school. Teach math to the weak, horror! Buñuel's lack of compassion, despite the fact that it does not realize that it is reaching the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor to cope with their situation. What suggests? What exactly these children teach at school? Does not it mean that this is not a modern technology that makes them poorer than any other human?
