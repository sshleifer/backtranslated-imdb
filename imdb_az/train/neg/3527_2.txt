it did not seem that it was a great fear of the place - prisoners finding magic books! claustrophobic ensues from terrorism and so on. <br /> <br /> But not a story to go along with a great idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < nothing was killed except for the number. <br /> <br /> Loss of good characters, which is a good thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a low budget does not hurt it, the movie actually does not go anywhere, it needs a Hollywood remake. you just do not care about this version. As with red / brown red teas that are at least as anticipated / entertaining, other French films like the last few years can not be seen in the same league as the malefique, to the point of being honest. and you can guess the end before watching the movie. it is not really possible to recommend frustration.
