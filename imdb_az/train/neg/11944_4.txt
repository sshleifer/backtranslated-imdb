I thought this was a sad sad thought in 1959 when I saw it as a child. It was not. Therefore, I was delighted to see marginal, poor character development, and, most importantly, failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... The "Flanders dog" is just one "edge" approaching the film. Get the 1959 version!
