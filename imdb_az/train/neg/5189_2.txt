If only one simple thing to do, this series would be better: Made by Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. The Diamond Head needs one that manages the role of the beloved beloved, as he proves what McShane can do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the true Diamond Head, really plays just that role. McShane is not as good as a bad guy tree. The character of Nuyen of France, Tso-Tsing, does not think he is an unfaithful victim or a difficult and defective woman. When he owed Diamond Head's role as his lover, he really financed his pay. After watching an episode or two, I did not know what happened to everyone. The tree gives us much to hate us, but Diamond's head resembles it. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, the spy genus was not like the 1960s.
