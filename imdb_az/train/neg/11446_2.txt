My family and I have shown the previous night to "Underdog". And bad as the Underdog (my four year old liked), Hot Rod Oscar looks like a decent material. The only thing that can save this movie is that Evel himself began to apologize for taking the film for Samberk. We can say that sound was good. Is the movie set up in the 80's, but am I convinced that most of the music from Europe? Who knows. If I was you, I'd give you a link. And just stay home and follow the test sample on your local TV station. Otherwise, people affected will be able to do so.
