A whistling slap like a comedy. Elvis Presley, the government's suits, runs an Indian choking champion just because the family has spent a lot of money on the livestock (a caring groom's need), leaving the rodeo to stay home in the state of Arizona. . Peter Tewksbury has some kind of novel skills despite the director's needs, although he is in some comic scenarios in unfounded comedies (his social commentary is not exactly marked) but Tewksbury has a satirical twist on his own. Despite the colorful support of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the world war is over, and there are many hoops and holes to satisfy many interests. As for Elvis, she is ready for a hobby and a shift - and it's nice to see her screen fun, but at this point she has to be surprised that she does not just give up her films. One picture is similar to hell and although alcohol is high, income is very low. * From 1/2
