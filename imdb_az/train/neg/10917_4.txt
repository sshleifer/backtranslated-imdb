I'm a fan of Columbo on a rainy Saturday, and am enjoying seeing Oscar Verner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very small. The original plot and ground folds were open and were predetermined several years before today's contemporary detective instructions. But it was fun to see the innocent divan patterns and "contemporary" electronics and, of course, compelling suburban amusements in modern art. The high-tech home is Tomorrowland's Jetson or Disney version, and they are forced to think of the authors who invent "road gizmos". <br /> <br /> If you play outside the sun, the game is better Columbo episodes. Nevertheless, we should be grateful for the cable TV that these episodes have been broadcast.
