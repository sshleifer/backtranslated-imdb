One of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen (ney, worst movies). Boy (acting as a phone psyche) should behave as gay to move to the apartment with the woman of the dream. Not Hilarity. There is no tension, light gey-bashing, and terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> When you read Brad Meltzer, you will love this movie, like his malicious dialogue. <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. If you see it, destroy the copy.
