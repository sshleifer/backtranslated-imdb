This is a movie showing that mood, music and tissue are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the audience looks at many beautiful scenes in Los Angeles in the 1930s - I especially like the tramway approaching the tunnel and the rampant tramway in the hillside - but this beautiful cinematography defeats itself because "something will happen" creates a mood and nothing . The scenario also continues to focus on some subjects or actions or traumas. Even the subject of the movie (I imagine) do not surrender, the main mistake of the characters. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? So, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. Her character was very good fashion and played perfectly, I wanted to watch it on the camera.
