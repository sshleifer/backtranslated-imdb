I think it's always problematic to bring a novel to the big screen. <br /> <br /> This is the only positive thing I can say about strange adaptation. A beautiful book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south like no one else. He was a paradise, a religious Catholic and a very talented writer. In his first novel, he created a dark and deeply troubling story of faith, doubt and salvation, with a miraculous and strange betrayal. The heroes in the book may seem strange to those who have not been to the south of the village, but I can assure them that such people exist. It's not just the creatures, but the people who have families, the emotions and the worries of everyone. Flannery's intentions were often wrong - he did not lampooning the zealots of the backyards - he saw what was the most fierce, worried and even amazing thing that matter was called 'grace'. "Wise blood" should be scared to read, and should be washed with a sense of nearness. <br /> <br /> As a result, we have to think long and hard about our thoughts and preconceptions. <br /> <br /> None of these is John Huston's adaptation to Gilligan Island. There is no. This is a Persian. It's a bad fancy. The whole film is saturated with a hauteur returning to the stomach. Acting is weak, the southern accents are fraudulent and insulting. Cinematographers do not give any thought to the idea of ​​religious paradise. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose has reduced gags and cheap, amateur theater. Soundtrack is a blend of heales silliness and cheeseball electronics that is not compatible with the story or movie "Clockwork Orange". I was admitted to this movie for free and it was almost gone. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views, and when I was raised deep in the south a year ago I went to the north and looked back. But it is a beautiful place filled with charming people (like everywhere in the world) and in this movie, the animated film, which is attacked by paratroopers and their attitudes, is mocked. <br /> <br /> After meeting her husband, most of this film goes through the line. <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk about an artist's work - I do not know John Huston, and I am convinced that he is a sincere and competent filmmaker who confirms his reputation in the film history. I read (and love) Flannery O'Connor's work with my thoughts clearly. So I do not want to come from another perspective. Maybe it works for classrooms as a stand-alone movie. But for the fans of Flannery O'Connor - and I can add to the gentlemen who respect it and all the lane - this movie is time consuming.
