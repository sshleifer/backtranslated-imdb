I saw a horror movie. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, a film shoots. So low-cost, low-cost movies can be good. Something strange is definitely cheap. But it is very small. I still do not yet understand what the karate field really has to do with the movie. Too strangely enough to offer something. Do yourself pain!
