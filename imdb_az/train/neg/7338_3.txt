I watched this movie hoping to find a wonderful and interesting story, but the story line was not entirely good. <br /> <br /> Of course, despite the fact that Shahrukh Khan was there, it was not enough to make the film "safe" and interesting. <br /> <br /> If this film is based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary, <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a good time to waste my time and worsen our mood. <br /> <br /> So you are the type of movie you need to run away and you do not have to appreciate it because you do not have to rate it! If you want a "dark movie" with a "strange and non-story story", you will not miss time.
