I really did not want to watch it. Before I began to watch him, he even seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie that did not hurt me, since I do not think he is so close to being a filmmaker. One reason for this is the appearance of Shahrukh Khan in the film. I did not know what the movie was about because it would be just a fairy tale. So, I thought Rishi Kapur would be his father or uncle between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti. My full shock Rishi Kapoor is really hero! A man who made the novel of young Divya! <br /> <br /> Just ask me again: why at the age of 17, dropped to the old beautiful Divya, Rishi Kapur, for 40-plus long hair, full, swollen piglet? Rishi Kapoor is ashamed to take this part; The only thing he does is laugh at him. Her daughter was a romantic girl who could be more logical and even worse - she acts as a teenager for forty years. It only pops up to make it even more irritable ... <br /> <br /> To clarify everything, I have no problems with those who are romantic romantic women who are very small. There is no problem when they create a persuasive couple. In fact, the leading actors have always been replaced by young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi, Mithun Ã‡akraborty-Madhuri Dixit, Shahruh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and have made the pairings pretty good. Also, I do not have anything against Rishi Kapur, and I think he is a good actor, and Bobby's movement is still well carved in my heart, but it is said in the film that Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan or Aamir Khan is looking at. <br /> <br /> It was such a disappointment. Oh, and because Shahrukh Khan really made a good debut for everybody watching this movie. Very few of it managed to do it. The late Divya Bharti also made a debut debut. If you just want to watch this movie, just enter the second half. Personally, I would not.
