I saw this movie in early preview and I can not say how bad this movie is. The audience began with Pacino's charming southern accent. The weak Al could certainly have looked at the truth and could not decide whether it was part of a role of a publicist who was charged with drug addiction, and maybe he did not dream before coming to support. But worse than Pacino's drawings, it's an accidental plot for a plot. In the early film, Pacinho's characters are gay, and I suspect that the scriptwriter first initiated it. But then we have to stop our incredible and believe that this tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleeping roles) are thrilling people with ridiculous accent after this old, half-dead image. The worst part was the rope that was never associated with any corporate espionage, which was never publicly disclosed, and was never the primary focus area that never cared for the most. Because this was a preview, I would reassess and edit my probability because it is reserved for my final judgment, but will pay a percentage to see in these theaters that you can bet.
