I always thought that a good movie should have a field. This particular movie was missing and I feel that it would be more effective with a plot. It was even worse that it lasted forever; I'm worried that this would finally end. But I noticed that it was only about 123 minutes long; I felt like 4 hours. There was only one thing, but the film did not have a noticeable confrontation. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was "Fast and Strange". So, this research is not one that needs anything other than a single action. I really hate today's most acting movies; Only this film is the whole way on the other side of the spectrum. There is really nothing in this movie. But the decor and suits were beautiful.
