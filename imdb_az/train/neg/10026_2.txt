Because it was a beautiful star for me, I was hoping for a movie, and it was the return of Akshay and Saif's prayer. It would be nice if I was afraid to watch this movie because it was done by the same person who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; But if compared to Dhoom 2 Tasan, I can say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I first saw credits, I felt fine because it's a wonderful thing. Yes, the first scene itself is bad. Then, the main drawback of the film is the movement schemes. They laugh at me and our friends by watching these fierce battles. Akshay faced about 30 murders, and all slys have even found a machine gun! The Prophet (pbuh) said: "O you who believe!" <br /> <br /> Some of the films have been recalled. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing that's worth the movie is that it's really hot sexually sexy. For this, from 10 to 2. <br /> <br /> Kids, Please Please ... please ... do not think this is a real gangster movie. <br /> <br /> Behold, you can watch it for some of the laughs in terrible battlefields. <br /> <br /> All this.
