It rebuilds the evil and poverty of the classic Parinaeta of Bimalda. The story is based on the same book of Sarat Chandra and is a distortion of the original. It assesses a good creativity rate, but is not a creativity creator. Everyone's movement is affected and the whole movie is something. In the use of Sheer's father, Lolita (Balan), the choice of words is cheap and morbid, and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, Shekhar (Saif) is in a mood of a movie scene and a mysterious scene, and it is very emotional for his emotions and could easily be avoided. Likewise, it is cheap to attract sexual scenes and spectators between Saif and Balan. When a creativity is not true to the original, and the soul is destroyed, the job falls apart. The song "Piyu Bole" is pretty good. In the dark cloud of this film, another silver lining is a scene for Saif himself and his rebels against his father. This is a positive separation from the original and dignified loan. This film deserves 3 stars. Craft performance with dance and dance and a sheep. The song is tuneful, but I remember that I had heard somewhere earlier, and if I did not make a mistake, this melody was worked out. <br /> Well, after the deal has changed, the times have changed. But this film is not contrary to the modern era. <br /> <br /> Modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly surprised by the NRIs and capturing the profitable NRI entertainment market. Such films do not belong to India or any other part of the world.
