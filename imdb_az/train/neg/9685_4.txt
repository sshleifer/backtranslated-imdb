I know you, but I just hit the "ART" cinema. In my opinion, Peter Greenaway's first 'art' film, which I can get his title of "The Cook, The Thief, his wife and lover," has turned my mind and creativity into extortion. The film was a beautiful and strange paradox ... it was a "cinema of art", exploring intellectual ideas and bringing it visually. Life, a real life, may be living in an article, and art shows what it is. I love all kinds of movies, but especially those who are fun and also say something, whether I agree with her or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMAN" is a dry, father and son the clinical 'comedy' that Harem collected for creating many sexual fantasies. There are only a few short details on Fellini in the film, unlike what the preview offers. The main purpose of the film is to have a "close" relationship between a father and a son coming together after the mother's death. In the first scenes of the movie, the fathers' dreams are convincing, you can feel the pain. What happened later is Greenaway's standards, harem gathering, observations of love and death, and bodies for the body ... One may claim that, but I feel the movie is shallow and meaningless. And the idea that this can be a comedy is surprising to me. Best of all, especially those who are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (Mandy should put off his clothes even though it is flawless). The lack of a movie is very nice to watch other films, not a charming story or ordinary Greenaway. <br /> <br /> Understanding moments and casual taboo, "8 1/2 Woman" is cut off and adhered to as art, is considered funny "funny" and is simply too boring <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
