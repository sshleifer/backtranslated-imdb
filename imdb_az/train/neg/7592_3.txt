1930 is the golden age of Los Angeles with the film industry and the other potential of being rich, celebrated and happy. People hoped to fulfill their desires. Only a few people awaiting open arms and waiting for their greetings are condemned for starvation, embarrassment and unwanted endeavor, seeking a little respect in the barn bars and bad hotels. <br /> <br /> A young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandini comes to LA with a similar research to spread her appeal around to write a perfect novel that can get one of these beautifully-wealthy women and his career. has written a story published in a dark anthology so far. Even though he wants to create a romantic masterpiece, it may seem unable to produce anything, but sometimes he sends magazine stories to members of the local press. He is proud of presenting himself as an Italian, but deeply feels his heartfelt Italian burden. The courage to conquer small money and once the world has gone a long time and looks at a foolishness that holds the last nickel to spend his imagination. <br /> <br /> The coffee he brought to him was cold and wounded, and he fell into a curse, an insult, an unexpected excuse, and an undercover love. Although Camilla is an uneducated girl trying to get married by her marriage, she has a heavy cross of non-promising race heritage. Although he is a stronger and more experienced person, the situation like a beautiful Mexican woman is more difficult than the realization of Arturo. <br /> <br /> Arturo finally gets inspired to work with novels? Is it possible for their love to finally find the place of the sun? <br /> <br /> It is surprising to learn that the two main characters prepared by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell did not work with chemistry. Communication has no raw and original feelings. Hayek is a character, although Farrell has forgot to forsake Camilla with her passion and strength. It's hard to believe a character that is clever, but uneducated and uneducated, using very difficult vocabulary and difficult sentences. A more rigid character of the kind of Phil Marlowe, though striking in a period costume, will fit better with Farrell, who appears to be too absorbing in finding a fragile world of a twenty-year-old dreamer who is balanced between the desire for a secret love and desire . <br /> <br /> Embarrassed feelings are not true following the two on the screen. Their relationship could have been wild, but more likely, the thunder and lightning were not storm-free, true passion, but feelings that were not felt inside. Unfortunately, an interesting article and a good potential of the actors were wasted, and often turned into a gray average.
