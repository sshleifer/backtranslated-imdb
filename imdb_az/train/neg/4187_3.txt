A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale," is far less than a 87-minute music video that has been tagged with a song by a songwriter. <br /> <br /> It is said that the film is based solely on words related to youth social politics, and describes the story as the act moves. <br /> <br /> The effect of the Hell's exit and the flawless grainingess picture equates the Young's leaving home for some of his home movies and public consumption. Although it is claimed to be a "story" in the movie, there is no doubt about what happens because of the unprecedented appearance of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur neglect of the players. All the young people we have acquired within eighty-seven minutes are aged hippies who are quietly rejuvenated through a story that is not related to each other. All this becomes a weak exercise in self-confidence. "Greendale" off-Hollywood's low-budget movie is bad.
