On July 4, they played at the Twilight Zone marathon, which took the worst "Twilight Zone" Episode I ever saw. You can not completely sync with the rest of the array. Although the Twilight Zone is quite an uneven range and although many episodes ended up being awesome predictors, it was completely grounded. <br /> <br /> Compare this with the legendary episodes like "A Stop in Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun" and you understand that there is no comparison. Buster Keaton did his best with this kind of material and clearly surprised me that part of his historical comedy squad will rise to this episode. He needs some money, though he has made some effort ... there is no other explanation.
