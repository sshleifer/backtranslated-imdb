Last weekend I saw this movie and it was foolish and stupid. Ancient curse turns people into mummy in pajamas? The victims were awe-inspiring and could not escape the slow-moving old man. Instead of burning torches and swaying to protect it, or duh, it burns. Quentin alias married Honeymooners, Mr Fabersham, Miss Canfield named Diane Brewster, and released to the fame of Beaver, the happiest of marriage. Wow, love area. The remainder resembles the graves and helps them to react to the shouting. The Egyptian girl is not looking bad, she does not lend a lot to the film. Where is the mummy? Indeed, only a curse has been opened. It does not hold at least a torch for Universal Mummy movies. If you need to sleep, watch this movie.
