I was laughing when I saw a reviewer compare it with LOTR. Well, if dwarfs, thousands of castings, great special effects, big battles, strong characteristics, decent machinations, good players, classic direction and everything else. Which will leave you in the walk. And boy, is this movie going on? If Mr. Piano had set off, it would certainly be a three-hour interrupted squatter in Wisconsin, but every 40 minutes or a pounding Martians took a few seconds and took another few seconds. You did not see a lot of picnics in a movie. If it really had a budget of $ 20 million, most would have to go to Mr Piano shoes, because he had to go through many couples with all his marches. Good effects explain that there is no money left for a decent video camera or relevant actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish videos for people who have long walks in their suits. <br /> <br /> According to the famous philosophy philosophy, it was wrong to put the Martians in the film: they are just walking on the road. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the director is much more interesting than the story.
