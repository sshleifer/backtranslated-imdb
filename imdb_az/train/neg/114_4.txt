It is not cast. A better team player, you could not find it. It is not his perception. The director is in love with the New York City and we are all up to the end of the movie! Woody Allen was unable to develop Bogdanovic as he did here. Manhattan is the place to go if you are going to be in love or in love. No, the problem with the movie is a script. There is none. Players are in love at first glance, words are unnecessary. What happens when they go to work in a band in Hollywood's own experience. This is a reality for him and his peers, but it is a dream for many of us in the real world. So, at the end of the movie, it is empty, and shallow and the message is less.
