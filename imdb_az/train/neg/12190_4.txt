Scorsese is bad. Medium Voltage; The only thing that recommends it is psychic playing De Niro. The finale is usually above the genre, ie, does not interfere with one another, and it is another person who is immune to immunity. I have not liked the original of the 60s and this version is not a very good thing. I have no idea why he forgot about Scorsese's time. Nevertheless, considering how bad his latest films are, this is not so bad compared to this dashing Buddhist film and his new favorite actress, blonde girl Di Caprio. And considering that you want Spielberg to be rebuilt, it could have been very bad.
