I have not read Shirley Jackson's novel, and for some time there is something very important to me. I'm sure that this film should be scared. I remember when I looked at jumping one day, even though I could not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very great and I've looked at the DVD, but I'm sure the theater should have a nice look. <br /> <br /> I thought this film should be based on at least the classic novel, so it should be a good story. but that did not happen. I was basically deprived of looking at the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie because there was nothing to watch. Lili Talor was such a character. I did not like her a bit, sad people about something. Also, the man in this film recalled cartoonist Dudley DoRighti with his voice and face. Could not relate to heroes. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. </ P> <p> The Scream Queenish movie! There are at least a fun type. If there are no stories, at least they fill them with fatal or attractive women. It was nothing. <br /> <br />
