I have seen this night in another film and have to say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Acting is fair, but the plot is absolutely funny. A murderer is born on the grounds of "all the energy used to make a film" and if the film is burned, the killer dies? How incredible is it? The heroes were less developed to say at least ... for example, at one point, "Do you try to finish the movie because she can not get her?" So, are we planning to go along with it? We did not think that the movie was half daughter. The film really did not pay attention to anyone, and we did not know anything about the survivors except Ringwald, the actress of a man, after the death of a man, and wanted to be a director like Raffy's mother. It is not a diving to know who it is. What we saw just ran to kill. The entire plot is completely weak for my taste, and I'm very disappointed. Anyone who likes this hell, of course, should learn something about the film structure. I do not believe everyone will be able to star in this picture and even be happy to work. It's not funny, it's not scary and has closed the entire movie. I saw that I predicted before every scene, so it was not difficult for me. This is a disgrace and I'm sorry for an hour and a half watching this evil. 1/10.
