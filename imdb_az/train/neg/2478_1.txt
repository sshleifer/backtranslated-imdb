This film is S-L-O-W. <br /> <br /> Most of the film was waiting for the start of some films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But, <br /> <br /> The solution was consumed by a more intense, lightweight hunter than the original Wendigo, who gave a very short look to the end. movie This was a strange blend of 'Wendigo' just a tree and a stag, and it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The little boy's parents seemed too far away and sometimes seemed to have been completely separated from his son. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad move or a bad scrip, but I'm not sure, but it has raised my imagination and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to think. Wendigo's air reminds me of the dull film shown at the award ceremony. <br /> <br /> The end of Mr. Bean's Holiday: an artistic and unusual movie, trying hard to be profound and meaningful, but in an ambitious and boring way. <br /> <br /> I will never want to watch it again. I just waited for the latter to hope that something might be in the heart ... but he did not do it.
