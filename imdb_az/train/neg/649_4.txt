Okay, this film was for just one reason and for one reason just to make money. Manufacturers did not really think of killing a classic horror movie. When I realized that this movie would be a pg-13, I knew how many pg-13 slasher films came out well? How many women are asking for a month? The answer is NOT NONE! The prom night was not a masterpiece in 1980, but of course deserved to be regarded as a genre of genre, and deosnt is trying to do something more. <br /> <br /> The problem with the night of the night of 2008 is the way to capture the murderer and with it there are three main problems ... <br /> 1) He runs away, locked in a mental institution and escapes from a ventilator! WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT? Why is there a ventilation air in the patient's room? Do they want him to be comfortable or comfortable? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain as to whether the killer is the murderer of all the family and friends of the main victim, so he can give everything to himself, he says he loves, but when he tries to kill him wants to kill the next minute, love him or just hurt him? 3) The killer is very good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so the mother did not see the victim in a place where her boyfriend killed, mostly sleeping and did not notice it, all horrible 10 stars, 10 terrifying, foolish, stupid fears film
