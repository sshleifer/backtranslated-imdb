I do not know what other people think. The basis for this film was independently feared. You can become a great believer as you want ... Most of this film is a stupid act. I feel I was insulted by watching the first 40 minutes. And it was just a small feat. Not just a terrible toy, but the plot is not near to development. There are countless holes in the story, and even hardly anymore, you can tell a story. I have not read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is my first review here and it is only to save half an hour of life to the audience. I do not remember the last time I can not watch a movie. It really gets a cake.
