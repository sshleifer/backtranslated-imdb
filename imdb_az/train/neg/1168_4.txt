I have seen Ryuhei Kitamura's work a lot and come to the conclusion that he has a skill to action. The scenes combine elements of kinetic and often martial arts, combat battles and samurai battles fighter camera fights on effective screenshots. Versus and Aragami demonstrated Kitamura's creativity and showed that he had less than the ability to work on a budget. What happened at "Alive"? There would be a response to becoming a corner - nothing. <br /> <br /> Nothing was happening in Aliye, it was a two-hour film, and there was so little work, no hero and land. <br /> <br /> Compatible with the comic book "Alien" by Tsutomu Takahashi. a Tenshu Yashiro's life (played by Hideo Sasaki) was executed for the death penalty. He then chooses to repeat the execution or select himself in a series of experiments. She chooses the latter and is soon placed in a room with an aggressor, and then provides a homeowner with a girl who is infected with a strange parasite. At a point in which the parasite is made Yashiro, of course, the bad thing does not happen in a very short time. <br /> <br /> As "Aragami", "Alive" puts the first half of the main exposition. Characters are introduced, motivations are identified, and relationships with each other arise. Everything happens even in one set. The first major problem with this comparison is that Aragami's only 70-minute movie, Alive drags more than two hours and the first part is over an hour. If this was a bit more interesting than the length of the characters, then there was no such thing. Dialogue is transmitted from dry, monotonous, emotionally and deeply, the characters themselves are not very interesting. "Alive" is somewhat more ambiguous, but when it comes to all the classics: small government people, a very powerful hero, yes you have guessed it, and at the end there were little attempts to keep the girl. As I said earlier, the whole film is practically only in one group and after two hours drilling, even worse designs are not even interesting to begin with and does not do much to improve other aspects. <br /> <br /> Now, After the end of the section, Kitamura may think that they will make entertaining scenes to prepare at least the drill start. Unfortunately, it is not. Only two battles are battles complete with ballot effects and psychic forces from Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Not just exciting and entertaining, Kitamura's Versus creativity has gone, the small band even squeezes its very often impressive camera work and all these are common and anticipated battles, br /> Apparently, "Aragami" was better on all accounts and "Kitamura" had learned something "Alive". Thus, at least, there was no general damage to this movie. You can only make mistakes, correct them, and create a better fun movie.
