The problem with such films is the correctness of the word every year. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of this film is the truth. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The wrong time in the wrong place, a tough but troubling person's "Die Hard" is one of the films using the formula. It is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security procedures for companies and individuals in this case. In this case, of course, a ship abducted. It is possible to see this movie as a mixture of Die Hard and Air Force One, and the film does not try to hide that the two movies are the biggest source of inspiration. So you really do not think this movie is genuine. <br /> <br /> You can expect something like this movie. <br /> <br /> You can expect such a movie, a very weak script. On the contrary, I say that there are many lazy articles. As I said before, there is no work in the film, but the real story is some of the elements that are far from being possible and simply merely captivity. In other words, with just eight children, he seizes a large cruise ship, shooting only a few smaller weapons, and then only a ransom of about $ 10 million. very strange. Are they even going to divide this money later? Does anyone get more than one million? It is not profitable for such a large and risky initiative. And then passengers are taken hostage. Finally, they are able to pick up all the passengers in a large vessel, and place them in a room, but they can not watch them with a pistol, even with a single person, even when they can not survive. But you do not see more than 30 soldiers, but as if they were all men on board. Also, Van Dien's character is looking for his son and vice versa, when they cross the cruise ship, they hit each other instantly. <br /> <br /> However, there are some examples of lazy writings in the film. <br /> <br /> But of course, an activity flick, so of course, the story becomes secondary. But still, this movie will not work well. Half of the actors, initially, did not hold any weapons and seemed to be full of slow tension. Of course, the movie does not reflect the best players, though Casper van Dien is not really a bad "hero hero" and actor. genre and B-cinema are an issue. He also fears the same problem with Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he does not seem to be convincing enough to play the teenage father. Van Dien had just started a new career as a young actor, but it does not really help his career. He can do something really good, though he does not really have the right options to show him. <br /> Yes, this is not the worst genre movie I've ever seen, but it's always. <br /> <br /> 4/10
