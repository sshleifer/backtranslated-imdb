A girl named Susan Montford writes and directs this "movie". There is no credit or credit for his name. He made a serious professional mistake in choosing him as a career. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst human works of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Apart from the ridiculous story of a woman who escapes the fourth murder of this film, the key to her mistake is that LOGIC is open and incomplete. <br /> <br /> After leaving the mall, she is approaching four groups because of her surroundings. Tell me, which woman insults and humiliates her when covering an aggressive insult? After an attack has already begun, I do not want to say, because of course it is absolutely normal to go back. But he loved the man and raised most of them to the next level. No woman can do that, (1) do not have a gun, 2) make sure that the reserve is very close and thus safe to the injury; 3) They may be confident that the attackers are too young and weak. Nothing has been done in this case, for he was acting like someone who was raping or stealing. Also, when approaching the security guard, Kim Basinger's remote, why would not he immediately want to help or shout at him? <br /> <br /> When a security guard pulls a driver after being shot in the head, he moves to a part of the city and crashes. She continued to climb up the hills and climbs to the feet and ran to the Red Toolbox and began to confuse her under her head. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br / <br /> <br /> Every major sequence of this movie has so obvious evidence that I should not comment on it. <br /> <br /> Why does he try to hide in the darkness of a high Red Toolbox? When captured, one of the wildcards will open the toolbox. First, he resisted, and then opened it. And brings a key. The scene here is full of fragile portions of the dramatic effect that has to break me - this is one of the most terrible scenes of the whole film. When he wanted to open his box, he was planning to attack someone else in the first place, so it could be somebody in some action movie to open up anger after opening it. The enemy is a device that requires the enemy to touch / unlock / manipulate, and once the hero declines to open it, the enemy launches this device, and it only includes a chemistry / conscious, and a hero's plan. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ span> ** In the rest of the film, everything you see actually uses the Red Toolbox as a weapon to slaughter around the trees surrounding the trees. <br /> <br /> When he ran, he ended up understanding how the thugs move back to BACK? I think it's the scene you're loudly singing to your dead child. Finally, this whole body is so weak that one of the first things that has been pursued in the first place, in the future, was a witness to the crime they committed before and so we thought they should kill him. How funny is it? According to one of the prisoners, they left the city and returned to any city they had, but no one had seen them, and it probably did not get the number. While these opportunities will not work for themselves, how can hell rise and hunt for someone to increase your chances of dealing with the original murder?
