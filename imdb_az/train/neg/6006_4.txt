I did not agree with any of the Left Behind theories, but I still found the books they were reading and I read 8 out of 8. Insufficient writing and an interesting story. But I did not expect too much for the movie. There was no way in which Hollywood took a Christian series and pulled a big budget. So it was done independently ... and I really felt that I watched a long TV show. FEEL did not just like a movie; there was no "experience" in the movie, and if someone talked about me, he knows. That's why the movie shot and low-budgeted, poor private effects were another punishment for me. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I feel Gordon Currie is worse than Nicolie Carpathia. When I read the book, the NC impression was that it was a charming, enchanting, strange and beautiful man, spoke English, almost zero. So I imagined the role of someone like Pierce Brosnan. Instead, Clay Aiken, who seemed to be an employee of the month of Best Buy, found the pen's neck and gave her a really bad fake accent. So, I lost a few stars for me. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> A movie is not convincing when it does not seem to be a great deal of violence or if it does not sound. <br /> <br /> The act was okay; Some of the scenes - one of the conversion scenes (one could not remember) - was a real seat for me. <br /> <br /> As some Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom, some Christian rock music or anything remained outside the scene. In short, a bad movie, but it did not do it for me. Put it in the book, it's better.
