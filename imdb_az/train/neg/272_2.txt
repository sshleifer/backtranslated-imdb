When I was young, I was very happy with the bad TV show. We are sometimes guilty of some other sin, but this is an excuse to watch things like "Buck Rogers 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons": I was young and naive; <br /> <br /> What happily I appreciate good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12 year old would love every bit of my hackneyed bit, stylted dialogue, each line, unnecessary technobabble. Writing is not insipid; so soft and acne is a Star Star Trek: Voyager. <br /> <br /> The movie is a fine guilty pleasure on stage by James Spader and Kurt Russell. interesting Egyptian architecture and culture, a beautiful music account and cool fantasy views. Except for the original music, the show does not see anything in the show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The budget is sometimes like the basement, because the budget was very low. Cinematography is not as good as a scroll, vanilla and dart. To me, there are many more styles (like Farscape) and that the substance (like reimagined Battlestar Galactica) is smaller and less powerful than the pope. This is not just worth it.
