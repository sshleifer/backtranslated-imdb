The young and attractive Japanese people are still on the wrong side of cursing, and this time they cover mobile phones. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you see more than 2 new Japanese movies, you can shut it down in the dark with your hand. <br /> <br /> Here's the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Until now, I was more amazed at his undercover basics like the Lost Souls City, but as a Past Caller, I was interested in more popular envelopes or deadly Cronenberg Audition styles that charged me with Dead or Alive. Although his films are largely empty, at least they have such works, or at least to capture the attention of Tadanobu Asan, holding them with the brilliant suits that stand up with Johnny Depp. None of them has been kidnapped in the Call; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Miike's glittering sense of humor has a leaky sense of humor, especially when it comes to a movie that has led to the death of one of the curated television programs, while the television programmer has a higher rating than her daughter's life. there is nothing beyond this, that there is no Miike behind the camera, which has traditionally disappeared without the trace of its outstanding vision (and its well-known protection), although it was not just a project enthusiasm and why I can understand it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> it felt like a hammer.
