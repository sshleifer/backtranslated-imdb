RUN ... do not go away from this movie !!!!! This film, directed to many young children, will lead you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90s is lifted, this film just dropped it. It is a slow paced and monster fight is good but rarely seen. This film blended me in the cat box. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The first 10 reasons to hate it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the start of the movie, you see a gamer for a minute adult. She takes her butt off thrown by several Gyaos and destroying herself ??? It looks old and lethargic. Nothing looks like any player you are already seeing. <br /> <br /> <strong> The young Gamera you see in the rest of the movie looks like a poker. <br /> <br /> <strong> Valentine's Day. This film has the pace of watching the NASCAR race during the 3 hour rainfall. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans, and how delighted the movie was. <br /> <br /> I saw an SUV full of greasy people on a mountain road faster. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie was a very little kaiju time on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In recent battles, though, it was really shorter, though fought well. 5. Children take the lead role. All children's subject-friendly and poor articles killed the original Gamera series in 1970 and repeat itself in history in 2000. The most successful Gamera movies left Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to an unsuccessful form? This was a new trilogy and the poor sales of the ticket killed any hope for the continuation of this story (thanks to God). <br /> <br /> 4. The gamer has lost his iconic breath. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This movie can create a new Olympic event ..... Think about a racing race that involves very small children. You need to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Special effects were good, but they were subparagraphs for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had a better effect. The best effect was that the apple-size baby Gamera flew. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This film is not just what the adult kaiju supporters expect. The director attends and shows at Power Rangers. ET, Always: Third Street and TMNT come as a hit between sunset. Kudos, if you know all 3 references. <br /> <br /> Lease it in the best possible way or watch it once to complete the DVD sequence.
