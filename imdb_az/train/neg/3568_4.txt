Truth that a film based on Harold Robbins's novel is not worthy of any award. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" budget B, cast and execute B picture. Technically, it looks like a film prepared for the film. The player is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly awful. Anthony Holland is a shame. As a reviewer speaks about a particular Katherine Hepburn performance, his range goes to A. Ms goes to Zedora G. to go. The remainder of the castle is solid (and is consumed in its role). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch are better. Still, all things are made up of many things. According to Robbins, everything happens around sex and nudity. If you're looking for some fun ... and we're not too sober ... this could be for you.
