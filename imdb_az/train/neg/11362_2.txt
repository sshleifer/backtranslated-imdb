"Aya Fly" I must be the worst cartoon I have ever seen. She says something since I took her son for the last 4 years to see every animated version. The story is to be generous. The sounds of a tough voice, sound very nicely. Humor is a kind of Romper Room. The animation is passive for a Nickolodeon animated movie, but it's not on a big screen on a cable television. <br /> <br /> Causes you to have OK 3-D visuals in just 2. Some of the scenes had a soft stimulating look, but we've seen better in the past. I demand that the filmmakers move away from the screen rather than the majority of the characters. First of all, it is interesting, after 3 or 4 times it has become a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I also have to say that there was a very cool soundtrack. And my son was not too crazy about this. Bad movie.
