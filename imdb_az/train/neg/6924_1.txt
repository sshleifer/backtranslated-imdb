If this movie were worse, it was directed by Uwe Boll. This unusual mistake makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen the baking pad, but I'd like to remind all the participants that it's a serious bodily injury. Everyone can give this movie more than 1 star, and it gives me compliments to all those who are considering this trip. I give a star because of a low rating. All copies of this film must be burned to the ground planted and protected as polygons for the most toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept under ultra secure and only shown to the film maker.
