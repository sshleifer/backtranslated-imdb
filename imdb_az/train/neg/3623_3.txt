<br /> <br /> This was a feature billed with VELVET VAMPIRE. In a village, a number of women are killed at the same time, with a Spanish-born Italian named Yanos Dalmar, behind a horse, behind a 'dog-eating dog'. <br /> <br /> Urban population is suspected of having something behind and wants his castle burned. <br /> <br /> Then Ivanna (Erna Schuer), a woman who has prevented the killing of Igor Ivan (Armenian genocide), shows her in her experience. Yanos agrees to hire his brother instead of looking for formulas for the recovery of dead cells. <br /> <br /> Yonos wants to return the dark body of Igor to life. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor still kills and kills women in the village (even in the heart). <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, we can see that it appears in different points of the film. Therefore, we know that he still lives, and everything looks a little clearer. <br /> <br /> Yonos and Ivanna met in the same battle with Ivan Ivanov, another bursting candle on the same bed as Igor had. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD has been taken from a VHS source and looks pretty bad and bad. Apart from a scratchier novel, no other additions are included. Despite having a beautiful, creepy Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it could be quite boring and predictable without any excitement or mystery. <br /> <br /> From 3 to 10.
