I went to this matrix or like Pi. My son, I made a mistake. Yes, the film has a weakly written, weakly moving structure (to capture CG animation cells and peptides). <br /> <br /> Indeed, the real target of the movie is the "expert" chatter, who has a good sense of freshness among cunning segments. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this is a fairly innocent one.

Save your time and money: Do not miss this movie.
