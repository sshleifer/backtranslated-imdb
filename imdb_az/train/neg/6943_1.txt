This movie is terrific. A man wants to take revenge on a crime, but when he takes revenge he has a video camera all the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies, including one, had a physical injury. <br /> <br /> I think some of the salient habits that scenario writers think of their brains and their ability to pull a battalion of armored tanks. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Only those people who wrote this story were as laughable as to write down absolutely unrealistic field shots that could never happen in such a way. As I told the writers, seek help for a serious mental problem.
