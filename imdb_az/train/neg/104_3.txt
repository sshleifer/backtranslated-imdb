When traveling to a small town out of the beaten path (but doubtfully approaching a motorway), a woman runs to a strange jump-hiker, who agrees to a reporter's appointment. The strange man then explains several horrible stories related to the region: In the first story, a stingy couple plan to kill a woman, but ultimately hurt themselves in a zombie attack; <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garret Clancy and director Brad Sykes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles - a beautiful idea with a zombie themed anthology, but with only two stories, it falls shortly. And this is not the only way to avoid a flimsy low budget: the player is inactive (with Joe Haggerty, like Ebenezer Jackson, one of the most striking appearances I've ever seen); the places are thirsty; is a script writer; There is a sexual scene with zero nakedness; <br /> <br /> <strong> Violence against the people living in the Caucasus, Joe Castro's enthusiasm for cheapo: one ear is over, the eyes have fallen, one face removed, brain is painful, and there is a messy breakthrough. <br /> <br /> The zombie chronicle 2/2 is not even a ride in the park for those who appear to be enriched in garbage. <br /> <br /> I'm Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but I did not see the movie with the benefit of 3D (although there was a secret doubt that I did not make a difference to an extra dimension).
