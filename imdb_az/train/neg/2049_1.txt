At least, I was able to mock the stunning movie since I had difficulty with her. In all honesty, my guess is that the DVD movie is a cover for more cost than all movies. And when it comes to a new version, saying that Boogeyman is the same director ... beautifully touching guys, it was quite misleading to shut me up. Only one thing, copycat was his hair. In a ten-year-old child, you see such hair and this is a similar character. As it was seen by a D + grad student being shot down by a student in the film, he was excited to use the film method he never learned while attending the classroom .... sometimes less friends. For a while, I've lost it with casual yards that have never been brought to me or explained. All this is a bad film, but when it comes to the end, it does not come close to getting it, well, that's a pretty bad movie. Surely, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it's part of a French final video of my friends for my high school, but maybe I was a little pretentious and I also succeeded. P.S. I do not think even a half deserves ... even half. FOR YOU!
