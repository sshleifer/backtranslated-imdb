<br /> <br /> This film is the second film led by Alexander Korda in recent years. This film, apart from the great cinematography by the wonderful James Wong Howe in battle scenes. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". He was so afraid we closed it. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ font> <br /> Maybe it's good for the 1937 standard Queen's performance, but with Helen Mirren Compared to this, it is not entirely compatible. In Robson's fashion, Robson expresses his lines. <br /> <br /> Vivien Leigh, a woman living in the Caucasus, has repeatedly played a supporting role here, and she really does not care does not convey anything. Scarlett was 2 years to think! <br /> <br /> Spain's Armada is a shame that history is so dull in this film.
