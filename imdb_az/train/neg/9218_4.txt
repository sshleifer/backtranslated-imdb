The psychology of this film is really strange to try and understand. He is often billed as an anti-RPG movie, but is not really that simple. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they come up with negative contradictions about what they want to say about the game (if any). <br /> <br /> They are familiar with all the characters they use, their parents have divorced, alcohol-filled, and completely burdened with life, when they are harshly trying to succeed. Tom Hanks, of course, is in the worst case dealing with a brother who is still missing and dying out of another school. <br /> <br /> His game, which he talked several times, plays to create problems in his real life. And sure enough, when they finally go to see Robbie (Hanks), they are all happy and well-organized, they have started their maternity careers, solved problems, dropped out of the game (even Daniel does not want the computer games to be played) and even Robbie ' Her mother was always drunk and dissatisfied, suddenly Happy Homemaker, looking fresh and bright and drawn flowers. Of course, JJ decided to commit suicide (and quite surprisingly), but the reason is absolutely clear because he is not the only boy genius who can not get his history because his character is dying just like the famous Jack Chick tract (which happens anyway), it almost seems to end Daniels and get everyone to play. In fact, the only thing that can save the life of a cavernous soul is that it is the only thing in the cavern!) And the whole movie can be the best scene scene, Kate looks very rich in chain mail, looks at the right camera and says, "Terrible monsters are in our minds" . <br /> <br /> The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two swarms of rugged pairs of magic beans that will smash a dirty, homeless man. The recurring theme ("We were going" for the 80s) could have been a bit unhappy, but the way to open the film is obviously reducing and appearing beyond the ground. And, with a final mystery, a hero with a complete Pardu regalia, has a psychological break, it becomes completely his character and begins to look for it, of course the first thing is changing street clothes in the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is ineffective, but I think it's an illogical topic. These days, a circle of children with dice and pencils was saddened and possibly accepted as they owned and could have been crazy when they talked to you about their words. The Anti-Paranoia, first of all, asks the journalist's question of the police, says a kid loses the police in the tunnels and Maze and Monsters are involved in some way. The speaker admits that he is unusually familiar with the game (although he has allowed his children to play), then turns to the camera and acknowledges that there is no other explanation for the game, producing a polished spiel, accusing him of everything. In the end, there are no masterpieces for him, and films prepared for TV are interesting.
