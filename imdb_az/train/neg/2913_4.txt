It is very pleasant in terms of the development of the Turkish film industry, but I would expect something more creative than the Togan GÃ¶kbakar. starting with a script that believes that somebody does not have a clever article as they think. especially the pessimism of the dialogues that kept the viewers in a position that they are not smart enough to understand the situations that make the film unbearable. but also an open end; you can easily talk about the beginning of the murder. The weakest part of the scenario is that it is impossible for serious mental illnesses to behave like patients, but also professionals! Medical conditions that have never been a professional for patients with severe medicine, and medical conditions that can not even be used by ordinary people are another strange point of the film, with any weapon to protect themselves, on the stage where the staff is looking for the most dangerous patient. and the scene was in accordance with the heading "Push Out". not the only weak parts of the film. There were many advantages in the film. The most dangerous patient was a complete picture of Hannibal, and most of all, the appearance of Togan was the worst mistake he made in his first movie! Unfortunately, the size of the film and the interviews with the actor made people wonder and see them. Gene is a general disappointment. If Shahan was not famous this would be a miracle, would Togan be able to shoot this movie with this budget? Hopefully, Togan said in an interview that he is not a fashionable actress who can play a role as director. Never did it, and Night Shyamalan successfully continued! he should be aware that he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan! Hoping to be more attentive and creative in this great industry next time!
