Let's see ... I try to find everything positive, so what can I say about Pallberger? <br /> <br /> I know! It was not a performance, it did not work because Gwyneth Paltrow had succeeded in emptying all personalities, and it is usually so alive and creates caricatures from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh, - nope. It does not either dose-inducing or fly. What was the genre anyway? It's not funny to break the rules of comedy. It was not quite interesting to be dramatic. Was there a romantic relationship between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I'm sure I should ask - just call him "blows." But I'm sure that those who were behind this movie started with a vision, they almost had to challenge studio suits, but I should help them find it. <br /> <br /> Even though I was ill, I did not recommend a movie that would give a good deal of conscience to a person with a wind whistle and a professional business interview with dirty, hairy, stupid hair. <br /> <br /> Must not be ridiculed by Mr. Black Horshey's black roots and platinum locks? <br /> <br /> What do I do? In the film, I lost 97 progressive moments - I can not afford to spend more on missing.
