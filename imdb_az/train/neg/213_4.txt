Yes, it could have been a really good movie. An affectionate story, unfortunately, spoke badly, biangle, an exciting story (not apologetic for the poetic license, but triangle!). The appearance is sometimes strange, sometimes OK, looks full of pictures and looks narrow. Sound requires more attention (usually in Romanian films), light and colored filters are sometimes poorly selected. The soundtrack is short and does not help move. About the operation ... sorry, but the best actress is the host. Others are immaturely acting and the audience can not agree. Acting is poetic when it should be poetic, true and realistic. This is a picture for adults explained by children. Be very uncomfortable when it's too exciting.
