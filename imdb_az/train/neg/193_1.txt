The story prepared by Norman Maclean is a work; Redford movie is a mediocrity. Maclean adds banal scenes of two of his brothers who go on an enemy and their dual-accompaniment bar at an unobtrusive bar. Password, Brad Pitt, Charismatic Paul Maclean, proves that the original story is elegant or pressured, depending on what you belong to while trying to play genius in the open air. Some rabbit scenes are beautiful. Also, Norman, like Tom Skerritt and Craig Sheffer, is one of the men and women as expected. None of the women in the film is sorry because Maclean loves women in her story, and it's clear, even poetic.
