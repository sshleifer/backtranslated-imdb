Liongate has not yet proved himself. Every movie from Lionsgate was horrible. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they slapped me again and again. <br /> <br /> This film was so nervous and filthy to most of them. <br /> <br /> This is a conspiracy. For some reason, Guy cuts a dead dog. The casual virus is infected, transfers it to the children in the camp, children are infected and die, the city is talking about and helping them, killing them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Hell, there is a whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are absolutely flawless, no one cares for them, and a child must be compressed. Talking to me and my wife about how greener and strange this classmate was, it was more profitable to pay attention to this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will do it. <br /> I'm still mixed with casual slow motion karate movements, because the bulls managed to do all the way to the end while shouting $ @ t. a casual child and, as you can see, everyone in the country is completely defective and closed. And again why did this dog attack the girl? Why was the boy trying to kill hicks? Was it part of their plans? Amazing! Wow. best plan. I can not believe this movie has the freedom of theater. I can force a DVD to sit in a theater that does not move for about an hour and a half. Do not be afraid, funny or cool, or something. this is a 90-minute loss that you can use. I do not know if I'm building a tree or something. it is more productive than garbage. Acting, special effects and scripts are a joke. <br /> <br /> Cabin fever gets a bad foot shave scene from the age of 10
