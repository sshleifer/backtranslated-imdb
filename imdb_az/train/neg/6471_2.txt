This is a filthy film in every imaginative way. Of course, it's been 12 years since the last movie, and we want to know how much it works. But new characters are not interesting. Baby Melody is a terrible horror! Unfortunately, despite the constant protection of the logic of humanity, other basic physical logic is ignored. If you are in the Arctic, it will be cold if you do not have cold weather clothes. I do not know why the most commentary here is that the return of Jafar's degrees is worse, and I thought it was more horrible.
