After Chachi's playing, I will not be watching Happy Days, so I knew it was a challenge when I sounded the best scene in this movie, Scott Baio (a skateboard scene!). Jodie Foster's first "grown-up" role becomes his usual professional career, but that does not give an excuse to this dull problem. I will not be back for two hours of my life! There were no remarkable characters, incredible stories, suspicious editions, and terrible cinematography, but it was all bad, I could not care less. The story of teenagers living in California in the 1970's, where children live a pitiful life and all their parents are sexually active. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
