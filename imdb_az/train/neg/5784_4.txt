Like many other reviewers, I have so much impact. Of course, there are some pretty girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. flew to the cars on their way to their homes (at night), fleeing the path of the two beautiful sirens, and invading their hunt ... these are the buffalos of the men they are sexually active. What happens there ... thoroughly, killing each other and killing their visitors after kissing. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has a few shine with his camera. Some scenes are very heartwarming and effective, but do not take a sexual film (nothing is meant ... at least conscious). There's really no story here. We have two daughters. When we see them hitting them with a pistol, some unexplained and unexplained start appears. Why? What does it mean for a couple of days to greet a boy at the hotel that he knows there is a guy in the hotel? Does he have one goal? Of course, how many questions are there for several couples? In the English village there are vampires and Carpathians with a wine cellar full of wine the beautiful looking girls who are, in any case, scrambled by these flaws, begin to lie in the crypt, and then go on some charming scenes, but this is anti-climate. As I said, there are some impressive scenes from the director Marianne Morris, especially, likes to be more than just a few, and is also the most impressive set of movies in homes that look at girls and their predators: old movie fans, silent screen gamer Bessie Love came short of the end of the movie.
