I can sit in this movie once, but for the second time I doubt that I can do it. Mainly fun for Lindsay Lohan's physical presence. Matt Dillon's fun (to think about Mary) and more serious Micheal Keaton's emergence. It's not fun, it's Love Bug, but it's fine. One of my main detectives in the film is the fact that Herbie is turned into an antique R2D2 for the majority. I was twisted 30 times or several times with the eye effect of the lantern, and the bending front fender made the same reaction from me. Carefully scroll through the small ones, the so-called "single-bracket" kids, and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> _X
