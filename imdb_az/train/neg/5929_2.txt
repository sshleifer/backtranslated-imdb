People who praise this movie are the true disappointment - at least, a few years ago, Leonard hoped that a few years ago he would do his best to save his life by more than 70 people. But this movie is just scary. Leonard says he is not sentimental about his past, and then in the next half an hour emphasizes the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so bloody with infinite attitudes towards those who are emotions. Cohen's interview is all near the video of grace, and he wanted to see a medium and long shot of his whole body! I was less careless about performers, especially Ego boys and Edge and Bono's comments. None of the performers in this movie did not make Leonard a good song as his music, and you are thinking of seeing it and pay no attention to them. This can be perhaps an acceptable PBS for the one shown. But I'll be hesitant about getting DVDs. The film was finally destroyed by Bono in one verse if Leonard's "Tower tower" was played. Even good performances (Antony, Rufus's first issue, Martha's treacherous) were damaged in the context of this turgid blab. Forget it and get Leonard's latest album, you want to respect it.
