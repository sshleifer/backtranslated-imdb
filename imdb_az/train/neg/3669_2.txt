I do not think it's a good thing to say about this movie ... it's nothing. The scenario is a nightmare. The writer mixes the lines between chemical and biological properties and does not understand the difference. You would at least think of getting a technical consultant. It was bad by most of the performance ... though I do not really blame them ... the material is really bad. The performance was equally bad .. Now I just stop it .. all bad 2/10
