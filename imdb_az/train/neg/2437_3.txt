Yes, I'm a John Ford fan. (I watched "The Informer" only because I tried to work on the list of "adults"). So if you do, just act, because you do not agree with me. /> <br /> What's this? We can say that there is a good idea for a movie here (I think there are a few films about the revolution in Ireland), but it was decided to bury it in a usual condition, like Ford, with a very moving and cheap idea. I guess it is interesting to watch for some time, from the silent to the "conversations", to a few more seamless transitions - the movements of some authors are endemic, feel like they can play better with unforgettable cards than movies and movie dialogue. (Of course, the sixth part of the cards would prevent Ford from re-instilling every feeling.) What kind of dialogue is that "They are always successful Charms after me!" each actor seems to have been allowed to use his / her own version, unlike Ireland. Of course, it's helpful to remind them that we are in Ireland as bad as they are, because the gang seem to be drifted from some of the other German expressive parts, which are later shattered. (With an eagle, some peasants feel as though you are seeing Frankenstein's torch in the background.) <br /> <br /> Techniques change. Tastes change. So I'm not as crazy as it seems to me in the movie's own day. But this is not one of the classics who hold a more just "fair warning" about the type of simplified malarkey that Ford will dedicate to his career.
