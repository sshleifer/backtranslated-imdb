Rick Sloane was allowed to convince five films to be more convincing than cold fusion. This movie is completely offensive. Before watching this movie, Manos thought: Fate Hands was the worst piece I've ever seen, but at least Manos can sleep so slowly that it will save you pain from pain that will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this film is to turn the "locked" part of the old man holding Hobgoblins into the final scene. It was an absolute loss of my life when I watched this movie.
