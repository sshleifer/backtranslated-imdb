This is the worst-case scenario. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very entertaining and dramatic. Creators of this worthless movie are closely following. Well, the old novels are not sacred and if they have ideas, they will improve my free version with me. If everything can do, everything changes and replaces them with irresistible and watered clich√©s. If they are filmed in a studio studio made of cardboard, even if they are at least twice as good as the worst actors. There is no imagination, just fatigue. <br /> <br /> This should only be purchased or watched by collectors of the Victoria novel set. <br /> <br /> I think the novel is not a hint to understand what's happening to people you read, but if you decide to watch it on TV, or if God forbids you to spend money on buying it. Some of Gagool's and Gollum's old-fashioned witches have become a wonderful ghost in the book!
