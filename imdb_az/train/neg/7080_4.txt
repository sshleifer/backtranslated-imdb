This film could have been an interesting character and could give some ideas on the subject, but the real problem with this film is that there is no such thing in it. No idea or solution to this problem. This is a description of the 'old' male sexual intercourse and everyday problems for normal life and family. Why do you want to watch it? <br /> <br /> It really is absolutely meaningless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This is not really helping to make some of the main characters a little bit older than 50+. You will experience difficult times to identify yourself, and be sincerely devoted to it. She looks just like a dirty old playboy, which is a constant hunt for women and sex. <br /> <br /> Every day sex has all kinds of sexual intercourse, not 3 times a day, but not prostitutes. <br /> <br /> Although it's a bit embarrassing, it does not have a bad visual style. But still many other direct-to-video production looks very good. <br /> <br /> If film material was provided with better material, the movie would be worthy of a better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is really ridiculous. Certainly, there are some senseless truncheons that are more laughable, as they obviously are supposed to. For example, I'm talking about the entire Ordell plan. They get worse as they begin to get started after the movie is over. Also, the narrative of the story, the events taking place between the events and the main characters with the psychiatrist are a little cheaper and simple feelings. <br /> <br /> But bad movies, this is not just one of them. <br /> <br /> It's still strange and surprising that Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr were able to do that. It's a simple little little production like this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
