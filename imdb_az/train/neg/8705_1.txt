This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... the worst I've ever been ... I've been watching it all the time, it starts to dance to the expected music and to dance to a doctor .. (better plot with porn) When Rapport wants to enter inside the door, I think he threw a plastic puppet against a door away. But worse than I said, I have to explain that if you tell me how negative it is, it will not do anything compared to watching it. I do not rent it, but watching TV about 30 minutes is what I mean. I could not watch for more than 30 minutes, but when I got everything out, there was a good will
