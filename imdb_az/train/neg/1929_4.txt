Someone praised: -Atlantis: - The Lost Empire - like the Disney adventure for adults. <br /> <br /> This script is not for adult thinking, at least I do not think. <br /> <br /> This script is a live action movie that shoots someone else as a crap that you do not sell for adults. Many of the old adventure film's "Crack Squads" have been made better (The Dirty Dozen), but Atlantis is one of the worst films in the motif. The character is weak. Even the rear part of each member's stock is seen as the stockholder and is mistakenly the best. My dad is a tomboy mechanic who always wanted his son, MD / Medical Man, even if we did not see it before, we've already seen the mixed-up quarrels. The story about how a friend of Vinni, played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), was torn away from flower shops and turned out to be a completely uncertain path. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, has any depth voiced by the young Atlantis-foolish academic Michael J. Fox. Milo's father, who has grown up his search for Atlantis, also continues. In the opening scene, his father shows his smaller Milo by kneeling over his iron head. <br /> <br /> At best, the best part of the heroes was Atlantis. voice talent. Commander Rourke did not lose anything called by James Garner. Although Rourke is a very rugged military type, Garner simply shows his breathing lifestyle to his characters. Garner's vocal performance is a high point. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy, King of Death, is not obligatory. In addition, Don Novello, as Vinny Santorini, a demolition expert, was different for one or two good, funny lines - but I liked Father Guido Sarducci anyway. <br /> Check out the computer animation. COMPLETE PROGRAM animation, that is. Character animation does not do anything if no plain characters are already created. <br /> <br /> Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is nothing to impress. <br /> <br /> This area was the worst. Some people say hackneyed or trite. I am not sure of that. Any used area can be transformed into something new with appropriate treatment. Shakespeare often began a famous story and composition and was only famous for putting a new coat. Thus, treatment is something. And -Atlantis - obviously this does not exist. <br /> <br /> Without Spoyler, I will not go into all the logical holes. The area was bad. The bridges of the plot are cut as twins and are not the last. In addition, the script and animation are bewildered with annoying flattery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Milo has incorrectly transliterated these rings or Celtic symbols and read the "Gulf of Iceland" on the "Irish coast" and our problems have begun. The authors of the book need to know Irish "for Ireland" or Eireann and not to see the great, Latin Hibernian. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it is necessary to familiarize Wikipedia with the green island Island and to assassinate the island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this has forced the direct translatitic "letter" to run the runic version of the English language and the post-roman history script. Long before it was supposed that Atlantis had fallen into the cave. <br /> <br /> Since the past, Milo has written less of the tips and technology that are less expensive than the technology. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd Magazine was unable to write before the Atlantic collapse or he would not have known anything about the cave or the crystal "False in the eyes of the king." It was written after the sinking of the land, but without the technology of the Miles expedition, Leviathan did not sing anyone. So what more can you learn about this from now on? And why it will be written in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clarity or astral travel can explain these things. However, science and astral journeys do not require writing to Atlantis. So, some sort of autos must be. Because of the inability to read in Atlantis, it is necessary to surface the crystals' natural messages. That would be more meaningful. It could also be explained in the film: Milo revealed that this force called him all his life - revealed in dreams and should be investigated in this film. <br /> <br /> The Atlantic should not just understand modern languages. No one expected the true Hindu-Europeans to talk in Europe, according to Romans, very difficult "c" or "French" ("sh," few!!!). Atlates lived before the disaster - but they have not been able to read what they are using or have worked on similar machines. <br /> <br /> Massless uncertainty shows a significant defect in the film, and it seems that there is nothing to do with it, when Milo stays up in the air until he can. even if it is not a constant struggle for survival, nobody wants to write poetry or write a novel, and maybe it is a good science fraud that goes down towards the end of Atlantic school systems and causes Atlantis to rise. <br /> <br /> Kida, If he were young, he would have to read or operate a car if he were so young For the Deification! The foolishness of my scalp almost cleansed the people from being a single-handed man. A group of Catholics was killed and a Giant Robots <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> While the only person who can read the Atlantic, Rourke and others read quite a bit unhappy book and knew enough to find a page on a crystal - it's a crystal and stylized astrology or "sun" diagram. <br /> <br /> Milo's father, Rourke, is not yet told how Rourke did not explain Milo as part of this book. Although Milo did not find any sign of the hernia page in the book, Rourke left the page that he had heard in his hand - something that was not "just right". Milo would not have suspected anything until Milo was warned that someone else would steal someone else's word "crystal". <br /> <br /> The intrinsic "double-cross" character change is not. We learned that Vinny, Shirin, Audrey and Cookie were going along with Rourke from the start. However, "heart changes" fall straight. It was a change and it needed to be better motivated. <br /> <br /> We will come together and look at the sequence after the bull flows out of the dome, rather than filling the rest of the region. . This fluid; In spite of the events in the Caucasus, the cease-fire has been restored, Atlantis is already a weak force, so coddling is required. The giant robot guardians and those who turn blue lightning think that we are less afraid of them. Technology is superior to us and definitely in the early 20th century. In the end, Milo should teach Atlantia to read, why? <br /> <br /> Many countries of the Organization of the World Economic Cooperation (OECD) should give a signal to me that the Century era has given me more respect for the money. The film fails to agree with this idea. But there were also many dima novels, because they just had to pay to see the subtle symbols. Pulpa stories, in any case, are part of the so-called "adult can not sell". We have become a little more advanced and our pulp needs to grow. Lost Ark Raiders have never lost his sense of pulp and run away very badly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the 10th to 4th movie is pleasant,
