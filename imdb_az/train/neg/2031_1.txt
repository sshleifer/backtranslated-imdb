Even though William Shater always smiles in something that seems to me (and especially loves him as Denny Crane in Boston Law), this show jumps up and down and screams girls glitz and dancing. No millionaire exploration, no Deal, or any of the ability to negotiate. <br /> <br /> This show is dancing and foolish to fill all the time. <br /> <br /> Of course, I watched him to check it out. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ strong> <strong> It's a hoot! Unfortunately, this show will NOT DO. <br /> <br /> This is a given one
