I love Zombie Films and love amateur production. And the meat market will be truly promising with a beautiful congratulation on Fulci's classic "Zombie". <br /> <br /> So I went back and waited to be affected. <br /> <br /> Some of the makeup for some budgetary films is great, some actors (vampires and chefs) are really different, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything new here, but here is a whole series of films that have a little or no shock. <br /> <br /> <strong> It resembles the hero of "MeatMarket2 Gore" - something like that for me. not enough - we apologize. <br /> <br /> *****
