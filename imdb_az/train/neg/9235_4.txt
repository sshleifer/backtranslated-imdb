This woman never stops her conversation throughout the film. Recalls every line and delivered it with little natural emotion. He also owns the most miserable jaws, and the sound of his voice is like a nail on a board. There are so many Betsy Drake WAY in this movie, and Cary Grant, who has little to do with the film itself, is not enough.
