This review is released worldwide in 2002. How undeserving poor based on the video, dubbed Shock-o-Rama? The '1', which is represented on a scale of IMDb's terrible - but it's not bad. This can improve the quality of the original German-language print issues, to imagine that the fine - dubbed the funny comedies in the English language - but truthfully, you're likely to see this amateur films of any genre, which is one of the worst. In the film, the zombies slow and clumsy as ever, they talk or think about anything beyond their next meal does not seem to have the ability. However, they also Western taboos about genital no doubt will revive their dinner table conversation to know that you are smart enough to operate chainsaws and you're quite harmful. George Romero's Land of the Dead is a zombie nation posited retained a piece of social commitment; Director Andreas Schnaas zombies here is nothing more than a blank canvas for the superstitious imaginings. Utterly redeeming social value, and not as fun completely without even worse, Zombie '90 waste of money out of it, everyone is a bad joke.
