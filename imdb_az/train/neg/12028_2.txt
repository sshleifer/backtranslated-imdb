I agree with all of the above that something strange amateur movie would agree to not even spend the moment watching. Very poor operating, offhand production values, completely pedestrian orientation and, therefore, undeniable and convincing writing should never be written down and written. Even Hollywood's "professionals" work for just one wage, even though no one is paid for such a bad job. <br /> <br /> OTH, there's something interesting about watching something worse than this paradise. And Chad Lowe is awesome and consistently bad.
