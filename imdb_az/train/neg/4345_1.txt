Deceptive Advertising ... I saw the trade for Carlitos Way: "Scarface and Carlito Producer On The Road" says that when he rises to Power ... Michael Bergman did not produce scarface, in fact for 'Scarface. I should not go far from Bergma's ability ... but in my opinion, there should be a little more class. I think I can talk to the masses ... We hate to lie openly. Despite the film's progress, it was the weakest. Puff Daddy thought you were doing a good job. Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this movie. Overall, this film did not do a good job to fill the paths of Carlito. This is an attempt to make a good movie for a quick money withdrawal.
