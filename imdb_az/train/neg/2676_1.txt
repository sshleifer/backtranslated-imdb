** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This straight-to-video mess combines a gun-toting heroine, grade-Z effects, pupils, mummy and endless lesbian footage and are still boring; The video sees the 45-minute process as Eternity only. Only a good part is that bad guys are one of the boutiques outlining 400 pound Egyptians in a cafe, and a person's leg is almost crushed under a chair foot. Return this snoozer to the video store and watch golf, bowling or tennis on the TV.
