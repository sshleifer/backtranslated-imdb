I really like this movie, but it's a very boring and incredible result. The first bomber is a camera feed from a robot that moves towards a bomb and naturally shakes. But the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, during quiet moments, until the ridiculous point. Will rent houses come from tripods and Steadicams? It's made in 16mm that the film does not help the whole film as it is silver or shaking. <br /> <br /> Bigelow has the right tools and equipment, and there are considerable errors and discrepancies to weaken the film's reliability. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - A car will not run out of fire after a fire and will not be extinguished once with a small hand-sword. <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - In order to reach the target, it will not be possible to shoot long-running Israelis within a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> I believe that bomb bombs are brought to the areas near or near the coast, not a casual place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil tanker attack is said to have occurred in the Green Zone, which is a very safe area where there are fewer attacks. Most of the zones are offices and palaces with several residential areas, but dark alleys and insulting insurgents are described as a dangerous war. Suddenly, James does not have to worry about the ridiculous tactics of each of his two comrades, who orders him to take a cemetery, thus making an attempt to abduct. <br /> <br /> - As always, a team of three is clear that some of them have cleared some of the rebels and so on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and what is the order or place of Baghdad. I did not know whom the EOD team was telling me and that it was not the other one. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that several times in the US "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predicted. Yes, it is clear that the psychiatrist is concerned with the Iraqi people he is trying to move, so that the choice of picnic will be very heavy and a stolen driver will not wait for you to leave the car. finally, the character development was almost complete. Renner's character has previously had a troublesome relationship in the home, not miserable and depends on adrenaline. At the end of the film is exactly the same. <br /> <br /> If this is really the best of Iraq war movies, it's a very sad group. I just saw it in half an hour, but instead advise to kill Generation Kill at HBO.
