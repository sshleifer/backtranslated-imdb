I really liked it. I'm a fool, but I have to admit that I love the movie. I was waiting for it to bend, but it was shocking, but sometimes it's not worth it to look at many movies to relax on the OK and watch some movies? I did not expect any hidden meaning or morality, and nothing happened, but in this sense it is not important because I just looked for fun and it always amused me. That is why films include Ben Stillers ("There is something about Mary") and Vince Vaughns (but I'll be unable to be checked if you write her last name). I do not know if it's okay to watch a crap movie and I can take a luggage, maybe I'll work, but not a car, not a driver, a blockbuster video, or even a Choices, and this toilet can rent a bunch of humored movies and Stay watching them at night. Good day to the reader. But if I do not tell you that this comment has helped you, then I will not love you, if you say that God bless you, you are going to heaven.
