Wow, I hated this movie. The theme has led to a really nice movie, and the leading actor was sensitive and capable enough to touch the subject, but the script - even a scandal - is a mess. This is no less than a casual slide show, which is no longer a part of the show. I would say no to go anywhere, I would not rule out that this is the longest 81 minutes to sit down. As I said, the leading actor is good. Faruza Baulk (SP?), Sometimes it is a tough, but ultimately host-like mom. Filmmakers have a lot to answer here because it's a mess. It's a real shame because I really like to love this movie, but it's actually a movie that's never been taken. Skip one - even at $ 6 that I did not pay for.
