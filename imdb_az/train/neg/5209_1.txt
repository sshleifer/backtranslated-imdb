Perhaps I was very upset and watched it all the way. <br /> <br /> This film is soft, harmless and unshakable. The story is very sweet, throwing your teeth into the opening headlines. A tail of two 'traumatized' children learning about "God" is a fairy-tale story that explicitly traumatishes me. Irish blarney uses such stereotypes that it does not see any real Irish. "OIRISH" focuses on children who are sincere after the first attempt. Why all these things are erupting?
