Many other reviewers, including those who respect their ideas, appreciate this part of the European sleaze horror. Personally, I did not like it. An attempt to disagree with an atmosphere of sex and violence. Jess Franco makes this kind of movies very good in the best way possible. Unfortunately, the rough-running filmmaker is Joe D'Amato. D'Amato's most well-known films are rude for their high transcendence. In an early film created by him, he had a more famous "Anthropophagus" and "Beyond the Darkness" that he has not always had disgusting scenes. As a result, an unusual movie that does not involve the viewer in any way. Without sleaze factor, it is very boring. As I said, others were very pleased with this movie, but I found it to be a perfect example of just incredible laziness. <br /> <br /> The film has several advantages. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") and she looks pretty warm and often naked. However, the cult movie symbol Klaus Kinski is completely spent on a subplode that has nothing to do with the main film. He looks bored with this role and does not have the manic intensity he does best. Music is beautiful and has funny short moments. It's still an ambitious and meaningless movie that can be incredibly boring. (3/10)
