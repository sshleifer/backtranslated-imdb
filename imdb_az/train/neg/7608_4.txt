I do not expect much from Roger Corman. In general, I'm waiting for a lot of picnics and bad scripts. But in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> GÃ¼nslinger is a story of a woman (shocked by Beverly Garland) who works as a sheriff if her husband is pounded. Mary Garland struck herself very well and the next day she killed one of her murders at her husband's funeral. The first task is to close down the local bar that violates the city's commandant's ban. The owner of the bar tries to take the land while waiting for the railroad (hopefully) to be purchased from the road. <br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Garland, a thorn in your plans and bar matron Ms. A man takes a job to kill Garland. <br /> <br /> Ms. Since the role Garland plays is honest and realistic, there is no temptation to go to the poems of Suzanne Somers "O Sheriff." Films, such as filming, are quite profitable, except for a few faux rusts (two horsepants waiting in the door to open the inside door, jeep tracks and a corner on the screen). <br /> <br /> Sterno says that Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time. However, Corman's film could not resist flying with horseback scenes.
