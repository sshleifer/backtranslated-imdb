When I wrote this review in 2008, we have to rebuild the culture of reconstruction. The film studio decided to break many classic films, such as King Kong, The Wicker Man, and a completely unrecognizable update, including any movie by Michael Caine in all films. However, as proof of "dough for laziness", this lazy recommendation mentality is not a new phenomenon. Bob Clampett's "Porky's Wackyland" full-colored version of "Dough for Do-Do" creates the originality of life, adding some of the luminescence of Clampett's color image and the new luminescence controlled by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a completely useless filmmaker to distort the source of Clampett's source, although no director could hope to approach Clampett's undeniable argument. Otherwise, 'East for Dough' is, of course, nothing other than a classic's aggression. It's like painting Casablanca for animated films like me.
