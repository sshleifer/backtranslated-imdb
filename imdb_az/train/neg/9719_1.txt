Umm, forgive me, but there are no more than half the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a man who has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for stealing a bread bread and then trying to escape several times. She breaks her verbal abuse and is harassed by police inspector Javert. There are many characters on the way that are not in this version. It should be noted that Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme will be. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. Throughout the entire movie, I was mixed up and angry to see how it was related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
