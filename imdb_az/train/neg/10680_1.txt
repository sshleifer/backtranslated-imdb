SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> This is one of the worst films - it's simple. There is no charge for this movie. The first 10 minutes are very difficult - you really believe that this movie will shock and will be at the edge of the chair. Instead, we'll spend 83 minutes in a stroke of stolen and weak appearing scenes without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, like an aquarium, and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show advanced teleportation powers, for example, Alex Thomas, who is drowning in the lake, and ends up in an unusable position on the boat. Angie Harmon showed a bad performance like Kate, and at the last moment he was worse with a seemingly permanent space-breaking dialogue written by the fifth grade student. An example would be to say "Chirag". in a similar way, shows how much of a human body can show up to half an hour to crash. Finally, the editing of this movie was the most strange and terrible I have ever seen. Cameramen was a giant champion who was given cameras by scholars. An example of this would suddenly be the moment when we suddenly close the lantern in the Alex's car. I do not think it's time to fix this movie. The end was completely miserable. The writers are clearly the viewer's "oh yes!" They tried to create a series of mysterious plot lines that they were saying. Instead, we left some to view some generous paintings in a spider-matching line. Unfortunately, there is not a million prospects for this movie to be a festering shit piece. <br /> <br /> I give it 10 to 10. This film was filmed instead of being a picture book.
