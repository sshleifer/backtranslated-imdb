So, my husband and I have completed it, despite some dangers from both of us, to complete it. In most of the stories, this was the worst part of the film, and there was only a little excitement. The motion indicator came to the point where we shouted a few times during very bad scenes (like the church lady). The deceased brother used paranormal means to communicate with the green twins, but instead, he tried to scare the hell out of view of things. On the contrary, let's replace the police - I'm sure that this tap I find is a DNA on all of these pistols - instead of preparing a terrible plan to "buy" the person who killed his brother by accident. I call it a terrible plan, because in the end, the film also allows him to kill. Bad dialogue, bad move, bad end.
