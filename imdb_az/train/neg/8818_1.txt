A stupid boy who is traumatized when he finds Santa and just a strange movie is not real (???). She grows up and grows up (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of naughty or beautiful people. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> If you're looking for in case, not here. Only a few murders are demonstrated and they're not cowardly, which has a very fraudulent effect. Most of the film is just talking to Brandon Maggart himself and slowly becoming insane. The scenario is strange, the player is strange, and it brings me an end to the entertainment on television. Seriously, I was not sure if I was back in the band and waiting again. <br /> <br /> If you are not afraid of a frightening Christmas sniper's "Black Christmas" (original 70s version --- Terrible repetition). Avoid all this.
