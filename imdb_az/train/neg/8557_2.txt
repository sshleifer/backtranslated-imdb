Am I admired for being 'kissing my mouth' because of being sincere? especially from the founder / director Joe Swanberg, sharp hair cutting and masturbating. They were not afraid to show the truth to everyday "special" events. Unfortunately, although the film's jealousy is somewhat improved, it falls into the "The Brown Bunny" world. Yes, does "Bunny" mean nothing, or does it not reflect much of kinematographic shots (or heartfelt memories)? legs, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, you can see why this movie was left and why people are leasing: real-life scenes and full frontal (both men's and women's) nudity. However, full time has been spent. We quickly learn about a male male / female roommate pair, so the man's men have clear feelings for the woman who sees her as a friend while continuing her sexual intercourse with her ex-girlfriend. Apart from that, we are exposed to the events of drilling everyday: they work for their parents; works on a very informal sexual information project on his computer. To do this, dialogue should be interesting and moving. It's boring, meaning "The Brown Bunny", neither for work nor for watching an hour drive. The only actor is Kate Winterich and even some suspect players. (In addition to Mike's DVD, you'll actually need to watch / listen). Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, not to be afraid to draw them all and to expose themselves or their shower, but in general they fall flat. Excuses that are incompatible with the scenes, the day-to-day dull events and the sincere efforts you have made, why not rent it, except for a mild porn factor?
