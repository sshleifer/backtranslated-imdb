I've seen the worst movies, but I'm so tired of how bad these movies are. The killer wolf is really a really bad thing, mostly a man in a green body suit. B movie has something to move on, but you do not think of anything second, it's nothing like hell. In fact, there was a substance with substance, but it was still very stupid. Basically its a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as the titanic, this sucks the balls, this is just one thing. In this film, blood is really fake. The new nation, all the horrors of low-grade horses, seems stupid. A terrible death scene with real fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
