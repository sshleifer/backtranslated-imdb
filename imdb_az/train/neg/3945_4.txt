My modesty is a low-budget movie about Modesty Blaise's story. Not that movie is terrible, it's not just what I expect and hoping. For a few years, though, I have been aware of the misery of Blaise, I do not know much about comic strips or graphic novels, so I come to this movie as an outsider. This can be part of my frustration. I was expecting more fun and more comedy. The film is directed to dialogue. I think we were looking for something less than camping cost. So my modesty is a deadly film. Very few, if any, have "light" moments. At least there is nothing that is acceptable, but outstanding at Alexandra Staden. In the opinion of others, the main role is somewhat weaker to be completely convincing. What action scenes are at my step, Cameroon is one of the weakest points in the movies. <br /> <br /> I hope Quentin Tarantino is going ahead and has made a huge budget movie based on Blaise's misery. I'm convinced that understanding has a lot of potential and I am very glad.
