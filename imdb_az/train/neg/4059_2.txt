Rarely such a surprising cast has been spent a lot. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro, all jumped to the ship to collide with a script that was just nothing but a joke Hollywood. Martin Scorsese's name would probably be equal, but the result is less than the sum of his parts. It looks like a nightmare, it's wrongly gone wrong, and every scene looks even more profitable. "Search and destruction" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, dissatisfied nonsense, and the entire film is undecided ........ MERK
