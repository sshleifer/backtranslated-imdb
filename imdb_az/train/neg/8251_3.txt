ABOUT LOVE ABOUT TRUTH (this is a double entry on the star?) If you fit into white noise or sound sounds, you have nothing left of the store shelves and you need to bend after no day because you put it in the DVD slot. <br /> <br /> With his wife, Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt), it's pretty straightforward to be married. Sam (Jimi Mistry) put his life in love because of the law that deals with dealing. His partner, Archie (Dougray Scott), likes both Sam and Alice, and attracts Alice for a long time. Alice cheats with her sister, Felicity (Kate Miles), a free lover who encourages Alice to do the job. On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice sends a card to Sam Sam's Anonymous signed up as a test to see his sincerity test test. At the same time, Archie sends a racist seed package to Alice and has not written a love affair. Both of them regret the past for the truth. Sam actually spends time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and really cheats Alice. Alice Sam organizes appointments with emails and phone calls, and prepares to meet with Sam to disguise "Anonymous" to test his loyalty. <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> English comedies the quality of writing and the quality of the motion quality. Perhaps the director John Hay was selected to give English actress Alice as a fake hit on Jennifer Love Hewitt. But in the end, Peter Bloor splashes between these lightweight humorous and miserable messages. A terrible awakening is a consecutive high-grade music account that covers and interferes with all dialogue. There are several beautiful scenes in London and a few minutes of passive humor, but in the end this little movie is really used as a good background music / white noise. Grady Harp
