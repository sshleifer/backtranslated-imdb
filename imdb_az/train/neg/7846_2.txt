You know, I was forced to go, saying, "Traces have eyes". In fact, I enjoyed the original and the reconstruction was very fun. Of course, there was more money to throw around because Wes Craven had made special effects for the second time around. Although I could still pretend to be an original movie, remake was good and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any admirer of fears. <br /> <br /> Which brings us "Hounds of eyes 2". Man, where should I start? Lack of paper or paper is slim. There is still no new ground here. He decided to follow the military region, and all this was missing. What will we do now? Send it to the National Guard to explore. In the true Hollywood style we need to see them the most terrible and worst soldiers. Gee, I have not seen that moment before. To make a long story short, mutants kill one of the heroic soldiers graphically in a single moment. Once again, Nicotero's special effects are great, but it does kill, regardless of how the graph can be drilled and predicted. Honestly, this flick was simply for fast money. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring and scary. It would be nice for me to have an original idea in this movie. Craven and her son shared their writing assignments and met with my favorite horror movies, but unfortunately not one of them.
