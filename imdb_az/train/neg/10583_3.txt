I'm sorry to say that, but those who act in this movie are terrific. Dialog is the first time it sounds when reading its own lines. Perhaps I accidentally got the "costume ready" version. The director is likely to act slowly during special effects like an attempt to compensate actors for their bad performance. The story is very well written and the sequence of struggles is better than I have seen in many action films. The battles are quite realistic. But all of these are left behind by two leading actors, many miraculous, free automatic weapons fire, bombs, sophisticated tours and basookas. Enemy soldiers, some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when there's a truck that flies about 30 miles from the 30-kilometer residential area, and every basooke kick is at least 50 meters away. This bazookas needs serious site calibration.
