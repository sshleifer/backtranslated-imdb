If someone does not illuminate me, there's really no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but far from it. This film tells a story about a New York press agent and his problems. And, mostly, all. When this agent is played by Pacino, it is important to think that this should be something important. But it's not hard to figure out how senseless this film is. Al Pacino, one of the best actors in the world, is the second film of the year (Simone), the title of "The most boring and trivial movie of the year." So what will happen, Al?
