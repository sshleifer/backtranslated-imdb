It could have been an interesting movie with all its accounts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is either cliché or humorous. The Short Story Anthology structure was carried out with deaths (and better) in the seventies and eighties. Of course, the idea of ​​a "sick room" was lowered, but it was left out by writing and acting as bad as most of the film. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write a dialogue. With the chief police investigation, every penalty is full of disbelief and humility (typical "outside police" type, funny, I've seen somewhere else ...) Xan Chandon, you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. BAD sounds. Moving on very horrible castings (but not me wrong, Dani Filth is not a great singer and musician, but not an actor) ludicrously add OTT and performances beyond the laughable for burstingly cringing. <br /> <br /> Visual impacts have affected all the poor, some with damaged CGI, horrifying dark effects (Peter Jackson has done better and less than ten years ago) and OVER-USE shriek that filters! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> - Do not push inside the audience. seventy and seventies, and many good frightening films in the eighties, this is a very good improvement (eg, manic, zombie feeders, beyond, doubts, etc.), better frightening, cowardly, in my opinion second degree and <br /> Shandon hoping to learn from this filthy betrayal of a film and create a heartwarming quality of horror. <br /> <br /> The nearest chance is better.
