I know that John Singleton created a clever man's "Boyz N The Hood", how he wrote and directed him? This is like a bad pilot, the "first-time college" teenage soap, drill stereotypes, and a series of illegal abusive parades for clicks on a commercial offer. Who is the victim of historical aggression who wants to slaughter sausages for seafood? An angry loner would be set up by a group of neo-Nazis (and black and split by a Jew - just laughs!) Even the creepy reaction history of Laurence Fishburne Profesor only annoyed me and I love it, like everyone involved with this movie, lost. Except Busta Rhymes except. Big ups.
