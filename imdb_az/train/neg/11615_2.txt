Although Sam Rockwell was not an admirer, I was surprised to see his name at the opening of Joshua. Heck, I did not know that there was 'Joshua' until I opened the movie. So, I'm telling you, not a movie. Some kind of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Omen' or another devilish child's film 'Joshua' has been billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow and straight. Nevertheless, I continued to see how to solve this problem, and beyond belief, I hoped that some of the lights would be the ending issue. Okay, I admit, it was (it's a bit over), but how old is a rooted attachment. And how little is the lower budget movie, or at least how they did it. One Fall? you do not see the drop, you see someone lying in the bloodstream. A man hit a taxi? you do not see it, you see someone complain about a bike. I'm not sure whether this is a "style" or laziness, or simply a lack of funds for special effects. You have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a working father, trying to balance everything, a child? Many people who can be flooded and born newborn can cry. Does he cry like we see how old he lives? And what about this? Do you have rats or Yeshu above? His mother's nuts? Joshua is crazy? Is he jealous of the newcomer? Will Michael grow up to become Myers? Or does he lead his family to his throne? I do not think so. They were previously nuts and no "wordy" movement did not believe me anymore. Unfortunately, any questions have been answered, but any open doors have been closed. I'm sure it might have been a thought, but give me something for Pete. Everything. There are plenty of wild and wild movies to explore. Joshua is more like the Dajjal's Mini-Mei.
