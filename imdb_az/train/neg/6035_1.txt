I can really vote for it, because I think 83 minutes of my life, following the worst horror film I've ever had, have wasted. The movement was just terrible, I say almost bad, the dialogue has worsened, it's called as it's written ... I do not think anything terrible enough to say. And "outside" and "in-night" shots think that the events took a couple of days. In a strange way, you can move, manage, write, and so on. And so on. INCLUDE ALL PARTICIPANTS FROM PARTNERS. If my only saving grace was far from hell, by doing good, this does not mean that the world is watching it. This is a real reason why horror movies are not taken seriously.
