Last week, I looked at the weekly Nielsen rating and was Veronica Mars, supposedly, "You do not watch the best show". <br /> <br /> Well, they were not right. we watch it. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest index in any national broadcast network ... and it is worth it. I tried several times to see the whole press as a "great" show, a "realistic view" in life, and all this nonsense. The truth was different. Veronica Mars is a hole. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is what CW, after two years, has been forced to open the show for the first time in memory, the only reason Mystery caused. commercial and artistic failure.
