Michael Callan is a smarmy photographer who appears to have been regarded as a perfect "catch" by any woman facing him; Can the film be associated with the truth that it has prepared? He is a "hero", which is very difficult to become "empathy", so the film is the problem of the beginning. But difficulties do not end there. Television film has a production value (check the head or cuff next) and endless betrayal is not possible when I do not want to see the movie. Let's just say that the killer know more than we know.
