Generally speaking, despite the unpleasant structure and expensive production, the director can do great miracles as to how many cultural mistakes can be made. Where were Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Apparently, it's not about salary. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend danced loudly in some of the cultural absurdities he had seen in front of his eyes. Later on, he says, "I'm filming a movie starring in Fnnish, which uses Swedish actors as a merging force and Frenchman." In a worse era, Scarlet O'Hara lost her females at a time while she was missing and 1950 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> or the Japanese gown was painful and it was the subject of the movie! Hollywood movie is so beautiful in terms of myopic appearance, because the big money is often turned into something big, and I think the sensitivity of the films is a shameful mistake. A good film to achieve is a bad one: The geisha's memories are at the same time embarrassingly good and bad.
