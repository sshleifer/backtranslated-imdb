Plot Presentations: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, who built the Victorian Tunnel, was killed along with his comrades. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, are separate. Twenty-five years later, Alex, a Karate trainer in Los Angeles, a traitor who lives in Chad and Hong Kong, claims his father's killing and the tunnel right. <br /> <br /> For the second time, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have previously worked together as "Lionheart". This is the first of three films to play Van Damm's dual role ("Maximum Risk" and "Duplicator"). A very simple idea of ​​the revenge of the land is the fact that Van Damm has two different people, the sole substitute for the film? prissy rich child & rough & chomping chiffon, cigar challenging boy. Perhaps Van Damme does not do a good job in both roles, but Aleksin's purchase is soft. The brothers are surprised at the misunderstanding of each other with different dresses and different haircuts. Bolo Yeung is a very deserved one for the baddies.
