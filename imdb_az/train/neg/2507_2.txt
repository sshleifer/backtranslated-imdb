This is not a good movie. It did not leave, there was a naked story that you see is something that's all about to go wrong and thousands of times. You can see each plot point away from a mile. All the worst, no one can not be disturbed by saying Lonette Mckee. But whoever betrays it is so damn cursed. But I'm not leaving anything new here. Bottom-line uses a hot girl band, some look like drugs, some connect with a boy, someone goes into hell, and then horrible things happen. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music business. I believe there are a great number of people in it. As for the Black Film Evaluation, many of you would like to use a slider scale. I do not play it! If you want to support these films to see them - great! If you love it - super! Each one to himself. But do not try to say that it is good. Pleineease! I would like the colorful nations to like black-eyed actors against such films. Want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or violet purple. Players will have these great movies, regardless of the color of their skin. Why? After leaving the theater, they told you interesting stories with pretty big players causing you to feel something for a long time. Because our practice does not automatically make a good movie. Only good - good. Period.
