In 1988, I became a great Lynn Peterson admirer of the film "Far North" and although I liked the movie "Slow" (2004), starring "Francis", I'm sure that Linne , all of you (or should) play an important role in the "Driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the other was very scared of Lynn's incredible performance, and this movie is not really a big deal. <br /> <br /> Wait - there was something else - a great creativity to correct the cursing of television viewers. <br /> <br /> O.K., "You are your son's weapon!", "You are the son of your son", "Shoot!", "Forget about you!" As memorable lines. Yes. <br /> <br /> P.S .: Does anyone know that I can get another Lynn Peterson poster?
