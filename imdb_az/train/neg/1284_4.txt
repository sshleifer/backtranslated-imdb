This film was a long structure with no insecurity. In the end, those who talk about the sword must either be foolish, or not. Often this movie was soft. Soft movies were not bad. But no matter how flawless it may be, the T-bone has no place to bake. This film should have been revenge for crimes committed against a civilization, but it was a small bar. There was only one who knew what the sword was. The character of Tim Roth (and yes, she plays well for her). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" who had no knowledge of how the sword was being used and the "win" way was a disgrace. As a drama, this film has been a period of time, but its best performance should go to the nature of Scotland. This book is a "soap" impression.
