I will try not to let so many spoilers. Normally I am very pleased with Robin Williams movies, but this gem was not one of them. It was billed as a voltage tension. It was a night listening. To be blunt there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, two reasons came out for a good reason. The film was written in my opinion poorly written and directed. The player was good but still there was nothing to work with. About a storyteller who reads a good book by a child who died in the film. However, * strange here * nobody can check for the existence of children. Thus, the author of Williams goes to Viskons to try and find, but he is the excuse for all headache and boy guard. That's all. Wait an hour and a half and wait for the movie to end. There was a lot of excitement and fever like visiting a dental office. Homosexual excessive or overtones had nothing to do with the story, and the film was a bit unbelievable, but there was no reason to throw it down, and they gave it a little. It is impossible to write a truly worthwhile review of this film in life, because it was attractive when watching dry, because it was nothing. I gave him 2 because he was not ruled by Uwe Boll.
