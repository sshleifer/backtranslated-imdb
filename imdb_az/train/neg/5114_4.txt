This movie was bad. Bad act, bad routing, bad writing. But funny was not bad. It was dingy bad. I looked at the "Surface of the Air" because it could have been a laugh. It was not. The mistake did not work. There are more pleasant ways to spend an hour or half to paint dry or to read the dictionary. Seriously.
