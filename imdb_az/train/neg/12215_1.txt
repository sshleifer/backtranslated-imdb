I almost had my time stolen and I took it to see this movie and it was a terrible experience. Faye Ann Lee is an awesome actress and is sincere in this film. Larryjoe76 is a clear clay review. The subtlety of the field is minimal, Cantonese dialogue is not funny. <br /> <br /> Prince Tang David Tang should be after the movie that this movie has little or no income. The banal plot tries to compete with other rom-coms there, and is merely a d√©cor. This paint was like dry watch. In short, this movie is a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on YouTube.
