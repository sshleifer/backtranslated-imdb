I'm a great Steven Seagal fan. Hell is likely to be so heavy, though I do not have street paper on the playground. Expressing his self-esteem and love for America's beloved body and screen heroism, this is a hard heart for me not to declare that it is the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> Major problems with this film may be post-production. It is obvious that this film should have a different story. This is the result of fierce sounds that resulted in Steven's inattentive noise. The correction has come to an end, and in the beginning it's getting worse and worse, and in the end you're wishing to re-elect Da Vinci's Code. <br /> <br /> Well, that's bad. <br /> <br /> Then I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me to listen to their CDs. When do I start direct control of Van Damme for DVD drop logs? If you do not want to watch this movie, remove your eyes and clean them from the toilet. A dark life is better than 89 minutes.
