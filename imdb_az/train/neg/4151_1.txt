This is the best film film ever since Ed Wood's death. <br /> <br /> I can not spoil the latter because I did not know what happened. But I will do my best. There are some kinds of delightful vampires, but they can keep the changing organs, so it can be any character or may not be the character that needs to think, or it may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> Does voice mixed? It is not as confused as you can imagine, because it is illogical to start with none of the characters. No plot, no character development, and random people speak a few lines and then disappear, never heard. Vampires may have enemies *, probably zombies, but there is a consistent sleep type in a mental hospital, so none of them happened and the hallucination of all the main characters. <br /> <br /> Progress? Both leading girls take their shirt for a short time. Special effects are just mental-boggling (especially the incredibly slow, difficult fight circles). Everyone has a really whimsical Canadian accent, which adds to the stunning overall level. <br /> <br /> The rent price is good. We laughed as we cried.
