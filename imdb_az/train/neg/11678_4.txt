An unsatisfactory, unconvincing heist film for me. With an A-List, especially with three potentials and an experienced coach like Spike Lee, I've long been waiting for them and eventually felt less of the sub-genre of this movie. For a start, I did not like the pacing of Clive Owen's raison d'etre, short cut short film, and after unnecessary repetition, finding a striking pepper-winning story, non-realistic witnessing interviews does not mean that you have started in the sense jumped into the scenes. Of course, the camera business is continuing and combining hand-held cameras, but director Lee does not give rise to the excitement or endurance of doing nothing with the main heroes of the movie. Denzel Washington spoke with his shirt and bad donkey about thirty-five years ago (he even understands her, but she is a "hot" (a little bit clear and inappropriate "dirty talk" ) and its mild "The Night Of Heat" raffle only one surge with the riff Willem Defoe (almost partly) Clive Owens is determined with English accent, because we believe that ablution is Arab-based and that 90% Jodie Foster, his patented lighthouse, ice-cream, sub-Clarice Starling, is a good-looking hunter, if it does not have any effect, but in fact, the title is actually spoiler, and in fact, a real mish-mash movie with a bright, but obvious twist The worst scene is undoubtedly an 8-year-old son of a street It's Washington's testimony, but it's about a few minutes before the same child's story is close to these embarrassing shares, including the characters from the classic heist movies like Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. But there is no honor to praise him. Instead of "The Hot Rock" more ... and even good for a few laughs.
