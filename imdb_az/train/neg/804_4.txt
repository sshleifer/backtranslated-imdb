I'm proud of this film because it's incredibly incredible. Judge for yourself. Please note that the following will not only prove, but will also disrupt your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, developed by a patient with a nerd, sends a code through television screens. computer monitors. Code - in the form of light - when entering the eye can enter your body's 'electrical system'. What forces body cells to release calcium? Within an hour after the infection, the patient reaches the neck, develops the tunnel vision, turns the skin into calcium, then falls, cracks the hand and arm in the chalk cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very clever. When a blind computer expert tries to extinguish the code with the braille output device - the device is built on a very high voltage, causing severe burns on the head of the expert. The virus is also remotely controlled and aggression against the ATM keyboard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
