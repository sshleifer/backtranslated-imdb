I heard such a praise about this game, and decided to watch it when I ran over the cable. I do not see how it strengthens these "women" and their "struggles" by paying attention to this issue. This is for you if you are interested in stories about the special parts of women and how they affect their lives. Otherwise, it's pretty dull and boring. <strong> <br /> <strong> So, "without getting it" is not just one person .
