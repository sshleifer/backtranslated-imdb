In a year, I discovered that a rock star had produced his latest album before his death, which if it were not the best, is usually productive and worth the listening at least. The album is really good enough to make a legacy cement. However, when it comes to comedians, the final film of the main cartoon, which is full of stars in their car, is generally God's fear. John Belushi's "Neighbors", John Candy "Wagon East", Chris Farley "Almost Heroes", Phil Hartman "Small Soldiers" and Rodney Dangerfield had this movie. <br /> <br /> "Dangerfild's most recent film, though, is poor in every sense of the story, and it is safe to say that Dangerfield would still be on the shelves if he was still filmed in 2002. Dangerfild's great fan, because I was in my early ages, and I did not see how this movie was rotten. <br /> <br /> Start with a very weak foundation to join a movie, Dangerfield, a great comedian, often a prison director with a team of close-knit prisoners playing in the movie, Colonel-Tom-Parker-Sam-Walton's billionaire Eli Rockwood (Randy Quaid), a prisoner in custody, releases a prison inmate, sends a group of prisoners to the prison, Rockwood's eponymous convenience stores return to prison with endless goods, and loot. <br /> <b r /> Those who think Rockwood believes he / she is owed (I suppose) taking the ones inside the shops. <br /> <br /> With this unparalleled premiere, film acne and frequent stalls. At the same time, the jokes that you think will be saved will not even ridicule Mr. Rahmat. It is incredibly disappointing for you to expect a movie with Oscar nominee (!), Which has at least a little funny, with Randy Quaid, Kirstie Alley, Gilbert Gottfried, Ed Begley Jr, Yeardley Smith and others. Instead, Quaid plays a character in many comedies that we've seen before, Alley plays a British surprise with a terrific English accent (this movie could not afford a true Englishman!) And every joke, almost every member of this ensemble . There was no good comedy in any sense. <br /> <br /> "Back to night" R is basically rated for language (and a nudity scene). This is a mockery of the fact that many of the jokes insult such a viewer, even if the children (if you do not correct your language) get out of this movie. Physical gags are incredibly predictable, especially the Alley's pet monkey quaid character suffering. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is the Oscars winning substance here. Indeed, Dangerfield has previously made some great, timeless comedies. "Easy Money" and "Back To School" are still not fun and definitely the smallest of Oscar-winning ones. But there is a difference between making a funny comedy and making a dumb comedy. The last kind of comedy and filmmakers did not even try, which seems to be the pretext of this lump 90 minute wasted. Peace in Rodney, but add this movie to the party of unforgettable comedies such as "Wally Sparks Meet" (1997) and "The Godson" (1999). This movie is not worth seeing, even telling it.
