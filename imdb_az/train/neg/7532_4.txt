One thing I really love about the short films of this woman is inadequate, especially in the subject of "Happiness." <br /> <br /> This movie has some amazing startups - an unusual place and a strange kinematic treatment, but it does not succeed with the exhilarating exposure dialogue, light speeches, and television coverage. <br /> The usual movie. Ideas have clarified such things that they almost feel like a television ad. <br /> <br /> I can not appeal a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> I really would like to see that the director is full of length and works with a producer who does not require much boring. clarity
