This movie is one of the most terrifying horror flicks I've ever seen. Length was not long enough to include a good storyline. Also, the way the parents died was simply ridiculous. Mom dies suddenly after a move figure, and the father is shot by a police officer? I can see where some of the peculiarities are, but it would be better. Also, he wanted to stop this smoothness before stopping me. After he heard Lucy's name and realized that he was a "Lucifer," he wanted to close me. Yes, Lucifer was a woman, but it is interesting to look at her name. This is the name of a name. This should be given to a person's character. In general, the film was a hole and could use a better area.
