Men in Polynesia drink alcohol, fight and speak sexually, stupid and unfunny. Real life Polynesians are more funnier than stereotypes, carton characters. The alleged Samoan girl seemed to have not seen or moved Samoan, but seemed more like a white lady in sexual relations with anyone. If you are weakened as a water story line, I can not say anything about the actor - even the brightest actors could do nothing with this script. We are sorry to see Polynesian actors and only two or three "jokes" who want to play such a sad stereotype in a movie without a good scene. How much lost kiwi taxpayer money is a lost opportunity to shoot a big movie about a vibrant community. It's best not to shoot a movie if they are as bad and unhappy as they are.
