Drew Barrymore is an actress who has not only been in his career but also has had a bad time in his personal life. After many children actresses, she became confused with low quality mediocre films. When it is restored from dark past, this movie remains to remind Drew Barrymore's worst days. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting point reminiscent of Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain"; a plot that deals with many personality disorders that identify the story for a fright or tension. <br /> <br /> Barrymore Holly Gooding looks like a young woman who wants to create a new life after a traumatic event in California. <br /> <br /> Suddenly his past is to follow him, as in life he wants to destroy the new life of his evil personality and the newly discovered love. In the midst of chaos, her new companion Patrick Horsmith (George Newbern) will help Holly meet the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma's baseless triller, most Doppelganger is a single film, which is one of the worst results of the film, accomplishing only one purpose. Barrymore is certainly not good, though he tries to manage his dignity above average performance. <br /> <br /> One of the largest cities in the Caucasus is quite open. While the film is trying to be genuine by giving literary references in any number, the dialogs are dim and wooden, of course, does not do any good. <br /> <br /> These makeup effects are made by outstanding KNBs and really are some good things in the movie. However, the stereo use of the contextual end result completely reduces the impact of the CCP's work and can surprise anyone in a different film. <br /> <br /> This B -Movie is no better excuse for its low quality, as it could be an interesting movie with a better and more related script. Unfortunately, everything we're here is the worst-case movie in every second. He deserves the beauty of Barrymore. 3/10
