I am an enthusiastic fan of Lucio Fulci, and I still want to say that in 1988 he was a disappointment with two directors of the "Zombie Flesh Enameles 2" Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso. Compared to Fulci's great self-owned Gore classic "Zombie 2" (aka "Zombie Felsh Eaters" / "Zombie") in 1979, this is a great disappointment. Of course, the 4.5 low rating shows that there is not a good movie, but I love these low prices usually people who are not included in the Italian Zombie Fly, and I am fond of Italian Horror movies and Low-Cost Operation Cinema Classists. Only many films rated very low. Also, many of my friends, Italian Horror enthusiasts, admit this movie unfounded. The film said it was not a complete disaster. It's always a pleasure to watch Fulci's heartbreak effects, an Italian Horror / Gore buff. The main idea behind the film is not bad (though far from original) and I liked the depiction of military violence. Unfortunately, it is about this. The great predecessor of "Zombie 2" is very scary, but this is not a creepy thing, it is not a minute creepy or intimidating, and the only real reason to watch the heartburn and often strange eye "Zombie 3". The film is sometimes entertaining to watch, but just like a fear and an unusual comedy. It was mostly unhappy with Fulci and, first, Mattei and Fragasso, who deal with a number of terrible cats (like D'Amato's "Porn Holocaust"), and secondly, one of the worst films is the God-terrible "Troll 2 ". In general, this is definitely awaited, but one of all the Fulci movies I have ever seen is definitely the worst and I have seen most of the great repertoire of this great director. I am a Fulci admirer and I will always be, but this is not his magic moment. Gore might be entertaining, but it is recommended to watch another Fulci movie before that!
