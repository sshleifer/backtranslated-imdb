Writer / Director Peter Greenaway, 8 ½ The woman is trembling as the Supreme Lord of Art House Pretension, his latest workout in his happiness. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son in mutual studies for sexual satisfaction . this premise can be attacked and the chance to do so is Greenaway. Women's symbols are fewer than a catalog of food for two heroine heroes. Kabuki-obsessed Mio, Giaconda and Beryl, who are pregnant, have something for farm animals. Giulietta does not have legs and uses a wheelchair, is he a "half-woman"? <br /> <br /> <strong> Denies all accusations against people living in the Caucasus, but what if this is not it? <br /> <br /> The film is erotic of everything and everything that belongs to Japan, the 1996 "Bedding" book. But where the Bedding Book is erotic and elegant, 8 ½ Women are just brutal and exploiting. GreenWay's work is tasteless and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person who can do anything to watch it is auteur.
