****** ADMINISTRATIONS ****** <br /> The unfinished radio quiz hosts Kyser and his mediocre band Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre show an excuse to get a mild paycheck, sporatically insulting homeless haunted house . Lugosi is a magician, a magician, exposed as a fraudulent attempt to disintegrate; Carloff is a cocktail, and Lorre is a professor who exposed fraudulent discoveries, but it appears that we are in compromise with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and the 30-year-old "kids" group reveal the truth at least with humor on the way. Absolute horror is not complementary, no recommendation.
