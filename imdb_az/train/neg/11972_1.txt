The first ten minutes of Just Looking really directs the majority of this movie. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy living in New York in the 50's. There is a desire to see two people having sex. Who is the best people in his opinion? Of course, mother and stepfather! What a pleasure it is. Unfortunately, for Lenny, he is caught before seeing something and is sent to the spring to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see her uncle and her husband's sex. However, his wife is very pregnant and does not sleep at the same time. Then Lenny is a new friend. She and her friends spend most of their time hanging around a few girls. There are some clubs that sit in all the places they talk about and talk about sex. The problem is ... innocent, seductive, in the 1950s. I'm not prude in any way, but it's very uncomfortable to talk about masturbation, blowjobs, and anal sex. This type of rawness can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but it seems simply devoid of it. <br /> <br /> The Gretchen Mol is here as the Hedgehog, the former column model, which is part of the object. Lenny's wishes. Jason Alexander should stay as far as possible from the director's chair. "Being Better or Bad" (1996), so terrible and now. Which is a waste. 1/10
