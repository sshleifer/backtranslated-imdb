All Biker must compose the worst films produced by the film genre. These are many battles, a lot of blood and bikers fighting with Indians and an old city that suddenly resulted in the blast and splitting of a sack. Leadership is terrible. Robert Walker, Jr. what happened? At one point, he was in the production of several large studios, and then he just blew. This film is actually a blow, but if you have not seen Biker for a long time, it's a good thing to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit embarrassed for watching it!
