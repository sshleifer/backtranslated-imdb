Okay, this is how it is for the original - it's a rich old geezer, leaving its property for the elderly, all unwanted losers, and two scary servants, even if they spent the week in a jolted old house. It will surprise those who have not seen a single movie or television show that night. After a murder killing of victims, restaurant kerchups appear to be bleeding, there is a painful open twist to the end. The cast is headed for several times because of the hopelessness of respected actors for their salaries. At the same time, there are a few secondary players who have been raised but have already been forgotten. As a result, the film creates all the drama and mystery of the episode "Matlock". I'll give you a credit - the closing scene is smart and entertaining, you still wake up.
