bad actors, bad accents, inappropriate cinematography, terrible script ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie at the final film festival and after inspiring it I was very inspired. Quotations / unquote name are talent, but they do not deliver. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is an unequal and uninterrupted story that is the basis of it. <br /> Do not worry
