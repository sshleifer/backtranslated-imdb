Everyone who sees the original is in need of this terrible remake and the destruction. Alex Baldwin, trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for repetition, does not just work. Baldwin has some striking work, but it's a flop from beginning to end. McQueen had a charisma, do not try to compete with a star. Who is in the role of Ali McGraw? McQueen looked as dangerous, dangerous and convincing as the Doc, the film was excited and excited, Baldwin and the company made it a comedy, and once laughed when I saw this strange movie. And this is a terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, one of the more intriguing and convincing actors of today! Make-ups did it for Michael, they knew what they were thinking. Make sure you want to see the movie structure under the leadership of Sam Peckinpah!
