What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant filmmaker, a charming knife ... now sits very deeply ... Is the same person driving the "Last Picture Show"? Here's a bit of a fascinating (pre-populated) place and turns the first spark into a bubble losing its moment ... Dunst is not bad, but like Izzard Chaplin, and all other actors appear not to have their "appearance" because they It was true for some. Very bad. Again, I'm going to rent "Paper Bear".
