Gee, that was an unhappy movie! I do not understand why people are very scary about "The Grudge". The director plays a game (I must admit it in a very good way, bring a very stylized life) and then repeats for the rest of the movie. As a result, I was thrilled several times in the first quarter of the film, but once I knew that I was asleep immediately as Grudge could be more predictable in minutes. In the end, we can say that in the genre there are better films at the beginning, the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was strange and the ticket for The Grudge was a waste of money.
