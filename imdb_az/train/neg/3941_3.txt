This is what happens in China, though the local video store is exquisite with English headlines. Yes, it's like the Romanian cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < even with a beach archery scene on the flashback. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, when they stay in Bucharest, this mystery and many other problems continue to utilize hopeless comedians. <br /> The movie is like this. It's sad.
