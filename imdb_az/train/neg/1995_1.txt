Yes, I paid one dollar for this DVD and even was not worth it. <br /> <br /> Neagle is an ugly British castle, despite its glory, its award and its glory, that can not read or dance. or move. <br /> <br /> Some nice old Hollywood actors thought they were a classic that they were exhibiting here. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most interesting and talented femme on the screen. He was wrong. It was incredibly popular in England before and after the Second World War. His "serious" roles are even more proud than his musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Famous songs include only a few places and are not well presented. Skip one and find the Doris Day star. You will receive at least a few realistic comedy and professional style dances!
