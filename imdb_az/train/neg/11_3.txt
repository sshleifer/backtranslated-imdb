<br /> <br /> If you're viewing Corey Large's IMDb, it looks like there's a movie called "Re-download" on the production (June 08) while playing a character called Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, <br /> How do I know if this kind of malignant film does not get the next earnings? And secondly, Sebastian was not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I was struggling with an insomnia in the morning, and though it was dragged inside and outside. I'm convinced that I ran away from some stations, but in general, it seemed really weak. Great performance (for me) was one of the strongest parts of the film. I was a little surprised by all the people who commented on the beautiful girls, because I thought Brooke was a great actress, but not exclusively.
