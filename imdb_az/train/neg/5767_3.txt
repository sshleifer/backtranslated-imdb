As it was said before, visual effects are striking. They breathe. I'm personally using Blender as a graphic and not as easy as ALL. But this is the whole film. It is not confusing, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, on the first stage, Proog and Emo try to escape who knows who they are. The conflict here is between man and nature. When he enters the bottomless pit room, Proog says, "you're out of step and you're not dead." Here there is a more precise conflict between man and nature. As the film progresses, there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly Proog, there is a confrontation between man and man by the murder of Emo from nowhere. The proverb is changing immediately from the guardianship, when the missing child is a "sick man". He betrays us. It is not only difficult, but we are not interested, because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. It's not a story about a powerful man who emerged through war. It is striking and does not give a sign because there is no truth about the world that illuminates the human soul as a great truth or great drama. In my opinion, the movie has dramatically developed in all respects. But the graphics are striking, but one movie is more than just eye candy. No truth, struggle and a bad surprise does not end. As a result, a little developed movie without a single point. ... but graphics are good.
