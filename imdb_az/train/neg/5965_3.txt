In 1454, the magician Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was slaughtered in France and his hand Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was subjected to torture, vampirism and torture. They cursed the future generations of the executioners before they died. The spirit of Alaric de Marnac (Hugo de Marnac) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) these days (the eighth). Hugo decided to travel to Villas de Sade in his family's village, seeking a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and deceive Mabille and bring the local people to death. After his father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that Thor, who was hiding in a well, was a Hammer lace; Together with Maurice, Demoniac tried to defeat Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend, I bought a horror genre that I was dropping to $ 9.98 with Paul Nasin's five DVDs; Although I did not refer to it, I decided to take a chance. The first DVD, which was not cut and restored, "The Hero Shines Out" is a B (or C) movie that recalled Ed Wood immediately. A funny story scenario, direction, performance, cinematography, decoration, special effects, and publications and most of the naked women are described. The result is not mere fun, and I can guarantee the Ed Wood's style. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
