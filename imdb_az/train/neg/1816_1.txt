This movie is really brilliant. For such a swift bumping of human beings, duck, even people do not see past past good sense and general morality. But it does not stop there! This film is hitting the bottom of the barrel and coming back from a very difficult comedy: Korun Beergutted Conan wannabe like his hair with his hair on his hair and does not have anything to do with tomorrow (and he left it in the way I was really amazed at it, or at least the beer gut). Do not miss this movie, it's fantastic with immorality and similar bloody thoughts! After watching one, dry your tears from your eyes (or tears of tears in such an attempt to give advice) because some stupid f00l later gave them 5 dollars!
