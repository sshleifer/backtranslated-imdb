"Bubble," "Friends," or "Beverly Hills 90210", but it's an attempt to make a novel by Romeo & Juliet, an Israeli and Palestinian story. The heroes are as irrelevant as dialogue and cunning line. The film appears to have appeared between smoke and depth. Along with answering questions asked by a small character on the one hand, as well as making an effort to respond to questions such as "Hey, we are here", prepare a poster for a story against the Occupation. Do not buy politics! "In addition to the obvious absurdity of such a line, only one of the many hamburger signals that is directly and indecisive, as the movie's title suggests." On the other hand, the main depth of the film follows the presentation of a game called "Bent" in Nazi campus. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The aggressive soldier, called the Golan, is called the "Jihad" of the bloody brigade. roommate is "Lulu." Everyone who is familiar with Palestinian checkpoints and lives, whether in real life or in documentary films, controls scenes of abs The rest of the flawless fantasy is that when a Palestinian woman enters the fastest record in the record, Israeli soldiers are willing and helpful, and the ambulance appears in just a few minutes. (The result of birth serves to the Palestinians as Israel's benevolence and even paranoid). The point of the test is usually not the anxiety, but the bone, the medical aid or necessity in the event of birth, death, or severe illness, despite the degrading obstacles. Palestinian lover Ashraf, Nablus, Tel Aviv seems to have no problems, no problems, no hassle. She only shows when she loves. <br /> <br /> When the Israelis want to deal with it, they have more difficulty, including a scheme worthy of Lucy Ricardo. <br /> <br /> Do we have absolutely no motivation or purpose against the backdrop of the wonderful, supportive Israelis and the unusual homophobic Palestinians? <br /> <br /> Israeli-Palestinian romanticism with his wife has been staged with more skill and depth than Salem's "Salam / Shalom". <br /> <br /> Some people are in a difficult situation as they want to think. <br /> <br /> True bad movies? Like Ed Wood's works - at least there are some striking features to distinguish them. It even goes for that. The vast majority of voices are heard in noise like Simon and Garfunkel, and even with glamorous gestures on gay sex scenes, the overall lack of coverage of this film is played as mid-week videos.
