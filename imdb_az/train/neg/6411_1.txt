Rotate is one of those films for those niche groups who love movies and at the same time are confused. Sarah Michelle Gellar is an ugly woman who does not kill vampires or she can be naked across the film. I agree to agree with it, but I do not want to agree with the worst arrangement ever combined with meaningful flashbacks. Finally, when he was young he knocked on his car. Or maybe I'm wrong and this was just a flashback. It is impossible to talk to this movie. This cunning, who made the Dark Army, produced this shit? A better idea to stay at home and watch the Dark Army on the Sci Fi channel. There was a whole movie in this movie: naked, zombie and a slave holding a chain. I forgot that there was not one of them.
