This movie can not conceive of its message as "man is evil and evil, animals are sweet and disobedient" or "never go in water." A fishing rod (Nolan) is a killer whale, a very bad thing, but by chance he (CALL ONLY) will hit his cousin instead of a cow - all the feelings - of course, the patient psychopath and the canonical life of the piece - in order to avoid an effective method of self-killing itself, it hurts itself against the propellers trying to finish the most difficult and terrible way. (I doubt that he is the first). When her unborn birth comes to hurt her self-injuring wounds, her husband takes revenge and goes to bed and swears to kill, kill and kill anyone who negotiates with Nolan. <br /> <br /> There are obvious psychics as it is against the film. <br /> <br /> A semi-thought anti-human message in the film, "poor poor whale, bad guys suffer and die!" and it is still impossible for Nola to worship nothing. It is true that he was rational and brutal when putting his motives, but the first whale grew up in his first acne and became more discriminating with whale pain as the movie progressed. <br /> <br /> Nolan reminds us of the last trip to whale movies from a strange north: Referring to Melville's naked man-whale connection and the fact that these two husbands could join each other, they understood that Nola's respect for each other's wife and her unborn child was also an accident. Nola's losing her whale respect and her feeling of missing. But it never goes there. Whale does not have anyone's compassion or respect. <br /> <br /> The final scene loses this focus, and the sea monster finally loses all and Nola's death and checks no doubts. whaling-hugger chomp up (he did a good jerk for her a little earlier). I love animals, and whaling and I love what I love more orca whales, but the purpose of this film was to become a whale victim and the people were bad and embarrassed completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others, and all the whales think that they are killed and exhausted. <br /> <br /> Only one message can be added: "If you are a whale, if you make a wrong step on the FIN path, manage your other way, it will take you to the ends of the earth that destroys everything around you."
