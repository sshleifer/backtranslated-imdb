Although Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are always looking at me, I'm always in the class of actors I'm interested in. <br /> <br /> I have often found Ryan to be an attractive and strange actress in almost all roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth a look. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a very unpleasant character, shortly after the opening credit begins grating in your nerves, and after a few days . That is, Kevin Clan's character is even worse and less unpleasant. So if you normally love these two actors, I recommend that you make a transition.
