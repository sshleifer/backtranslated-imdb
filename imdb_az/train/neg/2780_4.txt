SHAHKI MAKER, undoubtedly, will succeed in Thailand, and similarly, the "Suriyothai Legend" box office records. In 1547, based on the historical background of Siam, Sean Casey's filmmaker, Lek Kitaparaporn's film, has some amazingly beautiful visuals, but is disarmed by the film's most horrific, pedestrian scripts and storytelling. <br /> <br /> The event is related to the arrival of Portuguese wealthist Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch). This revenge shows that revenge on his father's death was thrown into a boat, taken captive and taken into slavery and put in a block in the city of Ayutthaya in Siam. was purchased by a beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of his father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies). There is a way to overthrow the King and Fernando and his new Siam sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul), after some slyness of sophisticated CGI sophisticated choreographic martial arts, once Queen Sudachan is rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards Yoe Hassadeevichit) shows his organization to kill the king and his son to allow his lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to seize Siam's judgment. Of course, Fernando and Tong are condemned to fight each other to escape and save their families (with Tong's spouse and children and Fernando's solid relationship with Maria) with expected results. <br /> <br /> The film is weak, with the exception of John Rys-Davies, that the film is sometimes meant to be a camp. Based on a weak written dialogue, Thailand's competition competition encourages us to use their native Thai subtitles. Ian Livingstone's musical account has put in the shade of old television soap operas. But if you have the beauty of vision, it's worth watching after seeing it too. It is a movie with high financial support for all special effects and shooting masses, and shows its good intentions. Only the missing ones. Grady Harp
