This is typically a melodramatic Bollywood movie that is strikingly loved by Western critics. Scenario is ridiculous, the player overlaps and looks like cheese. The sole reason for watching this soap opera is beautiful songs performed by Mangeshkar and sounded on the legendary Meena Kumari curtain. At the age of 40, the movie is about the same as when watching the accident, while watching the actress who was sick and self-dead during the filming. Former spouse Amrohi writes and directs, but does not have the authority to perform a good job. Bollywood has produced better films.
