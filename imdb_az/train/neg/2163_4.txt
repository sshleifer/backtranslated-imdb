The shame is really - very rarely watching a movie, and at the end of the left feeling I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> I've seen some of the additions from Ira Levin's "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" and I liked them, but that did not appeal to me. The plot plot - the award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decided to prove that one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) was killed and succeeded - I was thrilled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Stackes and I say no shifts. It is very difficult to explain the plot line in detail. I enjoyed it for the first time ... 45 minutes, my twilight and turning began and my curiosity and taste disappeared. <br /> <br /> Although the Lumet loan had to give me a very entertaining experience, it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Their role was all brilliant - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dian Cannon and Irene Worth - playing a major role. Although Wort's obviously fake Russian accent is a little bit frustrating (no personal Irene, I think the fraudulent accuracy of any actor can irritate me). If you think that Cannon's character is funny but fun, Dyan can achieve self-criticism and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Everyone who reads this - I do not want you to be afraid to watch it. My thoughts - give you a chance, maybe you can not, you can not. All ideas.
