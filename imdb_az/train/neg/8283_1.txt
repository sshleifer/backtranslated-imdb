It embarrasses everyone and everything used to joke. I personally do not care about what Jessica Simpson and his talent or many people find interesting about her, a way or other. Like a movie, this is something that will not go beyond the classroom at the movie school. The scenario is a mess, the action is strange, and the truth is that Luke Willard (co-writer of "The Rocket Rocket") has encouraged me to think about it. He made "Old School" to cry aloud! This is not even the case with the "Old School" DVD! Please do not ask for these words for any reason! I see that it is bad that it is good, but obviously it is very good. Undoubtedly, when we begin to see singers who can not continue to work, I hope it will end soon. The worst part is that there are really a number of worthy actors, part of this trash (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Luke Wilson). I say good enough to the field, I doubt it will be something that is almost impossible and too bad to write and write (yes, I know another rehash). Please do not waste your time, but I'm sorry for the ACTUAL actors who are taking part in the bombing. Jessica Simpson is pretty good, but I love it, despite your voice. And whoever shoots this movie, I would not put it in your head. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
