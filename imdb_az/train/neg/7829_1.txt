In the early 1990s, he brought many "quirky" and "off-beat" independent films, with special sub-genres, a semi-spiritual desert film. Others are from the "Rainfall Rain", "Dusk Til Dawn" and to some extent "Naturally Born Strikers". "Highway 666", "Destiny Radio Radiosunda" and this unobtrusive surreal anti-masterpiece as well as well-developed films like "Under Hula Moon". It's a comedy that aims at a certain emotional tone, but it keeps on getting irritated. Though there are good ideas despite the world of desert spirit and the fall of Chris Penn, the film is not as ugly or difficult to be a good criminal film and really laughs to be a comedy. . I will not end, but just bad. The film is a bad influence of gene-cancer. This is the cage of indie-manic.
