Clint Eastwood Bronco Billy, the leader of the United West Group, is one of six regular misfits featured in a fight-to-break-even tour show. The seventh member of the band is Billy's assistant, but these women will not last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke, Eastwood's girlfriend). Doc (Scatman Crothers) looks like Miss Lilly, who was married until he was 30 years old, is a story that will take her father's estate for a lifetime, because she is on that birthday <br /> <br /> So, What is the plot of the film? It is difficult to say. There is romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but in the first half of the film, when one of the 'one of the group' became part of the movie, it was so incredibly insipid and, unfortunately, this is not unbelievable, but the audience is not interested in it. Lack of chronic funds behind the United Western show, but it's not really enough to be a hero of the film. Miss Lilly's stay in the west of the village is a move away from the funds he burns up his luxurious life (which he believes was mistaken for his family and the media). <br /> <br /> Yes, this film's purpose seems like Billy, but if he did a little, we believed he could not return to New York? a leader of a family, a group of lovers who are dependent on thick and cows. Is this a hot, blurry movie? or at least it works. <br /> <br /> On the way, Clint shows us his skills with a weapon, and even runs away from a film that has robbed bank robbery even in another way, which is relatively violent. One of the bells was arrested on charges of extermination; Billy bribes local Sharif. The show tent is lit; an orphanage makes them new. However, many secular traps did not create an area. <br /> <br /> The problem is to combine, move or not. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the supporting player is quite amateur. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Why?
