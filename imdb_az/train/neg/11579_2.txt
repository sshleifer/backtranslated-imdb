I have to admit that I do not remember much about characters or stories, though I do not believe that one of them is, I feel a little burdened by this movie that I'm very annoyed by this film. How can I name a movie "Keys for Tulsa" and then film him in Texas? A straight desert country around Arlington (I think this place) resembles the green rolling hills around Tulsa and would be a more beautiful neighborhood to live in Tulsa glory. No doubt, no one in the movie Tulsa or anything else in the movie was something like that. At least Rumblefish or Outsiders have never seen anyone? I know that this voter sounds but can not help. I was watching it because I love James Spaderi and usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But these two actors could not revive the richness and the story of a self-absorbing person in TULSA! Sorry, filmmaking in Oklahoma can not be more expensive. What would be the "live and die in LA" shot in Toronto? Do you want to suck it? Yes it is.
