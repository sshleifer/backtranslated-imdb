Everything that I watched this movie tells me about it ... or to me. Not a good movie. In fact, it's terrible. But in this terrible way, I was disturbed by this negativity that was unable to watch the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a horrible movie unpleasant are: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contradictory consistency, ridiculous pseudoscience. Wait a lot of time to think about the doom of Slo-mo death queues, the weak victims with their mouths agape and waaaaaaaay their deadly defective survivor's fatality. Your heart will cause two women to fight for a gun and warm up by an old movement scene, but the media SHOT? Both themselves and others then look at themselves (after 15 minutes), and finally one download. <br /> <br /> So, after a while, you have to read along with street carolers (of course, in Latin), which turns into an angry death because of making it a movie that has been wound up. Though the film is worse, they believe that they're up to it, and that can be a decent choice for you. <br /> <br /> Together with Roydu Roddy Piper "They Live" is not like my current sci-fi schlock favorite, but watching more of luke-hot movies like Omen II or III is fun. <br /> From 10 to 4.
