An entertaining concept, but poorly executed. Except for perfect makeup effects, it's not really great. There are obvious problems; for example, after appearing weeks or weeks to reach normal levels of fat, the main character flies deadly until the normal size of the day ... and if it is gentle before death, it is exquisitely dead <br /> <br /> In the case of the film, there are worse problems than the movie - the cinematography is overall the quality of the budget-television show and most likely the toy is horrible. Robert John Burke always strives for a kind of weird, strangely bizarre Charlton Hester, and as if he is suffering painfully ... Just a little scary, Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason you have presented this movie at the highest level is that it will enter the final 1/3 of the movie and miss the character of Joe Mantegna, the movie is fun, the camp is developing the feeling of "cheesefest slaughterhouse" It's a little fun to watch the gangster's naked schemes to grieve the immoral gypsies. The past, if expected, means good. Do not be too afraid to think of Fat Tony from Simpsons, who is a King-o-Phile or a terrorist camp.
