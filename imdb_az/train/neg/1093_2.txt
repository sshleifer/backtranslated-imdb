Russ Meyer plays Kitten Natividad, a movie star, Chastity Knott, a woman with breast cancer, so she goes to South America to buy some special fruits (Crockazilla) that need healing powers. After falling down to some fruits (like plastic bananas in the branches), Christian was equipped with some mystical magic powers that made him a super hero, especially the Double D Avenger. Note that she is wearing a pair of dresses like a mask. Writtenly, all sounds are pretty good. While performing, a good thing remains as long as it wants. As you can see, Chastity has a pub and a local lane is doing its job because some robbers (including Haji, Russ Meyer, including movie fame) are starting to go for it. Of course, Chastity returns from Double D Avenger. Look at the type of "Wonder Woman" to change it to its material and do not lose balance because of excessive centrifugation. Excessive jokes and barefoot double fly flies like tomorrow. Together with a fanciful theme song that will play as a 'live action' of the 70s, a child show will likely be the worst of the PG-13, even though it's not so fragile. Perhaps pale stars are a well-kept blessing. This is a great way to look at Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movies. What a special look but by Forest J. Ackerman. Very stupid and will not take another movie on Joe Bob Briggs' cover. 10 out of 2.
