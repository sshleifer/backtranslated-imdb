This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen since "Historical Film". I was laughing instead of scaring the entire film. It was funny how the snakes would look for a special part of the passengers' body to attack the eye, the tongue, the navel, and the skies. When we see the national geography channel we know, they eat the snake and eat snakes in their body. For each special area the snake smashed passengers on the road and burned the body. I believe that the producer did not learn about the snake and their behavior. I do not believe in this film that I spent my money. I do not believe in this movie until you wait until the dollar theater or rent.
