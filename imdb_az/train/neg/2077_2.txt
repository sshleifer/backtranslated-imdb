<br /> <br /> In an hour after the movie dried to return to the land and watch it, there was an excuse to leave the house. <br /> <br /> I do not remember going to a movie before, but we really wanted to stay. The scenario was not up to the castle, and it just kept the "ups and downs" - come! Is Uma Thurman doing this job? In most cases special effects. <br /> <br /> This review is based on only the first hour - it could have been a better past. I did not just go home and see whether a dark shadow would dry out of the paint.
