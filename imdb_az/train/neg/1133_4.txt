I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts. Many scenes work in the form of a plug-play, placed in the genre of romance-comedy. Usually this is good, because we deal with a genre, but in general, this problem is genuine, new and inventive. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else that does not really understand who the other characters really are, as Sullio Mourinho (not the true star of this film, Isabelle Blais). <br /> <br /> Film shots can be boring, rhythm deficiency, and editing will be full. with unnecessary approximations. And, naturally, naturally, I should talk about stylized decor, which naturally does not look like hell, but rather some scenes. Of course, besides, unfortunately, often unpleasant voices are heard. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that Woody Allen's obvious film is a deception. If you expect a good romantic comedy, this is not it. Instead, it is a bad attempt. <br /> <br /> A good movie for Les Aimants. <br /> What is it? But if you judge as a film art and artisan as an auteur, that is bad.
