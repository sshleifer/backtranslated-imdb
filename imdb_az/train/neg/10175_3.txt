But Gump sings like a fairy tale guiding us through an unusual lucky man. TGMB is based on tired clich√©s to explain only the story. Almost a Broadway music, all actors have to push. The purpose of each character was to fill a stupid 60-archetype. <br /> <br /> How do we accept the submission of Finnegan: Take her black servant clasp and MLK framed picture.
