CLAIMS HERE <br /> My school has done its best to try and motivate our exams. But the most memorable method used to bring us to life was Stan's "The Man" Longinidis, the favorite son of Australian Kickboxing. Their first mistake was to give this person a microphone because he did not sit at a distance of 3 or 4 meters from us for half an hour, though. Now his speech was full of ordinary things: "If you prepared, then you are ready to succeed," but there were different situations that I really did. He stood before us as we propagated how he had done everything for himself and for the rest of his life. Many in the past have been offered to abandon kickboxing, but he did not overlook Australia's biggest kick-boxer award. He said he was not out of sale, happy and retired, not involved in any other activity outside Kickboxing? and then filmed. Yes, you have heard it right, it will FULLY FILM. When talking to a woman, she took a poster ad and then she showed the shocking 4-minute clip of this bad movie called "Trojan Warrior". (This is before Gurkan Ã–zkan's recent career (now) winner) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stan is playing Ajax, a former boxing agent specializing in boxing, Melbourne. Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) was recently sold (well, at least Stan did not go far beyond anything) to all the federations and, ultimately, through organized crime. Ajax and Teo are in a ridiculous situation, regardless of their struggles in a kebab shop. All this is pretty laughable, but if Silverstein intends to shoot a really safe movie, this person should not even give a camera. <br /> <br /> I will admit, I really pumped to see it. I love moving movies, even if they are fragile, and especially in my garden. But what I know was a movie that was afraid of the word "get" and "Stop it for the love of God!" After the words continued, subplots were presented, and even after re-opening, the characters were decisively thrown out for some reason, and Stan's scenes of most choreographic struggles that Stan did not reflect on the true ability of Kickboxing. The cast consisted of nearly everybody's appearance (Dermot Brereton, Mark's "Chopper" Reading and Greg Matthews). It's all about playing the guess game of someone sitting and standing in the background. Very poor film is based heavily on split-second images by former celebrities. Did I tell you that you forgot these gaps? Once Ajax was accused of killing his wife. Now, we've heard that Ajax's ONE is the only one with a single word in the movie, and then release it for the sake of turmoil. After that, he follows another SINGLE sentence that convinces Ajax to help the same people who accidentally lock. Later, Ajax revealed that his wife was not actually dead but was sold to prostitution. See him? No. Ajax went to find it when he heard it? Now this is a marriage! <br /> <br /> On some websites this movie is characterized as a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie. This guy sat down and watched the Jackie Chan movie? Chan shows more flexibility by taking a dump, as Stan does. Well, ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie's murder movie is Christ, and compare it with Salik Silverstein! This film is a mix between "Pizza" and "Ninja Girin". <br /> <br /> Now, what is the name of the entire Trojan Warrior? Do Ajax have some strange fighting skills as an ancient Greek warrior? No. The merger of gangsters to find Theo as in the token empire? No. Wait? Theo carries a condom around him. Yes, it is right, because THEO is preparing with Trojan Brand RUBBER in his pocket, he is a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I was dissatisfied with seeing the Trojan Warrior on the DVD, but also had "special" features: <br /> <br />? Read the video clip of Chop Chop by Mark Chopper. Chopper did this to prove that anyone can rap. Most likely Chopper fled to just 30 seconds and then Doncaster to these two albino teenagers, Australian scores, "dis" and "dope". Throws by using some words. It was developed in the face of people, rap states, HAS USED! The clip resembles a Canal 31 cameraman on ecstasy. <br /> <br /> Biffs: There was no difference between this and the real movie. Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It was not too bad, considering only 6 or 7 different battles from different angles (I think Dennis Alexio fell about 15 times in this 3-minute assembly). /> <br /> As for the movie, I do not want to say that this film has caused the country to enter hell, but oh wait, I just did. Anyone who reads this is to go out for you and use 4 or 5 "Trojan Warriors" to shoot them, shoot them, and shoot paper, because this movie is simply cursed.
