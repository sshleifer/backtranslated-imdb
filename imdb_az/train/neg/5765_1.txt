Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it beside the load, the comedy is classic. Although two parts of the party were full of humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There is nothing about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls, and vision gags are supposed to be natural funny. It's not cool to hit the audience with soft jokes. In this film, the hero was intended for children who want to laugh at something. Upon reaching the middle school, feeling of self-esteem came out of the window. Call parody is not funny. Since 1998, I've been watching them in comedies. They are very dated. Michael Jackson jokes are also cool. <br /> <br /> It was a time when American movies were slow to die. <br /> <br /> The best days have never been a "performer" ever. Such films are nails stuck in his coffin. What has happened to true humor? I laughed at the cinema for a long time. Very bad movies hit the brain. Want to prove to you? Navigate to the local mega chain video rental shop and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe in dessert. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to watch Scary Movie 2 in a more durable loop than to end up with an excuse for unusual misfortune! <br />
