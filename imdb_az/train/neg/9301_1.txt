<br /> <br /> I think this movie can be seen as only one person of 1/10. Story: Not believing in the premiere - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people are aware of the mysterious events. there is. DOCUMENTS: Generally I give credit to indie screenwriters, this is a difficult task when you start ... but it's a shit. The story is straightforward - it puts the whole film without emotion. Dialogue is extremely poor and predictable, "Woah, completely surprised me" and "I want you?"? <br /> <br /> My wife is something for me. Some of them describe the characters in a straight line, and I want to take one more step and they say that they are really an inverse character ... In fact, they begin to work in a parallel universe and almost move backwards ... <br /> <br /> AKTORLAR: There are players who are worse than characters. They accept poor writing characters and add to the dramatic high school drama that operates. The phrase "Woah you absolutely surprised me" was not so monotonous and slow. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight-year-old film could have been facing lighting. It is very shady in the regions, and others are bleached. The director should not use the light as an emotion until he learns how to properly illuminate a major scene. Baby steps! SES: Which voice guys are really making to make a movie shotty? 9. It should sound beautiful with many voices, but on the contrary. Especially there is a scene that really exits, these guys move with a car, and the car's sounds vary with each camera angle .... Weak! CAMERA: Use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I run away from complaining ..... Rent - I dare you to ... Lease her and find out ... give it to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
