This movie creates a beautiful line between satire and silliness. A bridge system that does not have any rules can promote marriage harmony, of course, can not encourage a winning bridge, because the satir did not work for me. But especially when I looked at the great bridge between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film, I found something unpleasant. The championship is like a boxing match very much. The arena of the competition will be extinguished only as a boxing strip, a referee among the competitors, and the radio broadcaster continuously speaks on events occurring in Roscoe Karns. At one point, he even counts four diamonds as a "one ... two ... three ... four ..." as a knockdown event. People have been adhered to their radio for a common event for championship boxing matches. This verb really worked really well. Unfortunately, several actors provide the comedy needed to provide the intended line. Paul Lukas did not have a great potential for the comedy and was destroyed; Loved Loretta Young and ordinary comedian Frank McHugh were not given a good line; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic shift like a forgotten blond at the beginning of the film, but it disappears in the wake of it. How much loss of talent!
