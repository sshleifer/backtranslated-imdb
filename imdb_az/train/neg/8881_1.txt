The detective character is a bit tough, as if it were the first time the players were on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better players, Jean Simmons (Star Trek plays a great role on TV as in TNG and Night Heat) soon dies, and then his player runs away. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr Ballard, as described by Cliff Robertson. Cliff often has to film this movie in his body language. It does not do a poor job, but after a while it is a little less than asking an actor to protect the reader's blank screen time. <br /> <br /> Robertson's most memorable role would be Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man films (top role-playing Tobey Maguire). A husband kills wealthy wife with money. then his wife looks back, and her husband drags her away, and she is afraid of a deadly life until she leaves a high window on the day she dies less. <br /> <br /> The second driver, Mr. Ballard, looks much like hiring Hamilton. Really uncanny! The only thing that comes to mind is completely disloyal to the dialogue. After a few minutes of silence, nobody speaks, moves less. MST3K is a shame that children do not capture this movie. <br /> <br /> After waiting for QMork to appear in the shadows of her red eyes, she could have been more predictable with more dialogue and shorter "shortcomings" scenes. It works for "nothing" in the film.
