After numerous successes by Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror Films have spread as a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. As a result, El segundo has been filmed as a bad sheet, a bad post as a film, but with even worse action and directed movies. I have not read Ramsey Campbell, but I am sure that the author of The Moment of The Doll has nothing in common with this terrible production. When looking for a quiet night in a new movie theater, avoid any costs. 2/10
