It uses poorly functioning, no scripts, no plot, unbelievable killer, no decline, no original structure, recurring recurring and recurring recurring bed / person-behind-mirror tactics. dragging, and not by a front view, and that never leads to the killing of "really" (at least on the screen), which, in turn, can call for the right to make any downturn and spend money on the admission ticket .... its fear film LMAO does not have any fears. <br /> <br /> Most of the people you look at seem to spray a plastic bottle onto a ketchup bottle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;" But this movie is AWFUL and I have some kind of task to scare you, and I will not give money to Hollywood, <br /> <br /> If you want to have some remodel nostalgia, do not forget this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is to rent a "bad" movie from Weinsteins when you need to sit in a theater. <br /> <br /> This is not a repetition, <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> No, this movie: reminiscent of Brittany Snow's footprint, pointing to the trace that Jonathan Schaech should have had some sex with JS "Abducted" Cardone had another role as a killer (because he who is the poodle i am scary and very cute to kill just about anyone) and no one (duh) returns to anyone going back to the hotel suite. What person will not be bothered by the decision of the BALKAN king and the queen's nominee and when the unhappy rival will not show the girl alone? This is a warning for you. Do not waste your money like I did. The "original" is very sucks, but Jamie Lee is a sinful pleasure for Curtis fans, though this is part of the hell (although I'm not sorry to make a bad or rude vote).
