This is an attempt by both authors Edgar Rice Burroughs and an Arab "Approach of the Apes" by the directors. However, this desert movie does not show any of the miracles that Burroughs has ever accomplished in a more successful jungle adventure. Focus is the love between overwhelming revenge for a beautiful English nobleman, John Hall ("El" Lion "Chatham") and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke ("Princess" Eulilah), and openly state that they are guilty of inaccuracies although the mother's mother lives - but she never draws again. "Unfortunately," The Lion Man "appears to be worsened and missing images. <br /> <br /> The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ John Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
