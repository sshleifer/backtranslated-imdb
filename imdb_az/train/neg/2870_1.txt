Oh, my God! Please do not watch this movie to love everything that is sacred! 82 minutes of my life will never be back. Of course, I could stop halfway through. But I thought it would be okay. It was not. Everyone who really loves this film is a serious and painful individual. Australians / New Zealand have a sad reputation for filming. Everything about this movie is horrible, from dramatics to correction. I usually do not write here, but in this case I'll rule out. I only wish someone warned me before I took this catastrophe
