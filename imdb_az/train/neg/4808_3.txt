Okay, I've seen lots of movies dealing with witches and secret, but it was just strange. This movie begins as a culinary masterpiece managed by the evil Orson Wells, although it did not belong to anything in this movie. But in any case, coven gets a new member and pushes a similar puppet and makes it a rarity. A Muslim woman and her husband are going to a place called Lillith, and if the lady witnesses a look at her brother or if he calls her and tells her not to use her authority, she will die there. Once settled into a strange city, the pair discovered that all residents are all witches and are strange and afraid of all their neighbors and friends. Then, strangely enough, when he saw a funeral (creepy) on a hill, where the lady was not going to fall down, the little boy, owned by Orson Wells, saw life playgroud. She is soon trying to escape from the city, but she finds herself to be in a hurry by her inhabitants and her powers, and ignores everything she is trying to warn her soul about. This movie is complete, but it's moments of neglect, but I actually did better than Orson there.
