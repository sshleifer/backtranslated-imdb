As a complement to the hammer, I was afraid to boldly watch this movie, though, "Buses on holidays". I saw a bus movie and thought it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> I do not know if you're going, because now I've met this character and enjoyed some situations and knew how to react. <br /> <br /> I saw Blakey's funny, though I can not promise trilogy at any point in time, "I'll take you to Butler." <br /> <br /> Dick Barton is the best film in the buses, watching the holiday, jokes. Only those who want to watch this movie are likely to be admirers of the television series, which will undoubtedly be unsatisfactory and complement the Hammer myself. For companions, I would say that this movie is not bad and, of course, I can think of the worst Hammer comedies.
