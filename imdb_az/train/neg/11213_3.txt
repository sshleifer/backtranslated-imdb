OK ... I watch very bad movies. I am proud of myself. There are many stones with bombs number B. But this movie is one of the worst I have ever watched. I want a good horror movie ... but with one move and part. Opening scenes seemed very good. Good music and footage. From there the hill is coming down. One of the main characters has a disability (Tinnitus call). Now, this is a threat to the mystery. The film is in the center of attention. So, he left a plug of ear to where he was calling and in the wrong place where he had not been. There is no need to cultivate it. So this man comes in contact with this girl and falls into a motel and shoots his head at the last table. Thus, everyone decides to take his body instead of giving it information. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what's happening to her. Perhaps after finding his sister again and again (like a ghost as a zombie) and even directing her body, she finally finds her. Now the corpse is restored, and it is determined to deal with one who is killing him and only the suspect. The bad thing is that he has no plan. Just be the twin and get acquainted with the guy that was thrown into the body. Saleh did not believe he killed her. So, everything emerges there, and though it is a weapon, it manages to drown in a way. Thus, the final scenes of the film are his "spirits" that come out of him and his twins. That is to say, in this movie, I get a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: incorrect info about the movie: low-level incorrect orientation of music and sound effects long and drawn plot. Not some actors
