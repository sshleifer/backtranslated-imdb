There was a plot for SURPRISA! ;) I've seen movies with fewer questions (I do not want to talk about Asian cinema ...). I thought the camera was not bad for such a cheap movie, and the atmosphere was not bad. There is no response to what most people need to do and how to do it. <br /> <br /> If I were thinking about a few films, of course, that was terrible. <br /> The player was bad, but I saw worse. The movie was filthy, but I saw it worse. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a low-level experience with boredom, laughing ability, desire for death, sadism, horniness and entertainment. <br /> So, if you like murder movies with fools, this is the right movie for you <br /> <br /> I've given 3/10 because I will not see a good movie and if you are in the right mood, it can be fun.
