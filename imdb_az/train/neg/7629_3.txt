This movie gave me a great chance, and that betrayed me. As Egorist Bogdanavich (who set out with the Debaters), better than the audience, is much less than black and white excuses for the hell, as the "big speeches" in a debut of their debut are obtained. There are many teenage stereotypes in this movie that confess the teacher's wife, immorality, dirty prostitution (drawn in a very boring way and mixing things to completely stop) <br /> <br /> All this movie I think it would be funny for me to have sexual desire, it was just an orange. I enjoyed my finger so much to keep watch over it.
