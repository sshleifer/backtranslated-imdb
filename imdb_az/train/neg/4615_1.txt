It can not be the most striking, but it's the second movie I've ever denied seeing all the ways, and I even got it on the DVD with the "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the director was playing a great joke, so I was waiting for a resolution, something to laugh, something to keep my interests, but this resolution never came. Instead, the writing is laughably amateurish, the film has been dragged and disjointed, as someone cuts a TV series in length. <br /> <br /> If the movie calls at least eight Oscars, the Academy should be on medication. <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second film that I refused to follow. The first was "Exterminator." Hopefully this is an indication of how bad it is. 1/10
