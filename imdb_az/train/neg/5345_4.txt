You can wade with something you can do with the "classic meyer" names / intro. But would you like it? I did not find much to dig up my teeth. I think you'll be happy if you come down to expectations (a la Charlie's Angels.) But for my money, I'd like something more clearer and more moving. More. I feel like begging for gruel @ master foot. The men took the goods. but he does not just share it.
