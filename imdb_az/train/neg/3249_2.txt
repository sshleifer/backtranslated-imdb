Jim Carrey is one of the most funny and most talented comedy in the film today. With her hyperactive spontaneous and rubbery face, she just goes crazy and we love her. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala ace ventura) and turn them into decent comedies. Otherwise, turn them into one of the most exciting contemporary comedies around, in the claim of "The False Lieutenant." Carrey proved to be capable of solving dramas. He was perfect both on "The Moon on the Moon" and "Truman Show". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Carrey is provided with the power of God to complain about God and how his life spoils. However, the script is clean and repetitive. Even worse than a script now, sometimes Carrey's improvisation is sometimes an unusual scene. The problem is that there are very few possibilities for not opening Carre, because most of the comedy is based on silly special effects and some are fun. It should work around the special effects, because Carrey can rarely improvise. Writers thought that all these special effects and super power chains were funny, because the rest of the movie was simply full of nothing else but working on Carrey. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; "> last year's" Good Girl "was also outstanding. He also has a gift for comedy, but as a line with scenario, just a part of a painful friend is given. <br /> <br /> "Bruce Almighty" comedy should be a comedy. But there is no courage to solve an exciting topic; religion A few small giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead turned into a comedy superpower comedy. It should not be noted that the tactile shift from foolishness to the heavy hand, even to the black comedy. The film will fail at nearly every level. It is not just to see that you are absolutely laughing, but it's close. There are any problems that need to be included in a dog scene to peeing to laugh. But hey, if you find something funny with the jokes you've performed, go for it. <br /> <br />
