This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> A comedy about Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, a police shooter who investigated a shot at the hip-hop club, a police drama and two Hollywood detectives. <br /> <br /> There are many who are killed. Ford, Martin Landau, runs a real estate owned by one of his clients, Hartnett opens a yoga school that wants to vacate her, while two are being investigated by the Ministry of the Interior, Ford is an out-of-the-age girlfriend (Lena Olin) and a psychic, He was a dirty old policeman who shot Hartnett's father a year ago. <br /> <br /> There are attempts to compel motor vehicles and some humor in humor, and this is the scope of Turkey.
