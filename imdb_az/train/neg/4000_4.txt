When I was an American movie, I rented Chris Smith's first movie. <br /> <br /> In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I went. <br /> <br /> If you are just going to investigate the problem, it will be difficult to live up to the truth. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it's all about: 1) many jobs are processed and 2) most of them are terrible, minimum wages in the service sector ??? I knew before watching the movie. The film really plays "real" (hand camera, music, etc.) as it struggles to not feel, really playing in the "real world". <br /> <br /> If Randy says he expects him to stay 6 months, after three days, Randy will be very happy to Randy for the employer after leaving her? <br /> <br /> Do you think that one of the problems is that after a day's renouncing our job (and producing a car), everyone will have that much easier? <br /> <br /> A great problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is missing. He does not resemble either one of them or one of them. It's a dope. He does not pay attention to these things and even really works. It has a zero personality. <br /> <br /> I was expecting Chris Smith to work again, but guys are the topic of this-is-an-important movie. "American Job" does not work.
