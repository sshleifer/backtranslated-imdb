I purchased this DVD without any prior consent, but John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcettin are the names of his. I found Brazil's name very strange, but I decided to wait for a fun comedy like "Switch". But the story of the story is terrifying and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is offered a surgery to change her breed in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood, where she is Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and half of her uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Over the years, Myra and her alter-ego Myron have broken a young couple in her uncle's cousin academy. At a certain point, the scenario is intriguing, and the whole story is a mind-boggling Myron crash. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to hold this flick. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Men and women up to a point")
