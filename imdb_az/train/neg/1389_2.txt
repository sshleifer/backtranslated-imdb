I liked this movie very much. Indeed, there was no limit to foolishness: The Spheres that can influence the Role of the Truth? Is inexplicable hunters a mission entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole story of the "B" with the "holobrothel" against the station was very scary, so I was scared to the television at some point, "Why are you wasting my time?" <br /> <br /> Of course, the "Mount of Souls" actually did not ask the question of a soul deeper than the original episode "Soul Hunter". Soul Hunters can see that they can make mistakes, but we still can not get a feeling for their cultures. (Does any woman have Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> The player's work was completely good, and the special effects - especially the first action planetscapes - were very impressive. But in general, I would like to give it a shot.
