Through all these positive reviews, I am amazed at what I'm reading. How much I love my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are a number of problems in the film that are already mentioned; <br /> <br /> Many characters are mistaken and neither Evan McGregor nor Toni Collette performs. They are worthy of them, and the worst are Paltrow. In some roles I enjoyed my performance, but here he is self-conscious, nasal, rubbing and is far from his symbols and those around him. An extreme disappointment - even the perfect Emma could not save this movie.
