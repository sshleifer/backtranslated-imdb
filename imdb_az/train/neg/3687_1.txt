Not only is this a bad movie; this film does not include only four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers; and the scenario is not just terrible. It's just ... this movie is a great time ... sucks. These people spend money on horrific scripts. We need to criticize a Mexican society, but we benefit from such films. Is the bad language ridiculous? I can not get it. <br /> <br /> Do not think that such films are well received in Mexico: "We hate it" does not reflect them.
