Now I am thrilled to see a sitcom representing Indian Candians, but this show was not funny. The manufacturer and the player are very happy to get both bad and good feeds because they talk about their conversations! I'm ready for some stereotypes and I have no problem because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But it's not really something about these stereotypical characters. A new "boat" father who does not understand his daughter. A radical feminist Muslim girl (a very scary actress in this way) and a young Indian man try to control the mosque as politically as possible (he is a very good actor, and I see that he is improving). /> <br /> This is a very controversial and dialogue is not a good flow. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that, according to the US embassy in Azerbaijan, everything is a treat and a natural thing; the very bad girl in the show is not the same!
