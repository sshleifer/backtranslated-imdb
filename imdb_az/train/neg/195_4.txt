Crazy with slow and inaccurate. Despite these deficiencies, it is Alamo's famous and heroic siege page in the Texas battle to gain independence from Mexico. James Arness, like Jim Bowie. Brian Keith like Davy Crockett. Col. Alec Baldwin as Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This project for television is also David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
