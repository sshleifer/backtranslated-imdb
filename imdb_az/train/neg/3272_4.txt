I can say one thing about this movie: there is no calm. Do not waste your time watching. The point is that this is very intense. There are many moves and this is a mute need! It's the risk that you have in modern action movies. It's interesting, but not too late. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey and Roy Scheider have several "names", but they have a "B" movie. The best part of this is the dialogue of Shayder: this is the only "A" part of the film "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is a serious Rambo mentality, but there are several scenes. Particularly, it was a very innovative scene with landmines. It was memorable. It is not enough for other actors to reach so many goalkeepers.
