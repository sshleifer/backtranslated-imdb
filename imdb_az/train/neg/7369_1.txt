After Submerged, I did not think this was going to be a better one ... I'm right. Champagne is looking for money and should not pay attention to the final product ... voices are repeatedly dubbed by a stranger who does not sound like him; editing - good - a degree higher than amateur level. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more than a B and C movie that has enough money to buy a multi-camera camera operator and an "OK" player. <br /> <br /> Like the poster, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I rent I will not. <br /> <br /> Very bad - I missed Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> -
