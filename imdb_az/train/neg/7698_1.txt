Can I give it a negative rating? No? Yes, I say that is the most treacherous movie I've been trying to follow. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. Area (?) Good nebulosity is hidden in several sub-levels. I hired this movie with a friend and it would have been better after nearly thirty minutes, so we decided to "move forward" a little further to know that everything would be better. It never gets better. A couple of friends who have been kidnapped by these two girls are curious, but in fact this is just a hole. Even something far away is not interesting. If you have a chance to watch it, give yourself a blessing, rather than "PLAY PLEASE WRITE" instead.
