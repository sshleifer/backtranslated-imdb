I'm just back from a free sneeze and I'm so glad I did not pay to see this very sub-movie. The theater was full and was a blend of children and adults in the crowd. It was just the guys who laugh at all the rifles and fart jokes (although they loved to shoot some of these poor mice). The film is quite mature, unintelligent, predictable and mostly boring. <br /> <br /> The heroes come together to fill empty spaces, and the relationship between them has been forced by gravity. <br /> <br /> According to his ability, the film does not really matter. They have done a decent job to imitate Wallace and Gromit's clay, but these are very memorable images. <br /> <br /> Although I'm really bored with the entire movie, I've been a little bit tired. This is not necessarily a failure, but I will never again want to watch it again. If you see that you are a parent with children (and you do not pay attention to your children's cheap jokes), free them to see them, but not everyone should spend their money.
