I'm very disappointed with this movie. I thought that "Horror movie" was not a great movie, it was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand is not boring, funny, and sometimes straightforward. <br /> <br /> Exorcist / Amityville parody is probably the best part of the film. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now I will admit that I'm in a bad state. Because I have not seen a few films, these parodia are primarily different, so I've seen them mostly. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> What really damaged this movie was the time when it would break some of the things that might be good jokes. Scenes and jokes are dragged on a long way. <br /> Also, the same jokes continue to repeat. For example, talking birds. It was okay for the first time, and maybe even for the second time. However, he continued with anxiety. Behavior between wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun, but continued to recur, and was stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes are repeated from the first movie. For example, Cindy's (Anna Faris) "Scary Movie" was funny when she was killing her because she had been sexually sexually sexually active and had sex with her for a long time. <br /> <br /> In general, the bathroom and sex humor were generally more entertaining and the first time around was a good time. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was frustrated in this movie and was not really there. But Shorty (Marlon, in my opinion, was the funniest feature of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The stage and pot plant with me was one of my favorites in the second film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family, and I love their humor ... That's why this movie is so sad ... they have more funny talent than endless scat jokes.
