I would like to note a few points about this film because others have difficulty summarizing the plot. There may be spoilers here; <br /> <br /> If you take into account the low budget of the film, the creature's design was very good. It's really nice to see a direct-to-video horror movie that's not slathered by terrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of digital movies is very elegant in places and is most noticeable in well-lit white lounges in the shelter. <br /> <br /> A funny lighting design is part of this movie. time passage. I know that the director tried to simulate the dementia, but an effective sequence of time must be set. <br /> <br /> - We can count on a large number, but consistently. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> The characters in this movie are simply thought does not work.
