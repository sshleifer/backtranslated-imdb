I even have to review this movie because in fact this is not a movie - and so Dr. It does not deserve Peynin's attention. At least, it's not a horrible thing. Of course, this is a terrible offer to spend your time watching. So I quit her after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when it's just about 45 minutes gone by. Yep, that's right; this movie is not b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "Order" was a lot of defects, not all of them looked the same. Especially for me, I have come to realize that the main problem with the "religious" subconscious of fear movies is that Hollywood wants to bring Christianity to its terms. It is also possible to make really creepy films of Orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, films like these without orthodoxy are just one thing - reflect the imagination of filmmakers (generally dull and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think. If someone made a movie called a physical one, but it made the basic laws of physics wrong, but you will get tired of the trivial structure resulting from the entire structure on the wrong designs. This is true for the same films. In other words, "Order" (and many similar films previously) has prepared all the materials about the Catholic Church, building a part of these inventions. Imagine that the plot results in incompatibility and foolishness. <br /> <br /> This movie has the charm of being as interested as watching your feet grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steam stack.
