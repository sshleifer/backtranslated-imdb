Bolivak supporters love Amitabh Bachan's Mard very much, but I think it's very good. Manhohan Desai, Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I liked them all because I had a very high expectation before watching Mard and I was sadly disappointed. My main idea about Mard, Amar Akbar feels like Anthony 2, maybe Mr. Desai could not escape from ideas using this formula from year to year. 1. First of all, some of the cast members are recruited from AAA, for example, a police inspector who created Amar, Akbar, Nirupa Roy and several other Muslims. 2. Nirupa Roy loses sight, loses her voice in AAA 3. In AAA there is a good poet (Shirdi wale sai grandpa), reading Amitabh Maa Sherawali. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> <br /> <br /> I'm very far away I thought. My last thought is that I find the disappointment of the songs compared to the previous Manmohan Desai movies. I know there are many fans who protest, but I did not like it a bit. I really worry about writing that because I'm a great admirer and since I was a kid I liked the movies.
