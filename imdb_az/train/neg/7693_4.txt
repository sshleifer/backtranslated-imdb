Is there something unpredictable in this movie? I do not think so. Basically the movie is cliché after a stereo and really nothing surprises. Due to the fact that the film is extremely predictable and that the film does not have a serious tension. Thus, it is not enough tense and unexpected for a tension, but also a failure as a drama. Because the story of the movie is not very difficult. I would like to say that it can happen in real life, it can happen in the same way as the events in the film. Thus, the film has a realistic alarm and reliability problem. <br /> <br /> But there are clicks that really kill the movie. Sometimes things were sometimes predatory. Everything is a formulator in this film. The predator is described as psychopathic as a heartless, sexually annoying boy and presents the victim as a naive young woman. Everything that happened in the film was very clear and seemed to be happening for some reason. The "predator" victim is like a broken car. It must be one of the oldest clichés in this book. I knew what the movie was trying to do after this point. I tried to think that the teacher and student were moving toward each other in the eyes of others. It was so incredible and cheap that almost after this point I wanted to stop the movie. The film is packed with such moments. <br /> <br /> The title may indicate that this is a cheap porn movie, but it's actually made up for a television movie. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Elizabeth Berkley works very well, and everything goes slowly and gives time to the development of the film character and unnecessary sub-fields. in this movie. Some clichés and events are sometimes even realistic. His Hollywood career, Paul Verhoeven, is very good after appearing in "Showgirls", so it is unfortunately still only visible in this movie and on TV series. This is the loss of his talent and, of course, it is better. All other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier makes the cliché a much more 'untouchable' boy and the character of the mother character, even worse. The film looks more like an angry predator than a real predator. She basically tries to get sex with her husband in every sequence. He wakes up, wants sex. She wants to have sex before bedtime. She goes home and does not want sex. <br /> <br /> A small movie movie was full and I do not think so. It can really be something, but I know it's a movie like this and generally it did not feel right for the story. <br /> <br /> Any reason for everyone watching this movie. This is predictable and the reason for that is that it does not have undeniable and reliable. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It is not an unusual movie but sometimes a watchable movie, but all the weak and sticky elements of the movie are so great.
