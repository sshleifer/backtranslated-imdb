Unusual Jack (Matthew Lillard) has come to the studio of a bare collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and says that Jamie (Valeria Golino), an enthusiastic companion and delicate poison, is also Jack's brother. Jamie does not take his story, he prefers Jack and clings to his cage. As for Max, Jack offers $ 100,000 for each one and can protect it from the debate of the Spanish judges with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites poor personality Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who has come to terms with his frail girlfriend, who believes he is from Mars. But Jack Jack, Jamie and Piece, will take revenge. <br /> <br /> Low budget is a film that has a terrifying conclusion that "Spanish Judges" frustrates a good player. Valeria Golino is in a fascinating way, but with good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save a foolish story. Moreover, scenes that need to be funny, unfortunately, do not work, and in fact they are not clever and funny. <br /> <br /> The name "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("For All Money")
