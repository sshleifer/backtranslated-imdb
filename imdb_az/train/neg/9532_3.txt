Thus, two women, George, are sitting in a single home on the birthday of two women. George's wife is in a hospital where she cares for her children, so when George goes away, George gets into a bath with a balloon and gives love to both girls. This scene is not great because it really does not show anything. After that, the boy gets up on the next morning and the girls are still at home. They give him a nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy, and he tries to throw them down, but girls are still at home when they get home. Girls are old enough to have George and they do not want to cook for them anymore. Both are great psychopaths and use George in their little mad games. The girls did what they wanted and confused George's home. George was not so nice to two of his guests. George did not really understand when he said he was married. George, like Tom Tucker, with his family Guy. I had all the time for two girls.
