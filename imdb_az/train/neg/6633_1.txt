Where to begin? What is the best way to describe the horror of this movie? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the campaign sword humor. Not too funny. Add a group musician who imitates actors - Meat Loaf is terrific and Deborah Harry is even worse. <br /> <br /> Regrettably, bad Art Carney should be better acquainted than doing this movie. The purpose of life is to meet Alice Cooper with a girl who has been able to become a group for Alice Cooper's goal of working for a spouse to work with. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, despite the end of the movie, they can not go out of a better scene - well, I will not be destroyed <br /> <br /> Truly the film if you want to see it for you. <br /> <br /> There are certain actors who say that some movies will be worse or worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me, and she has a more prominent role. The film is probably a sign of sure that it will not be very good. If nothing happens, the film falls short of expectations - it's too bad for them to go too far. <br /> <br /> Just say that. All movies are compared to the movie. None of these is worse than Roadie.
