<br /> <br /> <strong> This is a movie about the filming of the "Crimea" film. I'm a very versatile actor (in my opinion). On the other hand, Mike Myers takes his laughs frustrating. I love him in the Waynes World and I'm a Magee of the Axis, but I never loved Austin Powers and "The Cat In The Hat" just finished me. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - the gags were terrible! it's amazing that for some 50 years, the fact that some of them has such a history is not just for kids, it's amazing! Assassination was dirty, terrible, mixed! It's really a shame because kids are so glad to be the "Mom". Alec Baldwin could have gotten better, but if he did not disclose the Replica's replicative description of Myers, it would not have been ugly. <br /> I've said - are you looking for a Myers even script? Was it written? There was one other actor - but Cat just seemed like a wing! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the sets and details were great! But, unfortunately, they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - a human genius! </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;
