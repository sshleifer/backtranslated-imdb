Sloppily director is a clever comedy that is no better than the "classic" 50s 'alien capture' movies, but possibly spoofs, but in a completely technical department (good makeup effects). And any parrot worse than its target is unsuccessful ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than any James Bond movie). After two hours of work, you hear the sounds of foreigners calling for peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
