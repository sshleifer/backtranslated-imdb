This movie is really expatriate! I saw him at age 11 and even thought he was so ridiculous! I'll only recommend this movie to children under the age of 12. I really do not care about it, but I think it will answer very good questions that children should be aware of: 1) happiness? 2) Should I beg (to my parents) that they will not agree? 3) Does the money earn friendships? 4) Is everything money? 5) Do I not tell my parents if someone tries to hurt me? Undoubtedly, these are very unrealistic, but if parents discuss these issues with their children, you should probably watch this video to show and frighten their children who are in danger of lying to you.
