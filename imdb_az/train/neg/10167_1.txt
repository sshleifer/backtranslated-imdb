This television movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I see this is covered in the KTMA MST3K. There's Super Bowl at Superdome in New Orleans. But it does not play any football and we do not look at anything behind the scenes. This film has nothing to do with many stars. I do not know why I'm watching it.
