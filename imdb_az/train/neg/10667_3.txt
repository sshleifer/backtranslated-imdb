Do not be fooled by all the great names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are simply added. Their scenes are likely to be shot in one day. Regardless of the motives of being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, use it better. For me, this is a bad sign. The area itself was bad. And the player from most actors was moderate. Cuba Gooding Jr. was terrible. It was so incredible that I almost laughed dramatically with scenes. And because this is meant to be a serious movie that can not be a good thing. Event scenes were not bad, but created a more specific blow that made him more excited. Again, there was a need for a better direction. Also a pacing for such a movie was incorrect. It took about half an hour for the main character. It's too slow for a 90-minute motion retreat. Only return factor is Angie Harmon. He does his best to do all the work. Too bad, the director hanged him. Yes, this movie would be better with a great director. Andy Cheng is very inexperienced to be the director. And I would expect the least exciting action scenes for the caliber / stunt coordinator. Do not waste time on this. Avoid!
