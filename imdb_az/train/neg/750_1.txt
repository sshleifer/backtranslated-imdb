After hearing the word about how bad this film was, I bought a dip and took a DVD. Previously, everything about this movie was true, he said. For a movie allegedly a budget of millions, this does not just show on the screen. The list of problems with the movie can be dragged forever. The film's head is too long. It was dragged 3 hours a few minutes. Approximately an hour or so, the editor simply overcame the multiplication of scenes that are more than just the main character around him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, because many say "trailers", special effects are something special. Tripods looked OK here and there, but the price of everything was Z-1970 or 1980's. Perhaps the worst of all was the shocking effect, and they went back and forth as they did. The effect of light rays was funny, because some of the people were exposed to bones without any muscle. Thunderchild, which is also a troubled Thunderchild rank, described as a ram-shaped ram in the book, did not look at something like this. Instead, it was similar to a World War II era, with firearms (not a firefighter, but a visible staff) and torpedo tubes. <br /> <br /> Figures and backgrounds were as bad as it was. The most funny thing is that the main character and his wife are going for a night's ride and she was an early scene that shows him Mars in the sky. The sky is black, but the images of the characters and the surrounding landscape are the daytime. There is a very sharp demarcation between the true scene, the full sunlight, and the foggy black night sky, with very large fuzzy stars. The color of the scenes did not make any sense to draw them down. Some of them are washed in orange. Green light on others. Others are blue light. In some cases, the appearance is orange, but it is green or blue inside the house. <br /> <br /> Finally, the actor is a sub-subtitle. A guy just described the two characters that did not have a mustache. It sometimes led to some confusion as to who and where it was. English accents are even scary for America's ears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have never seen Gigli or other recent floppies, but it should deteriorate in every respect for bad quality. I would not be surprised if the movie was 10 or 20 in the IMDb ranking. Unfortunately, the Mystery Science Theater is still around.
