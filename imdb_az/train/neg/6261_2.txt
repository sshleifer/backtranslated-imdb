A few do not know that by entering a sleeping house, he and his neighbors were built on land previously used in cemeteries. It is said that the film is based on a real story, although it is not clear how true these should be. The area is a rare one - Spilberqin "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short time, they are experiencing a variety of unnatural events: this is anxiety - from the mysterious shadows, from the serious illnesses of the girl to the obviously laughing, and the garage doors go out of control. There is a deep depth for the story: after we have determined that the land is used as a cemetery, we do not learn much. Land development does not appear. The heroes are not particularly well-designed or in any way memorable, especially the atmosphere. The film may be disturbed by some viewers. Katarsis or any positive message has no meaning.
