This movie was terrible. This was a very difficult time to follow all the ways. I could not get the movie. What was the purpose of this film? The soundtrack was bad, the move was bad and the story was dim. The two main characters in the film were very boring and their dialogues were uninteresting. There was no chemistry among the cast members. I did not know this for a fact, but I doubt that most players were the first timer. The film could easily be reduced by about an hour. The film shows how many unusual scenes exist. I have more root channels than two hours of the movie. Take two hours back! If you want to watch a good, funny movie made by family friend and a group of mormons, see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
