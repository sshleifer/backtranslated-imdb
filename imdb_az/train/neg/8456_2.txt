I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. I stayed alone after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I was able to stay until the end. <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only five characters, > The worst movie I've ever seen was an accident, but now I'm sure enough to experience it again. <br /> Good luck!
