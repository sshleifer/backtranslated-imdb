I can not recommend this movie as a historical film. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical life description is a heavyweight Beckettian account, one of the properties in South East London, Dante's hell circle. Ray Winston, in the center of the center, before this character but never did anything. The film begins with the order of drinks in the pub - all this is a sense of disappointment, self-hatred and barbarity, which he has exhibited throughout the course of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it needs a foil such as a stoma and a dropped drama, and Winston is adapting to Kathy Burke as his long-lived spouse and eventually denied his unwavering behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles may turn out to be like Billy, his son-in-law, illumination, even though he sometimes had to wonder how he was doing exactly. Gary Oldman is approaching actors and maximizing the claustrophobia of their board. 4/10
