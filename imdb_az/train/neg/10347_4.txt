I just saw Adam's fourth son, and it was the one that hit me, Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. The film was about the same age as four boys. Warner Baxter described the story of Adam Stoddard, of the 26th President, about the same values ​​and family traditions that you have heard without the strange appearance of TR. <br /> <br /> In World War II, Stoddard's sons act as TR, in which case young people lose sight of being killed. <br /> <br /> A woman's minx enters the entire male house and breaks everything? Here's Susan Hayward's job. In one of his most advanced roles, Hayward is an outrageous, amoral girl who marries a boy, has a relationship with another and starts a game for a third. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to tell what happened to an ancestor of Theodore Roosevelt, an important model like Warner Baxter's portrait, and a portrait of Warner Baxter, a part of which everyone brought an Oscar for everyone. Their sons and their revolution are Rev. Bergman. The area is a bit silly here. Bergman, Baxter and his wife, Fay Wray, as a hiring manager for the kids. Wray dies and Baxter has some financial recovery in the business. Bergma should go. She returns to France and comes to your family years after childhood. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I do not believe if a child needs a religious person now. Hayward is right when he does not have children bringing him back. Normally, Bergman's life could be taken. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said I was amended by a third of the third part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the 50th jubilee event was held in Ingushetia and Syuzen, USA. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason why a man sees four sons. I was convinced that Ingradi stayed in a good work room.
