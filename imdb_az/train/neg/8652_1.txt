Before starting with this movie, I thought it would be a good thing, but when I got started, I found something really horrible. They say the film is made in Afghanistan, but 95% of the film is shot in India. You can see the Indian cars. You can see really funny and much more things proving that Afghanistan has not been filmed in Afghanistan by the work of pilgrimage * hahah *. I think it's time for me to watch this movie and not lose time .. pure time fever .. I recommend watching this movie instead of doing something else, or my heart may be a better idea, but watch out for it
