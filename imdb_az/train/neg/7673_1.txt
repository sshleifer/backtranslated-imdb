I do not know what to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before putting on another film. Stephen Dorff found the motivation of Val Kilmer's character in the "Top Gun" category. Slater does not fall asleep. Direction, editing, sound (really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), Suits (bulletproof vests with muscles on them) and hey, there is no incomprehensible plot. No one is involved with the project and said, "Hey guys, this does not mean just one thing, let's get started now." I hope Slater's career can come back from this disaster. <br /> <br /> He throws the worst movie I've ever seen.
