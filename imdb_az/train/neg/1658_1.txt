This is probably the most boring film in history. I really was looking forward to giving this movie to actor / director Roman Polanski. I'd like to see three Amigos better than watching this movie again. She immediately dropped off from the DVD player. Perhaps I apologized to those who loved this film, but you probably love New Coke. It's hard to see why everyone loves this movie, it's slow, boring, and there's no real space. Wait 105 minutes for the movie to begin. I realized that this was done in 1976, but it was the worst TV era around. The goddess went to the disco and three companies with gratitude goggles and Bay City Rollers. Well, my ideas.
