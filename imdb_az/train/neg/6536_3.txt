This DVD will only put on it and target one that is playing with an infinite loop in the background. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tangerine Dream has been set up as a series of music clips from the Grand Canyon, which has been assigned to various pieces of Dream music. Unfortunately, TD music is weak and the DVD transmission is quite blurred and indifferent. It's a very expensive DVD.
