It's a shit. I do not believe any company can do such a movie in a movie. Full Moon has some awesome movies, but it's the worst. First, there is no plot. This is strange. It took an idea for the story and did not really have anything to do with it. They only spent two hours to shoot, while "heroes" walked around the wilderness, and Bradbury talked for about 10 minutes. There were two scenes in the movie (when Dez and Dazzy were on the drive and when Dez and Bradbury were on the drive), it just went on and then ... it was almost 2 music videos that had some dialogue or action. <br /> <br /> Then we just came to a terrific game. First, the girl playing Dazzy is just a monster. She was in awe, she wanted to look for her face when she was on the screen! Terrible casting. Then, there was a man playing Dez, his life was unable to act independently of him. Her "crying" is actually funny and her madly antics are even funnier. The man playing the desk secretary in the hotel is as bad as the man playing Bradbury. <br /> <br /> This movie did not have any recognition worthy of recognition. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects ... hmmm, can anyone be miserable? "Impressions" were very fake, they were funny. One of the catepillars facing a brave little robot looks at someone, they are cut and when it comes back, the person creates a completely fake wound. Beautiful. Did they run the makeup budget or what money? It is necessary to tell the chick of a drugstore in a girl's apartment ... there is also a great makeup. <br /> <br /> I think they're going to deal with drugs, and I think it should be a black boy, but it would look more like a cheap zombie makeup for Halloween. <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely horrible. Story is stupid and very, very unoriginal, direction looks like a 10-year-old, the player is down the low and so on. Stay away from this movie in any movie. In the first place, only 70 minutes and at least 20 minutes are accepted by music or no information or characters sitting around the hotel. Do not waste time on this waste.
