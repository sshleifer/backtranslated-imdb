Producer Charles Bond direct slasher movie. On Full Moon's Biggest Success Day, Band said he would never make "real killer films" because those small puppets and big monsters felt they were adding a fantasy element to their films - they killed each other so real and less fun. The composer is a wonderful philosophy that destroys the full moon studio with oblique business relationships and is a real shame that he was desperate for the benefit of home cinema, so Blockbuster wanted and therefore began to sacrifice creativity and originality. The team behind it is "Delta Delta Die!" and 'Birth Rite' - are equally as smooth as the Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is in the usual top form as a new player for a bunch of dudes and dudettes who want to prepare a story about the "murder club". He clearly explained that he believed he was not a true story, and that a foolish mistress believed Rochon, and now everyone is covered with blood, and maybe not to kill or possibly kill each other. There is a choice, and in connection with this movie ... you are not recommended but absolutely not bad.
