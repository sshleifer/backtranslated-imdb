I think we will all start with a lot of review: "It could have been a big movie." A demented ex-con sprung fresh, neatly targeted to a suburban family. Revenge, revenge, manipulation. Marti, ordinary laying of Karo syrup. <br /> <br /> Nolte talks only with eyebrows, Lange goes out of cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod!". Despite his scenes, his way and Bobby D ... well, is another magic carpet. By influencing a kind of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he throws oily cigars in a miserable state, such as "Problem Child". And I want to imagine the above-mentioned accents. Imagine putting the brain-clanging religious rhetoric in real volume, just as it sowed the six Bibles, and here's De Niro's stick. The most striking, lampooned up for the "De Niro face" used by OVERDONE. The eyes shout, the forehead is fragile, the lips curl. Criman, Bob, looks like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story 14 years ago, Nolte's De Niro appeared on the screen when he was unable to keep the knife in various attacks. After being released, he felt Nolten's mistake, and then assured him and his brothers of terror. And because Nolte kept the information that could shorten his sentence, we have to give a small transition to the character of De Niro. De Niro is one of those criminals who, despite being guilty of a non-verbal move, believes that the shortcomings of freedom continue to move abroad. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> Remember that Notle's nearest residence (he may want to avoid some mistakes), his wife, daughter, and family dog ​​know. One of the drawbacks in the Wesley Strickin scenario is that it can be predicted totally. Although De Niro's aggression is even more horrific, you can enrich the rest of the action before it happens. Strick should not be completely condemned by several exciting dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis are the best scene in a shady exchange movie in an empty theater) but mostly cranked. Scorsese's cartoonist approach to photography has forced the forced revision of the revised Bernard Hermann account (I was expecting Wolf Man to be genetically enlarged with the tarantula). <br /> In the comedic part of the flick. Needless to say, a comedy, that is. You know the scenes of a horrible thing that's happening in graphics, but can not help you to get out of the eyes of others? We will do it here. Nolte and Lange are flirting with De Niron's finger on disbelief, lying on a substance that is supposed to believe in a cross-dressing and kitchen. And Bob's "philosophy" fiancé, which has been removed from prison, is a permanent, DURATION, mental harmful, endless. <br /> <br /> I did not want to kill him because it is more than rescuing an annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to lend money to other reviewers. This is really the Scorsese version of Freddy Krueger. De Niro relshes, speaks, stalks, pains, his one-liners, vintage Freddy. After twisting the water with a bowl: "Are you trying to offer" sumpin 'hot? "And this is just an example. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to excite Balsam, Peck and Mitchus (or a serious headache experience) about 30 years after the original 1962 snap, and Cape- Avoid one trip.
