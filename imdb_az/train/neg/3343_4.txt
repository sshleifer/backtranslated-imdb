Despite the fact that an enemy fired an enemy from the life of a young girl and lost many other captives, she survived this incident. The film was burned and this soldier is now a teacher at a secondary school led by policemen who control the hallways, the bathroom, and even the classrooms. In other words, High School is a prison, and most of the children pay very little attention to their teachers or teachers. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) is a soldier / school teacher, and he decides to go out of school and decide to enter another area. Nevertheless, the director treats her as a teacher of the prison class as a teacher. At this point of the film, when all hell remains idle and the story becomes full BOMB. If you decide to look at IT, try to use it!
