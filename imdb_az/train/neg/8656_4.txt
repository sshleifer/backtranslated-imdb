This first non-zombie subgenre has been reviewed ive but it's worth a review for this movie. Dinocroc is a common film, but unfortunately still an open movie. Dinocroc himself was great, but I thought the film itself was a bit more weight-driven, such as motion and violence, because the croc was shown or not in the battlefield, but rather croc and croc kills or runs in a recurring process. Jane Longenecker was a plus and the player was better than the average, and one of the most striking things, croc is a comedy * cough laugh, looked like a cartoonlike cough. I'm pretty happy to have this movie, but there's more to come than I can say about some movies. Total 3/6 stars and one hour's price.
