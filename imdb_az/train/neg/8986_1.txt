THIS FILM MOTHER, LAME, LAME !!!!! It's a lot of things to get me to make it frustrating about a movie, but this movie has closed my house! I have not yet finished the movie and refused to comment on how bad this movie was. I have never done that! As a consumer, do not waste your money on this movie. Wait until you have a cable channel or something. But television deserves it. I hate to scare a movie, but this movie is ACTUALLY! Punctual porn. And the X rating should be! Good plot, some nudity (if you swim your boat), but HORRIBLE moves to high school level. I do not know how this film is spreading. (The deal should have been something). Indeed, if you love good movie viewing, do not waste time on this. A movie from the lover to the other. YOU WILL HAVE A SATISFACTORY! Maybe I can say something about it, perhaps it may belong to you and it will be worth yours. Then I tell you that if you can get something from it, you see that it's acting on someone else's therapeutic value.
