It's not really surprising to me that the films are not as good as the book they actually go. I tried to see this movie because it's one of my favorite books. I was pleasantly surprised. But the story of the book was very wrong, and the movie version did not show how terribly this house was. The end was different. Lara Flynn Boyle seemed full of fear because of a really bad cosmetic operation. The player was the best. Perhaps a theatrical version would be a good flicker, if it did not last long in the "made for TV movie" box. If you see this movie, I encourage you to watch and read the book. I doubt you'll be disappointed and love it as I did every time I read it.
