I'm afraid that most of those who rate this movie at 10 degrees are very Christian. It is not me. If you're looking for a Christian movie, I'm coming to this movie. If you are looking for a good overall movie, I'm afraid you should go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I'm disturbed by the characters and their illogical behavior. The film's premiere is that the teaching of morals is wrong, without being taught that Jesus is the essence of morality. One scene shows that the main character is wrong to steal a boy and then the character tells us that it is Jesus. I see that this is offensive: do we believe "you will not steal", Jesus came? Probably wrote ten orders? Theft beforehand was acceptable? I rent the movie from Netflix. I have to characterize the character of the film from comments. He is excellent.
