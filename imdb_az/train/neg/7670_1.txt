Where do I begin my story? <br /> <br /> I came to this movie in the evening and I did not know much about the actors that had been with several friends and had to be a scary movie. <br /> <br /> Well, in the first 20 minutes, I thought about what a bad decision before seeing this movie. The field was twisted and the scenario was the same. <br /> <br /> The number of those who came to my husband's life was very small. Some of the scenes were faster than they were dragged without such a reason. <br /> <br /> This film was a huge loss of time and money. Boo.
