One of the previous commentators wrote that there is no basis for the idea of ​​the Story of Love; loved one or hated it. But it seems that the ideas on the scale range from 1 to 10 are beautifully shared. For me this movie is No. 4. There are several beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turns into a wonderful work, like Oliver's father. But the film did not look particularly attractive to explain its story, and the story was not rare for at least one review, but not for me. I can be a snob, but I have to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet - most of them, but all of them have been destroyed for my existence. What is the only exception to the hero who is the protagonist of Barbra Streisand that his smooth performance is perfect? - And for a good measure that is not casual, it shoots a shot at Love Story! <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the beginning of a wonderful career: Tommy Lee Jones's first film.
