It was the most expensive Canadian movie shot in BC only, but it was easily the worst thing ever to see the light of day. The director is not even a Canadian, even English, and the guy shows it. We all are prepared to be a group of very dope fiends and morons. To be Canadian means that there is no spirit, and this is considered the reason for the funding of this linen. Of course, the English character is normal. The rest is a product of sitcom stereotype - do you say "Norm"? Cinematography varies from pretty clear card images to darker inner silhouettes. Players are always confused. Is it boring as watchers, or is it the idea of ​​film directors? Take this confusion and watch some Bruce McDonalds movies. It's a genuine Canadian boy who is kinematically original. After 10 minutes, you will not have to get out of the HIS movies.
