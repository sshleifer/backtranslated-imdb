When I see the first look, I am very excited about this movie. Normally I see this good preview and open the movie. Something told me ... you know first. I was happy. Keira Knightley destroyed the future movies for me in this role. When I went to the 2nd Pirates movie, I went to see her. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated it for that. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know and care about it. I did not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I was not interested in his character, and even Keira did not value the film's nakedness. There is no truth in the direction of truth. The writing was large and shallow. Editing was terrible. I do not believe that style can not benefit from poverty. There is a place for that. The opponent, the best examples of the MTV style, were colorful editing (not sure if it was the official name) Club Club; just above my head. Even the enemies of the state had a half-editing style. Tastefully used and not used as hemp. That means the same guy who directs the Top Gun and the Crimson Tide. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who love this movie. It is a fair assessment that I think this movie will absolutely love or completely hate it. Undoubtedly, I hate it.
