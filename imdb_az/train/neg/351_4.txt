1 2/16/2002 - Dir-Arne Glimcher from 4 to 10 was watching: Mystery / Thriller, which is very ridiculous. This film is a very predictable, despite a very talented victory, and simply appreciates these viewers. The filmmaking community is not foolish, and I hope that some stars repeat their pockets again, even though they do not. At the beginning of the film, we think it will be something related to Caper's sentence, but this is nothing but a standard that fights for the audience, the milling of a mill, nothing to do with tension. As we have described in the story as we need it, we draw every moment in the dream passage and we are ready to go before this thing ends. Yes, there is a good thing to do, especially with Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris, but it does not work until the very long-awaited end.
