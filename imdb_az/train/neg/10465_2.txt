I really do not write this review. I'm a Christian, I'm looking forward to seeing this movie. A Christian film appeared in a Christian film that was a spectacular star and cunning place (I do not want to buy everything from the Bible itself). So, I enjoy the front view on the edge of my seat when the movie comes in and runs for a few minutes to destroy my mood. When I was in the theater I was obliged to crush my lips to do terrible writing and not to work (I would have been shattered by those who were shocked by the very sly, but mostly motivating scenes) and the illogical and predictable Tension Scenes, I'm sure). But after finishing the last loan, I can think. Some unexpected places, some sources that are really special (I'm not counting visions) and some exciting technical work - fades, sets, kind of thing I had in most parts of the movie. Unfortunately, if I had read a book of Revelation to a monkey and put an ape in front of a writer for an hour, I could get a better script. And the music was disgusting (even for a Bond fan who is fond of the action and intrigue scenes). So I resemble everyone in the theater - I wish I could be as incredible as coming to cry and breathe - but I'm not the one who can comfort the writer, the Bible's bark and a Christian stamp on it. Before I could use most of my films, I needed a good plot and a convincing dialogue, and that was not the case. Sorry, but I do not recommend this movie to anyone. And that is a tragedy. When will we see some clever Christian fantasy? We need to be together ...
