The latter view was very generous. I'm as calm as the first movie, but I can not say so much. The start is tough, but at a fast pace. I just do not see John Bon Jovi as a "bad ass vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor frightened. Many scenes are not logical. Perhaps every normal person thinks that a strange woman suddenly finds something suspicious when an experienced hunter puts you alone. Why can she communicate with Una Jovi? Nothing has been explained in this movie, if you had fun, did not cry, but it was a lot of trouble. This should be one of the worst vampire films I've ever seen.
