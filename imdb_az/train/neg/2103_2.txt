Bela Lugosi is a bad botanist who sends a poisonous orchid on the wedding day to her home, helping the stomachs to steal her fake ambulance / ceninde body and help Bela's spouse to keep infants forever. Some second-degree actors who try detectives try to solve a terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi is a wonderful thing, but you can say that you need money. <br /> <br /> This movie is terribly horrible and most actors resemble waiting tables, but it's ridiculous. They are very funny, telling everyone what to do and demanding the film. I bought the DVDs at a discount for 1 AZN and I think it's a very accurate assessment, so everyone who pays more money will lose it.
