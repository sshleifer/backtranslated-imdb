For most of the 1960s it was a time of change and awakening. There were many social disturbances and disorders because people talked to their own ideas. Racial tensions, politics, Vietnam war, sexually transmitted diseases and narcotics are daily components and daily news. This film tried to turn these historical works into a fun movie, and it succeeded greatly. <br /> <br /> Two families are being watched in this movie: one white, one black. In the first half of the story, the story follows each family equally with social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is about a white family. Of course, this family has more symbols, and the story lines are intertwined, but not the same as the race aspects of this century. In general, the actor has done a good job and is confused with colorful and black and white original photographs to give a documentary experience to the historical film. Film is a figural work, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time line. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the film, but the situation was predicted and the story was one-sided.
