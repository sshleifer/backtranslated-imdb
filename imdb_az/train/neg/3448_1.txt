If I still had 6 votes, I would check this movie and say 7.2 or something, but this is a serious movie. Allows you to knock down. The first thing you'll notice about this movie is that it is shot in a fifty digital camera owned by a first-year student at a college college. The next thing you will notice is that actors are all the comrades of the first pupil (maybe they've met the pub at the previous night) Third, you'll find that the music list is horrible and many of them have 30-second interrupted songs ... all digital editing, first- it's being done on your PC at home ... probably using Windows Movie Maker. This movie was terrible ... Ambitious, undoubtedly, had a bad script, and I do not recommend to anyone I know about this movie, but the writer and director will judge this movie for eternity in hell.
