I bought this movie and paid a lot of money for how much I paid, but I would say that at least it's worth the rent for some cold deaths and laughable activities. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say that I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> As I said, the player is a terrible thing, at least I have done a better job of showing any emotion. The story is nothing new and has been done better. I have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire-type movie. I rent or download this, but do not necessarily buy it. It's not more than an hour.
