When I saw this movie for the first time in cinema 11 years ago, I liked it. I'm still in directing and cinematography as well as music. But in fact, it's a script that's getting worse over time. I find Emma Thompson's original and loyal writings in the original book; He dropped Marianne side-by-side into a second for a very old, very violent Elinor - he was given a lot of "attention" in the film, and often only Thompson himself. <br /> <br /> I understand it's cut off a few characters from the book, but has left a scene in which Willoughby bought the book? <br /> <br /> I like Kate Winslet as Marianne, I came to the actors. Despite working on the best script in the world, he still draws in extreme ways without feeling sensitivity. Alan Rickman maybe a little older, but he plays a great role. And Elizabeth Spriggs, it's always fantastic, as it always is.
