I'm starting to say I'm a great fan of fantasy. But this movie is not for me. Many far-sighted arguments are intended to support the claim of dragons that existed in the past. The film records relationships with different stories from different countries, but it is better to explore the film and provide some reliability. The film uses CGI (beautiful!) To describe a fantasy story that has been narrated in the life of a young dragon. It has been combined with popular TV show CSI-style flash-drives that should look like something scientific, and this is not necessarily. In many cases, arguments / tips are often taken away. In some cases, the tips used to show the dragons were likely, or flew or shed the fire simply unreliable. It just gives me the cramps on my feet to see it. Even a fantasy movie needs some degree of reality, but there is nothing. Bottom Line: It's not worth watching this ambitious fantasy-CSI documentary.
