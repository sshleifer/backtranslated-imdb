You have to deal with violence !!!! Parker Posey is truly the only actress to be entertained and only part of the actors' club of the month. Undoubtedly, this is a controversial dialogue with David Mamet, in the absence of a tongue-cheek satire, on the contrary, a machine-gun frequency or a monotone (Ben Stein) blandness or an alternate dry comedy; <br /> <br /> As quiet and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we are tougher and worried, this movie works for a Rotten Tomato Award. Jeff Goldblum. <br /> <br /> This film has more trees than a tree gear factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to a stormy pile, there are some roles played by forgetful actors, such as those who have been called or drowned by the American Top Model, Pardo or even a child, as the word "bean", and this simply means it's too little to love about the movie, we're in Canada or not !! Where I thought I was serious I laughing and receiving sections that are meant to be seriously humorous. Even music director Mamet's sounds like the Cartoon of Alaric Jans music for the "Game House". When taken as a parody, the movie is postponed; If taken seriously, it is only a self-conscious duck piece.
