I'm really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I've ever seen was the Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved her. Then I looked at the Polyester and really hated it. Something I like about this movie was DIVINE. He had a very talented hell. I was really surprised. Generally I do not recommend this movie ...
