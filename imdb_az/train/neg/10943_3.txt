It's a really bad movie, with a bad player and a very boring speed! Although Lorenzo Lamas is really nice! All the symbols are simply annoying (except for Lamas) and there is no one to use the root or care! Moreover, the move is very boring. The film actually gives you 3 villains, which is awesome, laughable and just want to shut down something !, it is very scary and it needs to find anxiety, plus it looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but it can not save or believe it, or the opening was really cool, it did not end, but in the middle it was pretty boring and I started to look like the press fast forward!!!!! I also had a cool bar scene that really liked it, but Lamas once headed for the dock, all falls apart, plus finding that villains Jennifer torture the family and kill them when they are actually in the laughs. This is a really bad movie, with a bad player and a very boring speed, although Lorenzo Lamas is really nice! But this is not enough, it is not recommended. Direction is very bad. George Erschbamer brings a very bad job here, with a mediocre camera work, a soft position and keeps the film at intense pace. The actor is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is awesome here and does not require action, he has a pretty fun and really nice character to watch and has many charisma, but he can not even save it and he has no chemistry! (Lamas rules!). Jose Bell is terribly scary here, and when he looks decent, she is not very convincing and there was no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Sex is hot, but there is not much to scream and scare, it's good. Rober Scott was worried about the main villain and was not dangerous at all, and laughed like the other two. The rest of the pig is bad. Avoid Total! Run away! Even if you are like Lamas (like me). From 5 *
