In addition to repeating the above mentioned movie, I enjoyed watching this movie: ... castle / space and perfect director Michael Winterbottom and others. Work ... About 'Start Now' About the Story That Begins From the Beginning. Staying in a different environment (again in Italy) to stifle the heart of the loss ... or why did I see it? So, I look forward to seeing this story happen in a foreign country and expect it to happen ... and I sat there and sat down there and what do you think? in fact nothing happens! and I'm not saying anything! Even the characters are not allowed because they are 1 dimension and vacuous ... I believe that the speed of the film will be something to turn the whole movie at the beginning of the movie ... The oldest girls are cautious with local vespa boys and much more to shoot in another direction had a large area; the images of the youngest daughters of her dead mother ended with a frustrating and meaningless exercise; Fathers, I felt ridiculous considering the age of the one who tried to deceive by one of the girls. The final scenario has been the final decision as the last minute deciding to overcome any defect in the story and then push it to a level that has no effect. Loans (unexpected) can not help when you start to walk, but you feel like you're spoiled when you spend watching these garbage stacks.
