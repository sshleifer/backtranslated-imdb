This film would say Homer Simpson was "more boring than church". Maybe I do not understand enough, and I thought it was very good, but when Hermann Brown was sent to prison, Maria began to work and began to wake up when she was lying with her boss. Maybe something symbolizes, but in the end the explosion was forced and forced out of the ground. (SPOILER LAST). In the end, I do not see how great others are, because we are very disappointed with it. By the way, I did not follow this movie as we would see in a movie class.
