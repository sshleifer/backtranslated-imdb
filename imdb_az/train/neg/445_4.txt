Nathan Stoltzfus, proud of being the greatest historian on Rosenstrasse, was one of those historians who worked on this film, something that surprised me (and in a good way) about this film. Most of the actual cases were changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta was never intended for Lena's Goebbels bed, but did he have any impression of what had happened? <br /> <br /> Why do not you show other possible causes of freedom of men as Stalingrad disaster or the speakers are afraid that the international press in Berlin will inform the protest? <br /> <br /> Why does the whole story look like a weak family for the second time? Undoubtedly, it is awesome to carry their own history! It was as if there were two stories in the movies, really, not like each other. <br /> <br /> Generally, the purpose of this film was unsuccessful, and this was a shameless attempt to draw attention to a lesser one that could have a great impact as the resistance was better.
