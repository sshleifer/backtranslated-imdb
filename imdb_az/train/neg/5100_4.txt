This anime series begins with a great story: exciting stories, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully illustrated and executed. Everything is not immediately disclosed, and an epileptic produces an epileptic root at the front of an attractive viewer to watch an episode before the viewer. But imagine a disappointment to find that the fantastic thriller / giant robot adventure is just a guarantee for the psycho-naked and quasi religious testimony. "If you say good, you want to hear it after you've beaten it with negative slogans and negative emotions of heroes." If you want a fun fantasy flipper to watch, forget it, both original and alternative endings are heartfelt. it was.
