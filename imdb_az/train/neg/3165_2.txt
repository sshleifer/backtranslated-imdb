this movie was terrible. It would be better if you thought with any good player. Do not waste your time. Eva longoria parker was terrible. she should be left to despair housewives. Paul Rudd becomes an actor in B. The confusion I have made in the movie is that you can never be a woman. and the lake's call it was sweet, but there was a need for more acting lessons. See it as paradise with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a better one. or another ghost movie. you will be grateful that you do not spend your valuable time. PS I love you better than the humble romance! It's time to start watching movies from 10 to 7 and listen to people who have already seen it.
