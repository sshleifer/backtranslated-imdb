I hope the Apollon 11 mission has some good information and some good negotiation materials with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It could have been a big deal - but when I watched a 60-minute program, about 45 minutes of my life felt frustrated I am. I want those moments back.
