Unnecessary updates and attraction of the original can not be approached. Excessive length causes several parties to move. This version is ridiculously politically correct. There is no style in the film, on the contrary, there is no talent, not talent but direction, sets, dresses, etc. This period does not clarify details. Vanessa Williams is the only castle to show that Tyne Daly is not too bad. They left quite alone. Singing is good (Vanessa Williams) to the poor (for everyone). Follow the original version of 1963 and skip this one. There is not much to recommend.
