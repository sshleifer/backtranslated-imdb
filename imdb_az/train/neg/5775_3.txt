We show them some off-network. This is a good thing. B-movies are not as bad as they are, but on Saturday they have a large stack of stacks, showing on Sci-fi network. Acting is passive. Field and writing are quite substandard and the pacing is quite slow. Every minute of the film is perceived as part of the film - not the peak of the film, but the credit. Also, most of the filming is looking for an old way of looking at the age you are playing. Everything is predictable, boring, and not worth watching. Protect your time. It does not take time to watch it free.
