At least ten years have passed since the original version of Man On Fire, which has been heavily rebuilt and often amazed, and did not produce a better result over the past years. This film is designed to draw attention to the producers who have plenty of money and very little experience and to pay everyone just the prominent alimony or drug dealer, Scott Glen's bodyguard, kidnapped daughter of a rich Italian family, an exciting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - all done well, the move is indifferent and rugged, and John Scott's exceptional score (Die Hardin's last reel) is a positive impression. Reconstruction is a development of a situation (the original choice of the director for this version, prepared by Tony Scott).
