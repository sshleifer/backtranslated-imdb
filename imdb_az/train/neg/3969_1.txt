I felt that somewhere Dark Remains believed it was a good movie because I'm writing it. <br /> <br /> Poor scripts, weaker actors and weak leadership. Would not it be more appealing for a more attractive actress, even if it is not possible to give a big name? It was painful to watch a sincere actress film with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and was written weakly. Special effects were minimal. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains are worse than some of the Horrors Masters episodes. But I'm not content with quality movies. Dark Remains is recommended for hardcore fright fans who do not want to miss any movies in the genre, even if it's just a weak structure. As for others, time should be spent on something more valuable - it should be easy.
