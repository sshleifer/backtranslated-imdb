I took this movie from Blockbuster, and you can get 5 films for 20 kg in one of those shelves. I can say that I earned this money. I was awaiting horrific dialogue, terrifying monsters and shaking cameras. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in the press, three out of two are not bad. <br /> <br /> My toy is bad, though it's not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Perhaps I have watched very few budgetary films that have recently lost their perspective. <br /> <br /> In this film CG for Sasquatch is probably the second worst part. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; The first thing I've ever seen is (and I've noticed another reviewer agreed with me) it would be better for a man in a monkey suit Clunky stop-motion animation seemed better. > So why did you call the second worst part of CG? The worst part of the movie is that it's sound effects, they're loud, bored, and stable - I've been to the camp, knowing what insects are sounding in the woods day and night, and if they are high, then the cacophony but when I drown the film's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but I did not lose much of what I was holding from the film's dialogue. <br /> <br /> The move was unusual and boring.There was no tension, It was a feeling of empathy, while talking about heroes all were cookies and soft ones. i really do not think anything. <br /> <br /> Cinema work was good, two or two times more than what you see in a normal movie. Nevertheless, there was still a quality of "home cinema" that you got from films that were made with pocket change and prayer. <br /> <br /> If you look like me and take a blow from the budget charm of budget charm, and if you see it in one of these dollars, think about keeping it. Otherwise, avoid all expenses.
