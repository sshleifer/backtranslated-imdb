Probably, I think about the new Star Wars film, Phantom Menace, probably when you come to the devious box, if you pardon the penalty, you probably get water from the "Titanic" office receipts and then hit the number one point. Every time I hear someone announcing the "Titanic", it's the biggest movie I've ever seen, I think for myself, "Do not you see a lot of movies?" What travesty. <br /> <br /> You can do 50 best films that are better than "Titanic", like "Well, you've earned the Academy Award, and many people like it". Someone says in defense. Spice Girls, like Billions and billions of people, eat at McDonald's, but this does not mean high quality. Yes, millions of fans of Elvis can be wrong. <br /> <br /> For the first time, part of the problem was mega-consciousness of the film. I was expecting for a month and eventually waited for it and did not fit the expectations that attracted more attention to the terrible foolish love story. True, "Phantom Menace" will have a similar fate. <br /> <br /> James Cameron is the "Titanic". a) A cheerful activity is exquisitely covered as part of a serious period. b) The three-hour epic with the best moments given on the trailer. (c) a story of love or love beyond love. d) It would be better for documentarians to do something better. e) A movie that boasts an arrogant boat to the level displayed by the real ship. f) I will never be back for 3 hours robbery, and therefore the biggest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I met a person who has not yet met, I say, "I could trade with you in places". h) slap in front of any real victim of hypothermia. How long should people believe that cold water cools and creates sensitive sentences? h) A film that is not recognized for any of the Oscars. i) is a technological achievement in the field of cinematography and is a little less. <br /> <br /> The only reason I have sent it as anonymous comment is that I will not accept the 10,000-year-old's thirteen-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio rebuttal, which does not cause any doubt. and I'm not really interested in defending the story, activity or length of the Titanic.
