Well, Cannes artyfartyrati may have liked this movie, but I'm not afraid of it. If you like the kind of movie you've been filming for a long time, it may be for you when you are surprised that the actor is sleeping or when the cameraman goes for lunch. A large part of this extends in a short time close to a similar dissatisfaction. Like some reviewers, he was unhappy about shocking - just a little surprising and meaningless. The only reason you did not give this star one is that the actor's film is shot well enough. But the plot does not give much advice. A large portion of the film shows an enthusiastic woman listening to or listening to piano, which can only appeal to some people. But do not think that it is ready to awaken the bad taste of your mouth just to get ready for pornography and sexual violence. Not recommended.
