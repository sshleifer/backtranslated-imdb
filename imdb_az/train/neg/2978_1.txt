I am a big fan of horror and zombie films are a special opportunity for me. Zombie 3 is one of the worst films I've ever seen. So, I really liked to say, I've seen a good bad movie for a long time. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon, "The Resurrection of the Living Dead", but the film is deliberately laughable, but the contrary. Particularly my main character, some of the most enjoyable activities I have met. The scenes with the General were hysterically. In addition, the effects are subpar and many cases of sloppy and death scenes are often just obviously stupid. Of course, it's more fun. Possible SPOILER - The worst man is the scene where the refrigerator door opens, and then opens his eyes and turns it off suddenly (it goes straight out with a fever), kills the boy's zombie head, kills his neck. Are the zombie chiefs now able to air in the air? Everyone known to human beings is in violation of the law, and this film is one of the most absurd things to do. This is one of the really really goofy moments of a stupid mistake. I do not believe you have earned a high rating so far. If you are an admirer of bad movies, give yourself a blessing and buy this sucker.
