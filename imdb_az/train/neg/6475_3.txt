Despite the fact that I have been watching the film for about two years, I remember exactly how far it goes. <br /> <br /> Private Little Mermaid loved and obsessed with mermaids as a child can be, I decided to take time to follow up and follow up. <br /> <br /> Disney is a small message for you. If the original director and actors are not necessary ... <br /> <br /> Our story begins with a younger Ariel and daughter, Melody. My first major problem was Eric and the rest of the crew. Yes, I understand that Disney's great on song and dance, but really, Eric is my favorite princess. He was a quiet gentleman who was calm, gathered and knew how to relax. And he DID. NOTE. SING. <br /> And then there is a villain. How can we forget how Ursula has sprung up our spiders when we place Ariel and the glorious ones with fear in every corner of the globe? Unfortunately, this gene did not pass through Morgana, his apparently useless brother. Nothing was said about Morgana in the first movie; She just stops trying to steal her baby. Oh, how sweet it is. The younger brother decided to abandon a month-old baby after his departure and trident. Gag to me. <br /> <br /> Morgana was unusual, with a sense of peculiarity. When I watched that movie, my sister and I did not scare anyone at all, and when I was watching this movie, I was three years old and she hysterically laughed. ; I would like to see my mother is a liar. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not hold any respect for me in my first movie and even did not go. Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder started me. Triton was a strange but loving father in the first film, and secondly, he lost his will to the fear of his subjects. Scuttle, once a funny relaxation laugh with everyone's "dingle hopper" (yes, I'll admit it, then after calling my hook a dingle hopper). In this movie, Scuttle has been forgotten. The first one, even a supporting character, has at least added something to the film. He was wealthy in the absence of others, and later he was completely abused. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as uncomfortable as before. Disney, do not do this. Do not even try to get confused with the crab we love. Or your favorite little fat fish, which gets a father and is very bored kids. <br /> <br /> Mary and the penguin were unnecessary and after a while you start to wonder. <br /> <br /> One day, Disney, I hit one of my life. <br /> <br /> If you do not like it, you have lots of originals.
