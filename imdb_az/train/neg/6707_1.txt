Please do not forget. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I have ever had to fail to watch. I think the film is an insult to my brain and behind me, and it has been complaining about me being watched and watched by this movie. I still do not see the damage that has led to the ability to see and finish my penalties. What is the garbage burden? And I did not start the actor ... Help me forget one! "Strange Science" - Go back! Everything was forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I'm proud to give this movie the first IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of films ... Most of them ** but this is so bad, I do not even believe it. Someone really thought and thought he was worthy of a movie? Someone really read the script and decided to shoot the movie? Someone read the script and auditioned for it? Did anyone decide on the movie and put a shelf to collect dust for eternity *? * This is * the questions I have answered. You know, it's not a philosophical question about the woods and trees in the woods ...
