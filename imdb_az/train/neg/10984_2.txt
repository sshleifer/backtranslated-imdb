I watched this movie for two hours and did not know what that was. Someone was killed or perhaps not, and maybe someone did or did not do that. When all CBC Canadian films were stinkers, it brought back the good old days (bad old days) memories. Recently, stinkers were no exception, but fashion feminism makes for this lost mixed hodge podge, flash back bouncing and madrassic dialogue lost time. It's never easy to read Margaret Atwood's books. This movie continues to be a beautiful Canadian tradition. It's not easy to watch. Perhaps the trendy people in chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will claim that they like it. Our people are a little assertive in peace.
