I can say that, unlike many people who did not like or did not understand this film, I understood exactly what it was. A very unusual attempt at the line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Basbug, in the first place, presents materials in an extremely "arrogant way" and is worse, too sensitive. Our goal is to wait for more than two hours, and the audience will think that the director is too drunk to remember CARE's scenes for the first time. <br /> <br /> I respect the Surrealist cinema. (creating a story about more real world that does not resemble real life). However, there is nothing to do with a story placed in the usual modern era and, at best, is a series of events that can not attract the audience, and just like one another. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is to review a story; <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was built on a book, but it was disappointing with the fact that the camera did not capture the necessary moments and did not co-ordinate one another. <br /> <br /> Stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's "Seoul Contract" with that. He gave us a consistent, very attractive and intellectually deep story. Although this film does not offer any intellectual research and is very stylized in the director's partial presentation, the director has finally abandoned the main art of the good story, and everything we do is a blend of interconnected events. <br /> <br /> Yes, it really makes sense to understand everything .... to a point. But as I said earlier, the viewer simply says, "Who cares?" Playing in a supermarket and watching the excitement of a man dealing with grocery shopping on a non-chronological order. Even murder is totally uninterested and weak. <br /> <br /> Many people today are unable to grasp something that they can not understand, and will justly appreciate something to fear foolishness. If you have a lot of time, watch this movie and watch it. It is a story based on a book that can be presented in a much more effective way, and this is my main idea.
