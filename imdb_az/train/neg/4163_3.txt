I see that a few people involved in these mistakes wrote a study to share the story and thought it was helpful to understand what they were writing. They write mainly excuses - writing, budget constraints, production formats, and so on. - it just emphasizes how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is not unambiguous. <br /> <br /> This is a corner hole in each corner, the dialogue is ridiculous, and the last is about a mile away. The modest feature of the hologram associated with the reconstruction group is drowning in an exciting conversation that is eating in the middle of the possibility that a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would some hamburger Helper Sally destroy us if we were killed by automated carpet broom? Apparently, this elite team was equipped with the latest gizmos and the magnificent armor of red plastic did not reach out to the ETSN. <br /> <br /> After entering the latter rooms, they are treated more like a fourth-star motel than a deadly encounter zone. <br /> <br /> The logic of the match with hero Kohz is his immediate killing. However, before only one scene, the king stopped doing this while the hero did this. Huh? Vivian Woo attracted and captured the best moving characters of the film. But I do not say much.
