One of my favorite actors, places and genres - Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and I'm worried to appreciate it with political tension, but 'Sentinel' really falls. This front was an idea, signed a right cast and had some big city shots, and then made a strike that allowed the rest of the band to chop. And yet, I accuse him of another soft work from Basinger (not only that he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but for more than a decade he was the only bad actor in the film, 'LA Confidential' for acting actor to win). But it was not the only problem. 24-year-old Jack Bauer-like Sutherland plays again. I miss his old "Kill One Time" or "Several Good Men" days. Douglas, of course, left the motion and called it by phone. Here's one: Some Secret Service wants to kill the treacherous, the president, and Douglas (kindly). Does anyone believe in him? In fact, there are no spoiler here: this subplode is over-done as soon as you come in half way. And why some (presidents) wanted the president to die? Will it be revealed later? There are many field holes, many doors opened and closed and are very predictable 'The Sentinel'. If you only see a movie in one year, you will not know who the mole is, but anyone who sees the film's episode "Law and Order", which is familiar with the type of movie or in the first few frames. Was horror? Indeed, cinematography was good, and in spite of Sutherland, Jack was still playing, he still has.
