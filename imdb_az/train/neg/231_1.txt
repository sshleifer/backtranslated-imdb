What is worse with the three women who work as simpir when they are sitting around giggling gin, gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate for a man who tells the story of the best 'man' - spoiler alert = = - Andie's character What happens to a young bodyguard who can become a student when he is 14 years old (he is the head of the English school, he believes or not) is 'girlfriend' from Hell. ... and then there is a basically unwashed cover: it is 'forgiving' the friend, and the body has a lover's friend, and it ends when 3 women begin to drink more and drink more cigarettes. Andie's character throws on a street in a miserable attempt for the symbol of growth of caramel chocolate. Respect.
