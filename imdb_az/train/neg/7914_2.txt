This movie is planned to be a boundless movie and really. This popcorn is the type of movie that is made to watch dining and amazing graphics. However, the film is not as cool as the ultra luxurious Iron Man. <br /> <br /> Famous pop-roots fall off more cliff than the munching movement and the film's special effects, more than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> The majority of my followers, however, are poorly adapted to the film, not the poorest movie. This film is also unsatisfactory for other reasons. Manufacturers were paying more attention to their minds in order to attract attention. The long-awaited and encouraged characters appeared on stage 4. Wolverine, Victor Kreed (not called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker's main characters are well developed. I made a good impression on the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the heroes are thrown out to lead to all major eye sweets. <br /> <br /> Although Viktor has been surprised by the movie, Wolverine's character is 30 minutes later, like Sabertooth. <br /> <br /> The final director of the film is a twisted, twisted adaptation of the film. has the original character and makes it difficult for any development to show only what it is. The filmmakers clearly felt that all the things that really needed to do everything they wanted and created a bad donkey that had a name for a famous character. <br />
