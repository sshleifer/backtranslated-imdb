Given his popularity, I found this movie a great disappointment. Maybe I was expecting a lot from this movie. It's one of the most famous martial arts films of the 1970s, but why I did not understand it. The story is uninteresting. This is a very interesting movie with sporadic movement schemes. The biggest problem with the film was that the story did not give me a character I could do, because the intended hero was a dragon. Director Changun has no meaning in the style and he can not hide the obvious defects in the narrative. I do not know, it does not have high art, but I miss the movie. Of course, this is not the best example of a very popular genre. Her religious status escapes me. I advise you to overcome it.
