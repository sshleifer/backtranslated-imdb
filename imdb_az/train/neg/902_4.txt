I think that this movie belongs to today, because it is a film of Sofia Loren. The film was 19 when it was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because I wanted to see Sofia's early work. I was surprised when it came to the camera after tanning in the brown makeup to resemble the prince of Ethiopia. Undoubtedly, this movie today would be regarded as a filmmaking and demolition. <br /> <br /> Actually, if the opera singers shoot this movie, this movie would be better. Then realistic artists' readings and real face faces seemed clear. <br /> <br /> Ms. Loren was 19 years old, and still the film would still be better, as it is today. even if performed on the stage. After all, the old "opera singers" behind the scenes do not see the beautiful youngsters on the stage! Do not discount the success of using popular opera singers. For J. G. Wentworth's opera singers to professionally praise the company's product, it is necessary to apply to the most featured television commercials. This is one of the best and fun television ads ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film also makes this product a little bit lower quality. <br /> <br /> In order to improve this movie on DVD, our manufacturer must add English subtitles, as we do not speak Italian, say what we can say. <br /> <br /> This film is a story of Aida and it's not a fact, it's an opera. None of his colleagues except Mrs. Sophia Lor√©n is not mentioned by this writer. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
