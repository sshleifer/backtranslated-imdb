Vipul Shah has done a really impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. "Wagt - Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" are entertaining and interesting to watch. Singh Is Kinng was entertaining. <br /> <br /> The London Dreams movie has a motivated movie. This shows how friendships become hateful. "London Dreams" agree, has potential, but are you surprised what happens when you watch 'London Dreams'? This film may have been the worst summit in recent times. Vipul Shah writer Vipul Shah put it on the ground. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second is better; but still peak panic. How can he forgive a man who decides to destroy you? I will not be. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and wishes to forgive his childfriend thanks to Om Puri. When he arrives in India, Salman does not blame or abuse him, does he compliment the composer, and does he say the reason behind the entire fiasco? Vipul Shah intends to show the character of Salman as God? Yes, because you're totally unsuccessful. The only question I would like to ask from Vipul Shah is to greet a person who has ruined it with such a magnificent setting? Write down what you feel, do not deceive us (viewers), we are sensitive enough to understand whether it is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is not music, but the music of Shankar-EÅŸan-Loyun fears. No song is in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman, though superior. The film carries on its shoulders and is really good at sensual scenes. But still his character is shown as a God who causes God to look like a retard. Ajay is equally good, but Salman completely shaded him. Is Asin Wasting and What Is A Great Thing Like Om Puri? Rannvijay hams, despite Aditya Roy Kapoor's superiority. <br /> <br /> Brinda Parekh is as good as a vamp. <br /> <br /> Generally, this dream is a dream!
