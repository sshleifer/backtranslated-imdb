I've seen this movie as a very young girl (now I'm 27) and I was foolish for many years. There were nightmares as I was exposed to violence (obviously) in all aspects of this film. My parents argue about those who still allow me to watch, and both of them tell me they will never let me watch the movie. I think only that they know I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I am currently reading a book (since it is sick and classic) and this is really a great story. But I do not think it should turn into an animated film. Ever. Well, maybe children would be strange in these days, but they gave me nightmares and weeks, and I still found it hard to see the rabbits in a similar fashion. Every time I get a little heart failure. Oh, I'm on a strike, but I think it's the first time that any parent will watch this movie to show their children, read their book, or confirm the content. Everyone is concerned about me, but we are leaving; 0)
