This third Darkman was better than the latter, but it's still worse than the original movie. This Bad Guy, better than D2, was replaced by Durant. Moreover, when it comes to the wicked man's family and Darkman, there really is a sign of character development. It softened my heart and I gave this flick 4/10, ie ** / *****.
