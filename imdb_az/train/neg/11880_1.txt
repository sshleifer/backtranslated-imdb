Especially in this period computers, multipurpose copy machines, e-mail, voicemail, snails and temps, a satirical area, earlier "Clockwatchers" and "Office Space", and this is the latest addition to the Temp / humor pool. , but Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, the 'Haiku Tuneli', did not live up to their predecessors and hid their laughter somewhere outside the door, waiting for a secret chance. "Unfortunately, this is not a chance for the audience; star Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth) points to the opening frames (directly on the camera delivered to the camera), this story is purely fiction and occurs in the fictional city of San Francisco. Innovative, if not very presented, unpublished disclaimer, and all this is funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, a self-supporting writer, as a pace - this is a fitting job, and from time to time some of his novels but he is doing well on the first day when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), and Shelby sends Secretary General Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to convince her to send him to Kornblut " . The idea of ​​working for the same company is primarily in the heart of Kornblut, but he is in the cave and takes up his job. He is worried about it, but at least now other secretaries accept his existence (of course, they will never work tempo) and if everything is very rude, he has seventeen important letters - (because they are back as they are an easy part of the post) should be returned), be careful with caution, if all of it is too much for him). Although these are 'important' letters, Kornbluth at the end of the week at the reserve, at the desk. And when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluth will not buy a genius to understand just like the day the fair-haired boy will be. And soon! <br /> <br /> Brothers Kornbluth, who is not only directing, and John Bellucci wrote a scenario for this movie, Ben Stiller made a page of the comedy book, "If you play straight, you'll laugh". But they were not and would not be the audience. Because in comedy, they were as objective as possible, because the main character (as well as the majority of supporting characters in this case) is "fun" - as he is "funny". And here's what Kornbluth is here; thus, more and more ambitious, more than a "comic" being a mistake in the Kornbluths section because he sabotaged his films by allowing him to do so. <br /> <br /> When trying to differentiate between the fact that this film does not work, there are two main reasons: The director, if not necessarily 'bad', is at least negligent; Second, speeches started with Josh Kornbluth. Very simply, Kornbluth was impressed by being more effective than himself. Unlike styles and even Steve Mart, both of them use very humorous humor very effectively - Kornblut has an appearance that will not allow itself to appear in this light; his viewers seem to have a need to really know that Kornbluth really is more intelligent than Kornbluth's character. And as in the film, it will not get past. Instead of giving Kornbluth millions of office workers knowing who can link this movie with whom they can connect, Kornbluth serves to justify the people they are trying to reach. As for all this, it is a poorly-guided and unsuccessful move, and given the inexplicable narrowness of the scenario (considering the potential of a rich theme), given that the scenario is weak, this is a saving grace of the film - Warren Presented by Keithin Shelby, his delicate delivery is convincing, and it's pretty joking. Nevertheless, Keith Kornbluth has been forced to share his scene, but its effectiveness is reduced. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) keep their presidencies above the water; it is possible to wait at least for their own scenes, and Overman even manages to raise Kornblut's activity for a moment. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong>), a community view by disadvantaged Harry Shearer as a Orientation leader - a role that answers the question: "What did he think when he agreed?" In any business environment, there will be situations when one or the other will be inevitably productive for a comedy ball and will always be with us for movies that reflect these cases; those who are good (see paragraph 1) may even be classics. However, "Haiku Tuneli" will definitely stay in their place for a long time because it is somewhere else - the fate is found only in an area known as "Flawlessness". I value it 1/10. <br /> <br />
