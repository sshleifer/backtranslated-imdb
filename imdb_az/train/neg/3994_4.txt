I am a great admirer of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> <br /> < I went with my request. <br /> <br /> This is not the fault of actors. Both Shalke and Jackson have very small roles, as the premiere of the movie, Cusacki, puts a "boy into a locked room" scenario. <br /> It was not a BAD movie, but I can not say it or a good one. This was a muddied mess with "ouch, it's just WRONG" moments with "ouch, it's just painful" moments, and with "little bit of oh, now that's just the unfortunate" between them. Eislin's father once showed, and there is nothing unusual about Mike's personal life. <br /> <br /> An earlier commentator commented on Olin / Enslin's argument and very much agree. However, apart from some clever musical wishes (the room almost tormented Enslin with a bit of violence and gives him a chance to get out before the ante ... at this point he gives him an hour of countdown and the carpets "We just started . ") is a title line, the majority" at least throws things when you wait! " <br /> <br /> Jason was an entertaining horror when he was 14 when he was watching Lake Crystal Lake and was surrounded by my friends. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> **** END SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I will not expect this movie, along with the name of Stephen King, better than the actors mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The origin of the evil we will never be able to find it. <br /> <br /> We have not seen some defeats, though we will never be able to see our defeat. <br /> <br /> And what's the end just for "What?". <br /> <br /> Wait until the cable comes in. I do not mind to pay it as a matin√©e, but I feel a bit shortened to pay for nightly rates.
