Nicolas Roeg? He did not say "DON'T LOOK NOW" to classical supernatural regression? Strangely enough, the above-mentioned movie was released on BBC television during the weekend, and COLD HEAVEN's show this evening was no pride. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <Br> <STRONG> was replaced by a husband who died in exchange for a deadly change, in fact, my idea was filmed around a horrible widow who saw her husband flying around Venice wearing red anoraks. This does not happen, but when a third of the road runs, a massive area is bent and is not disclosed at any substantial depth, although it is an important area. In fact, very little movie is being described in COLD HEAVEN, which is damaged. <br /> <br /> People are talking about COLD HEAVEN's poor production values, and it is impossible to notice them. If I did not, I would think that television is television, because I'm prepared for television, and I feel it's white in the headline. Roeg is also trying to claim the art house through speech processes, but still does not help this movie. Roeg can not help to put all feelings on the screen completely flat. <br /> <br /> Inexpensive production values, irrelevant leadership, and really striking premises and scenarios become a bad film.
