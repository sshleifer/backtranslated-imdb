This movie is sophisticated with a vision. There are some delightful black comedy moments. But in general, the appearance of the view is much more than a click. If you're fond of the hostel or the most violent in the main movies, you'll love it. If you are looking for something in all the high brow, remove it. I've seen it as part of the edinburgh film festival on 06, and I chose it because I was just looking for something to worry about. As a result, it is not uncomfortable. Just sitting and sitting is unpleasant. If you really want to challenge, look at something like Lost. Tell your friends about the movie if you want to accomplish, or really messed it, it's for you.
