I liked the first movie, but it would have been better from the left on the drawing card, which was later a manual. The overall idea in the first film was not good but at least very interesting. This is what he later tried to create ideas and characters from the first film, and though Christopher Walken was still as good as Gabriel, all the ideas were ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, take the first movie and then forget about it, and take all the joys there.
