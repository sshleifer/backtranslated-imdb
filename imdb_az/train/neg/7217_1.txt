I watched this DVD at home. We love the West, but my husband leased it. He began to apologize to me for half. Saddles, suits, accents - everything was empty. The part that made me so terrible is the place where a man does not collect "collector" with his bow and arrow while taking the soul of the man. His sole excuse was "only two readings". We watched it all the way, and as someone else said, he said too many bad things to distinguish. I would like to say that the boy was in the same moon and day to catch the evil of the collector, so what happened? Why was there a life of yard on April 25 that saw everyone die, but the people taken by the collector still walk around? If you want to have fun after a couple of beers of a movie, this can be your movie. But if you want a real West, you will hate this movie.
