I have almost every Seagal movie (yes, budget is such a budget), so it should be said that it can be worse than movies, not just movies. This is the only point in the film and I am giving it 2 stars instead of just 2 stars, A. Seagal and B. Seagal, in particular, have some sweet movement sequences in the store, and it has never been with an entire army knife. The story was not just stunk, but the F-16 and F-14 were somehow faster than the F-16s, as well as a secret F-16 because the next time I was killed in Seagal for 90 minutes and even did not bother with a story line. He never gave fuel to the secret. And after considering the enemy lands from the Afghan Air Force. In the end, I checked, there is no air force in Afghanistan; we (US) control the heavens. Also, this secret mission called all the crew members in the room, but Admiral still proved to be secretive to the other guy. Moreover, how did Seagal go above the truck? Why do they say they are in prison? After the Air Force pilots have great commandos (in the absence of Owen Wilson)? And in the Arab countries, when will their drinks not drink alcoholic beverages? And moreover, after listening to orders from women like # 2 who are responsible for the Arabs? The purpose of the film was a very short and totally casual scene from Seagal's store, with the killing of people and the other 50 people killed with a knife.
