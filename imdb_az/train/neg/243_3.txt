But she is trying to stay away from her family. <br /> <br /> Piter Falk (Colombo) comes to play a few different roles to convince him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is a medium and really an old star (Peter Falk) is quite nice. But William Russ was not really a star. <strong> <br /> <br /> In fact, the last 20 minutes would mean I would say the word. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> A letter grading system would take a "D".
