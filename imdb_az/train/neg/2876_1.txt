I question the motives of the authors of these fictional accounts in the motives of the BTK killer. Are animal rights advocates trying to portray them as sick monsters? Who is responsible for that? Do not they think that people who are involved in this monster have enough damage? The degree of disrespect and abuse of the victims! It was like an identity experiment: What's more, you're concerned about slaughterhouses or murder? Some of the victims used the real names ... This movie was erroneous, disrespectful, and insulted! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to revitalize and redefine the line!
