<br /> <br /> CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first features) was terrible, I thought, because there was great hope for this movie. <br /> <br /> However, most CLAIRE DOLAN is completely meaningless and straightforward. <br /> Claire is trying to escape being a prostitute, or is it not? It's hard to figure out. If he wants to escape from life, why does he take the plane at the airport? If he needs money on Seattle, why does he not get the tricks? Why should we see her hair immediately in the same color? Claire accepts some johns and not others? <br /> <br /> The film artist does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> I feel like I'm all inclusive (though that's not true), and filmmakers, verite documentary. <br /> <br /> I saw that Kerry's condemnation of the film's commentary as a political conservative defended the absence of scenic choices. It sounded like a learned rhetoric. <br /> <br /> I'm making a movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to go into this delicate film as CLEAN, SHAVEN, and as a developer of an interesting movie, and then tire him in a tired way. old "political" clich√©s.
