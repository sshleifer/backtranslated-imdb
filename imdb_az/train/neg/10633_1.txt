I watched this video in a friend's home. I'm glad I did not spend that money. Video coverage There is one scene from one Capricorn since 1975. The film begins with an explosion of several rocket-propelled rockets. Sibre is a short video clip of the smoker weapon, the video astronauts that make up the video. He corrects his voices as long as he does not allow the crew to listen. The video ends with an impression of Zapruder. His claims about radiation, protective, star photography, and others believed that he was a very ignorant or a kind of axis to mix NASA, astronauts or the United States in general. His science is bad, and this is the video.
