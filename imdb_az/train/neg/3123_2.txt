While watching this movie, I felt mine ... but it seems that this film has caused horror in the family. As others have mentioned, it does not mean much, it is one of Karloff's recent films, and only the existence of the screen, which provides no reliability. All the legends of the horrific films that have taken place in the sound period, eventually, have dropped to a lesser degree than in low-grade pits. Marginally, Boris poorer than the poor old Bela Lugosia, but not so much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and tries to gather this blend together. Crazy background music does not help at all. In addition to Boris, the rest of Mexico's shedding has become strange, cut, British monotony, and reminds of the latter's type of use in porn movies. <br /> <br /> In a word, I think that Edgar Allen Poe's 'Usher House' is that it is taken, but you will be in a difficult position to find a great Poe in the finished article <br /> <br /> The best of Boris Karloff There are better movies there, look for them, and give them a large plaque unless you want the curse of 'shattering brain'!
