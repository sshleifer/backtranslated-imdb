Maya is an uninhibited woman. He only dreamed of his life and miracles, why not? This could be an interesting topic. There is a good story, a good situation, and a good dialogue. None of these are available. This movie is absolutely boring. Not just the lengths and tops. The only climb is Shahrukh Khandun. But despite being a great admirer, I could not stay in the movie. You can not even shoot this movie. The movie is not as bad as Uncle King and if you are a fan of artists or as slow as you are, maybe you can be like that. It's not funny, it's interesting, it's not a buyer. My advice: Do not follow.
