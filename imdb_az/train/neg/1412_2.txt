While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie titled "Making 10 Products or Less". <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. Good news, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: It's great! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The film is an hour and a half. One business day is eight hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Author: Why not? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> !! But it's beautiful, at least in our Morgan Freeman movie. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a burden. It would be better to earn money. <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a while. .. <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, maybe that's pretty strange. But now we can not change the title! <br /> <br /> My work is really like the reality, but then it was not "10 Product or Less". This is a good toy, but it's a badly written situation and I hate to see it. While watching an independent movie, wait for some kind of message. I can say that in a better movie, a message that has resulted in death is "do not let you fall back" for "tired old". Anyway, with the "10 Product or Az", I would like to see the message "Look at the message Morgan Freeman!"
