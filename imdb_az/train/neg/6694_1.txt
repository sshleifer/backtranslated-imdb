I really enjoyed this movie because I saw Kari in a few other jobs and thought he was some talented. Unfortunately, this is not an exaggeration if you do not have to do it in the scenario. Completely undefined characters, no part of reluctance, and no space. Is a way / buddy / comedy / tension / romance / drama? Cinematographers do not have a clue and what we do.
