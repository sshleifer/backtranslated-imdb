"Whipped" is 82 minutes. This review is 82 words long. Three unknowable "scammers", three challenging New York Lotharios, who suffered the same woman who played with ruthless Peet, resulted in disastrous results. It is about the story and the movie. Very honest, dull and ridiculous, "Whipped", shocking jokes with Pentax's dreams, blends Tom Lykis philosophies. Technically competent, though, is poor, poorly written, average, and clear. People do not behave like this. People do not talk like this. Indeed.
