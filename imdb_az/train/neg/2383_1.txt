This is a candidate for the most disappointing film experience of my life. Cool name, perfect director (previously seen in "Die For" and "Pharmacy Cowboy") and hey - in the game called Uma Thurman. How can you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Behold, this is a question that touches my temples a few hours after watching the Hindu. <br /> <br /> I did not think to be outside, that it should be avoided from the dead zone of a movie all its expenses. His criticism is worthy of lambasting. Here is one of the rare films that has no recurring quality. Zero out of ****.
