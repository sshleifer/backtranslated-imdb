OK - Preset: A compact '70s crocodile (all right, correction - caiman) with unmarked signs, miniature underwater shooting using a toy crocodile (compared to the full length of reptiles) <br /> <br /> Most primitive Unlike the kill-exploit-western films, local people are batting and the mass killing of the rest will be justified this time. No one actually exploited the local population - exploited, but it is far from the aggressive treatment. <br /> <br /> Almost the rest are eager to work with the exception of the 70-year-old Euroflicks (with the exception of the little girl-one-glow-to-the-heroes) but far from death - door neighbors, mind. One pair actually kills heroism - none of them should fill the role of sidekick. <br /> <br /> The whole film has only two pseudo-betrayals, so dreams are more than cathartic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Session, strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You know, first of all, interested in this movie WHY? I thought so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-family: <br /> < br> The hero is half not bad, far from a fool (always on B in movies) and the little kid's funny relief provides most. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look !!
