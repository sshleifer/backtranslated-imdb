Skippy, Eddie, plays a "wings of metal" nerd from "family ties". When your favorite wussy "metal" singer Sammi Curr dies, all posters on the wall of the bedroom are throwing a prey. But later, when he was receiving a reaction to the spirit of the dead "metal" idol. He first took vengeance on revenge, but he did not want Sammy to get it. Indeed, his main victims are not just going to hospital. The film is entirely laughable and depends on how much it is with the real metal "Rock Star". Okay, maybe a little bit smaller, but it's my opinion. And I have no clue as to how a guy from Skippy can take root from Family Ties. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richards is a topless topless addition to the pool side of the pool
