Talked about Charles Bukowski, he talked to a friend John Fante in the summer of last year. I did not know that this subject was a favorite writer of Bukowski - a strange and humorous article, except for a generation earlier. "Tactile" was the first Fancy book I read, and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a romantic, frightening young writer who presented himself as a legendary, talented writer who did not have any idea how to write his experiences in the real world. The protagonist in the novel is a virgin. Without any ideas, she gains women's respect for magazines. The story of a strange relationship with Camilla is the story of how she has been settled with the "wounded" admirer for her first sexual experience, and finally she has nothing left but a failure to do so for love. end The adaptation of the film protects the reality of the book for a time, but becomes a cinematic trap that suffers from racism, disease, and death. The heart of this story is that Bandini is a madness and that Camilla is crazy and that nothing actually and never will happen, regardless of what they want to find. This movie has the true meaning of the story and replaced it with schlock. I do not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown read this book and could make a very bad movie about it.
