The summer season is here, with movie theaters being limited to the hottest week of the week, showing 99.9% of the screen. Okay, it can overwhelm a hundred percent, but I have to slide it. Apart from Hollywood, Bollywood also owns a large number of highly anticipated blocks, and some of the trailers shown are difficult to watch. Tashan was billed as expected at the highest level in 2008, but I was surprised when it was lower than in the movie theaters. <br /> <br /> <strong> When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a complete home, but not for Tasan. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I knew why. It was fun, but mostly weak. Simply, "Style" means, like the "English name", Tasan is a whole style, but it's a small substance. But it does not have the usual star power, but it has forced the scenes to be forced, and some Bollywood standards have to say with boundaries even a little ridiculous. Tashan's Dhoom and Dhoom 2, Vijay Krishna Acharya, both of which are quite striking, have made me very happy. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus has several streets to question the character motivation, but it's a little more It was late and only a minute ago, he tried to force many things to the final that you left behind. The Hong Kong telegram and Hollywood's horrific firearms and zero definitely entered a full blown action, imitating many Thai action films. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And everything you want to include into the kitchen sink, you have a means there is a kind of tool and a dowry that took a sediment was a jetski ship in the middle of nowhere. /> At best, Tashan can be used as an unwanted comedy, and this is about how much the molds are over with the symbols. Seyfi Ali Khan, Jimmy Cliff, a call center executor who teaches English, only plays a platform to hunt for a new girl-friendly outfit. His playboy paths go out when faced with Pooja Singh (Kareena Kapoor), who is not exactly visible, soft and sweet. Jimmy's boss, Billionaires Bhayaji (Anil Kapur). She can be very ridiculous, because she exposes the English language and how she says it is oh-beng. <br /> <br /> Bachechi Pandey, who deals with Jimmy and Pooja, when Bakhajani fled to the money stolen from Bahiyadi's work, performs the quartet quartet. <br /> <br /> Thus, a road begins to travel, comrades who lead to the enemy, and enemies you know, talk about road trips. Jimmy Cliff is probably the most intrusive of anyone who goes out of scratch to the hero, who is probably out of character, performing actions that will not embarrass Rambo. Kareena Kapoor uses the ampule of the sexual factor to make men cunning, and many bikini scenes and the opportunity to do so, considering other suits that are booming on the knee or neckline. Each character has a creator, and I thought Akshay Kumar was the best, most impressive, and most entertaining one, though his character seemed like an incredibly incredible Hulk with its heavy-weight opponent shots and power packing fists . Her wounds also cause sorrow on Wolverine. However, it should be noted that it is only a memorable single voice, just alpha-men, something that makes Bachchan-Pandey-Bachchan-Pandey happy. Looking for many Bollywood movies, despite a clear language gap, a melody or two sounds from the show. After the boat, I could not do that because, unfortunately, the songs were not just tempting. Usually the song / dance rhythms work well on the story line without the need to bring the characters out of the current scene or place. <br /> <br /> Tasan probably did not take himself seriously but came from Vijay. Krishna Acharya's story is probably not a ridiculous thing but a bit better, and your sustainability should be a bit more careful. It's bribed as a blockbuster, so now we can understand what the crowds are like this. While Akshay Kumr played the show, Tashan could have been all the better.
