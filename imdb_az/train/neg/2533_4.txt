I agree with most of Tomun's (bighouseaz@yahoo.com) majority of previous commentators. The Zatoichi series is a great character that combines a great sword fighting and excitement. <br /> <br /> Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe it has not been disclosed in 14 Regions (US). Zatoichi smuggling was heartbreaking. The storyline was complicated and many seemed to be a hodgepodge of the earlier Zatoichi story lines. Did not I see that the previous Zatochi movie was not rebuilt at one point? <br /> <br /> This film's fantasies (head-rolling, hands-legs, blood), Zatochi's character are less noble. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Previous films succeeded on story and event. The first Zatoichi film from this studio. All previous Zatoichi films are coming and I advise them.
