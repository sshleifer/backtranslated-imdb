This should be the most curvy, most wrapped celebratory film that I've ever seen and at least has said something. I know that Mexican people have a few ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs into traditional Christian theology. <br /> <br /> Loyal, greasy red is not an acceptable alcohol (see the white colored cheeks). sometimes!). On the contrary, he is a thin sociological pedophile living in paradise (or heaven), with a group of children who work more than Kathy Lee Gifford's sweat stores. While wearing a very unpleasant dress, she read the best music of the homeland, but a little African American boy "Mammy" played. This Santa is a devious Peeping Tom, listening to and listening to everything that's watching everything in the sky. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Klaus, there are no elves (what does the elves need if they have children?) and deer mechanical toy toys! <br /> <br /> This cloudy, strange show is floating on a cloud, possibly with a silver lining. <br /> <br /> The devil's nephew ... devil! What is our Santa Lord and our Savior? It's strange. Anhoo, Satan, sends one of his minions to an awesome, prancing demon, named Pitch, to try to shout Christmas. Here's what I'm trying to do - the cleanest bad guys are trying to destroy a completely commercial and greedy feast? <br /> <br /> Pitch is completely ineffective. Some children are trying to talk badly, but there is no chance. I hit my head with the story of the little girl, Lupine, who is very poor in the family. Everything she wants is not a puppet for Christmas, but parents can not buy one (they have spent all their home-made cardboard). Hence, Pitch is trying to encourage a puppet to steal. In fact, this is the only way for a girl to earn a poor puppet, because she must be holy and pray to God, and Santa does not actually work. But Lupe stops cheating and tells Pitch to go back and is rewarded with giving her a creepy puppet for knowing that Chuck's sister is. <br /> Pitch was hit on a tree where he was rescued by Santa Merlin (uh-huh)! Merlin? Do not deceive me! Do mythical druidic figures relate to Christmas tale or to Christianity? Will not Allah accept your magic? They burned Merlin several hundred years ago on the cross and did not want to come to the rescue of one of God's Questions (or I think Santa should go against Satan). Is this movie a long HUH? Starting from the start, and the egg that you drink will surprise you with no gravel or anything. Perhaps this movie is like a long giant DT.
