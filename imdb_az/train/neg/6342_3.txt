I chose the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you did not like it, go f & ^% to yourself!") In the box ... seemed like an alarm discount ... A little more than I expected is a Death Certificate. .. this is not a real issue of violence or about it. <br /> <br /> See the poster. That's all. Stunts and rock. Going forward. Seeing one of the few casinos in your striptease, the new Aussie stuntman in the city, where you see a level, a week in the life of the LA band, which is a magic show of a body ... They work, meet girls, and take part in the party. End of life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the group was clearly second-class and clearly needed all the things in a style written in 1978. Stunt bits in the movie Aussie friend is really something and the film is motivated by love and respect for "art". We hung there to find out what to do next. I just wish you had found a better vehicle.
