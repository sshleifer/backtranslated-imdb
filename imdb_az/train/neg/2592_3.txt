Stifler kidnapped his naked shaft and now is in the Beta House. Naked things happen, people run around naked, and nerds are entertaining, and this series is dead in the water. The Naked Mile was a crap film, but later it was a Better Band Camp. It turns out that they are returning to their jobs and they are not interested in them. You can tell where your target audience is and nail it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Star Wars has achieved a massive success, ahead of its audience, and has been greeted with it before. time special effects. The Lord of the Rings creates massive battles and mysterious creatures. Matrix has changed with action and science-fiction films, especially with advanced special effects. With all the advancement of technology, we look forward to the next big thing that's going on the ground. Later, the American Pie: Beta House comes. This pushes the boundaries that technology can do. When people create spaceships, landscapes and creatures using CGI, the Beta House uses this technology to create sperm. Yes, the thing that makes life, the things you've seen in pornographic films, have been created, and it's time to shoot us from a white room on a room. Is this funny? Is it disgusting? What is? The Beta House, which is striking considering the title of the previous installments, shows the nudity of Naked Mile. Need a movie? Of course, never before advancing this area, right? No laugh? Do not deceive young boys yet? Yes, women are beautiful, but if I think it's nonsense, then you're creating porn. <br /> <br /> The woman who loves the main character is beautiful. and did not bother the audience as we did in the series of previous girls, but at one time she did not believe that this character would do nothing. I believe that the characters in this movie are very realistic in every activity. The American Pie series has fallen into a fantasy world from a real world. None of the events in this movie will ever happen, and if they do not do so, they will offer it to the school. Does this film mean that people feel like they are having a good time? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> They say "Hunter says", but to make it "funny" for today's audience, they decided to replace the bullets of the horse straw.

For the first time, we met Stif's guest room, and she had sex with her girlfriend. Are you still delusional in joy? The film will first be about boys who want to go to the frat house, but then they are already transferred to those who are at home, but are forced to perform some tasks. Then it goes to a competition between nerds and boys. A little bit of us going to "Nerds of Revenge" and appearing from the ground. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The majority of comedians are forced to shock. At the beginning of my father showed his son that he had sexual intercourse. This joke is somewhere, in my opinion, your wife is not the last name on the list, or the son of her son's mate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> It does not seem to be focused, the story is sad and the array Naked humor, known for not shocking. Skip this reminder taxis and future ones. I do not know why they see all the entries in the array, but they seem to look at my eyes for an unknown reason.
