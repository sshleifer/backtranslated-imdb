This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any characters and the story was disappointing. It was a particular bedroom. In such a movie, you would expect action scenes to have its powerful points, but D-War surprises you in such a surprise. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the player was a step lower than the level of porn fraud in the low budget. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see the latest credits on this issue. Please do not waste time and money on what people do, a bad movie like D-War.
