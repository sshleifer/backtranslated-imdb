<br /> <br /> The attack of the Killer Tomatoes is the "parody" of the evil monster films that have ended worse than bad movies. (Very faultless) story tells tomatoes that rebel against those who abuse them. Basically, they spin and plant (yes, they are growl) and the next thing you know person is covered in ketchup. The actors are no longer movies, so they can not be named. There is a man in charge of the government to hire a tomato hazard and to stop it. He is accompanied by a black man who is a mask maker and a girl and a diving guy. In any case, there is another woman who spies on the first guy working for the government. If this is not important to you, you will understand. This film would never be so good, but it does not even make you laugh at these stupid scenes. Despite the fact that the film is from the whole point of view, it's really a fun (fun) movie that hurts. At one point, giant wax tomatoes "slide" on a wooden wheelless wooden board! Maybe if it were a pleasant camping cost, I would recommend the film, but it's also a bit of a terrible movie. 2/10
