This movie is a goddess. There is no quality in this movie. I thought it would be good, but it's good. The effects are even worse and worse, when you operate. This film is obviously drawn to the camera and is likely to cost about $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie watching the Dead or the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shot of the movie like Zombie movie, but watch the Redneck Zombies a better way. Please avoid this movie in any way. It's unwatchable and meaningless. You've been warned. I have something else to talk about this stupid movie.
