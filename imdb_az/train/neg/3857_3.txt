I hoped that this movie would be as fun as other genres. However, it was naked and I did not laugh much. Look at HBO, if you have a free rental or perhaps a waste of time, you need a movie to spend time. <br /> <strong> Jason Lee may be hilarious and he is here and there She takes a few laughs, but the film falls flat. Just do not see anything. The director is undeniable, but management is not important for that. In my opinion, its basic shortcomings are not funny. Look no further, do not waste your time here.
