John Scott (John Wayne) and his partner, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), are Rattlesnake Gulch's rodeo friends. Scott is a pretty fair contestant, but he will have to collect his winnings if he does not want a crooked inspector to take twenty-five cents a dollar in cash. Very likely, the bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decided that they wanted the rest of the rodeo; They have Charlie's killers to shoot Promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall) and make Scott and Kansas look like. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler have been filming the film so they want to go finger on various weaknesses. Every time Chandler gets a wild swing, Wayne stomps his leg and knocks it off. <br /> <br /> If you are very careful, Scott seems to have an interest in Anne (in several scenes there is Lipton tea advertised) Mary Kornman). <br /> <br /> Then, friends in the movie are reunited over the scene. A bad boy Jim wants to come and see the sheriff, but Pete shoots him. Jim tells his story about the doctor and his sister Anne when he's in the paddy. In an incredible scene, Anne goes to the middle of an armed war between good guys and those killed to face the sheriff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Desert Trail, the loyalist of John Wayne Wests of Lone Star, Mr. George's "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt are incredibly impressive. Whether you're a John Wayne fan, you should see it once, but that's probably enough.
