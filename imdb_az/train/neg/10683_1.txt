Some people are dismantling. Properly this other man shoots him. There are some guards and they are killer, but the reporter is interested. He went to the hospital and took the boy where they were staying. He walks away from a bodyguard of his corners but does not feel like talking. I can not understand why. Not everyone is interested. He is the only correspondent there. In any case, his editor refuses to work on this stupid story. But it is, at least. He is going to see the murderer's sister and mother. After a few minutes, he lost a great deal of time - someone was fighting each other - a big shot. Then he takes the body out of the hospital. They find him on the boat starving, but only in a minute they are submerged in a submarine tank because the three boys try to break them (and a big day of the boat exploded - a huge fireball). Correspondents and bodyguards blown out two boys trying to break them down. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, another person slides through the street and has a few stiff gunshots in the warehouse, a number of car accidents and deaths, direct suicide, and so on. stiffs, all kind of massacre. <br /> <br /> Great things, but what can the reporter and the bodyguard say: Why is the original guy thrown into hell? What is Motivation? Of course, it can help the journalist understand why he is not interested. It is almost the only correspondent on this story. The press does not care about anybody else. Even with all the great fireballs and dead bodies. True, the original man who did not spare was not a precursor. His job was a bit disappointing. He was the only president. Yes, living in the White House. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> So, what are the spoiler? <br /> <br /> There are some television cameras, other print journalists, bloggers ... <br /> <br /> Lemme thinks ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The Spoiler did it with his wife! Yes ... First lady. He was p-ed because he was crying around the President. And he goes away. Is it really sharp, huh? But how is paradise no one understands this? Why Does Someone Worry About It? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this action "1". I was just as dumb as I wanted to watch. And just dumber! These are the real spoilers! But even though I have told you to believe it, you must see it!
