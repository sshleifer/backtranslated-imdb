I recently saw in Palm Springs International Film in 2009. This is the debut of the artistic director of the veteran Dutch actress Monique Van de Ven and, according to my observation, should be his last. I hate incredible movies as much as you choose from practically every scene. This movie will scratch your head instantly. As a young photographer and a girlfriend working for an international aid organization, slowly slide through the Taliban driven mountains talking about Afghanistan's love when a truck stands in front of a rocket. Requiring the warriors to carry out all five of the vehicle that they have equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades. Whenever the Waldemar Torenstra was seen by rebels with a hand grenade boom that killed her daughter, she began to draw them all. Although it is more than 50 meters away because of its distance with the throw away, it moves farther. His girlfriend exploded and she pulled out the moment of the grenade that killed her and won an award for photography as a photographer of the year. Every scene and situation in this movie is opened as ridiculous. In the following year, Bob finds the assignment for National Geographic on the Dutch island resort, where he meets with Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and places himself in the rooted world of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give it from 10 to 4.
