Nick Cage, a giant treasure hunter from a long line of treasure hunters (oh, forgive me ... means treasurer's "guardian"). One of his ancestors was given a clue where a great treasure was found that if our fathers did not want all the Freemasons, they would only hide themselves for their independence. <br /> <br /> The first clue was a long lost ship, hiding in the Arctic. Gates and financier Ian (Sean Bean), Movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha from immortal "Gigli") and a few faceless lanes, include ship's load capacity. They are not, in any way, poured immediately on the floor all the barriers. Finally, they find the tip (going to a skeleton) and a pipe is written on it. Sorting. <br /> <br /> This is a fountain and its expedition is known even though it can not find the true treasure, although Gates is walking around yammering with the meaning of the puzzle, and in the frozen loading bureau, the crew just loose. So come. <br /> <br /> Some people had to be a little vocal, because they did not go all the way to the extraordinary Arctic, and thought they did not find anything interesting, but Gates came into his own world and stayed in the puzzle. <br /> <br /> The next tip will be in the Declaration of Independence. Ian decided to steal it. Gates thrilled. Different heroes give gratingly explicit exposure (to her kiss). All this leads to Ian's withdrawal from Gates with a pistol, and the blaze enters a huge explosion. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Text-align: justify; To stop them, Gates and Riley themselves have to steal themselves after Gate FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) attempt to stop them, so Riley explains Gates to know if he can not steal the Declaration, laser eyes and high-tech security.Gates said that she had the opportunity to steal Riley from the Protective Room.

(Also, I do not imagine computer monitors in movies - full of incredible and non-practical graphics and fonts). Abigail Chase ends with the tagging for convenience and a "lover's interest". <br /> <br /> Gates's father's abduction and a series of clues, in a number of cases, are all debated by a law-abiding grocery store, covering all plans with people. played by a dyspeptic John Voight, takes good guys and bad guys into the great Indiana Jones amusement home located beneath New York. Metro builders have never found this. Gates and Gates, the main heroine Ian, was involved in desertification. Ian believes that they were trapped in a cul-de-sac and left them there. But after leaving, Riley asks how to get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> oh boy ... <br /> <br /> He knocks a button and opens a door. No, I'm serious. One button, they can be vacu flush lavender in the office building. It's a good thing he knows. Anyway, remember that great treasure room (all underneath Manhattan) after being beaten, full of golden objects all around. Riley delivers a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean, and allows two chemists to marry less. <br /> All expositions, wacky and stereotypic characters for each viewer are too long. Some of his expositions cover beautiful history lessons that are included in the conversation at random moments. I would like more conversations in my life.
