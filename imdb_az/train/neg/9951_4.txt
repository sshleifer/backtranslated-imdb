Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of different types. Of course, do not lose squabbles. There is nothing better than dissemination of confusion, dark and bitter creatures. Thanks to their charm (ie sharp tongue and a wallet wallet), they deceive hopeless souls who suffer and suffer. <br /> <br /> I know better about this black comedy, as I understand. <br /> <br /> This is not a blend of black hero, I can subscribe easily, partly me, sleazy, the main character. However, the sound and melody of fast fever (and, of course, very virtuous) spoke. The strongest player of the cast, especially David Thelis, is very impressed; Jeremy's only character was very bi-dimensional. Photography and music both dramatically and impeccably work very well. <br /> <br /> Naked (which is really the main reason why I do not recommend anyone) really brings me out as a reliable way to break each other's statements. In other words, in such a bad world, what is the difference if it causes pain on girls? Johnny is totally absurd to me, suggesting that, as some guys like Jeremy are not as rude as they are (not on this site), so it's not that uncomfortable for a person. They are both terrible and bad guys. And in particular, they accuse women of giving a chance every time. Perhaps Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly goes straight back and is in the donkey. But her and Jeremy's sadistic behavior are still perceived as a matter of laugh. I can be wrong, but most of the people who love the film find it funny.
