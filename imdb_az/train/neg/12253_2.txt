In fact, I did not think that a movie would be very strange, but I was not mistaken. Terrible action, terrible plot, terrible effect. The Crocodile was terrible, and it was a bad move, as if it were all one of the stupid sex / killing scenes. It was really shocking, and this is a compliment! Someone can shoot this movie, watch it back, and then say yes "Well, that's a good movie, People can watch it" I can not beg if I did not :-(
