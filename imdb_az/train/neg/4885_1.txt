Listen. I was warned and still after reading all the reviews, I got money after saying that the original was "very bad" and the 2nd part still did not fit into this category and still could not resist it. What happened here? The first part was Hilarious, very politically wrong and the other Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and it could not have been a bad result on God's green space, Basket Case 2, Hell, and even Troll 2. This is really the worst continuation of history in fact, says the baseline of barrel qualities, looking at the bottom, saying something really. The second part of Murder Insane was a completely different bad brand. Video shooting, zero honey, zero fun worth, consists of 1/3 original flashbacks and all this crazy, fat Ethel lost part of her girth. I do not mean, honestly, this is some sort of sick joke! Thank you very much, Nick Millard. 1/1
