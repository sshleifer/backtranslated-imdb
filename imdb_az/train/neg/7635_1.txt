With Variety, I agree completely that the film's creative process can never seem funny, alive or inexplicable, and its purpose may seem like an unbeliever. Apparently scattered and lighting is really problematic. If it is necessary to characterize the film, poor lighting does not affect action, and sometimes it is difficult to keep track of the actors' facial expressions. Many non-south African films will have difficulty watching English and some local anecdotes will disappear. I watched the movie last year at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival. The comments and reactions to the film were a welcome departure from films about the outstanding and silent, painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the brightest lights of South Africa, but some wonderful movies about our apartheid history are really the best in our 110-year-old film history. Not surprisingly, two weeks after the release of the film in Cape Town, many cinemas disappeared from Durban and Gauteng cinemas. South African audience has clear limits.
