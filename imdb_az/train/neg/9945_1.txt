<br /> <br /> After watching about half of this movie, I distinguished one thing ... I found myself constantly watching TV channels just another thing - not exactly a good movie line. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have to be in a variety of genres, and every one of them misserably failed. 80% of the film opened to watch the old rerun. Bottom Line - The whole movie felt that they did not exactly know what to do and ended up in a mess with no modest taste.
