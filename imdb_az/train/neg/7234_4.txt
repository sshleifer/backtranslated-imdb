In a word: exciting. I was recommended to read some articles about the philosophical meanings of this film, but it would have been better to let the film last for 115 minutes and slowly flush under swirl symbolism and lava flow. After all, who is watching the film with hands-on program? And that flick was disappointing. The actor, Claude Layle, who started the film's opening, suffers from the same painful and hysterical mask as he does not distinguish between the film's eternal and terrible noise. On the other hand, one of the shootings of one of them could have worked better than giving a viewer and a double as the same thing: Ambricourt's priests are an unhappy man. The story of a persecuted priest who is trying to help a bourgeois rich family does nothing to make the characters distant or sympathetic, just as the family is an unpleasant stranger, and the priest itself is also a strange trick. The last 30 minutes tells us about a breath of grace and that one is equal to the others, but thanks to all the delusional convergence of Leiden and an uncertain subtext in Robert Bresson's script, let's give it an ice cream. Bresson fanatics Paul Schrader, who is interested in fans, has many elements and features in Schrader's comedies and films, especially in "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
