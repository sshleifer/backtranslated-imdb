The film is the second English film to adapt Sommerset Maugham's stories. A story from 'Quartet' does not travel well all this modern era; Since the actors were only British in the 1950s, the word of the actors was definitely "cut off". In any film, "Trio" is a tougher and fierce film than the first movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with overcoming these two films is that their source is written 25-30 years ago. Consequently, in the 1950s, Maughm (pre-war) was quite sweet, if it was a popular "little morality" story, obviously coy.
