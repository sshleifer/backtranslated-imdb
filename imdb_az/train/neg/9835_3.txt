The Desert Trail is worse than the western standards of the three stocks before explaining the Alias ​​comment. In fact, when you hear the highlight of Mexico, like Carmen Laroux, an unlucky girl, Juanita, you will immediately recognize the classic Stooge "Belle," as Senorita Rita. <br /> <br /> John Wayne plays Moe Howard in the "Desert Trail" and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like the Stooge partners, a 53-minute film shoots the illegal stick Moe Curve. Wayne's character, a heart-shaped skirt, is not very good, but it should have been a good man. The rodeo cowboy Wayne, on the way, keeps the rodeo box safely and saves the reward she earns when she gets a good income - the other racer is $ 25 cents (actually Wayne's cash register). There is no explanation for Wayne's removal from riders and heroes who still have her daughter. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's complicated in this matter. Because, F. Al Ferguson and his sidekickeri Larry Fine (played on Paul Fix's "Sheriff Mika" TV can play "The Rifleman"), Wayne Rob's cash register and then steal the remaining money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are charged. <br /> <br /> So, Moe and Curly moved to another town to get away from the law and change the names of the Smith and Jones. But his old friend, Larry, makes his sister half-hearted interest (Senorita Rita remains behind this old city and does not look much in the movie). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is played by a beautiful beautiful Mary Kornman (now growing, but in smaller days she was one of the original actors of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts). Kornman, Mega-lame qərbini izləmək və onun səhnələrini Moe və Curly ilə izləmək üçün əsas səbəbdir, filmdə onları tamamilə fərqli bir qrupdan istifadə etdikləri kimi istehsaldakı hər kəsdən daha yaxşıdır. <br /> <br /> In fact, in this case, the segments for the year 1935 is extremely weak and surprising film. The two main chase scene ends with shooting images from a horse-drawn horse. Both times, the editor reduces the shooting of one of the symbols rolling onto the floor, but there is no horse in the frame, the scene is completely different, and the character is different from the stunt driver. There is liberal use of photographs elsewhere, none of which is remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> Moe və Curly onların atları almaq və sol (sağ ekran üçün) bir kabin dən çıxmaq film sol sahilində doğru galloping olduğu bir film, bir səhnə izləmək üçün bir şey . The cameraman is watching two slowly a pan and then putting a whip in the left to reveal the upcoming posse. As can be seen outside the home of films never seen such a thing, because it seems stupid, but I never had a director do the scene. They dropped the two drivers and placed the film again, drawing the film as a separate move. Or, if their creativity will be up to the camera, so the camera is in the foreground and the background to the fore those who are approaching. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a kid.
