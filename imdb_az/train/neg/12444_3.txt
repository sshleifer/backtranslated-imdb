Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space suits. <br /> <br /> I love 50 science festivals and even love the philosophy of my 50s, but this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> What's the impression of the best "hip cats" of virtually unwatchable Abott & Costello as a few burglars. <br /> <br /> Chessecake usually can store cheesy sci fi, like "Women's Month of the Month", but can not be in this situation. <br /> <br /> Goran and Dolores said he could watch the spacecraft lasting about an hour.
