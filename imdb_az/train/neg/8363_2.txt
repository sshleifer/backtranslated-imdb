I think the film "Wild Wongo Women" is worse. This is a workout in patience. The teeth seem to be cleansed by the dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. No doubt, there is no activity (though the shark has a quality dialogue). We are not surprised about something. People did not know where they were. Sometimes such a thing will always be released to me. I agree with the previous writer that this is not even bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes away and will fill this space in your DVD collection. It looks like a paper drawer. Or a bad picture taken from the sale of a starving artist. Covering cracks in the wall.
