"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in Amazon, Peruvian, after a year in the woods ... naked, 45 years back." I suppose, "Keep Your Tea Right" is a modern fairy tale. In fact, everyone looking for some ideas about yamyamcılık will not be sad. The first half of the film resembles New Ginuea's travel card, which touches more local art. The second half is based on photographs of the Peruvian Yamyam tribe, but it really is about this. Of course, you are interested in introducing the home movies of a Jewish marriage or Schneerbaum's old lover. I'm sorry. A great disappointment and really a "modern lively tale". - MERK
