<br /> <br /> Hollywood is an outstanding example of the writer Dudley Nichols (and may still be able) to take Hollywood's literary artistic masterpiece admirable. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Guthrie can develop on a classic pioneer novel by the EU. <br /> <br /> Boone Caudill, an epic character and main character of Guthrie's book, was replaced by a downscaled riverboat fare, which is less similar to the author's intent, including a naive, ridiculous / mountainlike man of Kentucky boy. <br /> <br /> <strong> Interesting and even confusing elements of Gounrie's new effects and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. The most important of all is the character of Zeb Calloway, a casual, small character in the book and only a few pages occupied. On the other hand, Dick Summers, a very important and interesting character, a strange pioneer, is absolutely missing! It is clear that director Hawks decided to characterize Zebin's character, but actor Hunnicutt did not get enough annoyance. <br /> <br /> Thus, Zeb / Hunnicutt is a shortened part of Hollywood for sounding, editing, and directing this inadequate screen. <br /> <br /> Some movies are really an excellent example of William Wyler's Ben-Hur. <br /> <br /> This is not just a story adaptation, but a movie for himself as well. </ P> <p> The story is elegant and gentle, the font is just the surface and dull shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And, unfortunately, Kirk Douglas's star challenge, which could help raise the movie, was lost in the role of the miltost role he was given. <br /> <br /> If you believe, the version of the Guthrie Pulitzer award-winning movie <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Great Sky is getting stronger, and Howard Hawks is one of the most bizarre, striking directors.
