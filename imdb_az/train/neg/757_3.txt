My kids watch the show every day. It is a great program for young children. But they have to stop repeating the show and show some more realistic shows and get rid of Rooney and Deedee's SARI TEETH. Do Moe clean white pearl teeth with only Doodle bop and children do not notice these things and 2 Do not brush your teeth? Will the show not let the United States go and where can we find the timeline? If we can add anything else. Moe need to stop too hiding. Sometimes, when the small children are scared by the time and the rope? What does it mean? others are always moist. You need to add something new to your own show instead of the same ole. Children are not interested in such a thing.
