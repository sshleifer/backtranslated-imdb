The great moon-flying star on Earth ends up in a small town with a problem for drug dealers and dead body of a federal agent. <br /> <br /> Re-join to clean up the city with the former cosmic stars. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> For the small, mainly disrespectful, comedy "action" does not work. Part of the problem is cast as Chris Clone as an old acting hero. He is not really bad, but as someone who is regarded as a difficult man. He said that he was not bad, but only about his back part. The real problem here is not really funny, and it is sometimes a combination of the artificial visible and pedestrian-oriented port. There is no life in the construction of everything. As her director has a list of shots and goes with a list. This is for the non-attractive movie. The film is still spreading to life, for example, the film ends in the last show. <br /> <br /> The previous parts of the film saved most of her power. <br /> <br /> I really can not offer the movie. When you are an actor fan or you are a great admirer of independent film art in all forms, it is worth a hit, but this is just a disappointment.
