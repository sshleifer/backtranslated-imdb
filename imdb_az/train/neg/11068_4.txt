Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer is a mixed movie. Of course, while watching the movie, I had a couple of beers, but I do not explain why I'm so bored with this whistle. <br /> <br /> His bewilderment is nothing but confused and annoying, a start, and ultimately, something meaningful in the movie, a text that describes the beginning and end of the film. Inbetween products in the movie, simply dull pictures and time loss. <br /> <br /> We will never see real crimes, everything is just a few insinuations. Sometimes genius Dahmer is dreaming of all things, but he does not know that <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story and at least it's the most important thing. But what happened? <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to spend time in this movie. I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like it a bit, <br /> <br /> * / *****
