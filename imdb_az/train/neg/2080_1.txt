It's easy to see how the following screenplay comes up at early-sale meetings with Regency Films (and later Fox): Jump through the genre of superhero with the "Fatal Attack" comedy ... voil√†! I do not know how much a gifted director like Ivan Reitman is on the spot. Incomplete worker at architectural design firm N.Y.C. he meets a girl on the subway and asks him; Despite being numerous and unpleasant, she finally took her to bed - to learn that she was the only super-hero of the Big Apple family, G-Girl. This distinctive Superman is not a fantasy hero, with powers granted to him by a fallen meteorite, but ... screenwriter Don Payne accepts him as a needy, miraculous, vindictive fast. Uma Thurman still plays a role for cunning laughs). This is a worthless movie that can allow an insult slip. Our acquaintance with Luke Wilson, the lead guy who talks to Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a gaseous welding gas (these two friends come to us to rely on men in serious women). When G-Girl approached Nemesis, Wilson, who wished to take over her authority, said she would deceive an ordinary woman ... and after that, would not it be good? Thurman's first demonstrations in films such as Henry & June and Jennifer 8 were an opening grace and a hypnotic woman; Her films with Quentin Tarantino helped her break her hardness and intensity, but this was a price (the actress lost her outward touch). The picture is very well prepared and shot with a very special look, but no one has been bothered to find humor in this scenario. Frustration, ugly and bad cast. Bloated, frozen facial Wilson could not tell any of his staffers he had met with G-Girl, because he was pushing his chain rectum. Did the writer payne really think it was funny ... or did anyone really get together? * from ****
