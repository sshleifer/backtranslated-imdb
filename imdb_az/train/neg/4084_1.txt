Now you hear radio DJs inviting everyone to listen to the listener or never watch a movie. <br /> <br /> One day is the movie I thought. <br /> <br /> There is something with a game by Shakespeare. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> But I'm not sure if I've been giving this movie for about 20 minutes ... I think barefoot people will not cut themselves and look at me to betray me <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I have ever given to me for the first time I was given such a low score (in fact I was trying to watch) However, the British director Peter Greenaway wants to avoid other films. I remember his "Chef, thief, spouse and lover" actually thought he was a great British movie, though his content was sometimes stingy - a bright film, but why people would twist it. <br /> <br /> Another good film by Greenaway was "Zed and Two Noughts". <br /> <br /> Probably, there was a good content that was fraught with taste, but still interesting. <br /> <br /> I often think too late for such a radio show, the other movie "Brazil". It was impossible to watch so much of the way down to the unhealthy dream! <br /> <br /> If it is not difficult to have a high-styling, hard work, and challenging for self-important films, it is clear from Prosero's books.
