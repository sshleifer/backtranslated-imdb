After finishing my book, I immediately saw this movie and perhaps it was either neutral or too stupid. I think it was the last one. First, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I've seen is the day-to-day life, conversations, cafeteria, and so on in Winston's work. It was. He is free to appear unkind and thoughtful to people who are not greatly scared. One of the most important parts of the book was that it was impossible to safely display even some of the real emotions at even in small activities at any time. It is also shown on the streets of the proletarians. Winston, in this book, knew that it was a great risk to go around it and was afraid and scared every time. In the film, it often causes you to lose weight without having to worry about a serious control and risk. <br /> <br /> Winston, the other small minority that hides the agenda on the wall, is a very small change, but this is a question, what's the point? <br /> <br /> Along with this, there was one of the most boring things that the director had to do with a book. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the biggest misconceptions were even worse. First of all, one of the important parts of the book is that the Brother is a clever, yet powerful philosophic government. In the film, they skip the government thinking that Hitler was driving technology. In a real sense, when you are faced with it, but if you leave this older brother, you really miss the book. Something terrible about Big Brother, in some ways, has some points behind his philosophy. When O'Brien receives Winstons in the Ministry of Love, Winston listens to everything. He listens and moves in his philosophy, in fact, is something creepy and interesting. In the end, when Winston tells you he loves Big Brother (prudent SPOILER ahead), this is a terrible thing, not sure of the reason for the beating and the real power behind torture or philosophy. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the Philosophy of the Brother has the points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth are extremely troubling to this book. <br /> <br /> Also, with Winston in Julia's movie? <br /> <br /> Where was Horison before the title to Winston? One of the things bearing the book was Winstons' thoughts about O'Nbrien before contacting him. <br /> <br /> However, it is not clear why this film is about a very frightening adaptation: it is impossible not to drop weapons and morphs at least two hours. Under two hours, could anyone imagine how to watch this movie? At least the film requires 3 hours to capture some important mood and relationships. <br /> <br /> If you love your book, and if you really love it, you will not approve of this movie and you have the chance that you already know it. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that this book is inaccurate, and that this film is something worthy of a little roll of the film. <br /> <br /> Two stars from him
