This movie has some of the great adult stars, but a movie for adults does not care about it. You will not start with any of the stars in any of the scenes. The film is imagined as an average age kit and is filmed as a embarrassing cat. Acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are as interesting as listening to a neighborhood talk about your college kids, and the dialogue is worse than in a movie. The area was also ten times worse. I continued on the amateur road. The audio commentary was unusable because it was a skin whistle, but even that was bad. If you are a diehard Jenna Jameson fan you are not here. 4/10
