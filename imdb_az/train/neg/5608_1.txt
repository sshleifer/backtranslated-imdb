I'm curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be thrilled. I also have faith. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to every thought and thought. It does not matter if Jesus existed in the Scriptures. Maria, a virgin, or all other pagan chaos. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​salvation, which is important to me, is the idea of ​​love as the only way to peace in this world. <br /> <br /> It's a fact that's fraught with an accident, without the context itself. For example, in this film, they showed a great deal of punishment: "My enemies, who do not want to be my king, bring them here and kill me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) is the context you are recommending. Jesus explained a story about a wicked king. There is no connection to the Bible that supports Jesus' death. He is love! When we make a mistake, we shout at people (hatred-Christians) of hatred. Most viewers are checking the information they provide, so they start to think of Jesus' hatred, not for me or for anyone else. These are people who are purely manipulating. Please use your brain. Do not view everything as being said to you in this movie. If we start to disassociate Jesus in this way and start the message we are bringing down, we destroy our own foundation, civilization. You saw the branch you were sitting in.
