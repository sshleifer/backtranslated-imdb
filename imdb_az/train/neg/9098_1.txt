Some movies have a reason to shoot videos, and, of course, the obvious reason is that if there is a lot of mischief for a theater audience, then it's a straight video. Of course, the movies are good and they're still going straight to the videos. Amy Adams (American Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne deserves a good or at least a good agent, and Sarah Thompson, the film's best actors or at least potentially actors, is no exception. Walking from young melodramas. The movie is also a mistake: this movie takes place prematurely, so this movie is actually a prequel and very stupid. It was a waste and was actually a movie with the same level as the soft porn and paid masturbation movies. Fortunately, for actors, I hope that they will be removed from their picture. So you're thinking of seeing something nasty, but if you do not have the courage to buy porn, you can rent this movie as a start.
