Film: There are many interesting comments about IMDb about this movie. Its really terrible. The film does not seem to cost enough money and Spike Lee's spending, an indie movie and action flick. Characters / Actors: Denzel did "absolutely" what he did in every film, so no wonder. A little mind game for readers. Imagine the 10 Denzel movies soon. Now, we see how many people are counted as any police / detective / body fraud. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy will soon need a better role on his plate. I thought of her best performance as Beyond Borders. Moreover, he did the same thing as in every film. His voice and way of speaking were very similar to what he did at Sin City. Certainly, this guy knows the actor, and it's a better way of choosing the roles they do not know. He needs a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the film if you were watching her for the first time in your life. He did better things. Better role. In Hollywood, the biggest stars fall on their knees and Jody Foster can get low-class roles as in this film. Soil: Not a disadvantage, in fact, a whole film could think of such a structure when spilling a fine Chinese dinner. So let's say, **** SPOILER ONLY ----> I'm sick of unnecessary Haulocast and racism. The film is about bank gangsters, why did Haulocast and everyone try to put racism here and try to play with emotions? I HAVE NO. Do the police think that bank robbers are mortgaged? Riiiiiiiiiii, here we talk about the strength and security of US police. No one was able to find Clive's whereabouts, so he did not find anything different with that room. Who are we? Conclusion: Of course, watch this movie, and if there is nothing, it would be a great time to talk to your bad friends about the movie. At least people will not think that you are foolish to watch this movie, because they carry a great star "MISTEK" because I thought you were going to watch it.
