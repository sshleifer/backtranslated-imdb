She likes the movie about a lover, Vixen (Erica Gavin) ... but she likes it too! During the film, go to bed with many men, including her husband and her brother! <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was the first X movie to be criticized for the first time (I believe). It turned out to be a great hit. Unfortunately, it's not good. <br /> <br /> This is well directed and Erica Gavin (whatever it is) is only big and very colorful ... but by today's standards it is very modest. I was amazed that now has a NC-17 rating - there are no hardcore sexes and only topless women and no men have nudity. And (simply) quite boring and finally the addition of politics was mixed (and quite foolish). Despite the fact that he was shocked in 1968, he was worthy of the buyer. As well, I saw a cut version with R rating, but I've heard a few seconds here and I'm missing it. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next movie, "Beyond the Dolls Valley," is much better, and her history is very good. Keep it up.
