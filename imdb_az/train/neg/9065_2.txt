After half a century, I realized that I was not interested in at least a few of these characters; But they watched a little more. Unfortunately, the next day I came back and finished. <br /> <br /> If you know anything about the movie in advance, you know that the lead character will get an air crash, and the headline gives you a good idea. It will happen later - he will pick up the phone and call people about it! <br /> <br /> This is an old film and I think that the style of the player is less naturally compared to today. But according to these standards, the player was also embarrassing. These were stereotypes, not faces. I think this movie is more than just an attempt to help Bette Davis's wife Gary Merrill. There is no benefit - I have seen more real emotions than oak trees. <br /> <br /> Davis plays a happy cripple (that is, a non-attractive role), careful and thick career moves. It was not. It was just boring. Tiny Tim was a kind of film, and saw the love of Trask (Merrill's character) and the truth of forgiveness (though less flawless than Tim Hansen), sincerely speaking about his life and relationships, his only-begotten husband died. <br /> <br /> The last scene in which Trask called Ayova for communication with his wife was very impressed on both sides of the telephone line and I was very involved, and I immediately got involved. <br /> <br /> As I have seen in this film, I had to remind them that they really made money. <br /> <br /> I've been very pleased with this movie long ago. If you've encouraged it, that's great. But frankly, I just saw bad. Older movies are more well-written and moving than the Golden Age of Hollywood.
