Jeez, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this interesting hybrid, developed around a treasure trove of a spaghetti western and kung fu flickin. Amongst the Show Brothers and the Italian side, this coarse production includes spices, jokes, horrific events and many respected T & A. Additional campaign moments are Lee Van Cleef's psychic-armed Yancey Hobbitt (Julian Ugarte, a legendary wig, leather-covered bible), made by a man who should produce more unusual European genres. <br /> <br /> This little the workpiece enters the territory of Turkey and goes to the square, but accompanied by noisy dialogue, cheerful background music and totally funny sound effects on various minor events (especially every leap from Lo Lieh). , Van Cleef, and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the duality of this pair. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
