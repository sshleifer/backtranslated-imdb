Okay, my girlfriend and I hired a DVD and agreed with the idea that when we stayed in the movie for about 30 minutes, "ehhh, what's this movie and, more importantly, I want to know what's going on." or we needed a drug to deal with "plot" or to end pain there and watch something else. <br /> <br /> I really liked it, but I liked the "Cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is so awful for me and surreal, awesome! I prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> - Soria
