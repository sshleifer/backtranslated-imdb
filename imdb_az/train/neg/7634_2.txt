The film is a film showing the shortage of French cinema during the movie. The director's "silent America" ​​claims that you will not be deceived in a minute, since "Peeping Tom" since a serial killer film has not appeared. <br /> <br /> Two police officers (or more than half a dozen), terrible crimes, a complex plan than a complex. Charles Berling is not lucky in the genre (an incredibly honest "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). Stage scenes with pregnant spouse, the rest of the scenes that should be shared for any other atmosphere - the worst of them is a storm of love scenes and a strange autopsy to win PG 12 and thus attracting a big adult audience. A sinister and absurd result, and then a silent epilogue that can make a great deal of trading for côte d'azur is actually silence of nudity.
