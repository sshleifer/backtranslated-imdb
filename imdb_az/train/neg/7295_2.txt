First of all, the reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least Peter Falk's usual fantastic performance, like Lieutenant Columbo. <br /> <br /> When I read a poster by Andrew Stevens in this movie, I was all sad at first. Career. "It was a terrific performance by Stevens, who completely destroyed this movie, so I was prepared to be exposed to all kinds of insults in the person who gave me the above-mentioned explanation." Then I thought, what did Stevens do? I was checking and you know, that person is completely justified <br /> <br /> After 17 years of filming this Colombo, Stevens has been out of the 33 projects since then, so everyone is skeptical of not seeing the rest of his career. <br /> If you love Columbo, look at one of the 69 names, give yourself a favor and save the worst of the latter.
