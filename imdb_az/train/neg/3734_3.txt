Definitely a mixed confusion. The most things in the film appear to be 1987 or less, but then the futuristic things thrown out, like the gun of the police. And this car! The director was in love with the color lights. Only a very important performance was the girl playing Valerie, but because there is no list, I do not know which actress. This is a missing value. Level: F.
