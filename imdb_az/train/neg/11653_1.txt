The first was different and funny. This should never leave the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. This is a weak attempt for forced humor. The film chooses to rip-off the current and old movies. This time you use jokes and appear in the shade. I saw that the audience just moved again on Hannibal's dining scene and lay down somewhere else.
