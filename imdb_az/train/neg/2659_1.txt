We're sorry, but that's just scary. I told people about this movie and some bad movements and they almost did not believe me. There is nothing wrong with this idea, a modern day, Japanese soldiers are retreating to the days of Busido fighters and modern weapons are almost a match for everything. When the troops first realize that something is strange, does anyone in the back of the car need to say, "Hey, my watch is stopped"? Imagine such lines that they repeat 15+ times before saying something else, and the film is not jealous.
