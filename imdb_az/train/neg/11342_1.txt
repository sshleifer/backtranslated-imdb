I have to explain why this is for ... The "piece of art" is probably a 1-star 1-star rating. It is simply impossible to calculate it difficult or unbiased. <br /> <br /> I do not like HOSTEL or any such trivial films like this - it's disgusting and beautiful, and I think it would be the same if I gave it at 10/10. terrible (in all possible contexts), but as I have seen after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" and probably most of it would be like 10/10 and Tarantino would be happier (and Kill Bill to make more shedding to show that he had left too much blood. but what is in the genre of "historical drama" is a sub-category of "garbage films" that John Romero's unconscious-emperor-emperor can not be regarded as default. Film is a contradictory film and a really bad moment you will not be able to say that it should be as long as it is or it's just bad. for those who want to have a bad move, bad scene, and everything else. And with some sort of faith, I am one of them. I want to see a really bad movie in my days and look at a trash and have days gone by - it's getting rid of! <br /> <br /> Just a few days ago, Fellini's Casanova film is focused on my advice and does not appreciate it by default.
