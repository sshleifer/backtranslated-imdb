The film "The National Lamp Films" is the worst movie ever, because it's a foolish "Prepare 9 Outside Space". At least, this movie was simply foolish; On the other hand, the Lampoon movie is both mean and mean. Once upon a time, the movies respected the audience's intelligence. <br /> <br /> One reviewer on this site wrote that one of the best parts of the film is that it carries a rotten carcass to our faces and then tries to hunt our noses. naked scenes; and I agree that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry burn a little flesh and are very beautiful.

Nominally, this is a comedy. But where is the humor?
