I saw the Dolemite and Avenging Disco Godfather, our friend Rudy Ray Moore's two beautiful works of the blaxploitation canon. But this movie, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always take a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> For the lack of skills in film production and absolute enthusiasm (a little too much), the Human Tornado will not be opened. <br /> <br /> The opening scene gives you tone. Our old clothes are evacuated by Dolemite, a white woman, and some racist local police raided the house without good reason and you do not know! The woman in the bedroom is the wife of 'Dole' sheriff. When she saw her, she wept: "She did it to me!" Dolemite's Decree: "& $ * $ $ for real?" <br /> <br /> His wife, many young Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters Fame), has been a member of the community, changing the colors of a Dolemite's costume in every shot that moves his nightclub to characters, continuity mistakes (one character is looking for a way out of a shot) Queen Bee's Devil <br /> <br /> Here's Rudy Ray Moore. Did he really think he was cool in this movie? Certainly, I did not know why, but you should admire her respect. Whether it's just a hell of a cliff or a bunch of unbelievers (for example, Speed! In my cave, my mother has $ * @ (% has a plan to get her own grave) Of course, she puts the kung fu over the ship at any time, plus but also Rudy creates slowly to illuminate his teeth. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Nature" shooting is a very inadequate film, but at least it is very entertaining and, of course, these people need to make an effort.
