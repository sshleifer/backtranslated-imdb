This film is really just a religion commentary by Bill Maher. There are some funny moments and some exciting moments, but do not wait for a single discussion of religion. <br /> <br /> I think this is the worst kind of documentary film ever. Everything is pre-arranged and is intended to give the editor's opinion in the editorial office. <br /> <br /> Promotes - It's blended with clips of many pop culture and media. The interviewer has the opportunity to give a sentence before interrupting the editorial. Only those who do not want to know give a fair chance to talk about their minds. <br /> <br /> Interviews - They are definitely going to represent the most extremist religion. From the TV's Jewish stereotype to the TRUCK STOP chapel (Serious TRUCK STOP CHAPEL) to the TV. He did not demand the selection of the worst pseudo-journalists, heavy extremists and non-budgeters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; especially Muslims who are heavy hit, during the Muslim segment, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ALL MUSLIMS are described as armed extremist extremists through editing, and none of the people being asked are justified. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the end of the story, the message is heavy, and it is interesting that the idea of ​​a non-religious extremist is not fair, and Bill Maher describes himself as being the target of destruction, which means that religion is foolish and dangerous and destroys the world. /> There are some good points with the mistakes of the film, and humor, though very unfair, is not really ridiculous, but I know it's going to be very unilateral. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments, but with extremely irresponsible documentary style, are heavy.
