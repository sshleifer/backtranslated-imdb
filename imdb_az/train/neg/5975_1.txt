I never wanted to watch this movie, and one day later I watched it for a joke to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I would like to ask a question about the film's policy. Behind the masks of women is hidden "to be great in the city", but the only way women can do a great deal is to use their sexuality rather than their intelligence and skills. These women are more prostitutes. A bit less attractive girls do not let them succeed? The film is not the only right wing message, it has hundreds of American flags and great cash. The only powerful thing in America is not a movie about capitalism and a good example of moral, ethical or artistic value. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is the neck of its neck and then its staff and its customers. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows something about experts will know that this drink can be as dangerous as heroin and that it is more dangerous than many illicit drugs. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sex of a prestigious character Is the father always interested in interest to the audience (when he or she is lying or lovering)? We explain to his father that if he had a phone, he would be transferred to the camera. He throws his father as he puts his 'lover' on the auction. I feel it most strange. <br /> <br /> As a result, this film is immoral, fascist, betrayer, and sincere. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
