Omen had 4 ideas on the surface. It is a pleasure to see that the devil's child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, like Exorcist, it is very effective if you have girls or devils. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Maybe a therapist, then a priest help issues that can be solved. He is not afraid or Satan. <br /> <br /> This film had the potential and if it were prepared by the same people who worked on the previous three films, it could have been the case. <br /> <br /> It is a film specially designed for many television films. It's typical of a TV drama, looking for cheap looking players, and effects. Heroes do not bring any sympathy and you do not route them. <br /> <br /> Firstly, after bringing me for Christmas, I was watching him again and giving it a terrible date. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind watching it, then I will not advise you. Follow one of the others or watch Exorcist or watch the Good Son. Just do not waste time on this drive!
