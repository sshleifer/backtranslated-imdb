Love with boy-girl lover / songs, just this time punk and she's a plain ax. Film-buffs there really like this movie? Are there fans? I say that the mind blows ... The Oil 2 does not have the courage, the moxy or the transparent goat to take the fate of the predecessor (like Jaws 2 or Jaws 2, Exorcist II), no slow- slowly moves and often plays alone.With a sense of appearance and inexpensiveness, it leads to a great loss between dirty and unhealthy treatments.This is the first time a considerable audience takes Michelle Pfeiffer's attention and does not embarrass himself, but plays a worthwhile role. NO STARS at ***** at low level
