<br /> <br /> Therefore, no unnamed characters will develop. <br /> <br /> There is no beginning in the end, there is no middle ground. <br /> <br /> Even because it's not beautiful, there are beautiful pictures because they are not even allowed because this is not even the case. There is no "no" in this movie because there are no plot or characters, subject or ideas or symbolism, discussion, or information or points. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: there is a good soundtrack. But it's just the right thing to do, and the movie is right, so watching it is not worth your time, so if you're really interested, I'll go and recommend noise. <br /> <br /> You will get everything from this movie without fatigue, headache, and impatience. <br /> <br /> PololarisDiB
