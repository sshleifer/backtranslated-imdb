Perhaps something is missing because I read more positive things about a person who deceived himself because I read something bad. In my opinion, I like to talk about Humphrey Bogart in Big Sleep and Gen Tierney in Laura, and I want to create some style with them in moving characters. None of the characters in this movie have the style or the presence or the desire to call it. Take the lead actor Lee J. Cobb. Its steep, rectangular view looks like noisy, smooth conversation, noir archetype. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst of the worst cases I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Many political parties have commented on this issue. I would predict the outcome of a person who deceived himself in about five minutes. And the last cat-mouse track scene is plain old darts. The decade-long fifteen-minute movie that's gone is actually going to any pacing movie.
