Without going into any kind of cinematography and documentary filming, I can say that I am frustrated to be disturbed to sit with the full length of the "20 Dates". I will not spend your time with the plot, but you can read other reviews. Berkowitz's hyper, the Woody Allen style is very impressive. You either wanted to get off the coffee or ask for some tranquilizers. And Berkowitz himself is also aware that this movie is a bad idea, because some of it reflects judicial proceedings to finance a documentary. Forgive me insulting insults, but I'll give Berkowitz a loan, because try to convince you to make a mistake to fund this horrible piece of ****. I appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film, but it's about Berkowitz standards, but she misses it and misss it at all levels. Finally, I'm convinced that most of these female comrades do not have a film that wants to capture a magical movie, and that's why I welcome the originality of the film. Hey Myles liked watching the movie for the first time ... it was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith when it appeared to be Seinfeld episode.
