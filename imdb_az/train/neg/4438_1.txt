If I paid this movie from the library, I would be unpleasant. <br /> <br /> <strong> Mira Sorvino is very bad in the movie, it's very painful to watch the scene. She is a very beautiful girl, but she does not happen in this movie, but I have to bear witness to her wrong attempts to fool almost all other key characters. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
