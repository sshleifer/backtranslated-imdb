Ursula Andress' naked body is one of the things that believe in God. The other two women (especially the servant) have large bodies. Why is a high class that I can give to a movie with a quality and quantity of 3 out of 10 levels? In order to reach Ursula's incredible body, we should not have to sit with another movie (consider the full 101-minute version and perhaps beyond the 78-minute American show). In the typical Italian-comedy tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated cartoons (army strange, "latin beloved", constantly drunk, loyal servant). Last word: watch it, but keep your finger in the quick progress button, you'll need it. (*)
