I think only the other reviewers of this movie are shareholders of the production company, because it was the worst movie I've ever seen in the last five years. No clear cause of the opening of the Lord's laughs laughing, it was understood that actors performing in this film would be regarded as B-Level. Before starting this film, my husband and I were in a great mood, and we really look forward to a comic popcorn movie. We knew that we did not rent Citizen Kane and we did not expect to see the most beautiful film ever. But after a 40-minute period, we have to replace our worries for a minute after the most miserable unfounded debris we have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" is a terrifying, delicate plot and boring symbol for you, without any laugh, but this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least at the popcorn genre scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing these pictures for a long time because I'm trying to find a joke now.
