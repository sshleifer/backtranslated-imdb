I recently watched the Belle Epoque, thinking it could be as good as the Oscars for the Best Foreign Language Film. I was a little scared by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps it was a conflict that has since been filmed for many beautiful women, and as a result, a good man has ever been seen. In addition to predicting the site, some of the scenes in the film were really out of the way with the story (for example, a certain event at a wedding). Sometimes the film's ideas were slightly promoted, and the Franco-era movie and the Church were put on hold. The only purpose of the film for this was the magnificent moments, d√©cor and character of Violet that women were a strong, independent woman in the times when women were not really related to these qualities.
