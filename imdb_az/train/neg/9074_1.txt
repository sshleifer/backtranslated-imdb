A new venture in teenage-general-comedy that has decided to blackmail a teenage girl in a cool college-oriented college campaigning and capable of having a young girl. All this has been done before and all this has been done with great pleasure. This miracle that creates a jumble of "American Pie" and "Dude", "My Car Where" is a wonder that this popularity is completely covered, so it may seem that the viewer can only frown and deny it. The film was written in a bad way and the actors could not achieve even the slightest resistance. I will not respect the horrors of this terrible picture, because it is my time and your wealth. At best, Slackers will never be able to entertain or laugh, and the worst is too bad and sometimes completely inevitable. Jason Schwarzman, affected at the start of Rushmore, looks like this in a way that humbles himself and explains how fast a career will go to the toilet. Please run, please. Protect your money.
