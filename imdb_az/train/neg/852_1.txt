I'm going to catch that short. This "compatibility" of the beautiful King's book is a bad joke and nothing else. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site, and ultimately this film is a mysterious way to top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is also funny as Torrance, while Shelly Duvall. A story that has nothing to do with the book, an incompatible confusion, and Jack and Wendy Torrance <br /> <br /> For anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the story symbols, stay true to the TV series. <br /> <br /> Oh, the people who say that Kubrick has the right to destroy the King's story is ... The good writer does not only have to look at the "transparency" as "closing his eyes wide".
