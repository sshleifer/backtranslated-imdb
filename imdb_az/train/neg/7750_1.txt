This movie was the worst movie in the world, and I love BENNEY more than this movie. Graphic, half of the movie is revived, deaths occur and I'm all ready for people who shoot this movie! WRITE THIS FILM WOULD LIKE YOUR LIFE. Only a good part was when the movie was over! This movie features 50% Jurassic Park, 1% Sabretooth and 49.9% DUMB! Please do not spend time watching this movie and you will regret it. Want to know why this movie is up and running? Yes, it was the cover, the graphs were filtered, the blood looked (I would say), ketchup, people tried to pull themselves into the air, college students are thinking of all this and can resist the animal. I mean, there was a 5-meter tiger running a flat woman, throwing a spear 100 meters away! WRITTEN TO THE TERROR The player was also terrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and it was to go and destroy.
