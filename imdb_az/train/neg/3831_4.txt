I have to agree with Maltin's earlier comment and this. This is the second rank, the obscenities and dams that want to be put on the central theme of the East West, stand against the extreme West and go on a steady course. It would be like Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, but the movie was not a bad one. Andrew McLaglen's direction is sharp and has a real botch with the last 30 minutes or some incomprehensible strategy by heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone tell me why this slope is thrown into the fire. Give me a scar.) There was something elegant about the treatment of aggression, and the woman's reaction did not suit the truth afterwards. Coburn was sentenced to retribution from half anecdote, but all fellow escapees are less sophisticated (they're not like bowling pins to drown each other as the story progresses). Michael Parks usually gives the driver's lethargic, spectacular performances, but in this case, the modern style symbolizes the pride of the sheriff's technological advancement.
