Surprisingly, the film has some paying quality while moving toward the end of the movie. On the other hand, this movie is a really bad and naked thing, a small budget, a poorly written script and everything with it. <br /> <br /> This is the Christian circle of all money, not enough money to make a decent film. I'm not religious, so we can not care less, but filmmaking is a good tool for some churches to reach a new audience and interested people and read the Bible's Bible study. From this point of view, these films always seem to be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Low budget really damages the movie and dropped it down. <br /> <br /> It laughs to watch the movie's effect, and only gives the B-movie like a common movie feeling. <br /> <br /> But this is the most damaging piece of the film. The only thing that happens in this movie is that it only insults intelligence and then I'm not complaining about the religious aspects of the whole story. The movie is incredibly incredible, and people inside this film are making it so difficult to insult viewers. <br /> <br /> I hated the film as it was in the soap opera. It seems to me that they just had to make a full length movie, and they just stuffed things to add some things and dramatic developments. <br /> <br /> While the film's story focuses more on its essence, the film says it will be more stringent and durable. It is still predictable, but it does prevent a full-fledged accident to watch this movie and it's a bad situation for you to watch out for it, but I do not believe it can not win over any of these films. <br /> <br /> 4 / 10
