Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice is dubbed for 50% of the movie ... Why? As it seems, they have to rewrite the script and story as they are fighting, and have more than one version to change their dialogue to storytelling. <br /> <br /> So, the story has still been asked and has no sense in any sense. <br /> <br /> The last time I scratched my head was the reason why the film was meaningless and did not even mean the end. <br /> <br /> Avoid as dead. This movie just refused to follow Seagal.
