first of all Robert Englund should praise Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark for being in touch with this part. I have to give it 1 I will not be able to give a zero. Want to know how bad this movie is? My mother is calling me from the city and telling me, "son, I was just watching the stupid movie", "hack language?" he replied, did you know what that was? How bad is this movie. This first Freddy pinhead appeared to be a good movie in Melinda, I'll give you a chance. The rest of this movie I sat down because I wrote a column to review sad movies. time money or even brain cells run away from this strange piece. If you see it on the Hollywood video blockbuster or even on your local video store shelf, turn it around and get away .... and I still want us not to be back for two hours
