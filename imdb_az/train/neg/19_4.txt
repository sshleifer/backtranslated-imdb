I'm a great fan of Arnold Voslo. <br /> <br /> When she recently saw her as a star of a recent movie, she was happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have taken a movie review at college and I can say something that I do not like <br /> <br /> It is said that the movie was made in an abandoned part of the city and that there was no background traffic or a clear space . <br /> <br /> I want to say that the actor leaves anything, but Arnold is an excellent player, I love Arnold Voslooy and made the movie unprecedented. <br /> <br /> I saw that the scene of aggression was cruel and unnecessary, but later the actors were pretty good. But the sounds of sound were pretty bad. There are some flaws in the film (sustainability) but, given the low caliber of the movie, they are obvious. <br /> <br /> For the film, Arnold Vosloo was very pleased with the film. <br /> <br /> Jackie
