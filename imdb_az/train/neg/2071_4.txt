There were two reasons to watch this swashbucker when it appeared on Danish television yesterday. Above all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida and I was not disappointed here. He looked beautiful. Secondly, as I read about the film, I have sounded the absurd humor that is different from the things that can be found in Philip De Broca. However, I was just surprised. I've found the subject of jokes (except for a few exaggeration of the war theme) and the characters are totally one size. At the same time, moving scenes have been performed in a strange mechanical and impeccable way, without any drama. I was watching the end, but I hurried very fast, and I was waiting for scenes with Lollobrigida.
