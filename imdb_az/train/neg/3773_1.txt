When people ask me, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its reach to the MST3k level, or at midnight, does not seem to be a late night filler in a theater, even on Disney's channel. The only time I wanted to throw off a ride on Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was the gricky Dick Tracey's jacket off the mickey, rip for shreds and guided tour guides "Eat It, Eat Dark Darkness!" I'm not so crazy in any movie, even "Naked Professor II: Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Would you like beautiful colors and cinematography? It's fine here. The reviewers say, "Oh, but it's like a very funny book," to me, a Gordito color after a few weeks in the sun. Very nice. Beatty hopes to skip around this landscape, talk with her at times, and sometimes chat with other actors and tell her about the time when someone's generation will start firing. To be fair, I've seen this movie only once, but it's God, not a human being on the eve of my pain.
