Can you say "all shock, no space"? There were many untested trends in this film. There is no information about the room except the death. * WHY was it bad? What did he do? Why not count an "hour"? Then there were investigated things; for example, we found a camera at the airport. <br /> <br /> Spouse and relatives resemble one another. Hmmm ... puts all of these together, creating a high-tech spook house like room 1408. <br /> <br /> At the same time ... In 1408, electronics does not work. No cell phones, except television, have no wireless, but the wireless Internet works well. How many incontinence can you add? Sorry, but this movie is "shock after shock" but it's nothing. All this has been done before. Mirror reflects. Just things from the site. Changing the picture. Bleeding walls. "Oh, that was just a dream ... it was not." Why would the main protagonist agree with her daughter's death that she would stay there anyway, even though the room was "bad"? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is no information about his first book. Only "father was a jerk" and so on. Some uncertain information about. What about the father when talking about fathers? "You will be my place". <br /> <br /> Generally, it's really a HORROR movie. My overall impression is that the whole movie was considered "cheap" because it was 100% adrenaline shock factor without any new or innovative effect. using an over-the-air set and a few layers, was an episode of recurring, cheeky, "effect-seen" effects.
