With British British actors and the 1950s glittering photography, I hope and this movie is expected to be more fun. Unfortunately, I was stuck to the wrong reasons - I did not believe it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about some films that many can watch this movie. She knows what she wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or music. A little gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly gets into a 15-minute song! It's really unbelievable that no level, or story itself seems to have an ounce of no danger or never Daisy. One of the other factors that tend to be trustworthy is Donald Sinden's songwriter (a writer for prayer!), Diana Dorsun for her fianc√©e, and seems not to be interested in it (Diana means) Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in a song publisher's office. <br /> <br /> If you chose a favorite scene and started with this wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson, everything went well. way
