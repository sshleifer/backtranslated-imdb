This film is definitely a product of its time and is a movie that is made in any other context, an incredibly stupid movie. Heck, even in the context of the correct, is pretty bad! The majority, this is a mistaken plot by the famous Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni and is very self-motivated. <br /> <br /> In this film, he tried to create a very beautiful style movie with an anti-hippy movie and only managed to produce a strange amount of bomb. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rap session, with which the student says such things as "the power of the people" and complains about the "man". Considering the parents who sent most of these hippies to their parents, it was a little ridiculous to speak out loudly for the privileged children and shut down the revolutionary jargon. Shortly thereafter, the students were called "violence" and "pigs", and a police officer was killed. Our "hero" Mark could or might not do it, but had to flee to escape the persecution. Instead of directing it to Mexico or Canada, he does just what a lane does - steal a plane and flies through the Mojave Desert! There he faces a 'chick' that happens and they sit around the clock philosophy. Then they become sexually explicit in one of the most intriguing sexual scenes in the film history. When the eyes open on the dust, suddenly there are no other couples, and there is a great orgy scene. If you see a little skin (providing an R-rating), it is not as likely. In fact, it takes so long and looks like a choreographer, it's just a clever thing. Of course, after the end, many couples fall into the air. <br /> <br /> In an unusual way, couples look like a small paint with some planes and a Peter Max creation. Despite improving the appearance of the aircraft, the evil cops respond to the return of the aircraft by striking a revolutionary shooting. When a girl finds a semi-catatonic state, the film ends accidentally by imagining her fascist bacon parents and all the bad things they are doing (for example, hard work and responsibility). Instead of a simple explosion, you see the explosion of the same big house about 8 times. Then, obviously, TVs, refrigerators and other things explode slowly. <br /> <br /> They say that, along with film shooting, "David Letterman" is the only likable character and broadly edited. At least 15 minutes can be easily eased to accelerate some things - especially for the whole truth, there is no such plot or dialogue. On the contrary, this is an amazingly funny movie, and I'm not surprised to find it in Harry Medved's book, The Most Affected Movies. This is a good pantheon shit. <br /> <br /> It's a criminal offense to spend so much money on such a catastrophic filmmaker! <br /> <br /> Two recent observations. If you're laughing in silly hip hop films, try watching BILLY JACK's trial. In the example of art that imitates life, leading Mark Frechette carried out his character in real life. He died in prison at the age of 27 a few years after some friends were involved in a revolutionary act of killing and murdering a bank innocent. Dang hippies!
