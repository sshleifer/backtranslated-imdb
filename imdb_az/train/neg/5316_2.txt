Take this bare dog bone. Probably bad ... you can watch it anyway. The hawk (Ross Hagen) is a smuggler who runs and flies by a very strange spacecraft (Jan-Michael Vincent). The cobbler stealing a service that crashes the ground on earth. An alive android killer is sent to the dead alive or dead. John Phillip Law calls for caution in dealing with these two visitors. The suits are ugly and have no scripts. Vincent took absolute money and ran. The law shows only one effort. It's almost not funny. In the document: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
