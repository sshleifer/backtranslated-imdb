this is terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First, TOOO is long. <strong> <br /> <br /> The comedy was not a comedy! !!!! <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> ......... but my expectations have completely crashed in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> A good thing about this movie is MUSIC ...... and open- It's clear Vidya Balaman. gives you the best performance and is distinguished by all the high-level actors ...... she is just a new companion and she still shines and looks so awesome! !!!!! Blond, who plays Govinda and her love interests, also helps save this tragic movie. Govinda is a perfect taxi driver. <br /> <br /> Other talented actress Ayesha Takiya has completely vanished in this movie !!!! so priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay saw his role well, but also appeared !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted ... <br /> <br /> Salman is not the only Salman not to leave alone, because no talent will be so wasted !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> All this is a film that is possible with the Mishmashed scenario and TOOO Masladar, the story is shaped by stupid comedy scenes. <br /> <br /> 3/10 is more than 4 hours !!!! Think before going to the cinema and RETHINK !!!!! better avoid !!!!!
