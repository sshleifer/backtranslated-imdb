Actually, I liked this movie until the end. Of course, it was cheesy and unpleasant, but still a rainy afternoon kept my focus. To the end, that is. Because of her latest classic conservatory, she struggled to reach other classmates, what did the main character do? Do not try to catch them and glorify the tradition of music at this time? No. He turns the great sensitive Habanera from Carmen into torture and laughing, and turns it into a Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song that is completely forgotten. My ears were drowned! At the very moment of horror, the teachers stood up! Any teacher who was not in a fantasy created by Spears would have failed in his place. Protect your time to protect your ears - skip this movie!
