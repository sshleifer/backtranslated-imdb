I do not understand why the reaction has become a trend. Every remake I see is terrible and this is no exception. Because someone is quoted by Ben Jones, because he is a "dirty" piece of rubbish, he is very accurate. Why I did not break an episode that I love and DVDs will shoot a beautiful television show in 1-4 seasons and will destroy it and never know it. Television show was a family show and Daisy was really flawless, or at the show, saving his suits. Family show has become a dirty trash and I do not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I do not like is that John Schneider and Tom Wopat (along with the rest of the rest) are perfect actors, and they are extremely sweet. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little sweet. It was one of the hammers for the show. Casting is terrible. They could have taken at least one Kurdish for Daisy. Burt Reynolds is also a qualified Boss Hogg. Each role he plays is totally contrary to this role. Willie Nelson's uncle Jesse, who is involved in nearly half a decent role, is still not comparable. Denver Pyle is an actor and perfect for this role. I think casting is terrible, the story is horrible, and all this has destroyed a beautiful impression and turned it into a dirty, horrible film. I do not recommend anyone to go. I only saw it for interest, plus there was a free ticket on the season 4 DVD. I never paid for this movie, but it was free. THIS MOVIE IS PAYING.
