Do not think that this film is wrong with other reviewers, but the Japanese alphabet industry (in moral terms, is not worse than US meat trade or Scottish haggis culprit), because this ambitious stone is a self-sustaining, fear. There are some striking images, but when using your imagination, there are striking images on the mid-bus trip, so there's no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie is very slow and often accompanied by a noise that looks like a cat, and then restarts when you think it's just over. I saw it for a week in a hired Rome cinema to show Barney's films. It was a surprising and clever way to return something that was once a local flea from the dirty old men's luggage. Brigade, but if admirers of innovative young people and a few older bearded Bjorks were honest, they would have had more fun than anyone else if they only showed one of the porno!
