This mini-series is more entertaining than some of the larger budgets and bigger desires. SOTD falls somewhere between the "Kung Fu" and "H P Pufnstuff" in the entertainment scene. If it were not too long (about 3 hours) children would like it a bit. There are adventure, action, "cliff scenes" and many romantic or other "icky" things. When you are young, do not criticize rubber swords, criticize movements and recurring scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated in the same way as in an old-fashioned movie to speed up the audience). Finally, children adopt the American English dialogue from Asian dance actors. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie three stars, but the filmmaker feels like a producer, and the movies I hit have at least some additional credits to implement the project. <br /> <br /> This film is not art, but just like taking your home, it has actually taken some time, effort and discipline. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is not advisable for your time <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dialogue is a predominant and traditional writing. Spell checking thinks that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While the "dialogue" is accepted, both Webster and the OED consider it an alternative form of communication.
