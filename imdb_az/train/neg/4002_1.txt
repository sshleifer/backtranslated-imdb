Social interpretation is often unacceptable, and the mystery itself is set up, and a completely unbelievable variety is solved by imaginary coincidences. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life over the last decade, which is far from interesting. <br /> <br /> I did not understand that he complained about his visit to Australia compared to his ability to solve secrets in England. Can not he offend Australian police? <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the previous work are quite melodramatic and unacceptable, sometimes with silence, and this mantle goes back to the attention of the first. Sad.
