I started to create some of the most incredible drill-animated films I've ever seen as a great director like Chuck Jones. I did not laugh at once in this short time, and for the sake of Christ, Bugs Bunny cartoon! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, boring! Unfortunately, it comes out of Good Night Elmer (another incredibly dull Jones short) with this short Bugs Bunny addition. <br /> <br /> Absolute cartoon first warning sign is not always paying no stick. Good Night Elmer was bored, because he had to walk away with the predictable payment on the same two rods. On the other hand, this cartoon is exposed to the second warning sign of a loud cartoon: there is a lot of dialogue. The cartoon has more than two arms at least, but most of them look more like a big padding of dialogue. At one point, Elmer ended up eating and said, "This is a very good sand victim," perhaps the most necessary dialogue I read in a cartoon (the characters reading Woody Woodpecker cartoons later) . Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes away, it feels like 20, thanks to such unnecessary dialogue. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit is not an entertaining cartoon for me, but his soul could not admit that Chuck Jones was driving a few clues during his career.
