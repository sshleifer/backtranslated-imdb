Dolph Lundgren, as a tempo coming to New York when an archaeologist finds a key to discovering the Ancient Christ, stars are, of course, few miles behind the devil's Dolph and are not easily slaughtered until the body is transferred. Of course, Lundgren is beyond his element and the film is completely invisible. I admit that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while watching TV while watching TV. I grabbed Minyon and the boy never disappointed. This movie is absolutely terrible. If you are staggering in a staggered sequence and made bad, you can feel the sense of sense in the battlefield. The worst of all this is that the film is the worst movie I've ever seen from Dolph Lundgren (which is bad, but better) than the Fallen (Which's Good) and the end of the Fallen movie . There is nothing that this word has to offer. It's horrible and the lowest point in Lundgren's career. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4th (Terrible)
