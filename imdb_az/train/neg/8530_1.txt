"His cardboard love" is the latest film by Norma Shearer. He left the film and I joined the Board of Directors at MGM. It was a good move in its part. "His cardboard lover" was boring in conversations and portions. There were a few respected actors in specific portions, so a lot of work to keep this dialogue turkiyeyi spent. <br /> <br /> The story of a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer), a man (Robert Taylor), his playboy gunner (George Sanders) was a good idea to work to make them jealous. I am glad that director George Cukor, Ms. Shearer and Mr Taylor had never numerous sex scenes. Mr. Cukor served Mrs. Shirer well in "Women", but not in this film. <br /> <br /> The best performance in the film is given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, this is the best comedy film roles, and in 1941, "when the invention Ladies" was given. The best comedy performance in 1942, "Her Cardboard Loverunda" and it's by far the best dramatic performance of the "Johnny Eager" too. It was a year when he was busy. I think all the actors in the MGM, Mr Taylor worked with very large and small actresses. Also, the MGM presented all kinds of movies to Mr. Taylor - most of them were successful. That's why the MGM kept him for 25 years. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was very good as a socialist heel. He played a similar role in "All About Eve" eight years later. As Ms. Sirer…ô, it was one of his worst performances of the comedy was not for the comic and dramatic. It is strange that in 1939 he created a great comedy named "Women" and gave the best performance. She was too old to look for her young leaders in her "cardboard lover". <br /> <br /> Let's also note that he did not help his many clothes to be terrifying. <br /> <br /> Too bad, and Mr. Taylor did not have a great film like "Escape", like the latest film. The same commentaries on this film can be explained in 1937 with Jean Harlow, a film titled "Private Property" by Mr. Taylor. She was talking very much, the drill and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked at the patient throughout the film, and in Hollywood, no one told her to see a doctor, so she died at the age of 26 in 1937. He becomes a good actress and gets a better role.
