The main problem with "power" can be senseless characters and subplots that add nothing to the movie. Waiting for scenes that do not coordinate in order to find something that causes the film's propagation is a bit boring. Perhaps you can perceive all of these as character development, but all of them are returning from previous scenes of the movie or just plain and uninteresting. Lumet never gives you time to stop working. He must have concentrated more on several characters (hackman, spouse) and others (Billings). It could be a tough, tough political tension, rather than a whimsical confusion, which was very dangerous in writing and losing any message on the sea. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not parallel. Here, Denzel is Washington's only real actor. Gere and others made speeches better in all the other places. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet shows a strange man to seventy (ie Serpico) and seeks his return with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sidney has not worked yet and will probably never be. Leave the ensemble dramas to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> * / * * * *
