I watched the Canadian video cameras in the movie as "The Witching" to New York State. The sound was very bad, I had to raise it to just about 7/8 to hear it, and the sound was often against the dialogue. Orson Welles was worse than usual, working with his dialogue and one of the others. A fake figure re-emerged distorted his voice. <br /> <br /> A group of witches or sellers (the latter says that the group does not intend to represent any real group) fell into a ritual and a puppet stabbing down. A fallen and married husband moves to a city called Lilith, where a job is offered at a toy factory. <br /> <br /> Despite being one of the AKAs in this movie, we will never see it and only occasionally talk about being a "Toy Factory". <br /> <br /> On his way to Lilith, his new chief, Mr. Cato, asked questions about their religious beliefs. It acts aggressively and causes other cars to explode and explode. After the police arrives, she takes a puppet inside the car, the second of many handmade puppets in the film. <br /> <br /> Cato Cato comes out and all the townspeople are witches, and though they do not understand Him, there are those who cause her down. <br /> <br /> Some of the film's effects are slightly affected, but in general, the film is not very attractive. The film looks like a mess, and it's mostly related to editing and adding new footage. According to the latest credits, the original version was Necromancy - Life was not a life. The DVD may allow you to see both versions on a magic disc, but the likelihood of re-releasing this movie is not a priority.
