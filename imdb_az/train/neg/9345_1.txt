It feels like I feel it is, I do not fall for it. After reading gorgeous views (director, Sky with a movie teacher), it's been a time when I look forward to a strong, functioning, atmospheric, durable, powerful character. territorial development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, the "Six Years Alcohol" does not reach promises to critics, in most cases, this staircase has low budget-specific effects (why is it a klichel cobweb scene?), Instead of this non-real fight choreography, sacrifices these qualities? <br /> <br /> "Six Years Alcohol" starts with shooting in some beautiful places in Scotland, but it's down straight down here. Unfortunately, sometimes instead of creating a building or creating a hairdresser - the director will start to have fun with you, with a grueling noisy noisy noise. The lead characters are not so scared and behave badly - the audience will not be able to do anything to them, desperate actors are doing things desperate ... like this movie! "Respect" (typical of the director who wants to pay taxes to past masters) to worsen matters is either totally sticky or unconvincing. The soundtrack has raised me and is the only thing I keep in cinema, but it's not something that even dramatically supports the story. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film has a lot of irregularities and is terribly annoying. I still watched all the damned things! That's why I liked the decisive realism of the film, but it was even destroyed when it was interwoven with strange and abstract, sometimes trivial scenes. We did not need a big budget to make a really moving movie, we were telling how much money this film has earned, half a million dollars a bit ... ANY USE! Sometimes the actors are interested ... Or their agents thought! <br /> <br /> If you are still not masochistic or foolish, go to Turkey ... 1.5 / 10
