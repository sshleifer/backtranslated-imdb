The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the film is very subtle ... even manages it. The main problem is that these castings have made this movie almost another local and regular clich√© with a great lack of impression and impression. Apart from his father's small role, Rafael (played by Asi Dayan effectively), all other actors, unfortunately, did not do his best. The role of the old Blind girl played by Taly Sharon is fresh, but without any intensity as a leading role. so the moving figure has become soft and low profile. There was a trial and then moments and episodes that seemed to be a real movie. But after all, there is a good starting point in the future and great improvements.
