When I talk about hating long readers hoping to find a point and disappointment, first of all, I'll tell everyone that this movie is terrible. Terrible horrible. And not surprising, at first glance. When I saw the film as I deserved, I felt that I had agreed with her, but she was saddened to read what I was reading. I'm ashamed of taking the same side as someone who commented on the film's lack of beautiful looks. The first to me was, "Wow, that's a serious deeply-researched study there, and I can not understand the philosophical ideas about this film." Seriously, the lack of "good-looking women" should not be considered important for a movie. If you do not have enough hopes for "good-looking women," you really need to watch other types of movies if they are not in the fantastic category.
