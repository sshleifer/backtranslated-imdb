It was an hour in the morning and I did not do anything else. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> A group of people found a way to a island. They do not last long before a great "reptile" encounter, which makes the horses gobbles. Soon, they are captured by the local population and must kill "creeping gods" to gain freedom. CG sucks; It recalls the CG of early console video games. The matches were lame. The only positive thing to say about this was the native land running around jealous material. Otherwise, this is just an effort.
