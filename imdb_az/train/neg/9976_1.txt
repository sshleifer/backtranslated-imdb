The first scene of "Problem Child" puts a baby on a face. For this movie, this is witty. A bad, heartwarming "comedy" is incredibly convincing in many levels. John Ritter is a grandfather who takes his child out of Hell and is a kudos because he protects his dignity in one copy, teasing and humiliating humor. What does hell's Jack Warden do in this confusion? An attempt by Dennis Dugan to ventilate his grief and sadness, this film is very bad, and this is a strange experience. But do not think of them all. The bottom of everything is Michael Oliver, one of the most modest and distinctive child actors. Believe me, you may want to throw it in my mouth.
