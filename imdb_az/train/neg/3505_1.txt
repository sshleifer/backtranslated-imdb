The Comedy Center has the habit of putting great programs on time - Chappelle Show, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then some people Stella, Dr. Katz likes or hates. <br /> <br /> This show can be fun, based on Silverman's peculiarity (Colbert). Report) but may be terrible (Mencia's lament). Second, I believe the situation should not shock anyone. This show is a sitcom and parody of society, so an absurd program loses itself absurdly and is simply not funny. A woman's farting is done many times in comedy, because it's not a common thing. We do not need 25 minutes. When a criminal is disrupted by a queef, he simply loses his appeal. We found her at Jay and Silent Bob Strike, the women were more intense and the whole scene was much better and better. But the best comparison of this show belongs to Stella, except that Stella was very subtle, and it was funny with the absurd comedy. <br /> <br /> Maybe I think some of the research is negative (I do not doubt the critical acclaim, but I do not argue with a fan reaction)) is the amount of advertising on this show, very bad programs, bad ads, and advertising for other programs. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman's career is wasted, and others are still suffering when better shows are canceled. This show did not pass the unforgettable pilot stage. Despite the fact that Norma has given more promises, this show is further developed. Criticism, as well as the truth, has been universally widespread so much that their situation has risen greatly. Finally, I checked, Britney Spears also took good reviews. Compare what you want, because no one doubts that I should be psychologically IMDb so I do not like this show.
