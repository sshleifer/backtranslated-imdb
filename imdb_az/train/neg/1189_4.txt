The show is a 'foam' sound effect used to make me sleep. Very calming show. I think I was asleep in danger or danger. I also heard that shooting at Tarpon Springs, Florida, to create a show for gum divers. I thought the Lloyd Bridges would never be able to travel there. I remember the show I repeat, and although we did not admire anywhere, though, we would create my own underwater lake in my dad's house ... imagining the recurring flaming voices and adventures of our own. I thought the 'Flipper' was a better submarine action. Of course, being in a natural environment was a priority.
