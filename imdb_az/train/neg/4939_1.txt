Peeew gets worse! As everyone knows, some are based on Geico insurance ads; What Does Someone Know? These ads were the best at first glance fun; a challenging feed for a row. (The Geico Gecko is another story that is going to make for an interesting series now!) And why the ABC in the world is told in the press - do you really agree to get caveman characters from Geico? After all, cavemen who struggle in the modern world are not difficult for television; Phil Hartman played a recurring Saturday Night Live, a decade ago called Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. And a similar concept works well - just like giving a break. But on a regular basis? Fuhgeddaboudit. (In the 1960s, the response to the "Time" caverns used the concept of the modern world and continued for a season). <br /> <br /> One of the demonstrators responsible for Geico advertising, recently said: "When we were advertising, we were very excited because we felt like we had something very unique and had bigger stories." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the real TV year, we're always going to be in the worst situation, alongside the 1972 Me and the Chimp. The leading actor in the successful Chimp fiasco, after being abolished, was hiding in a shameful union. Without a doubt, cavemen will follow our friends.
