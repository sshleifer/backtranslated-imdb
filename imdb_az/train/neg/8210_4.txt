Okay, this is: "Nazi mountaineer is friends with Dalai Lama". We get a great star that we do not know how to make a German password, and let it split over France, Germany, America and the UK for more than 2 hours. Then we are incredibly incredibly incredible and splitting them into a very large space, so the field is almost unobtrusive. But to make sure the viewer is not going to fall asleep, we're taking the details of the absurd shocking shock as the hero smokes at a height of 22,000 feet. Of course, we should remember that our target audience did not want to read much of the subtitles, so we have every character in Lhasa, which was banned in Lehasa in 1943. Of course, the most difficult part is how to handle the moral and political aspects of the story, so what we do: We are now a reformed Nazi with Dalai Lama, because the latest film projectors, radios are antique carts and other devices representing the freedom of the capitalist west . Instead, the hero learns from a young defender of a kind that is really severely removed or untreated - Buddhism. We have many scenes with hero and hero who protects the rest of the Tibetan society, with all the respect and protocols that the Dalai Lama has agreed, even as we claim that the hero has deep and profound respect for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we think the audience does not believe this man, like Buddhist, in turn. Although we know what change is and how much we want it. And last but not least, at least we have made a "political" movie by hanging out the statistics that the Chinese were treating the Tibetans horribly (which, of course, is true), to the end of the film. this is not something like that. So, it's my opinion. Are you Vat zink? Can you make a bad movie?
