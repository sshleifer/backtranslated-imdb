BROKEN is part of the Dark Horrorfest III. Not filled with a slasher or gore. In this sad trance of France, writer / director Sean Ellis has plenty of glasses and mirrors. The perfect radiologist, Gina McVay (Lena Headly), integrates into a strange world as life seems to spiral out of life. While attending a birthday party by his father, Richard Jenkins, the guests are surprised, even though a mirror fell to the ground. It is truly strange when she witnesses a woman who has a self-immersed appearance on a London street in the same car. Gina enters the doppelganger's apartment and finds a photograph with her father. He is driven into the drive and is heading for a collision. Then the mysterious companion is not the same; It is not easy for a family and friends to have confidence in him. Is Gina alone with her? In a parallel world? <br /> <br /> Kudos, if you can figure this figure ... it will not be easy. Editing could not have been intense. Lighting is under question. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
