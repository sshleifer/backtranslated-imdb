I just saw this movie and it must be said that it's a great time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not move completely. He naturally reads his own lines and had a very natural face throughout the film. On the other hand, Rosanna Munter playing Petra is natural. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION! The story was simple - we've seen it many times before. He breaks, finds another, feels jealousy, breaks with the other girl and ends with each other. There was no surprise, someone knew that Evan was going to break, and Adam had "closed" Petra. No one saw that Petra promised Adam to go after Eva after the party. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> An unforgettable performance player. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
