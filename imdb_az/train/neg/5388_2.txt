Here's a good movie, but it's not. The main idea is good: a group of apocalypse investigate moral issues that will face life. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are the paranoid of the mysterious airborne disease that almost destroyed all people. But some do not have surgery on masks for several times. In some cases, fanatical thinking is needed to clean up any area where an infected person touches. At other times they can not be totally disturbed. Worse yet, after surviving a few weeks or months in this new killing or killing world, these people are always behaving like total totbs. They do not bother to pick up the necessary equipment or food. They go out of the middle of the fire forever. They do not see precautionary measures when talking to strangers. After passing through the rotten corpses of all human beings, they are curled up as shelter-like demostrats. <br /> <br /> So, when these rich people begin to lose their moral values, they want to make a movie in this movie. the dimensions of their actions and the search for their souls can not be taken seriously. Their actions should first of all be of the same kind as minimal. <br /> <br /> On top of all, we have to fight Chris Pine's suspicious activity. A haughty young man might have seemed strangely, as humble, as James T Charkin described. But in carriers he plays in the same note: arrogant and boneheaded. <br /> <br /> The positive side of the movie looks great. It has a sharp, saturated view to the US in the south-west. But in fact, it can not save weak text and paper (and annoying) characters. Whether you're an admirer of the latter genre, you have to save yourself from watching Carriers.
