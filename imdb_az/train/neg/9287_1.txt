HELP! WOW! Why is everyone going to a treacherous movie? Half past dead was a bad movie, but at least I had an idea of ​​what he wanted. There's no clue what HPD2 wants to do. The reasons I can explain are only available on the screen. Spoiler: The whole movie is: Twitch (played by Tha Dogg Pound's Kuruptus), to another prison, where there may be a box filled with gold bricks. There is a rebellion in prison, opponent prisoners, one of whom was shot by a boy named Cortez and plans to escape from Cortez. During a joint trip she was abducted by Cortez, daughter of Twitch and her daughter Burke (Bill Goldberg), and held in an executive room. Burke unwittingly joins Twitch, and when they discover that they are Cortez's favorites, they begin to have difficulty with ironic prisoners. <br /> <br /> The Idea: the most unnecessary ending since the Universal Soldier: Return. The script is horrible, the action is horrifying, dialogue is a joke, and everyone in this movie is a cartoon. Look, I know that the budget is a budget movie, but this is not an excuse for not trying to do what children do. In this "movie," one believes the characters he plays. No one can be taken seriously as an actor in this movie, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself, a "twitch" character, a puppet who is very fond of spending most of his time being attracted by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg, as he had to take a PHD (a very large dump), has spent much of his time sulking on the film. Heroes are poorly choreographed and miserable, and it's so boring even when an action movie moves to HPD2! Everyone can say that this movie is a little worthwhile, and it's striking that people do not hate Folliwood.
