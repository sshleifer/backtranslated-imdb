In contrast to another reviewer, I think this is WELL, especially more so, because more imagination will be required; and it worked well because there were no other characters to share the tens of ten minutes of plus-good monologues. But I am enjoying such solemn and religious memories. Everyone has a story, and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has a problem, some are more intense than others. These are just ten, non-atypical stories and problems, for example, an example of how someone's life (or some part) is feeding the film. Again, I think the reality of the television is bad. So, if you have a bag, you resemble it. These are good things to do for phone and / or internet gossip; but without any other words than absolutely nothing else. And though every one of them speaks to me, I will leave sex here.
