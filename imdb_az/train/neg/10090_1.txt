This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" comic joke. Why? The only thing about this was the good laugh I mentioned about my unpleasant, believable plot and terrifying play. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are many questions within this movie ... for example; Why are these women getting zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie "guards" and what is their purpose? When is 6 people "zombies"? And everywhere, anywhere, black eyeshadow smeared "scary"? Even 2 years old? <br /> Lastly; Why was this movie completely prepared? Why? why? why? No reply? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
