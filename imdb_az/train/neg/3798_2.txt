And this is the only reason I have a DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked this information and said, 'What is here?' Why? Because in the first film Alex was a man. But still the first was determined in the future, maybe this is a new thing Alex is causing the scientist to be only woman this time. At least he knows in the movie in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of the plot: Alex is still a baby (or, in the future, he runs with his mother in a special time boat and ends in the 80's, his mother is killed and Alex Sue Price is growing in the African tribe, and then the tribe is killed by a cyborg in the future, and then Alex runs and hides it and finally kiborgu. <br /> <br /> The Terminator is not the only film injured here, but Predator takes a fair share I think that the first Fly movie, Vincent Price, is the first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Okay, the film was a pretty small budget flick, but there was a bad effect on the film in the 90s, how good it would be for the 80s to splash.The biggest problem area is that things just happen and the audience is interested. <br /> <br /> <strong> What? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> : Oscar here waiting for decent performances? Well ... at least the price of Sue was hot on the way to the Amazon warrior. <br /> <br /> The rating of a "real" movie: 2/10 There are not many professionals about all their qualities. <br /> <br /> Rating of a movie: 4/10 I'm laughing accidentally at the film's bad, so there's a small movie. That's why they deserve it.
