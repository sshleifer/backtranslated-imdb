Just do not worry. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, I thought a movie would be questioned and functioned. <br /> <br /> But after an exciting start, drill and predictably predictable. There is a little social drama in the middle of the film and all the tensions have been lost because of the slower speed. It's good at the end, but it's not really good. In my opinion, the director took this movie very seriously. In such a film, he plans to do at least a beautiful performance. I nearly crumbled in the middle and the main part. Rating 3/10.
