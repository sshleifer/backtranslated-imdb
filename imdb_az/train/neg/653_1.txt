If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in negative figures. <br /> <br /> Someone should continue to shoot these horrific "horror" films, though the people who buy tickets for this movie are the money that you can spend on something that is more worth your time. <br /> <Although you're a scary movie, you do not even think of how horrifying you are in a movie, there's nothing scary. <br /> <br /> <strong> Who prepared the "last night of the night"? Undoubtedly, if not for scripting, actors probably did a decent job. This was a terrible waste of a visit to the cinema. I'm going to go and see at least one "Missing Call" with a series of themes.
