At the beginning of the film, two old friends are sent to Japan to take back the results of genetic research that has been stolen by black ninja videos. At first, they only need to learn a ninja's skill because "only the ninja can defeat the ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura's killings are trying to be a joyful ninja flick, but this is a bad way to fail. The entire movie is so empty and predictable that it is difficult to say good things about it: the same thing happened in the previous changes, the characters are very short, the direction is elegant and the script does not offer anything striking, even reducing the cost of the movie (garbage) on the last scene. <br /> <br /> Even the 80's-flick-fan movie, which understands the aesthetics of stupid films, is hard to make this film even unpleasant. It just does not offer anything new to the audience at the visual level or the plot. Shriks are thrown out and layered, but it is not enough to guess the direction of the film, and the same battle scenes repeat the audience even after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recommend the movie to everyone. Even Franco Nero's "Ninja Gir" was fun to play behind Sakura's killing in America. Even at the level of vision, there are no balls in the film, and there is a waste of time to find any great battle scene in this movie: nothing. In general, one of the most unusual ninja flies, I've never seen. Not interested in curiosity. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
