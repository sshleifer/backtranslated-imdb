Nobody ever saw Harry Sally, and then avoid this situation. For some reasons, your head does not put your head on the desk because it does not have a good restoration; but also worries you with the funny moments called in this topic. The film's appeal is incomplete. Ranee looks horrible. Saif is trying to act as a hellish actor. Areas taken from the original do not seem to be effective. Both of them bring their comrades and note them into a note, but it does not just look attractive. What could be more catastrophic? If you want to spend a bit of money, you can buy it. Otherwise, you can put more money and watch the original. It's very good to miss.
