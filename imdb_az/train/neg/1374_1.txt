Man, it was funny. Must be under comedy. Or the STUPID. It would be as if you could understand how easy a spark was. Seriously? I want everyone involved in this movie to be instantaneous. For everyone who wants to watch this "movie", go through a few point points. Wait OH. There is nothing. There is no plot in the truth. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and decided to take a movie with some random people and went on a miraculously video footage. This film is the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me? Watch it. Do it, man. I encourage you. But be prepared to look at your eyes. If you sit in this way without killing a cow, you will be very strong and courageous.
