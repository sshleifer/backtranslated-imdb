This is actually the worst movie I have ever had. It would be an incoherent compliment. Even the last did not make any sense, but it ended up being a great relief. I watched with some sort of fatalist charm to see if he could continue to get worse and did it. I apologized for any characters left until the end of this turmoil, or I did not feel very charitable about actors. If you want a train crash to be watched, I recommend hanging on a train station. Those who are waiting on a train platform in the wilderness overcome this turmoil. As you can see, if I did not get enough to fill my ten line, I would say once more with the risk of excess. This movie is zero and even less if I have a promise for a lower rating. How is the negative zero?
