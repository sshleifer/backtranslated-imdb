The Choke "The Choke" begins as a rock band known as Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker) and preparing for a nightclub club "Club 905". Leading singer Dylan (Sean Cook) and guitarist Mike (Jason McKee) other team members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) and drummer Nancy (Tom Olson) are now required. Once in Dylan's club, Mike does not appear and the concert is a disaster. As the group thinks, as they can not get worse, they will find no dead body in the basement, they will not be able to get out of the door and will not trust anyone to be elected as a secret murderer. separating them from each other ... <br /> <br /> Juan A. Mas producing and directing The Choke is a standard-by-numbers teen slasher that really does not have anything going for her. The script, written by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not a lot of horror movies written by women), has some awesome good characters and there are some noisy dialogs, but it's better than a lot of horrors in many video cameras. In this regard, it is slow and elegant to approach it to escape. After all the usual teenage slasher clips were used, isolated people could not escape, seemingly good looking adolescents, a few killings, and like Scream (1996), but they would not be able to create a sense of logic. (they could not do some of what they meant) and even worse, the killer was early enough and I did not want to boast, but I was there. Later, The Choke's producers felt that they would entertain the scenes of adolescents who walk around dark corridors that did not do anything in the infinite way (which would seem endless while watching it), but there are so many things that I can shoot before , begins to be exhausted. The number of offenses is small, they all decide to shift each other (good idea), but then they decide to split up and go separately (a bad idea when there is an empty killer), the speed is lethargic <br /> < br /> Famous director Mas, of course, looks OK for the majority of the film, though he uses a few annoying posts. slow motion or jump sketch. Gore levels do not really reset, but some blood leaks, a hollow man in the chest, several dead bodies, and some to the metal pole. Most of the killers are finally killed by an ax, a good example of the fact that the film does not show anything. Since the movie is related to a rock band, there is really a rock-oriented soundtrack that's really horrible, horrible, and used with rock music. I'm a sad rock admirer, but in my ears this shit is just noise pollution. <br /> <br /> Some $ 1,000,000 has been funded with some budget. production values ​​are cheap to make sure, but very low budget horror movies are not as cheap as it seems. As you can see, they hit a place called Spokane in Washington. <br /> <br /> It is generally very good, as it is one of the strongest points of the film, so nobody will win the Oscars, but half is not bad. <br /> <br /> Scream style teen slasher with no end to a split end and with a penalty of blood, snow, violence, nudity and dead corpses. I would like to say that if a slasher is not sexually explicit, then what's the point? Is there anything just this average slasher needs to watch?
