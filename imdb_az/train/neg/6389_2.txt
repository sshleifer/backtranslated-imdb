I waited about 25 years to see this movie, but I did not think it was actually a quality that was more than a period of animation. It was based on a series of favorite books, played by one of the best movie villains of all time and was produced by Disney Studios. Maybe it would be wrong with that? <br /> <br /> Not everything is good. Rattigan and Henry Mancini's strange account, Vincent Price, is the two savings manuscripts of the film. Price is a barrier, Mancini is more professional than material. Others bring a class to a dark project. <br /> <br /> Along with this, while the rest of the film is filled with illicit conditions, it still suffers from a completely scrambled script, mild general sound, terrifying song, and lazy animation that does not go out of place. <br /> <br /> This is a television show on Saturday morning in any of the Disney's mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment for me. This film is nearly up-to-date with NIMH's Secret. <br /> <br /> Along with that, an independent studio produced something more creative than during the GMD's work. <br /> <br /> This is a "terrible" starter price and Mancini.
