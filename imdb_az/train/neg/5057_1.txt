Very outdated film, terrific, clich√© and luxurious dialogue and a very bad construction. Additionally, Cassavetes and Falk have always been outstanding. Pseudo "good movie". There is no need to find out how disastrous this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a common hole filled with histrionic and hysterical transitions. The sound is horrible. Camera movements, like the structure of the characters, are without imagination. No poems, no subtle psychology, no interesting pictures. Players constantly smoke and we see ads for beer drinks. Very cheap indeed. (one exception: a beautiful and simple way to play Ned Beattie's stunning man).
