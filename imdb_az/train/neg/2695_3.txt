When I go to the video store to rent a flick, I usually trust IMDb's ideas in a movie and have not seen a rating of 7.0 or higher on the site I did not enjoy so much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, a legendary film director of the 20th Century, <BR> <br /> I love movies with defective characters, but no matter how dark the darkness is, there is a little light here, we are all shades of dark or shiny one of them. <br /> <br /> This film has completely overwhelmed this line by completely non-sympathetic and almost masochistic field with black heroes. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's Hank is divorced after being married to a 30-year-old, irresponsible male. A girl who hates her is a daughter who thinks she is a strange loss. Because he is too scared to be frustrated by the fact that others do not do dirty jobs, his strict impartiality and desires are directly responsible for the bank robbery scheme and the killing of the mother. Because it stands at the end of the film, it's even worse than a surprise. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but it does not give much to his job, because he is portrayed to a drifting driver and does not pay attention to the fact that he is there. <br /> <br /> The character of his character tells us that his wife is equally bad. Each film shot is just a matter of accusing him of being hired for rent and child support, and insulting his already unknown affiliation. Seriously, this is just the whole character. Albert Finney plays Charles's fathers and Mr Finney has been a great actor for many decades and carries about 90% of the movie with the same mouth. Open the half of the grimace, as it is suffering from the worst of the world's worries. Dear Finney, for someone who is an actor, you think it will be more appropriate for emotions. Despite the fact that he does not show much, his character is probably filled with sadness and anger. <br /> <br /> Maria Tomei likes Andy in the movie, Dr. Pointed out that Frankenstein put the monster. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei is not interested in her character. They had an unhappy marriage with Andy and had a few unpleasant experiences with her. When Andy's world begins to control a spiral, he drives a logical ship, but may be less selfish or self-centered than any other character in the film, but at least a common sense. <br /> <br /> And finally, we come to Andy, which is always performed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the only reason I appreciate this movie in place of 1 instead of 3. A "perfect crime" is an exciting thing to exploit the heroine's addiction to rob her parent's jewelry store. It's convincing and uncertain that the wrong master planner has come from a flawless scheme to an unstable, fraudulent killing manicure. Hoffman's character ends the film's misconduct, but it's hard to root out because the alternative is an emotionally-directed younger brother and an early parent of an unwanted baby whose son is ultimately a psychologist and an intentional killing of his mother <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie really looks for PSH's great performance and is a feature of the family train crash. Do not expect any humble character to be simply because it does not.
