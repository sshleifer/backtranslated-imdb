My husband and I agreed that this is one of the worst films ever. Surely, I'm in the top ten of all tracks. At least "Plan 9" was gratifying. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Christine's, Dead Zone, Firestarter, Carrie, and some other movies. I did not pay much attention to "Cujo" (only voices were bad in what I saw and I did not say what people said) or "Pet Sematari" <br /> But this mixture was a possible mistake. The "living things" themselves were made by a 9-year-old person. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian>
