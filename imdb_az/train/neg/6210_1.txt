The worst movie I've ever seen since Lindsey Lohan's "I Know Who Killed". <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that disrespect and frustration await you to see something else. Hey, Tim Burton, I've been a great admirer ... did you even shoot this movie? <br /> <br /> The story, which gives an indefinable conclusion, without giving anything ... Nine is appropriate, it does things, actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the film ... it rains. I think that while watching this movie a part of my soul died.
