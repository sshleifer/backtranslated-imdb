I'll start with good points. The film was only 86 minutes and some were so funny. Now for low dots. My first warning came with the film's actual "warning". At the start, the following warning was shown: "The film you are watching contains graphic and disturbing images because killing against popular belief is neither entertaining nor romantic." I have to save myself 86 minutes and then have to close it up. The first words of the film were: "I was in a sticky plant". She was a chatter on the phone, and she looked at a matte home as a glue factory. I do not know why. The essence of the film is that some children are dissatisfied with Zodiac Killer and begin to imitate it. The budget of this movie is at least $ 50, and they should use the cheapest cameras they can afford. Imagine that I read straight from a post. They are like something they did. The scenario was terrible and a great "twist" was written by Zodiac Killer, and this man was really Burc Killer. Of course, we tried to show this delicacy, but in the first 10 minutes it was completely clear. There were some terrible moments in the movie without the painful details of the site. Zodiac Killer is trying to compare Killer with a "army army" because soldiers are really only killers. Then, at the meeting, they tried to make "Satan the Devil" by showing some children with black hues. When someone gave the child's name and phone number, the big "computer hacker" could pick up the boy's name. For some reasons, he was forced to enter the FBI to get a title. I'm sorry, why not look up the phone book or use whitepages.com. At 9/11, for any reason, there was an occasional idea. I have also pointed out that no matter where you are hitting, your blood will flow from the mouth for a few seconds. <br /> So if you really like bad behavior, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an open space, you'll love Zodiac Killer!
