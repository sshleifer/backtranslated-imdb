Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) shows that his brother, Kathy (Mariel Hemingway) teacher (Chris Sarandon) was harassed. He is brought to court, but absolutely free. <br /> <br /> This film is known as an important drama dealing with aggression. What is badly written and (most) badly moving drama. This means being sympathetic to victims of aggression, but it draws us to the stage. But to be absolutely honest, Hemingway's actions are so bad that he loses any realistic potential. Court scenes could not be drilled and predicted. When the 15-year-old Mariel was assaulted, the film was not shown. I admit, though, that Margaux grabbed his weapon and killed Sarando in a great end. But the seriousness is that a young girl who is raped is arrogant. <br /> <br /> Actor does not help. For example, Margaux is no actress. She was, of course, a beautiful woman (and I believe it's an actual model), but her player left a lot to be desired. Reduces the film. Mariel was only good, but it was one of her first films. What can Sarandon do as an aggressor? <br/> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> => People. I found this elegant, simple and really sick one. A 1 whole way.
