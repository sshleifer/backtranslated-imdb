The extremely poor film, which was never with wooden dolphin Lundgren and Brandon Lee, remained stranded in the role of a never-ending sidekick. The action is the best average, with a little nudity and yes Tia Carrera is using a double! <br /> <br /> This structure is the usual monster police who have to compress in a new business in a great deal of work, at least trying to give the formula Lundgren to the police with the East values ​​and Lee's modern city slicker but virtually, you have to convince the Lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for a great showdown, there is zero character development, making it funny. The sequence of action is encapsulated to show the glimpse of no particular martial arts figures and Lee (which would go perfectly to make The Crow). But, as the famous room gave, he was under a very hurtful hell and he did a very good job that he did not live up to his father taking a very different role in showing that he could be a giant actor. <br /> <br /> /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> 3/10
