People do not believe that this garbage pile is thinking ridiculously. Fingering with the words "There is something about Mary" between the loss, hate, and dullness creates very little reason to stay up until the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very nice, but it will not be enough to keep a movie. <br /> <br /> Stiller is working hard to deal with this field, and it is clear that he is very talented, but the film is weak. <br /> <br /> Once, none of the scenes was incredible. Shooting was bad and timely. Farreley brothers should avoid any kind of movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> bonus I once smiled. In my opinion, I am not as a humor or a single immunity. My wife also hated me. The next day, we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughs at ourselves foolishly. This movie just stunk.
