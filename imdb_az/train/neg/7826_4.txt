Special effects? Well, good. <br /> <br /> Do you have a script? Terrible. No solution. No depth. No sense. This film showed Superman as a trivial hero, no hero of any archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. <br /> Of course, the actors were good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was a good choice amongst others. <br /> <br /> It does not solve the problem as long as this film does not have any depth. I did not see anyone going to have anything more important than this movie, SÃ¼derman was on the agenda and created everyday to be a heroic hero in the minds of people, not just in novels. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Lex Luthor could have been a global corporation, political domination, totalitarianism, or whatever. and. <br /> And Superman? Why did he stop in this movie? <br /> <br /> If you see him, wait until he comes to the dollar theater.
