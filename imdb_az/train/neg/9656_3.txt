This film has caused sadness all over the TV. Although this has started with great-looking gangs and great intentions with original props and suits. The film was suddenly turned into a frantic nostalgic dialogue, and the TV operated melodramatic sympathy. The heroes were so happy that sometimes I thought that they wanted to get into a quagmire of bare water, and as moving soldiers seem to just stand around and shoot each other. The Germans were described in such a non-realistic manner that it was painful to watch. The only thing German officers talk about was how good the Americans were. Take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this is a shit. Nevertheless, this DVD has a great extra feature that covers WWI frontline letters, so this rental is not a total waste of my time.
