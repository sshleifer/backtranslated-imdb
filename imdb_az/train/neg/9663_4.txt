How do the writers go crazy and look like that? I can be an American citizen, but there is no need to see other Americans thrown over one and a half hours to use a movie. Very few people were really surprised at how the dialogue on cinqoists, emotions and dialogue in this movie really is. The history of the movie is not as general and offensive as it is in the "U-571" (British submarines change to the Americans), but you still feel a little subtle. Indeed, in this film, the Germans amaze Americans in battlefields! How sad, unnecessary! I'm just telling the writers that it's clear that many of us can not capture real people with real problems under real pressure, and some well-tested shortcuts. Your chances will be for you to be a nationalist nutjobs for a sugar-covered ride.
