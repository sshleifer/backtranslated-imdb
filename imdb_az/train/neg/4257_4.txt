"Dracula II: Uprising" is a story of a group of nurses entering Dracula's corpse. Dracula II: Promotion is a very entertaining horror film that has few flaws, as it's a suggestion that a secret stranger looks and loses $ 30 million in bodybuilding products and auctioned for students. The symbols are of one size and the player is quite average. There's actually some nice effect on a really cool double decapitation scene, but there's not enough violence for my favorit. The film is quickly digging and unforgettable, and there is absolutely no suspense. If you want, the contemporary vampire screams give a look. atmospheric vampire coolers can be called as "Blood Flows", "Dracula Brothers" or "Lemora: A Child's Witch" in the early 60s and 70s.
