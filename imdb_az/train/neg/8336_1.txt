How was Hell obtained? Misbegotten "$", which presents itself as a comic comedy, essentially shouts the human trafficking fragments for two hours. Generally trustworthy Warren Beatty appears drunk and is functioning as Goldie Hawn depressants. Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - is more strange than his character here. <br /> Do I compare this movie with "Outsourcing 9 Plan"? Even if someone is paying me, I will not do that. "P9FOS" was mentally prepared, but it ended up sad; it has become foolish and has caused your brain to feel just melting away from your ears. When Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn played for them in "Shampoo", they did it, but then they played with Horika & Country. Perhaps movies should not always be a co-star. In general, I would rather tear my skin more than once. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Jackie Chan needs to rebuild. Then I'll pay for it.
