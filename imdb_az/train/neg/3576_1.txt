Although I was seeing this movie in a youth, I was wondering how surprised Pia Zadoran played a role in a film about an artist who showed the way to the top. Ms. Like Zadora, she was unable to keep up with this sad donkey in the film, just as it was beautiful and sexy. Even the photos of the Penthouse, "The Lonely Lady", were "kept back in the daytime." The only thing that can save this movie? An entirely different script. Give it a miss.
