This should be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I was really looking for a bad movie, but I do not believe or believe it. This story is traditionally included in all stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Dialog is so badly written that other semi-actors really laugh when you try to play it. The picture is not very good, the music is so bad that it actually frustrated me, the actors did not even work, but the script could expect more than 30 years and it was impossible. scenes are actually driven by the "movement" itself. <br /> <br /> Do not understand why such bad movies are continuing and who's financed? Where is the scan? <br /> <br /> This movie has one million Hollywood films, but there is nothing like that without going to the theater, but even looking straight Videos <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong>
