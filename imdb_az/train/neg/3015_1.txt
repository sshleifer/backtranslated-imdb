This is a bad movie. None of the necessities are bad. This is bad. It was really painful to look. The direction around the direction was horrible, which caused the appearance of the green and yellow colors used throughout the film to appear ill. Keira Knightly was not as convincing as a chick, and I do not believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke have signed for this sexual celluloid offense. The script was scary and was like a nail to the player's paper. If you have not seen it, do not do it. One thing is missing and you just spend two hours of your life watching this drive .I saw bad movies and even enjoyed it due to their flaws. It just takes time.
