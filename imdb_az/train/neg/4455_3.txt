What to start? Okay, do not compare this movie to a club that fights for a start - ridiculous. Even if there was a patch in the fighting club, violence, blood, gore and more would be more clear and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory - more realistic (and Danny Dyer seems to be ashamed of Nicholas Nickelby). Perhaps fair enough, the story is worthy of a lot and the fighting scenes are good choreography - with a good result that they can add. But the film is generally poor, very bad. People have noted that the habits should not spoil a movie - or a simple cast error, or a lack of effort in exercising sound, is an event that irritates the film / Geordie. Do not buy me a bad, good-looking guy who looks nice on a skin - but it's not a football hooligan. I can go on forever for how funny the football field is - the "fake steward" situation. Also, when GSE is playing north in the United States, only three are going to a train waiting for it - they do not make any sense - the gangsters and thugs described in the movie, about 5 people in the mouse religion. From the point of view of truth, did West Ham and Milwall play together in the championship for the last few years? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure "drowning" can only make a waltz of a Milwall firm. Basically, it's a very bad movie, where people know little about real football and hooliganism. If you really love soccer and you are interested in the hooliganism of hellfire, you will feel as if this film is insulting your intelligence. Ross George
