Steven Seagal, Mr. Personality, was promised to pardon the soldiers of the United States's largest Secret Pilot this time (.. then tried to steal the memory of a fleeing film, cut off a robbery network at a Kazakh station), thanks to an American treachery Air Force succeeds in launching a terrorist base in northern Afghanistan, controlled by a group called Black Bazaar, a secret warrior. Along with a surprising pilot, Jannick (Mark Bazeley), John Sands (Seagal), Arabian lover Jessica (Ciera Payton) and freedom fighter Rojar (Alki David) were there. Jannick was kidnapped by black market leaders, Stone (Vincenzo Nicoli) and his fianc√©e Eliana (Katie Jones), and the only surviving survivors were Sandy who could not regain command of the secret warriors kidnapped only. And, maybe, the Sands can take revenge on the treacherous trail, in the Steve Toussaint process. There is a ghost of 72 hours in the sand until the Navy bombs all the region. <br /> <br /> An eight-month biological bomber is equipped with a bomb. <br /> <br /> Seagal gives a chance to strike Afghans with a knife without breaking their throats. The film is mainly fired from machine guns and dead are corpses. Afghanistan's admission is not subject to inspection (neither Seagal nor the trade union area can easily move into an area not easily discovered) and the area itself is nothing to write home about. The film is quickly adjusted, the camera is a little invincible. Seagal, as always, is not active as a hero and has been staged in a difficult period when he sees his enemies take away from his good scenes. It is one of the poorest of Seagal's efforts, and it is always understood as (not a compliment). The more disappointment is, in fact, Seagal will never fight to fight the film's chief striker. He does not even even throw a wrist or break a visible neck in any apparent way (.. sure we see some of the tools thrown around, but the film makers make rapid changes and approximation closer).
