It is an experimental and rare experiment as a truck driver traveling to a striped bar in a short series (a two-dimensional season). When I beat Lynch and all the little malware on TV, I'm not sure what they mean by "ground" or "original". How accurate are the criteria for the army? It is, of course, original in comparison to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues". Indeed. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say the show has been abolished because many viewers are not smart enough to be open enough for the show's "strangeness". "The alleged wild inventive or anything, as an admirer of strangers, I have to make these wrong ideas, there is nothing to do with TP - it's just about every corner (or whatever) rounded ropes in every corner, browsing around is simply a very invisible, very clever form ... The strange oddity is always forced, and heroes do not behave strangely as they are half-pre-treated in Idiotics ... <br /> <br / > I'm a drowsy dream in My Dream, I'm a dream-scene clich√©, Lynch, in my dream, "I'm in Oblivion", criticized for the dwarf director's (Buscemi) exhausting old use. "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact it's not strange, you are looking for a unique TV show, see "Detention." A strange look Felini and Leone are suggesting that TP resembles a multitude of television crime drama similar to the fashion models of all young people. Casting gives a TP plastic look. Kens & Barbies masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP manufacturers said it was looking for "unique faces" for the Lynchin series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn? Like hunting, made from men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not take me wrong; especially if you like beautiful things like Fenn (Madonna 1000 times fine) it's not wrong to get an attractive cast with beautiful charm, but do not go around saying that you've created a strange show with strange people. "And I never miss Lynch's mistake I did not understand with Kyle MacLachlan (I have to get a medal to worry about writing his name), but it was not a difficult, but a little soft and polished looking charisma, and the ridiculous "eccentric" of her character was not so exciting to try to force Lynch's strange One of them was trying to live up to his reputation - he had completely lost his edge, but at that time everything that Lynch wrote in "Elephant Man" was relatively small compared to the first two movies, and Lynch was a relatively small, but fanatically supportive fan base, it meaning that they were trying to keep it in the public eye, giving meaningful stories to stories that did not contain any water during the closer examination. In other words, Lynch is the intellectual-wannabe's lover. <br /> <br /> Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? It was obsessed by Satan or this nonsense. It's best to come up with this 'great mind' ... The B-movie has horror films that are even more original. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ strong>
