I do not normally write an on-line comment, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Along with being drawn just like a soap series ("Young and unpleasant" really shot by professional professionals), it's also very small. There is no movement. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> So, (after drowning) they are here: boy puts a knife on his throat and says something like "Now you die." Then the main character says, "If you killed me, I told the police that I was threatening." So, the murderer boy goes to cry: "No ... the cops are following me!" "Oh, my God." <br /> <br /> Remember that only one example. I do not believe this movie really exists. So if you want to see no WORST movie ... please go, I recommend it :)
