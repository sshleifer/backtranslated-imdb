Yes, Madse's character - talking to a woman from a TV station - right: LAPD is corruption, violence and racist police. And this movie does not change anything about it. Okay, there are good cops, morals, and even a black, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale. That's not true. The most important thing for fans of action: It's very simple to get out of the wilderness. Only shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. If you play Counter Strike, then you will have at least something. The only morale of this film is: LAPD is now good. No worse than cops. Follow this movie if you like genuine, euphemistic ads for police and military service. This is the longest trade I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
