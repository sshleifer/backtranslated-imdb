London Underground, with long-running tunnels, deep and deep undercover escalators, and, of course, have a heartwarming experience with rats traveling through traces of rats. It is a source of miracle that is not often used in horror films. In the 1970s, a bloody tribal band living in a terrible tunnel called Deathline aka Raw Meat and the sequence of follow-up in the American Werewolf in London. <br /> <br /> I thought that the movie started well with an extremely effective credit sequence because we tried to give the atmosphere of the tube day and night. it was really worried, followed by a scene in the sewer, which was building a premise which was something worse down the streets of London. But Creep went downstairs and I wanted myself to leave her after the opening scene, and she made the movie a favorable impression. Not all the heroes, even Potente itself, are in a non-sympathetic and difficult situation, and the director needed to hit us with a public comment on homelessness. he made a mistake of not showing the "monster" in full lightness, where he was afraid of being afraid and revealed Craig as his name. How can you be a monster called Craig? X Files turns into something of a kind and remembers one of the episodes of the episode. In fact, I will give Mulder and Scully's wishes and make them all for me. <br /> <br /> When it comes to sexual harassment, it is very timely, uncomfortable, and absolutely unnecessary. Unfortunately, there is not much to do with any internal value, but to shock spectators. The horror is that it is a terrible and terrible thing that actually touches the other mistakes that are wrong, as if half of the movie is. <br /> The only payout feature for me was Ken Campbell, one of my favorite actors when I was a favorite. You do not often see it, but when it comes to the screen it moves in the corner of everyone. To beat him as a sewer inspector is a great surprise, unfortunately, there is only one thing in the film.
