Volunteering Herbie as a man, now run by a young woman Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) who is thinking of becoming a NASCAR champion. <br /> <br /> The only thing standing in his way is the current championship, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) will do everything to stop them. <br /> <br /> Original love bug is not good. As a child, I do not remember much to love. There were still some hopes for the continuation. I want to say that casting is very good and makes the novel look like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is better than before. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is a kid's movie, but it could make the film a bit more interesting. . It was very laugh and it was drilling near the end. The majority of players appeared dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was as good as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like Freaky Friday and Middle Girls. Matt Dillon gave everyone the best performance. He was very good as a bad man, although he did not have much to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and do nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela is leading Robinson and does a good job. Trying to keep the film interesting, but with a weak article. Have you ever written a script for Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant, and would you be surprised they were responsible for taxi and cleaning? These two films really did not succeed in making the stories interesting or unpleasant. This is not their fault, they hope they will work harder for the next time. Finally, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth watching when you're a kid. Everyone is better off jumping. Rating 4/10
