I saw this movie late in the night. It was interesting at first, but it did not convince me all. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually, I did not like boxing. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I felt that the film was starting to feel good. Players are good, especially George C Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable Flick is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are very important to me. <br /> <br /> As the film draws, I feel it's a little charm. I was able to be excited, but the last hour was not good enough.
