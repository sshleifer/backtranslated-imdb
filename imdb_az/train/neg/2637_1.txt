Seriously, I do not even know where to start. Someone gave an autistic third-class student a $ 1 billion budget and said, "make a movie about the secret service." Editing is ridiculous, cinematography was the best casual, every syllable dialogue was completely flawed and directive ... well, is there a director there? <br /> <br /> Here everything was meaningless, naked and meaningless ... and it was casual and naked. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is the most delicate thing you ever saw. <br /> <br /> But if you love this piece, you will enjoy it; Decompositions, dark blue and partial frontal lobotomy.
