Ziab la singlet al-lahem is a horrible film. This means the overlapping of scenes is not just an open link. Despite being a good player like Ezzat El Allayli, it is very bad. But there is really something in this film: sexuality, women's freedom, fairy tale scenes are rare in Arabian cinema, even in these days. I congratulate the director and actors for their courage. We want to see that this style is more in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons for making this film sound like a terrible voice are not just scenarios and movements, but lack of princely. This movie looks like an amateur. We see a lot of mistakes on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie, do not consult with Ziab la singular. But if you want to promote uncensored films in the entire Arab world, try to do the same with your friends and family.
