It's some digestive film. On the one hand, we are offered a tough arc, not just the Catholic Church, but also a foolish and ignorant story. Orthodoxy story on orthopoxine is presented on an inner layer and what happens when people follow a belief that they can not understand from blindness? <br /> <br /> At first glance, it's a comedy. If so, Mr Duran needs to open a vocabulary so that he can not clearly understand the meaning of the word. These jokes are frigid; humor disturbed and weakly delivered. Specifically, Ms. Keaton's performance is at a very low level than Annie Hall and Sleeper's days. Jennifer Tilly is a predominant model with a noisy and noisy style. If it were not for the last 20 minutes of this movie, it was a controversial game in 1981 that could be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Careful, spoiler ahead <br /> <br /> All this begins with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, meanwhile, is a man's name and only one, therefore, will not accept it after the promise in any condition) to show just how tireless research it is for the beginner.) When all confess they do not comply with church teachings, their brother must be mathematical and exploit the audience. I believe he's back when he's in Cornish, lots of slicing sounds in a sepia tone. If one of them agrees to have two abortions, the student's insult is even more insulting. As soon as she leaves, her students are likely to be killed in self-defense. He continues in a scream of killing his gay old student for his sins. The last stroke is a disciple who is dead in Christ. Can you say "heavy-handed"? <br /> <br /> I know that there are nuns hating in the past, and as a result, many people are hitting emotions, but these footage is almost a movie accident on this train in almost every other shot. I have heard from the writer and the director that there is a film about this hysteria and why he should not adhere to these principles, nor do he mean religiousness. This explanation has probably not given us an authoritative idea, which in no way or in any other way is biased against Catholic belief. <br /> <br /> This film is just an anti-Catholic strike that hates and hates the name of justice and equality. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to a Catholic, that is, the realities of the cynicism and ignorance that he or she faces today. If "Rabbi Ray told all these things" or "Imam Muhammad explains all this", it would attack the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscriptions. But, unfortunately, this is a film that is opposed to the majority, so it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same cunning point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am not ignorant, 1.5 stars were not bad, but bad, badly directed and generally a bad movie. Do not even waste your time.
