I first saw this movie in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were created by the Censorship Committee. But then, in 2000, I followed it exactly in Poland. And what? The area is quite foolish - 2 people get rid of genetic catastrophes and find themselves on a planet full of feminists with strong, straight and basic heavy ladies. People now try to fight, and then all sounds of extremely silly clich√©s are feminists (you can agree with them, but there are no mistakes, of course, sex drive, sex sexual desire, and full fools). ), and so on. The miracle work of Jerzy Stuhr is also a tree and strange evil - he draws unjust faces and repeats: "I was in the elevator with a naked chick and did not do anything to him!" It was supposed to be a comedy, instead it turned out to be a vapid fancy with predictable jokes and the waists below. Do not waste your time - it's just bad.
