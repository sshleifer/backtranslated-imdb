As others have noted, this should be a perfect Hammer-style movie, and I think most actors instructed him to play ... but the scenarios are very powerful, with poor temples, and very boring soliloquies (along with most of the bad Timothy Dalton) overlap and its important. This is a weak performance from Dalton, though he is gently Dr. The rock finally crashes the scene where he understands his work. The only actor who is really good is Patrick Stewart, the most beautiful of them. Freddie Francis could be a great cinematographer, but he was a bad teacher.
