This movie was an exciting hour in two and four quarters. <br /> <br /> Someone told me what? <br /> <br /> So, I understand the history. The bushwhackers on the Missouri-Kansas border should be about a ragtag group, taking revenge against the North sympathizers and abolitionists during the US Civil War. But in addition to unequal violence, this film did not really have a lot. Perhaps this was a political statement? Is not this war more than just groundless violence? That point was pretty good, but I do not think it was a point. I think manufacturers think that they really have a valuable movie here, but when I was disturbed it was a lack of any space. <br /> <br /> It looked as if I watched a documentary novel appearing as a symbol of the film's coverage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
