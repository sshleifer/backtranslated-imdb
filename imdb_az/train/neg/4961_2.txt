The area is not so large and it is even more barrier to the above mentioned calmness. The accents are British at any time. Many of these nations were Denmark. Okay, okay, the emphasis is not so important. But it's language. I do not think they use words like "yeah" and "ok" on Beowulf's day. And the cool weapon that his king had promised him? Did he download anything again? Did not he ever see? Or Beowulf, was this a bad goal? Well, the goal was to match the computer graphics used to create at least monsters. They were many. Bad special effects. Bright place? Only one I think. Marina Sirtis has been good for years.
