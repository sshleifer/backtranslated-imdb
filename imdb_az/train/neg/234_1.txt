This film was biased, impartial and subtle. It was a very hearty look of women. Because I am a comedy (it stretches), because rent and coverage is that Andie McDowell acts in a storm. It was not. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with two boys, and we asked for an hour later, telling him how bad he was. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THE MAIN DISTINCTION SPECIAL! RAMPAN ADMINISTRATION! <br /> <br /> An old woman holding a small man begins with a hackneyed area of ​​a violent agreement between two jealous girlfriends. They want to marry her boyfriend, a boy who has won her age. But she is very happy with a very neat shark that you have the ability to insert it and she is sure enough that she decides to marry the boy. But an angry girlfriend, with the help of a diphthard, thinks that the man is deceiving, preparing a structure to deceive our heroine. It works. There is a fight with him, he runs away from home and crushes with a truck (remember the name of the movie). Now he's dead, two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although our hero is a school principal watching over girls, she has forgotten to use her birth and she forgot that she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> He has already broken relations with his daughters because they were inconvenient. She's just and sad, she decides to marry a drunken boy. Did I mention that an awesome guy who loves him is a minister? She asked her to marry a young boy (nice, yeah?) But now she says she wants to get married, and it seems that she does not object to rushing around. But her girlfriends rescued her on the altar and took her home where they acknowledged that they were responsible for the love of her life. There is a kid. On the final stage, they put in a child inside the house, come in, smoke, and smoke. I do not know, it's bad. I leave the part about the moment of cancer red sweater and harpy's ridiculous flavor.
