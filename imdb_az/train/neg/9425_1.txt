Who made this movie? Or was the release of a DVD with only thirty-second gaps between scenes? Okay, though, for the first time I fell asleep. Then I slept for the second time, and for the third time I slept. The field is not the worst I have ever seen, but it's close. Imagine that it was not the worst I've ever seen ... but it's close. Production .... well, I honestly say it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Please, I'm a scary movie or I do not think I'm enjoying this movie. I just laughed at the movie, laughing with it. Terrible moments were very poor, but even better budget could be done. <br /> <br /> Characters seemed to be incorrectly developed or, despite each other, the end of the bend was pretty bad and the exposure remained eternal. <br /> <br /> It is recommended to avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
