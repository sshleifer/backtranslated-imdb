Whatever you expect when you do not have a script you have started, there is nothing that can work with the director. Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they do not react to something or anything to say. The earthquake was so vulnerable. I do not know how close the film is with the novel, but two of them show that the Jewish girl has not come out of the world, but that Arturo is a beautiful, warm heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. And even Camilla leaves outdoors, instead of bringing LA to a beautiful Catholic cemetery, instead of bringing flowers at least once. Disappointing. And the L.A sets are ridiculously created graphically. Is there anything good? The apartment window was real, curtains, sounds and wind felt. And Donaldson is always great. No matter what the body is from the driver or the night of the deceased.
