Now we can see why Robin Hood was quickly thrown out. The first episode of this is the worst thing the BBC has ever published. The opening scenes were intense, meaningful, and intelligent, as Robin Hood did not have any character with two models and the sword fight was just laughable. The main part of the episode was Robin Hood. In the beginning of the episode, several cows were made in makeup - how many people used to wear eyelashes in the 12th century? No one. The series could have improved dramatically since then, but this first episode quickly diminished the hopes of the people and was essentially a cr * p pile. <br /> <br /> A great hero of the British was disgraced. <br /> <br /> "Will you give me that?" I do not know if the BBC understands what a profitable investment is, I'm not sure. 3/10
