(NOTE: I only wrote what I did below, but I thought others agreed here.) Yes, it was quite clear - this cat was overtaking the cat. they wrote :) <br /> <br /> The owners left for two weeks on vacation - going to California - locked Sylvester alone at home. That is, it does not mean no milk, but the cat finds a relaxing taste of canned tuna. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The mouse in the house was put out. This is an average rodent that slanders Sylvester and yanking in the last second. Sylvester tries to do everything possible to break his tuna, but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why the sadistic mouse is "good man". Tom and Jerry are similar to one of the animated films, though poor Tom always gets the worst, although many times the little mouse starts to quarrel!
