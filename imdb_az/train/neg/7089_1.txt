A sexually-minded chef dwells in a dual life: one is a "happy" woman, a ten year old child, and the latter as a sexual talent. A large part of the documentary goes on for five consecutive days and speaks with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listens to her story and cleverly investigates. Nastassian's role is very limited, and he is the only great adult that does not take his clothes off. If it were, he would have given me a great "F" rating. That is, the ratio to F + does, however, indicate that it still fails if it does not want to be bored. It is more interesting to spend ninety minutes to clear the garage. The "Sex Sentinel Day" fell into the category of movies he once saw, and none of them happened.
