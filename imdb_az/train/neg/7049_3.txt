The worst thing to do without a wave is a film about surfers without waves. <br /> <br /> This film will be a great disappointment for those who love surfing. Because it fights for a total of 3 minutes surfing. <br /> <br /> The story is a slice of unwanted watch surfers. perfect wave, but for no wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer who flirt with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). As he finds the happiness that he has grown up with his beloved wife, three old surfers come to him and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves in the Bone Horde. Unhappiness, until the end of the film is a wave, so most of the story leaves the sequel to the self-destructing beach events. <br /> <br /> Acting is mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comedy moments, but mainly his player was secular. Evan McGregor, of course, was engaged in conscientious objection to the most intriguing and surprising character of the narcotic substance. Perhaps the funniest performance transformed Peter Gunn into Terri, making his corpulent corpse a permanent image bar. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but there was not enough meat for her character to show more mobility. <br /> <br /> There is not much here to really comment. I appreciated it at level 3/10. It's a real beach bummer.
