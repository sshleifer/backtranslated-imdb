With the love of the city, I tried to see this movie as a resident of Kalamazu. However, what a disappointment! <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and husbands. children. I do not believe how regressive it is for women. The writer lived under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I'm glad to see my favorite city on the big screen, I will not give it to anyone. This is horror. It is ashamed of the city called it.
