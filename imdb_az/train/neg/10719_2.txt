I'm telling you exactly, but if it were not for Netflix, it would not even be in my house. The excentric president of Steve Martin, a chain of health food stores, falls flat. It's not just funny. The SNL has long denied that another SNL can find a job that conquered them. Birthing Coach with Elmer Fudd lisp is about funny as the original. Amy Poehler just goes through the same moves for a 7-minute SNL sketch just like the SNL in recent days. The only thing that goes to this movie is that Tina Fey's eyes are easy. When he heard that his character was not pregnant, the latter was predicted. The theme may have been opened to other comedy attempts, but it seems as if it's frowning, not laughable and entertaining.
