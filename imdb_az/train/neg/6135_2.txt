America needs the best possible person to win the game. Kurt Thomas has a gymnast (Oh brother), a Ninjas, a crazies village, and Richard Wolfe's ability to win a game in which Thomas says "to keep his fleet in his pants." (His exact words) I missed it in theaters, and that's a good reason, because I would probably be thrown out of laughter that I regularly interrupted. The first thing I think about is that the ninjas are so naked when a gymnast can open his ass. Kurt Thomas is just like 5 feet and he is hitting hard like "the best guy for the job." When it comes to the capabilities of Wolfgang Thomas, it's good that you can not say a good thing ... how much cocaine was used to fool a thought. Tara Reid's decision to cast just like a scientist is at the top of the calm here. For 18 years, this was the name of the most horrific film I ever saw. I do not know if I could not find this unwatchable, I was laughing, almost drowned. Twice. Only in the 1980s was a movie with such a bad idea. Even though no hero for the record is the only film showing such a disaster, he can not even pull a sword out of the ground. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
