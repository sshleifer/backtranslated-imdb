<br /> <br /> This is a classic stinker, which is a big name, basically it is the elderly who are above and above the best to sleep. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, this is a pretty stunning movie. <br /> <br /> Gwen Vernon has still shown that she can dance. Very bad film was not more concentrated. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I just hope that this movie is not promoted by adults to mass suicide at the level of Jim Jones. <br /> Why Don Ameche won the Oscars for this stupidity? <br /> <br /> If the elders behave like this, then why is it a wonderful thing to encourage the young man to leave the boat? Why Steve Guttenberg threw the ship? After all, she found the lover's love. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie if adults can only find a fountain of young people on earth. Unfortunately, except Wilford Brimley, in this article, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and lord know who else is going. The writers accepted the scenario and placed it in this group.
