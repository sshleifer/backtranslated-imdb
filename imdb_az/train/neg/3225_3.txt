Kids love dinosaurs. This is part of their culture. But they have land earlier. Original. At least this movie was in his heart. That's it. This movie is simply sad. As children love dinosaurs, you can only point out any old story to one another. There is no structure in this movie, all premises are foolish and numbers are much higher. Theodore Rex does not form the soul, but depends on the pre-dawn land.
