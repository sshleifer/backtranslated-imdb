Days before Toxic Avenger, the camp kings at Troma Films tried to get a high (OK, less-less-down) road that produced smooth slasher pics. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is a movie for spectators. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is a movie for spectators. It is painful to really watch, thanks to two different numbers and countless senseless underground passages. <br /> <br /> After learning that a dangerous psychopathy escapes from a local hospital, the move goes to a Catholic university (I do not remember its name, but I am honored), it's St Splatter. The students are empty and shouting and facing each other. However, the new professor, Julie Parker, has proved to be totally un-authorized in his work. Children help them to avoid relationships, indecency, unwanted pregnancy, hate priests, and no-thing in the classroom; Julie is a creepy lover, his unusual leadership in St Splatter, counseling unwed moms, and his empty, idle appearance of his students. Nothing is a narrow thing, or it is not solved in any meaningful way. Oh, and every time you hit a POV shot for a while and one of the girls die, but wait for it to breathe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are Red Quarter Killers and then there is a sad anticlimactic conflict with Real Killer, then back shelter and roll there are loans. <br /> <br /> Simple speed and a large number of believable subplots are a frustration in the viewer, which can be dramatically corrupted, fostering the quality of coffee and helping the dialog box that does not give just one meaning. One of the most damaging of this film is the murder of women. Men in this movie are worthy only. I earned good money to look for a pregnant girlfriend or lunthead Lothario who was cheating around a girlfriend's roommate or creepy priest. There is no justice.
