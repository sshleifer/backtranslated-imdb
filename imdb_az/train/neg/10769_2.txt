I was sitting at home and saw it squeezed. How can people do it? It's not just a good pay-per-view movie, because it's just not working on this level (I think). Weak area, bad dialogue, horrible movement; There is only one thing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to do with it, Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech is just scared. Field development (especially between Ashley and Byron) does not make any sense. The writers have done so, as they want to go a certain way and actually write unnecessary bits. It's just an hour and a half, but you'll never be back in 90 minutes of your life.
