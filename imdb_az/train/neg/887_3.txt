Following the success of Paris, Je T'Aime, a group of directors decided to come together and make a similar anthology-style film in New York. Unlike the original film, stories in this movie come from time to time and can be very quick - when you think of a story, it's over in many cases. And often start and stop and then restarts - the stories are woven together. Unfortunately, "Paris, Je T'Aime" was shot or hit (mostly), most missed "New York, I Love You". Stories were more intriguing in nature than at the same time very little sweet and often extremely terrible. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting movie with only a few exceptional stories, and perhaps even more frequent music. Now that we understand that it was a good music, but it sounded as though it sounded really cut off my wrists! Among the better ones, a girl in a wheelchair talked about a girl throwing a girl out of a restaurant (even though she was in the first movie) and talking about a slavery old couple. All this is very sad, because I loved the first movie and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not really a complaint, but I was surprised by how many people smoke in the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, if you access the DVD, there are two sections, such as extras that are not included in the movie. One is to eat a hotdog from Kevin Bacon (wearing a cold fedor) .... and it's almost not nearly ten minutes away. On the other hand, a film that has been filming the world includes a young couple - a very happy couple.
