The worst movie I've ever seen is Ben and Arthur. Indeed, it is necessary to check the fulfillment of this film. The statistics for this movie have been violated by some of the people involved in the index, with a relentless and unscrupulous push, and evidence is enough to go online. <br /> <br /> "The people I and Arthur had created were honored enough to stand on their healing feet, but they would not have been a dishonest promotion, but as if they were me" <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie is scary, script, story, casting, actress, direction, photography, editing, music ... What happens to the movie? Whatever it is, it's as bad as here. If it were not to be unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is a very good idea, nor is the low budget meant bad for a movie. My favorite example is an all-budget budget show, Gus Van Sant's beautiful Mala Noche, but there are many. The director of the Sideline Secrets Cut or not the original is bad, because people who do it have no money, but there is no real talent and no talent except for their self-promotion.
