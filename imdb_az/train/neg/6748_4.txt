Watching after Sow and Bleed followed by watching this video, let me tell you, I've never looked at the biggest horror flick, though I just thought it was pretty good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is that women see nail lamps. Gore has done a lot of fake looks and much work. It has funny parts, but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay in to see the terrible end. If I needed it, I would forbid players and actresses, only one reason was Debbie Rochon's (Maddy) more than a hundred videos and at the same time two other members of the same or worse movie. They should not allow this madness to continue.
