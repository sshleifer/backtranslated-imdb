As a long-time fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found this ghosting episode and the liberal use of "flashbacks" that reflected Will Riker's exploits, positive (and very romantic) and negative (very painful, and the death of a crew) most of the "glass shows" were the money-savings equipment (like all episodes in the enterprise). Diana Muldaur (also appeared at least twice in the original series) was awarded a better final appearance for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal followers (whether Star Trek is somewhere in the world) was shortened. This was the last episode of the second season; So the season ended with "not a bang", but with "screaming".
