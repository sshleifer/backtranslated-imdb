Russell Hopton performed in many films until his death in 1945. Only 2 managed and "Black Gold" was one (since 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had a corrosive screen presence, but he was a good kid. It was undoubtedly very popular in the "quickie" era - many films. <br /> <br /> This is the son of an old oil force, who is convinced that he will soon shoot oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man that he has the oil to be shot at every moment. A geologist Henry goes to the scene and "Fishtail's" helps his father. She also conveys "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry looked at Cynthia, a wonderful teacher. It was the latest film by Gloria Shea - she began her career as Olive Shea in the "Honor of the American Girl" (1929). The father of "Fishtail's" was killed when the device was sabotaged and decided to bring Henry Anderson and cronies to justice. When Henry was abducted, Anderson tried to convince Fishtail to sell the oil lease. <br /> <br /> Good for a rainy day. <br /> <br /> Everything goes flying in the rain and going to the "Fishtail" Military School is good.
