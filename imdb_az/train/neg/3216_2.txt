Charming. It's strange. Original. Surreal. Butterfly wings? All of these words can best be described, and some may ask, "Happenstance," but some of them are more likely to jump to the American train, saying "Butterfly Effect." It is strange that I would be one of the screams for this fantastic Kutcher movie because none of the words I mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph reflect the Tautou characteristic that I have witnessed. Of course, we all liked him at Amelie and thought he was the daughter of Jesus in the Da Vinci Code, but for the first time in this film director (at least one feature film) Laurent Firod Tautou does not give a glimpse. Unfortunately, it does not give anyone the opportunity to really show himself, because he is sensitive to only the "chance luck" to bring the film to anything, but only a glow (a real boiling point). Pharaoh has a width, and I use a "little" word as a little bit of a fantasy story, love and chance that can actually build a fairy tale, but instead, it has become a mud at first <br /> <br /> Tautou 's beautiful face adorns the lid of this box, but I do not accept it as it did not. It assumed that Tautou would have another worship journey to the French cinema. Tautou in this movie did not make a mistake but could argue that someone is not in the story. The work of Pharaoh is ultimately to create a series of random events that will end up with the sense of refreshing "melodrama", which will end the spectator-friendly (though confusing). Completely completely unsuccessful. Firod failed to give us a large number of characters in the audience. With so many characters, it gives us so many casual interventions and ultimately, who's who it is, what it is, how it is, and how it will be; Your focus is on just ending loans and the timing of their arrival. Tautou could have saved this film from disaster if Firod would only give it to the center. Excellent, he did not, but apparently a group attempted to force 12 through a theoretical film hole about a single penny size. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Speaking about the events of "Firod", he "actually forgets the focus of his attention." For Happenstance there is no focus center, but first she has shared the same birthday and trying to create one with two main characters, revealing that the star horoscope is a love story, but we will never go back in the movie. symbols, stuffless scenes, and the imprinted drivel we have been selected to direct us to a real story and a world full of "ifs, ands and butes." I could not believe it. man) uses a primitive technique to feel that I must finish immediately, indeed, it is true that many of our people have come from the true truth (or science) but he would have to assume that he would not be able to do so, because he had his hand to fill in the appropriate forms with the help of homeless people, and I do not think it necessary to diminish his listeners on this subject. There were other elements that I had never done before (though I felt like a glowing Parisian collage of glossy paper), it was icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a credit for the credit. This is a difficult genre to succeed. Time travel movies are particularly tough, because they are never counted as possibilities, but Pharaoh is created because he is exploring various aspects. I would have been faced with saying that she would not do well, at least five full minutes of enjoyment. Where Firod directed this movie, he had a really diagrammatic story, but his last performance left him to split this movie. If Firod strengthened his film, he could have saved his movie. When I get these two simple directions, the overall mood of this movie will change. <br /> <br /> For the first time (and probably to the end), it was Tautou, for the first time (and probably the last one), it may be time for the production of this movie to show errors in his path to Firod, , the movie completely disappointed me. From the dream launch to the apathetic end I just felt that Happenstance was failing because of Fate's leadership and angry marketing. Marketing is something I have not mentioned before, but why is everyone considering this movie as Amelie 2 (a headline in Hong Kong) and you know why Tautou knows the square exactly? this film was never carried. I believe that this film was curled up from the first minute on DVD. I will applaud his subject, everything was better than the average level. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> Level: *****
