I actually tried to love this movie, but eventually I did not do anything for myself. I saw most of Kitamura and found it very varied. Alive has a fair structure like all its movies, some fairy-tale fans, and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are a short supply of Aliyin's pain. The area is all that original and can be prepared for a fairly ace film. Unfortunately, the pacing is slowly moving effortlessly and takes a century to go before the movie arrives at predictable locations. The action is just extremely tough, extremely advantageous in the final battle and about OK. Previously, it is restricted to extremely sensitive camera work, which leads to less compliance. There are some clear visual effects and some interesting ideas in the dialogue, but the film is still bad. Characters are well fleshed nor do good movement and setting, and the overall color scheme is drab and drill. The film is not entirely scary and has some sources of interest, perhaps using a fast forward button to improve it. It can be a pretty decent science fiction as it goes away from nearly twenty minutes of work. But the full length film is offensive. Only Kitumura fans are very neat and committed.
