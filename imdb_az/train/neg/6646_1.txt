The Romanian audience is still full of brave and uneducated people who love this kind of cheap and showtimes as superficially and cruel in the Garcea series or "Vacanta Mare" children's games. Mugur Mihäescu, Dore Octavian Dumitru and other sub-artists do not claim their show as "art". 40 years ago, Pintilie, a very good film ("Duminicä la ora sase"), and then enough nice ("Reconstituirea"), attempting to declare his film-lenghts "artistic works", but unfortunately the masters have a limited level in particular kinematographic expression. Thus, "Niki Ardelean" presents the "RESULT" sample again - it is due to its merit.
