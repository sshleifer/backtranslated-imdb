What happened to this stinkeroo! Shortly before his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - a great trembling as an actress, but very nice and pleasant (especially in movies such as Zorro Brand and Blood and Sand) I saw this monster, the memories of her golden days were quickly broken . The story is incredible and farcical, second-level, supporting player is impossible. I do not think anyone's more complicated performance compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray was the most boring man they could choose. In addition, it was terrifying photography (and I only touch the color!) Anyone concerned should be heartwarming when shown.
