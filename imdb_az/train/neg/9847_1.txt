Peter Sellers plays Dick Skratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship serving as captain after killing a previous murder. Although witnessing the burial of a treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he has acquired is empty. So you have to find someone who can communicate with Dick Ghosts (you place an advertisement for it) and help keep a treasure trove. It's very clever to think how anyone can put this foolish movie down. Former Goon Spike Milligan became Medak as a director, and when he gave his talents in Medak's Mature Class movie, you can probably guess what's in the directorship chair of Milligan, which is one of the smart, illuminated scenes. Peter Boyle gives a brief look like the pirate captain of the Resurrection in the first 10 minutes of the film. Perhaps the young Frankenstein's film is grateful for being released since it was filmed and preserved. Franciosa seems to be mixed like the real power behind Scratcher, but he and the Dealer seem pretty hopeless, even with Sellers' makeup and hair looking terribly scared. He had to know the bombardment as well as the shooting of this film. <br /> <br /> Pierre: I'll pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won 't. <br /> <br /> This is one of the good jokes. It is incredible for me that Sellers' productive product is still in vain, but it has existed in VHS already 15 years ago! What can one say about a program called "Fred's show", slamming up to the tiles and sold by the US television program Sellers, Milligan and by Richard Lester, a great Richard Lester?
