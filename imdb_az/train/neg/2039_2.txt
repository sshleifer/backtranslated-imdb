Sitting in this movie was almost unbearable. Although I was shot with a home video camera and although this movie was meant to span within a few weeks, the characters can not once change your outfit, but for the sake of me broke the fourth wall. I've seen you move better in the 4th class game. In addition, the plot is not realistic. If he suspects a man, he would turn him into self. I was very surprised at how all the killings were committed by guns. Zodiac was not killed by a single weapon but the authorities knew it was not. Another thing that disturbs me is that Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 is not the name of the disorder but the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental illness. Generally, I think this movie is not a low-level movie, or it can be made with low budget, as they can be sure to be better actors or more unhappy. Many people have gone down a low budget route using terrible actors Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and easily looking at the Easy Rider with a budget.
