Touched on a long film, the film finds ways to approach 90's. Here are all the beautiful things that make Hamer production a brand value, but Paris, drowning in fog, is a sign of indifference. The story is clear and can be summed up in many words, so there is nothing unexpected and you do not need more than 5% of your attention. <br /> <br /> In the scene, the actor is largely tough like the figures of the wax (okay Hamer feature, sometimes only shown in the whole package). My opinion is that this movie is not worth the evening I spent. The life of affection is a boring issue, and she knew children in Cinemath√®que programming well.
