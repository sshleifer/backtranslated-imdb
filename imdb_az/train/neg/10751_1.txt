Why did I spend my money on Sundance's last day? I would like to go back ... Can I get $ 16 back? While watching this movie I was expecting something to happen, nothing happened. What I did not even think about was the fact that I was reading the evidence that did not resemble the film. Why the director enriched them with the necessary windows and then reduced them? It was very artistic. Why did the director show his nails to Lulu fifteen minutes? When the actors try to talk, why sounds like they are reading? Or was the point? I felt like Phantom Love was no story and my friends felt like it was worth more fun than a vacation video as a vacation video to be honest.
