When you put this DVD into the player and hit the "game", you will see silence as soon as it is directed towards the correct starting point of the laser disk center and you will see the black screen. THIS Moment. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film you will have a great headache because certain Tylenol or something you have (preferably PM may fall asleep). <br /> <br /> I thought I would be in a good time with a very big breast girl and really an opening that caused me a little sting. Of course, the opening sequence was a lucky one, and most of the jokes were flat and this would be a Scream ripoff (my only giggle was Julie Strain's last comment on this scene). But then I knew that there was trouble ... there was an awesome rock song in the opening sequence. During this terrifying rock song, I watched the DVD titles and said, "BACK TO DEATH!" and "better SEX!" <br /> <br /> I knew what would happen to this movie's sales point. <br /> <br /> And it is sad reality: The only good thing about this movie is the charming castle. At the same time, the murder is a sad daily slasher film that attacks the club's "innovative" concept and is always a fake. So the whole movie is then confused in another direction and tries to find this great mystery, but all this is not just interesting and feels like it does not care for any of the characters. So, when the main character of the movie emerges to kill an innocent woman, can you really feel any sympathy when you are afraid of life? Scream effect is a ghost killer and some really scary jokes. We also treat abortion or some of the mainstream scenes that talk about something about the mother and father (Lloyd Kaufman, just another cool part of the movie). Uh. Yes ... This is a "bad-it-good" movie, not just BAD. <br /> Someone likened it to the Troma movie, but ... you know, it's not terrible that most movies come from Full Moon (or his movie, this movie is proving). It does not get horrific in terms of a Troma - I've seen many Troma movies and can say that everyone has something. But in this movie there is nothing so unpleasant. Careful.
