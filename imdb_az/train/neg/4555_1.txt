This film can not keep the secret and intrigue offered by the book. <br /> <br /> The book's key points, insights, and even a few tricks leave the audience curiously about what a great deal they have about themselves and why they are ready to endanger their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good. No background or personal development really cares about what is happening to the viewer and hence corrects the sequence of action. <br /> <br /> The manuscripts' searches end up steadily and without any real explanation, <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I've ever seen. Terrible and time-consuming. If you do not read the book, skip and read the movie. <br /> <br /> The shooting point of the film is the disrespect of the book, which is how weak and laughable it is. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Spend your time, READ THE BOOK!
