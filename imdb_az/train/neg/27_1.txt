Horrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are simply Filipino. The movie was bad. Why should I know that I have to expand. This is already the loss of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Difficult action and writing are only moronic. Everything is bad. A beautiful thing about the movie is the Sea of ​​Akkaya's breasts. It was even destroyed by this terrible and unnecessary aggression scene. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> First of all, I spend the time following this episode. Then I feel compelled to warn others. I just need to write a friggin about the movie just to create an account with IMDb, which I think is so bad. Completely unnecessary.
