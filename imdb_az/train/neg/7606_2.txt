Beverly Garland was born wrong. He was an early actress. She has gained strength and grace as she plays in Corman's films. He was the wife of Sheriff in Gunsinger. He is dismissed and takes his job to continue his murder. It is better than the material it works. The film is gray, stylted and basically boring. There is a humorous humor (straightforward to appear directly in front of) (and I hear lying faces, but it's ridiculous) that flies behind everybody's tracks on the wheels, and the new widow's really stupid line-up Sheriff, killing her he is in love with the boy he has worked for. Even if she did not like her husband, she was dead, only a week or two! In any case, he ended the boy's death. <br /> <br /> The first woman is a lounge owner. Though the railroad is passable and rich, a group plans to land. His action plan is pretty lame-she'll not steal as much as in town and skedaddle. Hell, against the whole city, just his weapon and his weapon. Do you say these people are not armed? <br /> <br /> When the bank robbers came to rob the bank, look at what happened in the real towns of the old West, then raided by armed and dangerous city populations. <br /> <br /> Interspersed with clever talk and slipping around, throwing out a few bare outdoors. Last, Corman fears as it is commonplace, though, for good, it is deprived of the "Conqueror" spiritual morality in the World. The sheriff turns his badge into Sam Bass and sings the sun, even though it's too gray though you see the sun.
