Every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget applies to categories of predecessors, contemporary, and classifiers. Extreme special effects, a weak story, ridiculous blood and eyes, boring and senseless characters, everything you expect. The owners of the Sabretooth attack are about a new recreational resort with Smilodon cats for genetically glamorous attraction. The cats begin to kill people, the show organizer does not want to warn them about their salvation and suspicion, and there are some workers who want to kill a group of visitors and cats. <br /> <br /> A special effect movie is the average success of the movie budget. Sabretoushs are described through the poor CGI. Surprisingly, cats appear to be more realistic in close, accurate stroke rather than longer, longer shots than CGI's. Their attacks are flawlessly bloody and sensitive. As you can expect, they attacked, torn some of their arms and legs, and left behind very little. <br /> <br /> This is part of the cause of the film's fall into the poorest slack. <br /> <br /> The plot and characters are very horrible. We have some collegiate children who come to the island and plan a scavenger hunt. Take it very seriously. There is even more to do with private property, accusing or stealing security systems. Why do they play a very serious game? Did not I miss anything? Was there money there? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, we can imitate the movie. But as it seems to me, it was a fun job to do. <br /> <br /> The Sabretooth Attack is a very bad film. This is a very poor and inexpensive example for a little budgeted fantastic figure. This will cause the audience to tears, it can be attractive to some and will irritate you and make you laugh. And remember that this is not a comedy, it's a cheap horror, so we do not have to be funny.
