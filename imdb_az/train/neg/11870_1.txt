This is the most outrageous film I've ever seen. I first saw it as a child, and even if I think about it, it really frustrates me. I know that life has become harder, and at one time I knew these people were poor and the products were vital. Yes, I got all this. I do not know, I do not remember the single moment in the whole film. Maybe it's true to life, I do not know. I think the player is top notch and the quality of filming, and so on. I believe it's true and I know that every movie can not be a happy ending, but in my opinion it's strange as a family movie. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it to everyone who wants to have fun with the movie. I do not stress enough how this movie influences me as a child. I have recently talked about it and all the sad memories are back. I think he did not go for Prozak heartily.
