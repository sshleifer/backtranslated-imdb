I'm usually not there to cut a movie. I'm trying to see good points and ignore the evil, but there's almost no good point in this situation. I think I'm going to do something bad, why are you worrying? Part of the film is filmed on Anne's face, deep breathing, and playing violin music in the background. the other part is full of poor and wooden action. Rupert Penry Jones is vague. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister in contemporary ways. Anne is primarily described as a beautiful and self-glorifying, but she keeps the movie in the same way and you do not see any reason why Captain Wentworth is in love with her. Generally, there is no part of production, it is one of the most romantic scenes in the book, to escape the concert, to kiss in the street, and to escape on the street with hat (why was this scene a movie?) It's a terrible film, very disappointing to please.
