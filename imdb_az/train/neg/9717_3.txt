The only possible twist is a pretty tense-by-numbers that appear to be nothing to hide. I was watching Isabel Huppert's performance in English. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. <br /> <br /> It is at least a tempting thing about this movie: half the players were not surprised after staying in the cutting room. . Steve Guttenburg tries to conquer his role with the appeal of everyone. There is a series of sensational fools he thinks his sexual consciousness can help in the treatment of PTSD. This is an uninterrupted performance. Elizabeth McGovern is a little consolation, actually, with a charm and character. 3/10
