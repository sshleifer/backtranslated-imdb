Who would want Bert I Gordo to continue the legendary trash film "God's Dinner"? No one, of course, was denied by director Damien Lee as a good idea, and he brought the delayed sequel, one of the most unnecessary films in the history of horror. When Gnaw is transferred to a typical late 80th place (a university campus), it also offers 80 cheap and cheerful effects perfectly. This script hangs along with other (and more successful) horror classics, with clicks that are not stupidly stolen, with terrible written dialogues and cunning events. Neil Hamilton is a beautiful two shoe maker for a scholar who is walking and walking on ordinary rodents. Thanks to some incredible stupid animal rights advocates, large and mixed rats run away from abroad and burn anyone outside. After the old tradition of Spilberg's "jaw", there is a depressed Dean, who has refused to accept the problem, even though severely damaged corpses are demolished everywhere. At a strange hysterical peak, the rats captured the opening ceremony of the new sports complex on campus! "Gnaw: The Gods Food 2" is pretty bad and so many fun to watch! Cartoons say that useless stupid things (like drainage systems) are unaware that they are infested with rats, and it's a strange thing to do, and it's a really strange sequence that covers the heroine of the growth-serum! I'm surprised at Freud's theory! Gore and sleaze and have some agreeable? Should it be said? music is a stunning atmosphere. If you can not get enough of this tape, there are many lively reptiles on the mutated rats, the Italy's poetry film "Rats: Terror Night", the humble 70's cult film "Willard" and its 2003 "Willard" with Crispin Glover, remake and once well-known latest movie makers by renowned directors Tibor Ticaks ("Rats") and John Lafia ("The Rats"). Be crazy about nerves!
