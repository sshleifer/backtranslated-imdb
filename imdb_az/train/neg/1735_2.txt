I got the feeling that the producers of this confusion had prepared the bitter, ridiculous West. <br /> <br /> <strong> "AROUND" is the best I can think of as I can imagine it. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is beautiful color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy, Jacques Aubuchon (injured player), wrote in a very miserable way that no actor could do a good job, and he acted in an annoying role. <br /> <br /> What we want: Stewart Granger looks like a westerner, with the British emphasis, a foolish, always white tree, with a properly adjusted outfit. Because the town's inhabitants and his son have always insulted Granger, he never spoke and did not respond. I know that we must stop the disbelief and think the West as a symbolic morality, but it has broken the funeral that we wrote with unrealistic and predictable scenes of sadness; in the end, the Granger miracle, the fast and single-handed plants' dynamics around a canyon are the worst and then Granger ends up perfectly, so the two main bad guys are to create rock slides to hit the dynamite at a very long distance and kill animals and bad guys. The worst thing is that everything about the area loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed convincing: I could not believe what the whole conflict was. The bad man took his flock to the market, and the cows wanted to graze some of the grass along the way; I can not see why something will not work. Do you need land dispute for this? Do not worry about seeing this.
