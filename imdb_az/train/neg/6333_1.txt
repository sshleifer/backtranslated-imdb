Actually, I saw this movie in a theater. When I gave my cashier money, he said two words he had never heard before or in a theater: "No repayment!" Until I heard these words, I had to give me money and go home. But unreasonable, I went and watched the movie. This film laughed at everyone in the theater. Even once. Not even inadequate! Mostly, we sat there in silence. Every ten minutes or more someone "SUCK THIS movie!" The audience welcomes the enthusiastic way, with a ten-minute silence full of silence.
