Heroic supporters (I am sorry to say you are 12 years old, I apologize for being offended if you are 12): In short, I'll deliver your imagination with good writing, worries about writing an original story, with unexpectedly well-planned fears and casual speeches, long-standing directors - THIS STEAMER IS PROPOSAL. I do not imagine that almost every episode feels like it was in the 1980s. If it were not for films about Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually, Clive, WTF), I'd be glad to say that these old guys (or 80's) can not convince Romero that he is interested in joining him ...). <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the person who trusts Mick Garrisy, pointing to his finger, is a logical manifestation of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" masterpiece and humbly condemning the condemnation telegraph. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is television today. We are so upset about the terrible horror of television that we welcome any old slide on our network of networks? Unfortunately, maybe it is. <br /> <br /> Generally, I did not see the point to add a comment that did not pretend to be the faults and advantages of a production. However, as this series is not the only exception (perhaps the only exception to the theme thread), I am writing this review as a warning: DO NOT EACH AND DO IT. If you agree with me, there is still a great deal of bad horror. Probably some of the directors' previous films would have been a better place to start, but if these "Rewards of Heroes" evaluated these things alone, they would never be allowed to graduate with a bachelor's degree. Of course, they did not study for a degree at the University.
