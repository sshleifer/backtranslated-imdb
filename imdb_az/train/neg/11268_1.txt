I hoped that this movie would be at least waiting. It was weak to say the least. I was more than happy looking at the bread line (can any one of them enter their CV?). At least I did not rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is full and absolutely PANTLAR.
