Ok, first good: Cherin performance and cinematography. I'm not an admirer of Cher, though he's doing a great job, and his part was well written. Cinematography was well implemented and captured a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> Convenience: Nazik Cetin is a completely unhappy and weak attempt to describe Nicholas Cage's performance and the Italian-American alliance from New York. First, Cage always opened my mouth. I do not know what type of accent it was trying to use. I'm not honest, if there was not a New York or Italian story I never heard of. It was quite real. And not because I'm some stickers for accuracy, but his voice smashed in my ears. I love Nicholas Cage in other speeches. Secondly, this is completely anecdote, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in my New York City, and I sincerely laughed more and I was more than happy to appreciate the Italian ethnicity more than that film. And at home will be a boring night. What is it?
