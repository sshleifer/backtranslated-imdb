"Wild Tigers I Know." Only in big cities will be shown, we will be sure. One of these films is so disappointing, except for the director! I hate them! <br /> <br /> All those who are spouses are DESPERATELY working to find "metaphors" of all, oh-so-alternative / cultural people, INDIAN horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, no story, no moral, no chronological and entertaining thing. or even touching. There were so many scenes that I had nothing to do with each other and to show how "art" and "vision" could be achieved for the whole show. This is still a BACKGROUND that was a young jerk, but it was impossible to trace it to every possible level. Then delete the loans! I was waiting for you to SENSE! I'm waiting for a "good part". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection. Most of them would be called "House of Art". This will not be among them. You're so angry to pay for this movie, you're buying less DVDs.
