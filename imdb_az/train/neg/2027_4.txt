<br /> <br /> In contrast to two other current game shows from the US endemol (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the pacing is slower for events on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br There is a risk involved in every activity of the player, the rewards are nagging and it is difficult for gamers to make a significant amount of money. <br /> <br /> Show me money, on the one hand, very slowly. When a question arises, you can be sure that the player knows the correct answer so that in the next few minutes nothing will be absolutely exciting. You will help to win the first time to show the speed of this show for the first time, and then the player's mistake will not loose the time for the Shat, and when the player receives an incorrect answer, they are wrong. Casual dance is really a filler that feels like a filler. <br /> <br /> Probably enough time is spent ... When the players are unable to opt out of the game, they are often wasted. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of a lifetime game show, but I've had a lot of problems sitting in an hour. Or need great changes or early retirement.
