After reading a movie, this movie should be considered, which is the best film of Sydney Poitier. Poitier has returned to the film for more than a decade and is clearly evident here. His 11 films are recorded in Wikipedia and do not include them. Five of the movies are featured on more than 100 AFI-inspired movies, yet they are not. Berenger and Poitier, the belt and the city slicker set out to hunt a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border to Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this movie have failed, and Berenger and Poitier's relationships were thrilling and disturbing (not entirely helpful by a mild script). Kirstie Alley (like a hostage) was not used and almost completely ignored when on the screen. Some attempts are made in the tension, for example, try and find out which of the five killer is the killer (all of them type villains) on a fishing trip. I realized that this is all the appeal to most of those there. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bereng, look at the Sniper (1993), and even contact Billy Zane. Better. I'd like to shoot at 3/10 to kill them all. It's not brave and it's very simple for me.
