This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. 1) Find out where the movie "War Games - Dead Cod" is shot. 2) Follow my true games during the war computer skills and eyes until 1983. 3) We learned and remembered to enter the Pentagon computer in the 1980s. 4) Place the PREVIOUS NIGHT before the WALKING code 5) Back to the day, get a beer, and turn off the memory of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones's memory, especially the "Dead CODE" of my original Look 6) Have a Beer and Watch WARS GAMES 7) Make a good 80 movie up to the next bad upgrade. 8) I was killed by Jar Jar. For this I have to travel to the future. Maybe I should go into a wormhole.
