Very interesting conversation on black and white written by David F. Friedman. Cashless actress Stacey Walker is a good and strange charm. She looks like a mischievous Renee Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This chicken consisted of only two films and then moved to Texaka. Music is terrible. <br /> <br /> The best line in Tony's film - "They put me on the doll with their chicks." Good B / W film from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and others). Good locals (cool pool, also used DEFILERS). Strangely enough, but fit. The best speech is Stacey Walker.
