Very strange but sometimes elegant abusive film utilizes the leading actress who does not have a real story, but with its overwhelming enthusiasm and a few wonderful, terrifying makeup effects. Daniella is an amazing twenty-one girl with trauma under the age of 13. Winds and hallucinations, which are said to be a werewolf, also cause a woman to rely on her father's reincarnation. During a nightclub, he killed his father-in-law and was hospitalized. He runs again, and by accident, he is eating more and more people in the running for police detectives, doctors, and relatives. It is very pleasant to watch and listen (really a great soundtrack), but the lack of plot and durability irritates it very fast. Fortunately, leading lady Annik Borel rarely dresses and she fills drilling moments with naked dances around the fire. The film is very long, very strange and very unforgettable. At the end of the biggest surprise and blue director Rino Di Silvestro tries to convince us that we are based on real facts. Yes, right ...
