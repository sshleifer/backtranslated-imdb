Jason Lee's beard is back! If you have what you are looking for, do not look at anything else. <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s are abundant, some bad shot, but kinoza exotic combat scenes (using JKD) and very bad player and cheap effects. Poor Lee may seem to be in pain along the film, and it's no surprise. <br /> <br /> In some of the films, the B-film was not cut off, but a German mosquito-colored Rutger-wannabe was a bad guy, but no unwanted sex scenes and even a pull. There is no. Zip. Nada. Even in the Starship Troopers 2, they had a common sense to include mandatory nudie scenes (my commentary on our upcoming review of this mind-blowing continuation, to rest my comments about the classic movie perfect piece). I got the feeling that one of the writers was revenge - so I'm not related to the film's plan or something else. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is something in this movie: there is no Jean-Claude :)
