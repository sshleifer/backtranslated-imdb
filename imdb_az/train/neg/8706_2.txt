If you've never seen the Moving Picture before, if this is the case for the first time, you'll find that this movie is a child of gods. But if you see a movie, a television show, or even a Barney dinosaur, you will not be so impressed with this movie. Heck Barney dinosaur was more realistic than this flick diner. <br /> <br /> Now I love B films. I watched only the "Giant Gila Monster" before watching this hero, and I loved this movie better. Works as movie B. It's honest to the real Gila wolf like lamer dialogue, cunning action, cheesier effects and monster! Carno 3 is not just a B movie punch pack. There are some fruits, and Polcheck is coming to a lot of fun, but this movie is incomplete, almost nothing. A small motor that can not get out of the dinosaur movie. You did not have to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch the beard drying sidewalk and have fun. If you are one of those guys, give this movie a shot.
