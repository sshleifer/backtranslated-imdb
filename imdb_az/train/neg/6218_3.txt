Thoughts about the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It is not good, not good. Interest, was very nice. Pacing, camera angles and so on. I agree with the characters? Eh, kinda soft. Land? <br /> <br /> This film more than anything else, like a new age. Organized religion is presented as timid and indecisive. Science is not a good description. ... Our weapons killed the monster of all things, but the "spirits" of monsters to destroy, and has the power to bring to life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's something a little tear in my mouth is something that. There is a scientifically created CGI movie here ... and use it to give a message that will destroy the science of science when promoting the idea that morality will end us? At least you were able to have one of the characters, <br /> <br /> "Okay, now what?" (Or something similar). Due to the rise and ceases to perform crowd esitməm very well. "Okay ... it was entertaining enough to sit for the entire film, but now you get out of here as fast as possible!" <br /> <br /> It is not possible to think about if you want to enjoy one of the films. Just watch your head gorsellərə nodalın respect. Any opinions, "what is it?" <br /> <br /> So, one scientist is able to create another, intelligent, robotic life after creating a "tool". Devils used as a weapon. However, scientists gunahındadır people. The car has in mind, but not his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine takes Skynet to the collective donkey of mankind and clears up all living things on the earth, and gradually strengthens it. However, the man of science, able to survive and shoulder to shoulder to create puppets. <br /> <br /> The latter, unable to do anything in the world wakes up to 9 points. He sees and selects it close to the strange device. He meets another like himself, # 2 <br /> <br /> Well, # 2, was arrested by Makina last surviving robot. Finds itself more and more as # 9 and # 2 is on the way to get rid of. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> The film then yanked soul-brothers to the rescue # 9 is trying to keep up with the action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a result, they succeed and destroy the machine. They tend to release the spirits of the friends who were going up to the clouds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I do not have anyone. Why do scientists want to divide the world into the spirit of the 9 homunculi? What has been achieved? Yaradılmısdılarmı to stop the car? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! <br /> <br /> Why, why bother? <br /> <br /> Why, when there is nothing else to succeed waited nine small fruit? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but you will fight first with the "spirit." At least it seemed as though there was a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why do they slaughter Mashs after they have sent the Spirits to the devices and then release their lives to bring their lives to life? Why not expect the car to wait for jealousy and bring everything back to life without any prohibited steps?
