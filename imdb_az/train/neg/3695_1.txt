Not the best actor movie ever. Not to give a good fun at the award-winning actor's stardom. The hero himself, his family and sincere admirers can do that. But not necessarily a neutral audience. The sequence of fight is a general comedy. Dancing movements in song sequences are frightening. Music is medium. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. The film's interpretation of the nudity created on the film has failed harshly. Do not even think about doing so even if you want to kill it. Instead of watching an animated film. A good movie buff can not greet this 2 1/2 hour shit.
