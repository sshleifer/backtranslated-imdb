I can look at all the good reviews and say that this can be a good show. It will not be so fast. If you do not know what this "talent" is, this show is just fine ... I will not even talk about it negatively (I know, it can be abusive to many people), because it really bothered me about the show. It's bothering me that people are watching it and I think it's funny. <br /> <br /> A day before you meet your spouse, <br /> <br /> This is not a million times a day. In fact, it was almost every joke or racist. <br /> <br /> Sara likes to read ... I love her voice ... these words are not words ... The words are scary ... she likes to read a lot about it <br / > <br /> If you like to see a hot woman, put it down to everyone and put it at the same time farting and talking about every race, this show is for you.
