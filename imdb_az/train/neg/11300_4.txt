1st Watch 5/27/2009 - Dir-Harold Young (Dir-Harold Young): The 3rd Universal Mummy film is the same as the first two in terms of audience view. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum. This time the story is in the United States. The new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country hoping to revive the generations of the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (this is not a very different thing, because he really does not have to act too much for that character). The new priest becomes a morgue guard in the city and carries on her ugly deeds after feeding the mummy with tanna leaf juice. Again, a girl is on the road, the priest has fallen on one of her fianc√©e and wants her, yes - to be forever with her (we have never heard before). Undoubtedly, when the townspeople hunt the mummy with torches (like the Frankenstein monster), and the burning of the living ends the story ... how do they get the result? Can you find the next one along the series? or .....
