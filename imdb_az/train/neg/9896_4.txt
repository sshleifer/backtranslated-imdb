DVD version consists of 2 episodes, part of Caesar's parisidi. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. <br /> <br /> One part of Cleopatra's historic character is very difficult, and for a new person, Leonor Varela plays only well. He is a strong desire, a very supportive, humble spirit. Thimothy Dalton like Caesar is perfect and romance is the most important episode of the first episode. <br /> <br /> After the parisit, a new lover came (Marc-Antoine), but the taste went: we always remember love for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, production is luxurious: the sets are great, tastefully decorated; Morocco's exotic and exquisite wardrobe are outstanding. Manufacturers have plenty of money, but they can not spend anything on special effects. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to hear it in French or English so as to have a look at these two films. (Blue screens, boats, Sphinx).
