<br /> <br /> What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> This is the color! <br /> <br /> There are some impressive underwater photos! <br /> <br /> There's a rhythmic musical account behind the background, and sometimes it works fine! <br /> <br /> So, from 3 to 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is speeding up! Especially when you want to move sharks or baddies! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! Time to approach as if it were to deliver to the audience! <br /> <br /> As someone else poured dust! It's a very similar thing to a "spaghetti West"! <br /> <br /> Italians can not produce quality products! In Australia in the 1990s there was a series of television films titled "Octopus", about 1-7 on mafia-type conflicts on SBS TV! And they were perfect! But, unfortunately, you will not find it here! <br /> <br /> I thought it was done in the 1960s! Unfortunately, it was proven by a funeral sight near the end of the 20 years. <br /> <br /> There was a sharp dog shining rapidly creating a red powder that appeared repeatedly in creeping waters! <br /> <br /> If we observe the bloody demolition in the bar of everything, either in the bar room, or with the last shark at the last sea, her heroic wife watches her eyeglasses with little concern. He was squeezed out of his ruthless role as to the lack of evidence or the character of anybody! <br /> <br /> At least the hero shows a dissatisfaction for his former spouse! <br /> Of course, even if music does not wake up our reality, we have a bad voice in the baddies' sounds, like convincing us that another dark act will emerge! <br /> And in the end, someone thought of a twist! Only when we thought it would be entirely predictable! But the shadow of the nations is thick, because you can find another twist! If you watch closely! More or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and there are several brains along the way! This will make the "Shark Night" look better! <br /> <br /> Therefore, we'll be ready for something like the movie 007, so it's time to return to reality after it's over!
