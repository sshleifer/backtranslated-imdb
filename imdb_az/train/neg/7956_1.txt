This movie should be number 100 below. The player is not so terrific that my son and I were physically ill when watching him. And the story is worse. How bad can I be, but I really wanted to do it, and I see that no one still has a problem. Do not waste your time, money, energy, or anything else in this movie. Thanks for the kindness we see on television, he did not spend anything. If we did not, I would have to write those responsible for this nonsense, and generally I had to blame themselves. Finally I say that I always liked Carrie Fischer's behavior. But I'm sorry to say that the film is not worth watching this movie. Carrie does not destroy your opinion.
