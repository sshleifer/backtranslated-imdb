I do not believe in the horror of this movie; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought Diane Keaton was always worth watching. I'm done. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> no development she did not drift, or she was surprised that Mrs. Keaton thought that the silk bag came from her ear. None of the heroes were part of their conviction and did not differ dramatically. The reinforcing act behaved like a mere class - I wondered, "What did I think?" Very, very sad. Do not waste your time.
