Think of the dark version of one of the kids like "Power Rangers" and since 1990 you have this movie, "Robot Jox". A film that fights giant robots, two people enter the arena and everyone who comes to the country will win. These robots are good, though robots are small, and are slightly better than those shown. I remember the battle of two robots, which is the last and last indication when it's over. There is a piece of fragment because of a traitor, but it's not something to stay with for a while after the snapshot is taken. Fights themselves look like giant toys in the cup, but still a little fun to watch. This film also created several other films with similar devices such as giant robots and tournaments. So, you should check it once, but it's probably not that much.
