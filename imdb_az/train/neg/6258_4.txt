Writer Tony Piccirillo, who recently learned that HIV is positive in the past three weeks, has lately falsely claimed that a widow was a straight man; she follows no homosexual partner, brings her to a flat and closes her, and as a result, she prompts the boy to carry blood tests and promise bloody revenge. An interesting idea sounds better on paper. The capture of James Marsden is actually kinda and slippery, but the actor's own behavior is confused - like watching Tom Cruise's instructional guide. Scott Speedman has to work harder in a more difficult role, but his personality is not convinced of shy away from theft until he or she has two conversations. Marsden's gay guy, of course, is definitely not - he instantly understands the difficulty of Speedman - but no homosexuals react to this or not. The film is not exactly a fraud, but a poor finish, poorly-thought flashbacks, low-budget production and silly pretension and soap melodrama smacks are great finals. * From 1/2
