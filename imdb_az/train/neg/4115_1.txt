"Power Play" begins exciting, but the hill is going fast. Only good player Tobin Bell and a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" does not see any value or interest. Within a year, "Power Play" has more than a few earthquakes in California. AVM earthquake scene is very subtle and totally unbelievable. And all action scenes resemble third-class students who play one game. <br /> <br /> "Power Play" will be regarded as a "B" class movie if it is done in the 60s or 70s. It's really sad that the "Power Play" was made in 2001. Is there anything like "D" class movie? If so, cast Power Play.
