It's almost like two films - one writer and one involving, the other stupid and clich√©d. All the problems that have not been written are really shameful, but given the fact that B-films are written and produced most of the time, this is not unusual. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> The movie is original and covers World War II Code Crushers. This is incredibly interesting and I liked watching the lead man (Lee Bowman) take his own steps as a master code breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the film was very good. But now it's bad, the movie has lost too long and lost in only 50 minutes. Additionally, Jean Rogers's role as "kooky girlfriend" should be one of the most written and entertaining roles of film history! For every clever move made by Bowman, the dragon Rogers stepped in to take things as a wrong "comedy relief" later. If his roles were cleverly written, the overall movie was very good! Instead, how can we really understand the Second World War when we are watching him!
