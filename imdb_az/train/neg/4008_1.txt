As an admirer of Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be completely poor. Vampire Bill does not look very good and looks older than the one described in the book. Already beautifully colorful characters are very refreshing and vulgar. One of the things I like about books is, despite all the hardships that Sookie has gone through, it's always a lady, and there's still nothing in the television series. Not only this, but also the prejudices shown in the TV series are spread in books. I did not expect a clear copy of the books, but at least I waited for the feeling that it was being used for the series.
