I'm surprised at how the actors act in this movie. Annette Bening really was, half and half, is he a liar or a natural one? He will not change the model of the film, even if he goes through the ceiling. Brian Cox did a good move. I almost always used this way, cunning, cunning, no-one was really inactive around a dirty dirty about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, he asks what he is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty scary and disgusting. Who will see such a deal?
