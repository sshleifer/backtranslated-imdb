Dear lord. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror films. And most of the time, horror films, other people say bad, I want. The actor who did not "scared" was not surprised. But this area was terrible. Did not make any sense! There was a scene from the very beginning and unnecessary (and rebellious) sex scene. The author believes the director is trying to be "shocked" or something, but it's just terrible. To add Festering beard they called a plot, the actors ('weird') were afraid and I was very careful not to forget who they were. Finally, this movie made me sick. If you ever want to avoid watching this movie, please.
