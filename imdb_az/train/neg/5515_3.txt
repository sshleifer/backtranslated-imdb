There is something very good for this cartoon; The backgrounds are packed with rich, lushly colored and beautifully decorated art deco detail. Animation is up to standard studio standards, and is far higher than today's. But I see it as exhausting for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Music: This is not in accordance with Scott Bradley's usual standards. Perhaps ending with "Great Gatsby" is likely to be evocative for the setting, ends with unhappy, sleepless, repetitive and monotonous (repeating and monotonous Beethoven's 5th Symphony is not the same as confirmation). <br /> <br /> Because many people (including myself) have closed their eyes, the visual part of the animation will be missed by the average viewer. Storyline: I'm not giving any mystery that is already in the summary of the plot - the country is good, the city is bad. This is an animated film and animated film since that time. It is a mistaken nostalgia of a non-existent rural idol that is reflected in a nostalgia similar to today's "values".
