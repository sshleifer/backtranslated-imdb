This is a great story and the beginning of equality in the United States. (We still work on it.) However, despite this fact, it is still a movie, and this is a movie site. I have difficult moments to get good players from independent films, but wow. Only one odd Ossie Davis is excellent. But even all actors (including a young man playing) could not be completely treacherous. The given script was very clich√©, but then you need to have some decent player! I do not recommend it to everyone, because it is so weak in each category. Read some of the USS Maso's true stories, because they honor men for what they deserve.
