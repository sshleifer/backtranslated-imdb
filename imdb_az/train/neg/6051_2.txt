urgh! The film needs 3 things: a good script, a good site and a good cast. I was expecting this movie to be hilariously terrifying and unfortunately I was disappointed when it was terrible. I've been able to live half a century. The only thing that stopped my brown knife stabbing was Rose Byrne (first of all, it caused me to watch it). Rastus did a good job, and his appearance has not changed much since his 13th birthday. It was a fantastic first effort in the film. The dog was also very good. but also did a great deal of this kind of terrible material. I think Sandra Bernhard is the biggest mistake of the film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <
