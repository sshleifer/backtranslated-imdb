This sword - the wizard story of a terribly fearsome and delicate "hero" who seizes a bad king is virtually worthless in every detail. The player is a terrible thing that leads to supporting roles. Basbug shows that the blood around the hero is leering, the sad glee is completely disgusting; nor his injustice has been opposed to him, for he is as wicked as he is fighting. <br /> <br /> The film is a rich film, including a scene where a character pushed out of the open sword is "dying"! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Films, obviously women women, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, paraded around the very naked along the film. As a 20 person, I will not act as if I was attracted to the woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the thinnest movies of this movie are at least slightly reduced. light hearted, with a tongue-in-cheek feeling (later this is better), but DEATHSTALKER takes it seriously as a heroic fantasy. In no way! <br /> <br /> Price: from 1/2.
