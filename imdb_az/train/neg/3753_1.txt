Due to the 1988 American Guild Guild, they had to shoot the episode in 3 days. It was described as "terrible, simply terrible" by Maurice Hurley, a composer of 2 + seasoned clips of the season, and was written by his writer Maurice Hurley. <br /> <br /> Why is it impossible to expect something worthy of knowing the producers? I guess production could escape money due to strike and that it could only release a flashback episode, or maybe Roddenberry was often sick to get this semi-vest. This episode also mentions the latest appearance in the series of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski).
