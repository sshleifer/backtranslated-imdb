Do not make me wrong, I think this movie is foolish, I honestly gave you an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I saw was a group of girls (a different story for a different time). When I started watching, I saw something that was terrible. There are two types of horror now, Freddy and Jason are terrific, here and here you and your friends are laughing and joking about how terrible they are and then there is such a movie. In The Hat The Cat did not even interest me for a moment. As I watched the first part, I did not feel unhappy, but I felt as if I had been disrupted by the disadvantage of the film. Mike Myers is generally brilliant, I love most of the work, but nothing in this movie was shot. One of the authors / producers / writers / hadith variables refused to use the original color of the original book (red, black, white), not by any character. Whether it was accidental or not, he refused to take any of the original (and I do not hate to use this word, but it will be appropriate) the original zaniness. <br /> <br /> This book was like an ice-cream market, it was colorful and tasty, and it was soft and difficult to slip as a flattering film. <br /> <br /> Take it like a leptosis prostitute.
