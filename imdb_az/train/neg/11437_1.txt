Sam (Thomas Cavanagh) and Gray (Heather Graham) are brothers and sisters who share a delightful woman named Charlie (Bridget Moynahan), their surprise - balroom dance, 1940s movie music and more. Historically heterosexual, Gray is mixed with new emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Weak, predictable, unfunny, weak movement and poor writing. Nothing was real about it, and everything was very disappointing. Additionally, this is a romantic comedy with a really special twist, rather than "quit" the movie. Sue Kramer, the romantic squad, first semi-sweet and the second part of the seriously accepted and exited tried to make serious. Unfortunately, he failed unsuccessfully. The first half was mostly unfunny and only Heather Graham could hold a little. Later, the film received an impartial tone and it all became serious. Serious scenes were weak and all feelings were feeble. <br /> <br /> I think the film is a bit more enjoyable when it feels that the relationship between the characters is more accurate. The relationship between brotherhood and fraternity was very weak and seemed not really close. Their relationships were not very natural. Also, the relationship between Tom and Bridget is very unusual. If two people want to get married after just a few weeks, you would ask for a little more excitement, but the characters told you to marry in Vegas ask the waiter what they want. There was no excitement in the film, and it was difficult to deal with such unmotivated characters in the film. <br /> <br /> It was a little surprising when the player was basically weak, and this was a decent game. Heather Graham showed just a good performance in the movie. She was funny and had some staggering scenes, but it's very bad that her co-stars are full of flaws. Bridget Moynahan was very weak and his performance was lying at every level. It also seemed to read his lines. Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden, and he did not show any emotion. The chemistry between Thomas and Heather was non-existent and the film was damaged, because the connections were fraudulent. I can often help Molly Shannon to laugh in a role-playing role, but here he is only a hookah. Sissy Spacek had about two stages and was amazed at both. Finally, Alan Cumming was just a shame, and his performance was not good. Generally, Gray Matters is a bare film and you do not need to watch it. Rated 3/10
