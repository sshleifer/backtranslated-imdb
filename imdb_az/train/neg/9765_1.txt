I often do not replace the "new ones", but if there's a movie that's worth it, it's "Gas!" According to Mammadov, Mammadov said Elliott tried to recreate Gould's deadly role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with the same movie (with Whiffs in the movie) - see here at IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more details) <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould Corman have "Gas" with Whiffs they approached the brass ring. but did not go there pretty much. One of those films came to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's in the gas? What is? No one is close to secondary school level drama level drama. The production values ​​are saddened. Here, someone else talked about magic lanterns on a running car, and did not pay much attention. <br /> <br /> As in this film, nothing will work and no one is interested. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" really put me in bed. This is not a sure treatment for insomnia, but it is really close. Kinematics Suitable Induction scale, "Gas!" In recent years, Marienbadda and George Clooney's "Solaris" have been re-established (regardless of whether the studio is more satisfied with the original than the original, while the studio's attention is focused on the audience's satisfaction). <br /> <br /> Dear editorial, "Gas!" about twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> Some movies are not so bad that they have an attractive quality that always makes eye contact. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. Even morally bad.
