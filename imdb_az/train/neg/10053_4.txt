The dead body of a little girl was removed from all possible means. When one leg is found to be longer than the other one, it is assumed that a few children are missing body organs. After this trauma, pairs are separated and dependent on the mother's tranquilization and cause a painful existence. All this one day later, many years later, she meets her daughter by phone. With the help of an old police and correspondent, she sets out to find out if her daughter really is right. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess, a miserable slow pace, and absolutely unbreakable. Guarding grace, Emma Vilarasau, is a glorious workman in the village. The best part of the movie comes to an end, but I'm not sure if it will pay the rest of the movie. Avoid the English subtitles at the latest R1 speed - they are not very accurate.
