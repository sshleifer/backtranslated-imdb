I was dissatisfied with watching this movie with my daughter, like me, an admirer of the first. This movie sucked right! The first wizard did not happen. The real animation is unsatisfactory, the palace is very different from the first movie, it has never been mentioned and terrible, there was a new prince, and fortunately, the Prince did not have many lines that kept him. It is mainly explained by all the mice, except for the stories of the King of Aslan 1 1/2. The reason I gave it from 10 to 2 was the songs that were not performed by the characters.
