Today, I found the "All Laughed" in the rented VHS. It was a really old and widely used VHS, but I did not know anything about this movie, but I liked the references that included me: Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and Dorothy Stratten, attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to take risks. I called the IMDb and the User Rating 6.0 was a great reference. I looked at "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and looked up? Amazing! Wow four stars! So I decided that I would lose more time and not see it right away. Indeed, I watched the movie "They All Laughed" and found it a very boring film. The characters are badly developing and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The site should be funny (special eyes lover of women who followed them), but laughed all along the story. The coincidences in a big city like New York are ridiculous. It's funny, like a glamorous and charming person, like Gazarra, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, or George Clooney as if it were falling for her. In the end, of course, they are interested in playing with Dorothy Stratten, a Playboy-based player and player, who was killed by his wife after the release of this film and was shown as "Star 80" and "Death of One's Death". At the center: Dorothy Stratten Story, beautiful beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, future lady Keith Richards, Audrey Hepburn, always beautiful, even fifty-two, and Roberto Carlos's "Amigo." is the most popular Brazilian singer and is called "King" by his supporters, and I will only store this movie for this collection of attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "<strong>
