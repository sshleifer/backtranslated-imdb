It is mainly produced by Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation and is another North East Florida production. As long as needed to reach the streets, the company was surprised that it could handle the main street of Fernandina Beach. The film is very nice and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but it's a lot. Eileen Brennan won more. Good for younger children, or those who love hair in large doses. 4 out of the Miller-Films formula.
