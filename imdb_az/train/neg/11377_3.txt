okay The taxi driver for beginners is incredible. It's not a taxi driver or incredible. what is bad. but I was thinking that this was a bad laugh, that is, she had several talented qualities. Like a dialogue ... Wow. There was no more or less plot, all the symbols were dumb, and the film was baptism. In some places, at the end of the movie, which was very difficult at the beginning of the movie, I thought the film would dive into a type of taxi driver that could reach the message. I do not think it's like 20 people who see this movie. Yes, it's worth watching you're really bored and wants to confirm once again that everyone can do a movie or at least try it.
