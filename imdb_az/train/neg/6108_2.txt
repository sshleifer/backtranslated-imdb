Tarzan The Ape Man is also rebuilding the 1932 movie, and is less like Burroughs' literary character than the previous movie. In 1932, when Tarzan was called Tarzan-Jane, Tarzan, played by Milz O'Keeffe, did not speak or even disrespect. Tarzan declares several times, sounds like the previous movie. <br /> No, Tarzan plays Jan Dana Bo Derek second banana. More precisely, to Bo Derek's left breast and to his right breast as the third banana. <br /> <br /> Two scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. <br /> <br /> Tarzan has an orangutan side-shot in this movie. It may be that he combined Sumatra with the elephant, which also showed the Indian elephants.
