This movie goes straight from the dark dungeon of Tam Moon Entertainment. In the first half of the 90's, this production company produced fame and luck and produced very bad and cheerful horror movies. Owre's most famous disasters are "Subspecies", "Seeders" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and doctors are not actually Dr. Morbid. Hyperactive director came to the right company for Charles Band film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly boring and surprising, and almost completely humorous. That star was Jeffrey Combs because I just saw it. I learned that he is an admirer and may have some disadvantages. For each good movie, it looks like the 5th lower part. In any case, this story is a battle between two ancient magicians. A good man (like Jeffrey Dr. Morrid) and a bad man named Kabal to protect people since 150 years. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I have forgotten. Combs receives his instructions from the mentor. This "boy" is only a pair of eyes in space. Too many cheesy, that is! The screen once and once displays a sparkle light, but this is a special effect of this movie. All this is just a piece of acne and nagging, and when the two wizards are finally resembled one another, it's over before I know it ... I would not expect the evil wizard to return at least a bit, but nooooooo. In some scenes, you can really identify some peculiarities and creativity (such as Jeffrey's report on the effects of the moon's criminals), and even some smaller ones called Edgar Allen), but in general a terrible loss of time and energy. I'm a great admirer of Jeffrey and maybe a super hero in my eyes ... but I do not need to put a stupid maillot on it.
