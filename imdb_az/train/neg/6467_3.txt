I still do not believe this movie. <br /> <br /> Part of life is a joke, but it does not make sense to be funny, but there's no story. How do you blend a swinging comedy with a jerk, a prison movie, city clues, sex jokes and an FBI agent? <br /> <br /> The most striking thing besides the terrible leadership is the actors. I watched this movie and thought, "Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be (after 5 minutes) Is it Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando. (5 minutes later) It can not be Donald Sutherland. (After 5 minutes) There is no Mira Sorvino, but it's too bad for all of them (in the end) No, no, no, it's not Martin Sheen! It's not a 10-second movie. "Then it's over and I'm down with my nerve. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
