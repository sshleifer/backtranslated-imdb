I was very surprised by the positive comments because we all saw one at a glance and all of us went. As we personally felt, it was a bit slow to watch the whole movie. We really tried to stay focused on it. In particular, those who really want to love their personal experiences from the school's sexual orientation, have never liked it or did not recognize it in any way. :( It's a great thing to see that this film is really resonating with many people in the squad and reviewers of this movie, the beauty of the subjective art form of this movie :)
