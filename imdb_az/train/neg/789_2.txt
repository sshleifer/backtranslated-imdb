Five minutes after watching, I was in IMDb to warn you all when you are not concerned about this movie ... genre: horror? it was at least a part of me and I would think of myself as "something will happen soon ..." After the film's end, I'm embarrassed by the writer / director, Patrick Rea, this man does not know how to shoot a movie, and the greatest admirer after watching this excuse for a horrible horror I went to. I gave this movie to actors 2 ... they were not bad, and it was a mistake ...
