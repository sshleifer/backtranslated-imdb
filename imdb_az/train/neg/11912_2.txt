The story behind this movie is very interesting and is not too bad at all ... but the details: writing, leadership, endurance, pacing, motion sequences, stunts, and CG make the film less expensive and destructive. <br /> <br /> First of all, movement schemes. All of them are not quite clear. Most of them, though all over the world, are standing up and running, trying to escape, fight, jump, or try anyway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Pacing: everything goes very fast. For example, "Elle" is prepared to fight for a few hours and can turn backwards from the start, and so on. Why is it so acrobatic? None of these are disclosed in the film. <br /> <br /> Like Lilith, she could not go back to where she was wings. <br /> <br /> Besides, go to a place and walk in a foreigner room with just a sink and mirror, then stabbing himself in the throat, without any reason and without any spectator, he (and then felt the secondary effect of another explosive vehicle) ... "Okay?" <br /> <br /> <strong> "Yes, I'm fine," he says. <br /> <br /> I was looking at everything because the entry said it would be interesting to me ... but at the end the poor executive wanted something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, because Jackie Chan was able to stop my curses, vampires The film, even the director, wanted to shake the writer Give a good talk to the Writer.
