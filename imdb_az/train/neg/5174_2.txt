This movie is very laughed, I do not know whether to laugh or cry. For Horrorfest, for the first time I joined Horrorfest, I had a lot of hope for Horrorfest and had to tell Horrorfest and all the movies were giving a false advertisement to a new level. I'm pretty mad at advertisers, because I'm sure they've fooled many people to spend and watch these movies. Hamiltons were the worst of the ones I've ever seen (the others I've seen, The Non-mixed, Black Ride and Reincarnation). The film was surrounded by a trailer and found that a trailer was some "old age" tale about the transition of a boy and, as a result of the end, it seemed like a faded family that destroyed the neighborhoods that I thought was a very interesting area for disappointment. vampire In this film drama is dominated by any horror feelings. They add a bunch of twisted twins who do not wait for one to 'bite' one another to make the plot more fun, and some deadly creatures lock in the basement. 'was a mystery that was not revealed at the end of the film, and I would leave the theater to half the film. <br /> <br /> We've lost money and time. Take this movie forty minutes and make an episode in Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural, and get more praise from it. Absolute discharge! Two years later, I need to return to the IMDB and write about it, as it is still one of the worst films ever seen in my memory. And when you read it, talk better about the rest of the movie Horrorfest in the future. The best of them is to rent them from Blockbusters or watch them online. Horrorfest did not touch on blood and drought or horror, referring to everything about independent filmmakers who could not come out on the big screen and everything they did not show in theaters. Because they are terrible. Think Horrorfest as a lesser-known version of the Sundance Film Festival, but for horror films. <br /> <br /> We apologize for all the hate, but you'll think twice about cheating your customers over the next period.
