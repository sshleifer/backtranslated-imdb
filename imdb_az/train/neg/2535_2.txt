WWE New Years Revolution 2006, as in previous years, started with an Elimination Chamber game. The difference between recent years and this year, however, is the value of entertainment. In fact, only three people have had a chance to get out of Pepsi Arena in New York City, Albany with the WWE Championship. These men were current champions John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. Vinnie Mac does not put the pipe in any tea-house; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane spent the last WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was just one night. And it would not be. Last year's match was a thrilling event with six of the best WWEs offered. <br /> <br /> <strong> It was an expected and disappointing event in 2006, but still the match of the night. <Strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vince McMahon, Then Edge announced that he had cash in his bank championship. John Cena did not give a chance to prepare and retake the glasses to win the match, and after a spear in the most entertaining heels at WWE. <br /> <br /> Like last year, the low card was really embarrassing. Triple H and Big Show have set up a betrayal festival to help me get away from it. HHH won, but did not there be any real doubts? Both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestlers do not have any chance of winning in any game with the same card. <br /> <br /> The King, Helms (who wrote these things?) and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Selton Benjamin, with little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> WWE's women also had a busy night. Braley and Panties Gauntlet won by Ashley had the usual Diva nonsense and the Women's Championship was also a line. In a match, WrestleMania thought that up to 22 Mickie James would not be allowed to play as long as he challenge Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the competition, but it will continue in the near future. <br /> <br /> The opening night of the night began to be the WWE champion Edge against the intercontinental champion Ric Flair. It could have been better, but after a disqualification ended, it was a protected and bloody Flair. <br /> <br /> Thus, the New Year's Revolution In 2006, the maintenance schedule for payment began in a catastrophic way. The only good thing is to know that WWE is the only way to go. They are not worse than that.
