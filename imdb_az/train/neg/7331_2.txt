this film was made in a clear and hasty manner. I think it's hard to come up with funding for any movie. However, if there is any original material in the plot, some would see that they had received the necessary funding, and that is not what they are, and they do not have a single purpose. The structure of this film I have been able to add many times before and have been implemented in a better way. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance of competing with others. I told my computer that at least ten lines were needed to submit my comment, so the following lines are just a bull to fill the spacebar. I do not think there's anything else about this movie. I said that if you spend a lot of time reading this, do not waste more time for God's request. The only exception is a person who wants to watch the bad movies at 2:00 pm in the evening.
