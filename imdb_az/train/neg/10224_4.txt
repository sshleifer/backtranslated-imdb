Spoilers <br /> <br /> A good line summary tells them all. Melville "Le samurai" has the original and "Leon" elements. And Better - Better! <br /> <br /> In A Samurai, Alain Delon keeps a bird in the cage and is a left-wing warrior / scenario that stole a car for his job (with such an inactivity). Even the latter is directly identical: samurai is looking for death in dignity and is shot with an empty weapon in his hand. <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill as many people as "Ghost" dogs. But I guess Jarmusch likes "Leon" much or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. That's why it added. <br /> <br /> Now, my daughter will be "professional" like Natalie Portman as "Ghost". <br /> So what did Jarmusch think? <br /> <br /> Is original thinking rare in this movie? <br /> <br /> I do not see the point in opening Carbon (cellulose) copies. <br /> <br /> Connor 4/10 rating by Macaulay
