Very dull, clear, exhausting Exorcist's red eyes dropped a Doberman - this is the cheapest cheapest special effects level. Richard Crenna is alive as a chewing toy. Add more than 70's clothing and music to torture alone. You'll need to sleep just like The Corpse Vanishes or The Blue Hand. Practically worthless. MooCow says that's a brutal dog! : = 8P
