I do not want David Copperfield to "complete the set". There are some good speeches (eg, Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (for example, beating), but in general, this is actually paled against the BBC version of 1999, as well as previous versions. <br /> <br /> The story, which is not based on real truth, can not be understood, except it is possible to give dumb (stolen authors work at a point). The American actress was not selected: Sally Field is a good actress, but it's as incorrect as Betsy Trotwood, and his English accents are better than Dick Van Dyke's cock. We can see why Michael Richards was selected to play Mr. Micawber; However, it is very pushing and irritating. At the same time, he splits out his lines eccentrically and speaks modestly. Anthony Andrews creates a threat like Mr. Murdstone, but he expects someone to pick up a black hat and close Dava's mother to the railroad line (although this is partly Dickens's fault). <br /> <br /> I bought it for free in a newspaper. I made Sunday afternoon, but in the end I thought I was more attractive
