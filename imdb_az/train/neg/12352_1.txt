<br /> <br /> How much is the 6 star average of this movie beyond me? The scenario is very simple and undoubtedly the insult of whose life is based. Cinematography is made out of the world of flat advertising and talented Ridley Scott should be embarrassed. However, when Demi Moore attends this movie, it is not a surprise if he looks at a piece of play. All this is a "high concept" film, even ashamed of Don Simpson.
