I was thinking about coming to this movie as a Specialist, but I left feeling abandoned. Humor was weak and the characters were fairly straightforward. That's all bad, the idea of ​​a grocery store dating service seemed to be a very productive material, but the director went into the focus of attention "The Boy and the Pop Shop boy from the evil corporation." It felt like it would be shot just by the dating service area, she would go out with a more memorable movie. Now I'm in Rochester to do the movie's justice, and I liked the way Webster described. In fact, here the best Kevin Smith (Shades) was honored in his hometown. Webster, NY, to check what the Red Bank's NJ is doing to the Secretaries. The director cleverly drove Nick Tahou into a history. Add to me a list of things to do in Rochester on a garbage plate. I'm lucky to see this movie at Rochester. Everyone knew when the fires of the city came and he praised them.
