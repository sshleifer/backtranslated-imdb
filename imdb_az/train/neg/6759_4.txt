There is another situation in the case of another DVD, which betrays the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was not bad. Rochon is a job that does not work and damn it! cast is good looking. I have never seen that many musclebound children go together. This film really wanted to think that Rochon was a killer, but that did not happen. The biggest problem with my film was that I did not pay much attention to who the murderer was and that the real killer was a bit unreasonable, because he was in blue and you see a filmmaker "ha", "betcha"! "Yes, there were persistence errors (mainly, for example, with Rochon's changing wardrobe), but it's not bad for the indie slasher." From the very beginning, I was convinced that girls were just an exaggerated excuse to go topless, but it was just a ghost <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> And the community of Lloyd Kaufman is very well understood.
