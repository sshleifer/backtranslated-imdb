A contemporary, frustrating African American woman Scrooge inspired inspiration, but there is nothing else in this film. Here, Mrs. Scrooge is a hell of a bank that lives mainly in poor and black neighborhood workers and clients. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate into urban structures and do not update the scenario. The constant message about sharing and transmission is so replicated that the audience is very tired of the end of the movie's familiarization. This is a message movie that does not have time to get out. In the lead role, talented Cicely Tyson delivers a very sensitive performance and sometimes it is difficult to understand the lines. Charles Dickens's novel has been fabricated many times, despite its very important message, it is a struggle to adapt it to a fresh and relevant way.
