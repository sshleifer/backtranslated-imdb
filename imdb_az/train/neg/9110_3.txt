I watched this movie at 3:00 am and it was a time when I came to the movie. But it was not good at all, this movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> Representative of the Delegation: "As long as it is very good". <br /> <br /> All of this player is good and the events that took place in the past reminded the Chevy Chase comedy of the poor 90s. I would like to say that it's a poker case and a poker situation among the servants ... This movie was first and foremost reasonably basic and OK. But it would have been worse if I did not see it first before I saw it. Finally, it suddenly came to me and I felt like nothing was going to happen ... Sebastian suddenly changed, and it seems like it's done just to make it 1 and it's never like an effort. used to do something. <br /> <br /> They need to control the situation with more style and class, but they did not feel like a movie. and that's why this movie came out bad ...
