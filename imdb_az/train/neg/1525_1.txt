I watched it a weekend afternoon, because there was nothing else but chewing my legs and feeling less painful. It's definitely deliberate to invite everyone to see how a movie might be a dangerous film. I believe that I tried every illusion of humor in such a childhood, ruby, unplanned and badly executed. Spiceworld's Goodfellas movie, I think I'm exaggerating? Give good air time and think again. Terrible, completely scary. If this is not a game, the director and anyone responsible for it must be deleted after having to watch the movie again.
