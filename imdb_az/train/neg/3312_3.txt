... but I'm sorry to see it. IMDb ratings are relatively high (and they should be relatively higher in Netflix), so I put it in order because it's so great that it has been recognized by England as a sophisticated comedy and has loved me. On the other hand, "Eliminating Grace" falls under the category of non-capable films produced by Hollywood films. Brenda Blethyn is a talented actress and I liked her in other films. Understanding is a gardener who has taken marijuana to overcome the horrors that her husband faces after her death. Despite the intense efforts of Tumac to produce humor, my film fits flatly on my face, as my wife and I are worried. Read all the warnings to succeed in British comedies. It's a fat.
