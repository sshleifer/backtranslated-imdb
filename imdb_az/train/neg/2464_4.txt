The First, Possible Planet, but a lonely, or 'disappointing' part of the Devil's Pit. As you can see, he blows something out of the pit - nothing to the pit. Then the ages led to the drift of round air flows to destroy the story, the Beast intelligence was empty, so I did not expect any doctor / no-one. TARDIS is a way inside the hole even though TARDIS has not gone through the crust since long. Finally, there was another reason for logical reason - I mean, do not drag Beast Hole after the pit opening? Why not take it every year instead of seizing it all year ago. Why or Why not - I can go, but I lost interest ...
