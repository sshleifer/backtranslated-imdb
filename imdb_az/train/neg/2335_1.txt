Created by those who did not believe in this film, perhaps hoped to give milk to the classic title of a genuine film, "Veda, of course, Lovely," will make a thoughtful thought in this way. Heroes are very bad and unappealing, because they are justified by the cold reception at the first release. Time only makes her absurcity. Not one of the plot was based on a complicated and meaningless criminal conspiracy, which could easily result in several arrests in a matter of hours, instead of being exposed to cinematography, despair, or hopelessness. Probably, if not enough, at least one participant has thrown an entirely nonviolent attempt to erotica not to worry about bathing for several days. It was only a bit more painful to watch this mess. Instead of spending two hours on this failure, find a good classic forty years.
