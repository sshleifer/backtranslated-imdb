Compared to other Columbo films, this can only be 1 (terrible) degrees. I do not understand what other viewers are seeing in this horrible accident. <br /> <br /> Another commentator claimed that Falk was only directing and interfering with his acting. role. In fact, in my opinion, the real reason is connected with the director of the studio, horrified when they see what they do with their money. This is a murder that has not killed a murder.
