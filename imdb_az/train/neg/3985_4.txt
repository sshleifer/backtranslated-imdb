The usual thriller associated with a woman who is afraid of cheating lovers as the bank believes to increase their bank account. Nicole Kidman plays cheating Tracey, married Andy (Bill Pullman) doting. <br /> <br /> An old schoolgirl named Andy's Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) returns as a surgeon, anxiety is not far behind. <br /> <br /> The Committee, with its unsuccessful structure, is an effective, thrilling tension and character-driven motivation, its background and development lengthens all demonstrations. <br /> <br /> Poor filmmaker Harold Becker is unable to enjoy any of the refugees and any of them while trying to resurrect an immortal deadly project. At least cinematography appeared to be "secret", though Massachusetts looked good. Also stars are George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
