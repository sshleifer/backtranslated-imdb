I've seen some pretty bad movies and that's it. There is nothing wrong with one of the worst coma episodes in a soap opera. I just did not want to touch that little girl because almost she was suspected of the film. Some blinging monsters were funny. I also saw a little "Silent Hill". And I read that it was done or seen by a fin metal band Lordi. So it is not surprising if there is not much miracle. There is no means to encourage and much more. The FX is very good, the appearance of the movie, monsters, and even those who are good. But the story and its explanation are not just there.
