I do not know why these fans are and I do not know why they gave me the account they gave me. This is unhappy. There are many chil- dren to postpone the blasphemy, draw pictures and upset him in the same place, and let some weak police officer finally have to explain what we have seen. However, this is very little, and it surpasses the sequences that are nothing and nothing related, even with the Italian standards we have to listen to a most common soundtrack. It's not a ghilo, it's a terrifying idea from Klaus Kinski's most terrifying 'sounds' outlet. I think he came so much that he did one day and cleared Mr. D'Amato for the rest of his life. Ewa is certainly very good, but not enough, and ultimately after a while, when we are totally interested in this stupid and ambitious nakedness on the whole earth, which created it. Maybe not just in the right mood!
