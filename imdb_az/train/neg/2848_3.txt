... I would like to have a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, if you want to see it in a lot of trouble - it is pumped for this role and it looks pretty good darn - or less. In a cave, there is an extended sequence, and it takes its place. There is a beautiful place where only Miss Eleniak is forced to flee behind the groin. William McNamara is a natural little on a polished side, but he has a beautiful, handsome handcuff. Also, when you quit your bed, you can see all the enchants, if you just stop your movement. You have to do this, and let's say half of the people who want to watch a movie about sea men on the "road trip". I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for his nervousness with equal opportunities. Can William McNamara move? You know, heck.
