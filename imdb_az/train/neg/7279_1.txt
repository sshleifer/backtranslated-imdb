<br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a local television station (Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio, Great Chuck and Little John, TV8's.) I did not hear this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> < <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If this material does not contain any real effort, <br /> <br /> It looks like a few small ideas left out of a variety of writing sessions, where it is thrown into a mixer, it's not just funny, and the "parody" look is good. some references (even for releasing it). <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, then I have not heard anything, it is really bad, Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even it's worse than anything else in a candle color. <br /> <br /> Adam says:
