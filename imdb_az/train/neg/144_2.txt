There is no way to describe how real this film really is. It's a shame that I really sat in this movie, this very tedious and predictable movie. What's wrong with here? Acting: There is no performance near the sub-currency remotely (atleast is pretty good at all). Soundtrack (Songs): "If we get Orgy soundtrack then everyone will be able to watch a scary movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with the keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Even "What is hell?" moments, here are a few: The killer can move at light speed, the door opens into an actress, nobody gets back, there is something sitting in front of him; The killer has a really great place with a powerful drill! Cinematographers earn points to place it at least, but I believe that the killer has taken the time to find the power to reinforce it. I feel like one of the guards at the head of the Holy King and where did you put the power to win? I can talk about how bad this film is, but there are only 1,000 words. I'll give him 10 children. A star for laughing and another star for all the fragmentation. Seriously, do not waste time with this.
