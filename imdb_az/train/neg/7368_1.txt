I am happy that DVDs have lost 10 kopecks for SS new film: Attack Force. Now, generally, I can stop my faith following such films. A pinch of salt and a dark night on the wall watching that some beers wait for a noisy night, ideal for an alpha person like me. <br /> <br /> I took this movie thinking I would see cool martial arts. Segal was old and bloated, even with SS standards, and it is quite strange to destroy Segal's activity (as it was originally). In fact, half of the voice was dubbed by a man who was calling something like that. Also, the SS's crew movement (polling station) was very scared because they could not properly record their voices. The sound would be sounded between the Whisper Segal and the Honda announcer! <br /> <br /> Most action movies work in the same position on this subject, and there's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Avoid hitting this movie in front of a high-speed train or a H5N1 bleeding dose. <br /> <br /> This is a public health alert.
