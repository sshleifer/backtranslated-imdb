There is no injustice in the bright fantasy novel of A Wrath in the ABC flat-TV failure. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle has brought children and adults to a magical, fantastic and original world as well as a writer at the same time. This novel is the first of its kind in the 'fourth quartet', a wonderful effect of the life, the universe and the time. Although it is easy to understand for any child or adolescent. His morality is spread in the book. Adaptation to this film can not be regarded as a lie of respect for Mr. L'Engle's work of art. Honestly, what did they think? The effects are cheap and ridiculous, the plot is soft and uneven, and dialogue is far too far away and every magical character of the novel has been destroyed. It was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. One day, a clever, decent director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuaron) makes another attempt to put the book on it and realizes what it really is: I sincerely hope. This adaptation can only be compared to the garbage, fake and inexpensive motel room art, and has no effect on the audience.
