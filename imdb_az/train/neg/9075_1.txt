In this film, three college-friend Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel) who want to graduate from the university after successfully completing their honors. The film continues until it differs from the most popular features of Nathan (Schwartzman). Nathan is blackmailed to have a dream girl because she can not follow the normal conditions. The only problem starting with the three problems, Dave is in love with the gorgeous and good-hearted Angela (James King). Unfortunately, it is not a bright genre movie. Schwartzman is watching the movie easily because his performance is brilliant. The king's performance was average, I think he would be hired to go with his beautiful appearance. Slackers reminds Americans of a different nature. Jokes are just as tasty as American Pie. But does not everyone use it? In my opinion, this film is a warning to genre directors. In general, there are a few smiley moments but in the action (except Schwartzman) and a terrific film on the subject. * exit *****
