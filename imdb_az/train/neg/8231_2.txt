<br /> <br /> At the same time, all eyes can be summed up in one word. This movie works best to get the most out of the movie 'Blair Witch' .... it does not work ... just someone decided to make a cheap video camera, a van and a movie. The story does not give any explanation, the hero does not give any real motivation (and looks like a taste of a strong suit compared to five girls) and there is no violence to talk ... just shouting and shouting sounds. The whole film happens inside a van, which is a decent decoration issue. Five girls are doing their best with what they really are good, but they seem to be pretty scary actresses ... though, in fact, it is difficult to judge if they really can do something. screaming, whining and shouting .... it's hard to put up with what it says at half-time, and the cameras are so bad that it's hard to say who you are. This video is painting itself as a violent torture film, but in fact, only five girls in a truck shouting terrorism ... just like the whole movie ..... after 5 hours we see it ending, and we are constantly screaming and all five girls still There is one with his finger. Only use this finger (finger ... LOL) for poor actresses who have lost their voices (and dignity) after making this terrible film. Do not judge by this poster .... will fall so much.
