<br /> <br /> If someone really wants to make a really bad movie, the "Mysteries of the Past" really create an excitement to measure the depth of the evil. <br /> <br /> Start with the surrounding pseudo-Chewbacca. The main character ... It looks like some shriveled "furry" suit, which is thrown from the clay. Work slowly, slowly, with more special effects that completely discredit the viewers. <br /> <br /> Secondly, take this movie away and find another one and a half hour.
