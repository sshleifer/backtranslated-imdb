I do not believe that this movie is comparable to most Argento. <br /> <br /> Basbug simply does not have the capacity to create real tension. Murder scenes - and, as we face it, this is all genre - we are not interested. It was not difficult to know who the killer was, and he did not really care when I was discovered. Cinematography is not memorable, and in the 19th century, many Gothic atmosphere did not attract me. A few actors are pretty good (especially a sadist girl with lords on senior teachers and little students), but they have anesthesia, sadomasosism and lesbianism, but they add incredibly little spice or cries . <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie movie, look elsewhere.
