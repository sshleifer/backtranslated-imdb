This film is extremely boring, a woman explains a story of a gas station owner and her life. No excitement. The director really "keeps the truth" and feels like a camera around a woman as she lives her life. The other directors were forced to watch for the director's class, while others were not boring. This movie was also watched for a task ... should be a good boringness with a good grade! Generally, do not watch the movie if it is not necessary. But do not discount other movies by the director because they are not bad ... They do not want to download other African films, especially when they are done by a western director.
