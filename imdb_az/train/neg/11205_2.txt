Yes, I'm sorry to disassociate myself from watching this strange little but long movie on Saturday night. Apparently, it was not the main thing to steal two hours of my life. That's what Antihero said in "There is no sad". We have such a terrible thing as it is not so rampant, unhappy, purposeful and difficult to attract, because it was difficult to attract the high-ranking businessman Jaemine to his eldest son. He claims to be another thing that is love. But after watching it, as Charles Manson likes to drag your beard. (Alright, it's not bad, but there's still no realistic feature). I can never have Jaemin's infinite bones caused by Sumin. It has never been demonstrated that Jaemin likes Sumin. Probably a culture that flies in my head: crazy / stalking = mad crazy in Seoul. More than half of the film is one of stalking and the last part withdrawal. Because I thought it was a vocal comedy. I'm looking forward to a tiger named "baby" to make a look. Okay, Sumin is busy doing two jobs while going to school, and someone who is trying to improve himself in a good way so far is good. But after his first taste involving his stalker, he refuses to do his day job for a kind of prostitution ring. Yes? Well, as you mentioned earlier, you can believe that unbelievable incidents can only arise if you do not stop because of obsession / job change and many other angry characters. The main movie is not 100% horrible, but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies.
