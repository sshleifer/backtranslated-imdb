The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression: Joeseph Conrad's Dark Heart, the river replaced by one way, and the ship is Jeep, Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> There are Muslims in some sections <br /> <br /> The United States has said it supports the 9/11 attacks on Muslims in the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < for semi-fictional accounts of actual events.
