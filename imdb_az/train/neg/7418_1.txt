Oh god, what a terrible, terrible film. If there is no comment on the state of society, this is in contrast to the vast majority of the worst of the worst. Interstitials performed by Jason Jones and Don McKellar, on the contrary, are the most striking part written in a tone designed to be reflexive and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Besides, these moments hate the talk of a person who has been insulted while talking to the camera and hides the "meaning" of the film down the throat. A point for filmmakers: Long shot and silent scenes do not fit into art. <br /> <br /> Fourth chapter or logic extends to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If everyone is interested in watching this movie, do not ask. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
