I was thrilled to see "Hamish Macbeth" published in the United States. Then I was in trouble to watch the devious thing. Connected with the magnificent Scottish Constable C.C. I love the books of Beaton. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well written. The authorities responsible for this rumor have never read one of the Beaton books. It has only to do with the series "Hamish Macbeth". Along with the lack of recognizable characters, I find all the shows with noise at a high level. Apparently, actors feel that they need to close their own lines and cry each other. If you are M.S. If you like Hamish Macbeth, who loves Beaton, do not waste your time in this trash.
