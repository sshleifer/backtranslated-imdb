In the first part, this "thing" is simply a very short-term signal of the stack camera work. The general plot, despite every potential for a tension, said the story could not be so badly purchased. In the middle of the film, the actions of the characters are not logical to me. <br /> <br /> For example, the idea that Edna had given her coffee after hitting her son's gun was the lower part of her claim; This is a very stupid idea. Domino can not query the splitting orders we received from Claremont Williams over a sealed phone connection; Should not Williams not have to doubt for a long time to leave them? These FBI agents are just looking at something that has every reason to look at the capital's mafia shooting with only one helicopter. In addition, it is quite a fury to kill Cigliutti and stop killing their information; If the FBI is investigated, it's fair to me. In fact, they were left out of the renovations, as they did. If we do not kill the majority of passengers, we have to see a mine accident that is normally the least severely damaged, but we leave all of them miraculously with some rotten ones. Unfortunately, the accident was not immediately established by Domino's predecessor events, but it is in line with the observations, followed by Domino's love for Choco. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes, starting with Claremont Williams's phone conversation, seems to be dramatic for me. This is a piece of terrifying, worrying-looking camera work that is avoiding a movie. I apologize for the tough efforts of the main actors under whose talent.
