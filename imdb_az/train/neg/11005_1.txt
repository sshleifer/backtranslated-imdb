This film shows a series of sketches that partly intertwine. The night I spent in the movie, I just got angry. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come without any punchline and just try to sit around it by using absurdity and colonialism. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, my personality and perhaps subjective result (my God, every time I say it to a movie): It's a courageous attempt to turn nothing into something big. But it failed. At least the director had done nothing outside of anything. But it's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many films did not look funny as planned, but all of them are over. The film's worst case scenario is a real-life manifestation. No. It's even worse to correct myself. Gags is so bad in a movie, they are not funny at all. It is not even fun to watch the horror actor, writer and director (all three on the road) drowning in the sea at the wrong movies. Film is too bad for it.
