God, what a bad thing! Oliver Stone wanted to see a trial or something (look at the terrible use of music and pictures), but why really? All that is behind the scenes of "naturally-born killers" are "surprising" in how the media can turn into a full trash can, but unfortunately the film is turning into a trash. Dear Mr. Dash, next time you want to criticize television shows to get high rates by using violence, do not hesitate to do the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said in a very clever way that he was insulting media fascism through fascist cinematography. The truth ... He just forgot to tell us about the massive headache that you got after sitting with this sore load!
