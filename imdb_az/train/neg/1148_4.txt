The chronicle of the Federal Bureau of Investigations is a small, very long setup. an airplane explosion is still a proper ending, James Stewart and attracted but quite promisingly with melodrama Vera Miles just had a habit of playing loud weddings under the pressure of Miles, and his outdated nerves were right here on the wife's schedule). Mr. Mervyn LeRoy donated this adaptation to the book Don Whitehead, but despite the talent involved, the picture failed to make a lot of impression. The best performance is the dialogue, transformed by Murray Hamilton as a Stewart partner, but the most funny and dogged pacing causes the movie to appear as twice as long. * From 1/2
