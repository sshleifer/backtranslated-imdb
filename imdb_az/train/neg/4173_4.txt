When I see the novel I am excited about, I say. Futuristic soldiers, vampires driven by genre veteran Michael Ironside taking bad habits .... in Space. I will not expect high art, but B looks like classic. Undoubtedly, there was not a TV pilot, and later became a feature film. Well, I'm going to start with a few good points from the movies, the action was enough for a lower-budget movie, and CGI and the places used. Now on the evil, first of all, Michael Ironside was barley and his performance here .... good cheese is not a good way. But as I said, he was not in anywhere, so it is not possible to blame him. Something really stupid is the PETA group for vampires, and I'm not joking, the most terrible thing I've ever seen and this is serious. Also, this film follows one of the greatest sins of the film B, it draws and delivers a lesbian scene. Most importantly, immersion of this film does not really happen. As the pilot is intended, the script is almost nonexistent and does not end up on a regular basis. Even the main treacherous ones are only coming to the end. No matter what the movie Sleaze and gore factor up, it's Vampire Wars. In the near future, I would say the main crew of the spacecraft, all very talented actors, and they put this confusion behind them and moved on to bigger and better things. There was nothing left to work here.
