Double-tap the movie again. To see what's wrong, we put it in three cars. Steven Seagal's voices have changed? Will he die during the shooting and should the studio vote for anyone who does not like him? Or was the sound disappeared on the DVD? After about 10 minutes, you will hear the real voice of the actor. The majority of the film sounds like the sound is recorded in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> If I had one copy, I was ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill. I rented it, but I will not do it again. Before I rent more of the movies, I'll check this database, all of them (fewer or less) are good movies. What you usually get when you watch Steven Seagal. Well, no longer.
