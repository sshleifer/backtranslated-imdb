Clark Gable is one of the worst films ever. Only PARNELL was obviously bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Gable - slammer (like a gangster talk). She hopes to do the right thing, but she just abandons it - either of them is not known, "she is on the family path". Finally, the accusation is doing the right thing, and on the one hand, it's a happy ending! They had forgotten that Gable should take the rap and spend a few years in hoosegard. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are the best here". With which standard? Best in the production of unwanted jams? <br /> PS - After saying this, my husband thinks Leonard Maltin will find me and think of opening my butt. Hmmm. But in spite of my interpretation, Mr. Maltin is the best repertoire and person in the planet (I hope he has canceled it). <br /> <br /> UPDATED - 2/2/08. For the first time (especially the ridiculous finish), I decided to watch it again because I did not like it. Sometimes while watching a movie I sometimes love it and I understand it's a little tough. I have not liked this movie for the second time while working with several films in recent months. That was the reason for the first half of the film. Harlow's character in the first half was incredibly stupid but at least convincing. But when it was sent to prison, it was all clich√©s until the last funny scene of marriage. The lower line shows that this sequence is a shameful mood - it makes no sense in any sense and makes the movie a logical tale instead of love legend about two shortcomings. I'm standing on my original look (despite all "PERSONAL SUPPORT"), and if you go from PARNELL and maybe from POLLI to CIRCUS, this can only be the worst Gable movie ever.
