Faat Kine has a really good scene. The character of the title is argued with another woman and Faat Kine sprayed her in front of her after being threatened. The scene is a scene because the action is also unexpected, strange and more fun. In an example, writer / director Ousmane Sembene gives an easy-to-follow character to tune the character of an interesting movie that can be watched for two hours. At the scene, a brave woman presents her courage in her actions. The other part of the film that he has presented for the rest of the movie is contradictory tones. <br /> <br /> The voice is everywhere. All movies should not be in a certain genre, but Faat Kine is not a genre. I guess it's a dramatic drama, though there are moments when such a great comedy moments (the sprayer mentioned before) can not be taken seriously. On the other hand, the film, of course, is not a big comedy for serious issues that make Sembene a picture. There is a way to mix together comedy and drama together. Unfortunately, Semeben can not find this balance. Instead, one scene follows one another in a very unknowable or illogical way, and puts two different tones in the wind. <br /> <br /> Faat Kine also has a two-hour problem with an extremely concise final. The film ends with a big party where all symbolic conflicts are resolved, and is not solved soon enough. The scene is likely to take longer than any scene lasted for twenty minutes. Because the rest of the scenes have accelerated to this point, and it is particularly difficult to endure at the final stage, with early start of the scene, and thus cause frustrating viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Faat is heavy on Kine. I'm not the audience for that. I did not feel anything in the characters and had nothing to do with the story. Perhaps in the story there are some people who find something meaningful and see powerful characters. But I could not do it and could not recommend it.
