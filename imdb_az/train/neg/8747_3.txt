AntiTrust could be a great tool for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut off his best scenes. In the scenes he is in, he is just a zombie. He's involved in a sub-plan for Getter's sub-plan, but he looks better at GetCenter (the director is guilty). The director's respect for Hitchcock was sharp. (Ryan Philippe's peculiarities may be that he does not trust Tim Robbin's qualities, and at least I think he's a respect for Hitchcock.) It shows scenes on DVD. Do not listen to the test audience.
