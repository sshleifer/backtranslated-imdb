I wish I could give him this movie. I went to the IMDb to check the comments after leaving the movie the day before I left. A commentary called the film awaited and unkind by a terrible dialogue. I have not gone to other people's opinions, so I spent seven dollars on this crap movie. <br /> <br /> The scenario writer was forced to jump from a cliff. When the fear movies are joyful scenes? <br /> <br /> <strong> It is disrespect for the people living in the Caucasus. Once. And I left the zone thinking of my research paper in English. <br /> <br /> And heroes were strange. My friend and I almost laughed when the excitement was over, and the main character said, "I have to get my mother's shawl!" You. Idiot. Shoot the shawl! A few steps away from safety, but NO, my mother's shirt (which does not fit this way) is more important than my health and safety. Knowing that the murderer knew where he lived, they took him home. God. <br /> <br /> Dude and I have predicted the entire film. And only when I say that she is hiding under the bed. "He stole his clothes and escaped from the hotel" and "This is not a murderer but a corridor detective!" moments. Movies can not be this subject. Disney films can not even be predicted. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to end my mortgage, it's a terrible movie. I am glad that I went to see it in theaters, so I will not get it for $ 15.00 and I hate it. It was just bad. It would be better if there was only one thing. After being pulled by the detective, he would have fallen into the same position as the killer had shot. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing her daughter down. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> If you see a good movie.
