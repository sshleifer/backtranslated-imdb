Let me confess. I used this video and bought it because Guttenberg was very sexy in her dress on the jacket. But there was another event inside. The film, in its essentially parody of special effects (high-visible strings and other paraphernalia) in the "Invisible Man" genre, has never been able to spell - in fact, it has caused all unusual insults - WASP competitions and real or imaginative homosexuals. In the scenario, every insult to a person was either homophobic or racist or both. This noisy sound begins to invite your nerves along with a sincere camera style photography and melodramatic story. But it is a last surprise. But when you get there, you pay less attention to trouble. It could have been a very bad, very good movie.
