Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered from the misery complex, hated my home, chatted with new people, and had a great sense when people hated me. But after watching an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my fortunes began to change. After 2 episodes, I started working on new things, dressed in fashionable clothes, and really feeling competent. After graduating from the series, I was selling many women to the sales department and often taking my local karaoke competition to work. If there is no confidence crisis and you do not know where to go, then you can take a trip to Poundland and get the DVD just 99p.
