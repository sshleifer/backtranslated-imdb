A stupid dentist sees that his wife is faithful. So here's no new story lines. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you enjoy talking to a dentist, thinking of the vomiting of children, or the full teasing of their teeth with a bloody horror, seeing (or renting) the movie. If not, move to something else (MY FAIR LADY, everyone?)
