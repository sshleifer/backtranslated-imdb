I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio production. I love movies with stars and I love the unknowns. I love any genre except drama, comedy, action-adventure, science fiction, mystery, western, horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and even love the bad guys, because almost no movie has ever failed to entertain or enjoy one level. <br /> <br /> I attended a late night show called "Cowgirls", attended by around 10 people. Less than half, I stayed alone. Soon, I could not tell you that there was anxiety in front of me, and I left it. <br /> <br /> Today's Cowgirls is the only movie I've ever been to. <br /> <br /> This is how an unstable, vacuous, trashy, meaningless movie will be described or its invaluable value. Perhaps this is always one of the worst films ever, at every level irreplaceable and indispensable. It tries to be smart, but the concept of feminism seems hopeless anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but her humor is rude and deserves to be torn. This is one of the few films that can spoil their etiquette. Demonstrating heroes in a way you rebelled against and values ​​their values. If you want to watch a movie, see "Water World", "Ishtar". Except for the new "Alexander". Read this and any book you choose.
