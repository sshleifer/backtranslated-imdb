Seriously, the reality of this show is very popular. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, just a spark twist. Let me start with the symbols. Heroes are all sized morons with high, exaggerated sounds like all wooden nails. The influencing sound could have been better. Then there is animation. MY GOD looks at my eyes only. Everything is very straight, very bright, very bright and very sugary. Then there is humor or absence. It's totally wrong! They only have B-grade jokes that are not so funny and then repeat them first. They throw me into some delusional potty humor that hurt me. And finally, the latest and at least the music. It's just an annoying thing. It is written on a child's computer and sounds like no emotion. I wish I had a score lower than 1, I really did. This show should be canceled seriously. There is a show I'm trying to escape as a pandemonium. When I hear the theme song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you have never watched this show, do not do it. Watch cool programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
