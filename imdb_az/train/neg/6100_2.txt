Put it aside (this is not a review of good intentions but its final product), this movie is written badly, overly and negatively. The story had a clear potential, but this story has no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. He was in doubt as to passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and other feelings. You know, you will not know anything about the performance of the leading actress in this movie. Everyone in the film is appealing, but in the case of Barton: Every sentence is a speech. The epic is about the most inhuman robot. It was the only scene in the board meeting and I understood it because I did it! Her idea is incredible in the context and comes with ideas that have taken a lifelong spirit that searches on the right. For example, when he sees a wounded person, he will begin to pontify the needs of the battlefield, protect soldiers and put white flags, and so on. It's like a movie that's played in a certain movie <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is fighting for Clara Barton. It is protected from humanity because it cheapens everything because scripts are written. The writer does not recognize Clara Barto and his script is based on the Britannica Encyclopedia. (yes, they were back) But hey, beautiful Technicolor! (for whom it is)
