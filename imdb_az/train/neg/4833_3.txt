Yes, this movie is a real thief. US politicians stormed some Awesome Oscars because of the US's desire for another war heroic film to boost the war for the ongoing war. I do not want to go to politics here, but it's clearer than summer. There is no real sphere, not a thing, but a shade of life. When I tell the people what the people want and do not want, I really feel myself in the 50s of Hungary. The same propaganda films were prepared at that time except for black and white. If you consider this title as an acceptable part of the "cool war of the United States", the movies you choose are even better.
