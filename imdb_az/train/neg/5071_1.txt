I do not even believe that this show continued during the show. I know that it's part of America's bottom. Personally, like David Spade, when I went to this original title - "Seinfeld," he said that he liked the show better. What is most disturbing about this show is an ambitious method of episodes that go beyond clear, basic sense and general humor. After a series of recurring scenes such as "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "Lucy and Ethel work in a candy factory," "suddenly hypnotized", really great shows are still funny. In other words, it is a great honor for the great program by the audience. The writers and producers of "Friends" really do not appreciate the episodes for themselves, in such a way, that nobody else will respect them before it even allows them to see it for the second time, but also with modesty and vigilance. <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, Hallmark Card-like Neverland is full of greetings. The true meaning of friendship? Want to be friends? I would like to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people are looking for work in coffee shops and as actors, but in some ways live up to $ 4,000 / month. apartment? Get real. I wish all this to be good for all those who want to move to Manhattan and those who want to live a life of New York with the Monarchs of Russia and Monicas. There is no one in New York who earns less than six digits. In spite of all this, let's be successful. Now close Soma and go.
