Nothing in this movie is funny. I have to give a randy ram libido, interesting and some laughs. Lying! There is nothing funny about the movie. For example, in the middle of a farmer's yard, the main character who passes through a hot pass is not funny; it is limited to his independence. <br /> <br /> Behold, dogs eat at any place, anywhere. The main character who does everything with everything, everywhere and everything is not funny. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider, in my opinion, is acceptable in the role. By doing so, I'm probably not a bad player, it's hard to describe the quality with ugly materials. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN-romantic potential (whether the main character is counting the number of animals that are romantically interested in), is ashamed of all things, and that should also be. All kinds of film actors act in a vacuum. <br /> <br /> If you just want to get bored with this movie, just tasteless, boring, recurring material.
