When I wrote the film in 78, I see and remember my family. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Ralph Bakshi has fallen in the middle through the animation process for this movie and has been forced to cut the corners of this production dramatically because it is primarily rotoscope that animation for people in the budget. The technique is just one of the many things that can be just animated in the most sensitive sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Because of the budgetary restrictions, there are some scenes that can be "people in front of the screen." The Ring of Rings and the Two Towers "one part has been further reduced. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> movies. <br /> <br /> This film is noteworthy to have a never-ending sequel. A few years later, a half hour and a half hours of private television was broadcast. I'll say all this, it was music.
