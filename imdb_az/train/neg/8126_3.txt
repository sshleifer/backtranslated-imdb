As it turned out, some people were terrifying. It is regarded as one of those cheerful horror movies that you will spend in the middle of the night, but there is no better quality than that. Actually, acting is not very good - I thought, for example, as Marianne McAndrew like Cathy Beck, was absolutely passionate - but several aspects of the main problem area are not really logical to me. Becks is part of a journey depicted in a journey depicted by John (Stewart Moss) and is sometimes a never-ending honeymoon (now romantic!) The part of the work is something related to the caves, which, in its turn, is strange. is it a work of one of a group of tourists through a cave?) but when he understands that he is a medical doctor in the field of medicine (that is, this relationship has completely lost me). The cave begins to turn into my mind that it should be a human-hybrid hybrid (though, when we see it in makeup, it looks like a kind of monkey) and the killing lamb begins. There is another problem. The first killing is a nurse in the hospital. At first, everyone thinks his death is an accident. The second murder is a young girl, described as destroying her throat. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells him that his death was like a napkin (a throat crash)? - How can anyone think that it is an accident? What's with the sheriff? Cathy's room is quite nonsensensive when it's hitting a scene in the hotel room and then almost harassed, and then everything can turn normal. It's also packed with one of the most disturbing songs I've heard in a movie, along with the last one that left almost everything unsettled. For all this I had something to watch. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get within an hour and a half. Too bad, yes - but not as terrifying as some people.
