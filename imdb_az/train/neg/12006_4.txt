OK PROFESSIONAL DRESSES WERE LOVED AFTER commencing with KHNH, the director Nikhil Advani takes the second half and is waiting <br /> <br /> He is patiently losing time.etc is 3:30 hours + movie. This film is watching a 3-hour sleep <br /> <br /> They had 6 stories, so why not? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian <br /> <br /> We believe in the story of Akshaye-Ayesha again, but soon we win, and that is more comedy, and it's a very boring comedy. <br /> <br /> We have Salman-Priyanka story. the worst, not just moving conditions, it makes no sense in any sense. <br /> <br /> We have a Sohail-Isha story to talk to you, and the trickery of the majority of other stories runs through trickery. <br /> <br /> The story of John Wylie is a good story. <br /> <br /> But then, when it comes to all the stories, the audience is bored and sleepless. In particular, Salman-Priyanka's story is good at Nikhil Advani's capture, some have good things, but music is weak in weak places, but many songs are great. Cinematography is beautiful, every story is given a different look, invoice and works <br /> <br /> <br /> The actors, after leaving the Govinda Rocks, with the BB, actually make her laugh and love, despite her age and weight. Anil Kapoor feels good Anxana Suknani can not be dismissed <br /> <br /> Selahaddin Han is very superior and has nothing to do with Jesus <br /> <br /> The Prophet (saas) said: "I love you, it's a standard that feels like throwing it, it's getting better toward the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is good Shannon is good
