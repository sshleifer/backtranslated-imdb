In the first 10 minutes of this film, the main character writing a life-advice column, has turned into oh-so-cleverly and will have tables for learning a number of valuable life lessons, Perhaps you have something wrong. The rest of the film is predictably predictable, though it's not as good as it might be. Recall that Steve Carell's stalker-business behavior is not embarrassing, funny. It is difficult to believe that the character of Binoche will be of interest to him. Finally all this is so beautifully wrapped up and everyone is happy then. This is a great American!
