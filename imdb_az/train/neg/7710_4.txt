"The Killer Tomato Attack" is mainly based on poor merging images in a movie search. The arena has no meaning, and the various symbols fall inside and out of the picture without any explanation. Looking at this unnecessary confusion, you can get more and more feeling when it comes to accurate capturing a large number of commentaries: it's easy to use a cheap, high-quality movie, and then use an "parody" angle as a pretext for cheapness and low quality. Women swimmers are horrified, how far go to "cursing suspicion" - is it a parody?). The title song is great even though. (* 1/2)
