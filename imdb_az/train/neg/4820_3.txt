As a teenager, I was pretty much into the Bigfoot thing - I read the book and followed the traces that were reported. As a very tired adult, I have now abandoned the great boy, but when I come across one, I will not watch a single movie. I was a little acquainted with the story of the Mayan event in 1924 and the two events that Teddy Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt had made in connection with the Bauman event in 1850. The film has been given for the sake of a couple of events, both of which have more acceptable explanations, but the recreation has been completed well. At the top of the movie, Patterson's well-paid gifts still provide reliability. The sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very good and the sasquatch was a very creepy feeling as it was depicted mostly as shadows or past hairy feet of terrible men. Unfortunately, in general, these four things could have been about 20 minutes, but the film is less than a few hours. <br /> <br /> This is a fictional story prepared in a documentary style. The home of a suspected seafucker in northern British Columbia. A computer was targeted at one of the more entertaining scenes in the film - the computer used "vision eyewear" to capture a sasquatch that looks like a "soul" of the "Patterson" video! I would like to remind you that, apart from these 20 minutes, we are mainly looking at this expedition travel, so we are looking at many people for a long camping trip. Walking with kids. I told them that they were not worthy of any movie. Among the long stretches of the narrowest are some of the most spectacular scenes, some of which are resembling one another (some with canned images or even captive animals, wild animals), and scenery from northern English, from national parks in Colombia, Oregon. <br /> <br /> I understood that we never sasquatcher's real shape, so we did not need to deal with bad stuff. this is. 3/10
