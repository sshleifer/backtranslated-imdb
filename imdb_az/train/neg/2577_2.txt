This story was a different point of interest to me, the VHS that was done earlier enough to get something unprecedented. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In the hospital could be a very nice story about bad people and their different personalities - quickly turned into a very hard soap opera with different symbols. /> <br /> <br /> "We, Bloss (William Forsythe), have a stereotype racist white person who is the first to denounce every penalty in the film, which is very incongruous, and it is very pleasant to be surrounded by Raymond Hill (Wesley Snipes ), a woman who has a quick chat. "Snipes did not like the hip" hip "rogue roles because she played a series like" White Men Can not Jump ". <br /> <br /> Probably, there is sweet Helen Hunt playing a beautiful, loving "Anna" with a stingy relationship with "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz), heartwarming, feeling good, but watching these wonderful people melts in my heart, but this rebellious movie sleazy men If you are one of the lovers of sleazy characters depicted by ..... really like this! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and go there! Who would want more?
