Especially when I'm watching tremendous and tearful films, I consider myself a very melancholy. There are several worries in the film: 1. Despite the guilt, Ben was deprived of Real intention to rescue his life in order to save his life. I'm concerned that the film seems to have been promoting such a suicide. Some people might accept this heroic action and think that some of them are fearless, as a result of which it was an uneasy move. <br /> <br /> The movie story line is over-dramatized, but logic is very simplified. Naturally, blood type is required to be a body donor. At the end of the film, Emily was the type of rear blood that limits the chances of getting donors in a short time. Nonetheless, Benin Ben's blood type is a rare type of blood, despite its rarity but not just his heart but also its kidney and corn. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is not just the blood type, but the tissue antigen requiring his bone marrow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why doctors permit the forgiveness of their bodies, despite the jelly chain used to kill themselves? <br /> <br /> I can analyze the whole story long ago, all of them are just a movie. However, some of the worrying facts mentioned above will help you re-examine your plan to watch this movie. If you go to a soap opera movie, go. But if you're going to find a clever fun, give it a poor one!
