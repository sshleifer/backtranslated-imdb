The film began with a strong, LL Cool J (Leader) partner as a secret police officer with Sgt. Lazerov (Experience Dylan McDermott, possibly worse than a bad guy), is robbery and murder. The appeal denied killing a drug dealer who set up a clash with a conscience police officer. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey, etc.) sound well and promise in the movie. <br /> <br /> As soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is presented, the film begins to fall shorter. Given the opportunity to create a good movie, perhaps for a couple of times, or a teenage girl, and you'll see Timberlake just once, I would choose the old one. Even talented actors have to work hard at crafting; Timberlake is not talented and no hard work can save her. Given that he has been acting talent for years, I would have thought he would show a better show. Everything he does in this movie is not convincing. <br /> <br /> A singer sells a record of millions and does not translate automatically when it sells stadiums, that it can act successfully in feature films. <br /> <br /> <strong> N'Sync fans can not even see the obvious shortage of actual talent. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Pollack has several hollow spaces such as sudden sniper capability and deadly operation of warehouse vehicles. There was much talk about this movie. Completely disappointing.
