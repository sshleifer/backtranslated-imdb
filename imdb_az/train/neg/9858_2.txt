This movie is not funny. Only D & D receives nerd stereotypes and strengthens them. All the main characters are less than 30k every year, all of them live with their parents, they are socially defective and have no chance for women. These jokes are not horrific and imaginable, such a player was beaten by two Gypsy wounds because one of them was NCK's appearance (his magician's suit) and the other boy John Rocker (Oh, how funny it's a nerd who does not know about sports) . You might be a childhood high school student to find any of these items funny. Poorly mockmuntaries are very painful to watch, but obviously too cheap to do. I apologize for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I do not know, these are the only opportunities available to the past.
