I saw this movie in a fair, empty theater, in the first theater freedom. I believe them, when I look at cinema a couple of years later, it still remains in my view as the worst movie of all time; <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> 5 minutes or so Less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of kufr, each stage laughed for a while as it had just fallen. However, after a while, such suspicious pleasure was exhausted and only really saddened.
