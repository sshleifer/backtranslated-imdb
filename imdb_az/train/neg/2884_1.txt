It's my biggest responsibility to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen while working on a video store and keep my friends and colleagues alive. In the middle of one of the most intense discussions of the worst movie, my friend B.B.T. Killer, I can watch the entire movie, and if I still claim to be the worst movie in the previous selection, he would also watch. I lost it. I believe that even in high school, I have made better videos and this was a great achievement of a young genius. This film seemed to be a production cost (though it is striking, though it seems to be hit on a bad camera), but also in the movement (wooden, hollow and pitiful, unobtrusive) and just a bad movie. I can remember a scene I heard from the bottle signal and suddenly I remembered some of the bad schools (I know that I often go to school here, but this movie was too young), it seemed very fake, but as if people read their lines from the script, is not sure what's going on. My review does not make this movie fair because I can not describe how scared I am when I spend watching it. I say I'll do a ghostly job, describing a miserable excuse for a movie.
