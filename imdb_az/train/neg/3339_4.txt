Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has weakened his job by joining the memory of his father's son Barry (original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen) with the abusive upbringing. He is a spiral of madness and ultimately a serial. The battle to control the spirit of good (in the form of a gay man) and bad (in the form of a bald silent boy). This movie was dropped by some bad legends and unwanted humorous scenes. I can not say terribly or anything, you just say that Bruce Campbell is like a strange fan base (who I am). <br /> <br /> My Value: C- <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second comment by Kallio and voice director Joel Newport; A 17-minute documentary titled "Hate Every Minute"; deleted and stretching scenes; gets an alternative; outtakes, world premiere images; Poster & still gallery; Talent bios; and theater paper <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Scenario .PDF format. <br /> 2 Easter Eggs: eyes for a funny exit (left eye) and actual Easter egg in a minute (right eye)
