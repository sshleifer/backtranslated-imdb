Tremors 4: Legend begins, is boring and boring. All the moving scenes were foolish. This is called "GRABOIDS", but it is smaller than a modern day cat. this film was just an unnecessary film on the Tremor epic because the story is very indifferent and useless, even though the story of how graboids occurred. In the past, when you are in one of the other Tremor movies, you use Michael Gross one more time. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time. Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. Make sure you're away from this movie, but with the remote STOP button for a remote retreat.
