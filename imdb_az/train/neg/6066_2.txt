I was waiting for John Carpenter's episode in Season 2, because first, Six Burns was the best of season 1 (and I loved the episodes other than this season). <br /> <br /> It is said that the primary problem with this issue was terrible. The heroes who go out of the story behave as talkers and talk like Walker, Texas Ranger episode. The player was bad, and I normally like Ron Perlman, but the writing was terrible. I do not try to guess what the writers are trying to do, because it would be useless, but it seemed to me that they were trying to confuse horror with some social interpretations of abortion and religion. It is not surprising that there was a chance to stab some sort of religious or religious nuts and fanatical anti-abortionists. I am good in both ways, but I was so embarrassed that I was embarrassed to follow the movements of characters and talked to such stupid contradictions. <br /> <br /> "I do not believe that Carpenter can be responsible for most of the evil, but I say here" has chosen to direct the teleplay and is therefore responsible. <br /> <br /> True color and monster effects were good, but CGI's (two separate guns) were the same. Surely, low-quality CGI has never been OK. I often criticize CGI, but I have a problem with this principle. I have a problem with this implementation. While it is fine in some cases, technology is not enough to fit the "real" effects, especially when it comes to miniatures, and should not be used, especially when it comes to organic and / or living things. . CGI can be used in small quantities or it is clear that the entire film is animated. <br /> <br /> I will also take this opportunity to mention that the show title, Heroic Masters, is a bad hood. There are many actual "horror masters" around. Maybe two or three. If the show is called "Horror Story" or something similar, it would be good. But one of these episodes is criticized for not being a "horror masters" based on criteria and directing at least one horror film in their career. And even a good thing.
