A few years ago, I saw the movie "The Godfather" and made me a long-lasting impression, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the memorable actor and the story were classic. I recently bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1, I was also interested in watching Part 2 ...... I was very pleased to go to Part 2, early to enjoy a great fatherland movie here It was a step. just awesome and wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG !, would like to stop II. Storyline was not good, it seemed to me a story prepared for a story, the characters were especially poor. Pacino's protege was a poor character that would be a live meal at Godfather 1 or 2. Corleone scenes, all the choirs of the Catholic Church, all innocent boats, a helicopter car rifle at the meeting ('goodies' rescued and shot by everyone), a daughter and a 1 American pasta swimming unit, one of the most miserable shots ..... Corleone, Orange juice for diabetes (is not his intelligence and plot ready for emergency?) ... No, that's not good and I will not be able to watch again with the best of the world. But I will be watching the 1st and 2nd years.
