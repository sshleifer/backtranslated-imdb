Haunted Boat welcomes itself as 'Fog' with open water. In many cases this is precise. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that from this day, it is an open indication that it is simply a group of fear filmmakers. They fulfill all their creditworthiness in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> When you accept some budget, it is very difficult for special effects. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. However, it uses a lot of curls and shortens and blends you in a short time. The film is very good in terms of keeping you awake. You do not really have a direct contact in 5 seconds, but you really want to know what's happening. <br /> <br /> This is not Ghost Ship, but a T.V. I will definitely do it for one evening.
