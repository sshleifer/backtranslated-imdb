Oh, how good it is for people to get global warming to be a science, this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! <br /> <br /> Al Gore is trying to complicate this issue, even though it's a good idea to see all of that, a big mockery by a person with his own money making agenda! <br /> <br /> This planet? Assessing the activity of the sun spot. Who did not ask if this method was accurate? No, Gore is not himself! So, what is the accuracy of prediction of future temperature with solar spot activity, since it is correct in the past? According to the solar activity, today the heat should be fully compatible. Is the temperature in the universe equal (as compared to Earth)? <br /> Do questions raise the heat for the rise of Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use many common sense! It does not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out something other than a HOAX. Please examine it yourself. How does Al Gore and his elitist friends, such as Rothschild (a bank family in which a land acquired), benefit from this work? The new World Bank will be built on carbon credits, which is a tax for all CO2 deficits, and it is easier to avoid these taxes, if people only save the world and want to save the world. money, centralized control and more power to elite bankers. Al Gore has a company that sells carbon credits! Is it willing to pay voluntary carbon credits to save my world, especially to its company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe in blindness, carry out your research, and use your self-esteem, and I'm convinced that you will come to the right conclusion!
