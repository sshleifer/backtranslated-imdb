There is nothing like a movie about just a group of friends who just do not like each other at hate, but there is no indisputable quality as a spectator * or empathy. Good movies are very good (A la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films) and just plain evil (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "job"). Whether you're a perfect MSTie riffer (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000), the movie is unbearable for this movie. For this reason, I'm happy to be very talented (my mind works all the time), for those who are naturally talented at the MSTI, you just want to get your head in to the movie at the end, and it's almost an hour and twenty minutes you will never come back. Even my MSTi talent was a tough game to slowly and deliciously waste time. The most striking feature of this film is that it illuminated and / or financed one of the ... I rented the "Taboo" for the talented Amber Benson, who only had to blackmail this movie in a normal movie. I have a less well-known movie in my hire, I'd like to read better. The best part of the film is its impressive labyrinthine position, due to its inner position.
