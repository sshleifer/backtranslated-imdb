Cheerful, loud moments laugh ... and is not yet a comedy. I say, "You're sorry, I'm sorry for you," and then I say, "You're a bad bums," and, of course, someone pays online degrees in literature! The worst scrimp effects and field holes in the excitement of instant excitement, ridiculous movement, ZERO character development (even among the characters that meet .. know each other and trust each other) .. Oh God has land holes! To be honest, I wrote that I did not even watch all things, but for the past 30 minutes, I'm hoping that it will strengthen the tricks in the movie for the past 30 minutes ... Thankfully, we should not forget that we are a burden on a film that looks a bit better. Use your imagination for the consequences of this punishment!
