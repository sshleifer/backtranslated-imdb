Here's a movie that lets a movie make a movie unsuccessful. Horrible writing, bad deeds, amateur guides, funny special effects ... this is a terrible film. When you come to the end you will realize that the meaning of everything will not be a lie. After wondering what the movie is all about in the world where it was finally explained, the story was built on a ludicrously impossible foundation. This ugly "villain explains the whole movie" tells us that our murderous system is simply not able to accomplish and does not mean anything in its entirety. Oh, and then we found that there is some kind of jell-monster that is involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to show this movie as never before. For some unusual reasons, if you are having trouble sitting and watching this movie, I can offer this time to hit your head 104 minutes on a wall. This garbage sitting is a much more unpleasant experience.
