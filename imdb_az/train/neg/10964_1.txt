I was so miserable as I saw the Urinary Film Festival. As a whole, the sidewalks were a disappointment and this was the last nail in the coffin. I was very excited about the beginning of this film, which is an immoral admirer of Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books, more than just watching it. If they are normally treated well, I am amazed at the modern reality. Usually, in a familiar story, it is interesting to see parallels to the past and the present. Unfortunately, this film was less modern retelling and pop culture disorder. The adaptation of the original looked like a youth, and it was a whimpering tone. Perhaps, it did not help the actors too good. Many speeches were laughable as I was trying to write badly or badly. Once in the film, I did not laugh. All the jokes were obsolete references that did not come to an end in time as they did not think they would lose their boredom over time. Indeed, the only point of the film was the opening sequence when it set out to meet White Rabbit Alice, but then it was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I have to say that the kroquet game is a rave dance. <br /> <br /> The downside of the film is undoubtedly. Do not watch this movie. After the event, I was really angry.
