I do not want to say that this movie is terrible, because I've seen worse, but it's half worthless. <br /> <br /> The dead are very confused. I did not really understand what happened and where everything went. When the movie was over I shook my head. I looked at the end of the loans, after which there was something, or after the loans were over. Throughout the entire film, I felt that I was contrary to the weak points of war, and there was little or no passage between them. <br /> <br /> Character development is very remarkable. I could not understand because someone was angry or upset over others. Half of the heroes were just drunk, stoned, mentally challenged, or a bad actor to portray them. This film is hard to avoid using stereotypes (apparently it is difficult to prevent using a movie about a singer in a rock band), so many other films have shown more characters. A test of a heroin addict that is exploited by an abused child or trying to be cleansed. Stereotypes are easy to describe, so bad movies cause stereotypic characters to emerge. On the other hand, this movie uses stereotypical symbols left and right, but then tries to make it as improbable as possible. <br /> <br /> It seems that a problem with heroes appears without explanation. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is a very short time consuming character. Because, indeed, there is no chance to know any of them. Sadie's singing. Terrible. Music supporting him is not awards, but drowns in the voice of Sadie's vocal cords. There is a point in the movie that sings a song of at least 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Generally, this film is in confusion. Characters do not develop badly, Georgian actors are wooden and tough, Sadii's character does not give any other story or explanation to one of the worst situations. The music was unbearable and there is no good reason to see this movie, though there is no thirst for cinematic pain.
