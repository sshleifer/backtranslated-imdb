I'm expecting a good movie to Sky Captain in 2004. <br /> <br /> It was positive at nearly every point in the film, the effects were attractive, prejudices were convincing. <br /> <br /> Of course, the disappointment does not really describe the feeling I get from this movie. <br /> <br /> Besides being silent and weak, this movie causes 2 out of 10 stars because everything in the movie has been stolen from another source. I understand the difference between respect and theft: it was a theft. More importantly, cinematographers do not try to move or move to a point. They just stole to show. At the beginning of the film, there is no point in showing a film of the Oz Wizard of a theater that stole another scene from the same movie (I do not touch it). Of course, every conception in the film was neither the old concept nor the original: robots made of pulp era reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the latest film, The Iron Giant, recently known as Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace minion of the monster's silent martial artists used in countless films. <br /> <br /> The theme of the real movie, most of the performances was completely wooden. Perhaps this is because the entire movie is taken on the blue screen, because computer imagery ends with everything from the actors. Surely this is not an excuse for poor behavior. When a human being does not have any children, they realize that there is no excuse to try not to look for a vision. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film does not have humanity. Here the heroes are the only real people. Almost all antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters displayed during the film is counted on the one hand. If robots attack the entire planet, will not we see the masses of humanity escaping them? <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst movie ever, so I did not. On the contrary, the film is an example of everything wrong with modern action movies: the filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but without any artistic vision and originality.
