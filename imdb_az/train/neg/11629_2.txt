** SPOILERS ** XAMOSH is completely non-existent, there is no plot, and it's basically just designed to describe the stars themselves. After watching Shabana Azmi's shower, PSYCHO was the most notorious scene of the movie when she saw a television camera playing. This film actually awaited users to believe that the character of Naseeruddin Shah is a good memory to remember the places where certain shots were abducted! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER WILL START <br /> <br /> Finally, the killer smashes Shabana Azmi for a long time to escape the character of Naseeruddin Shah <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> The General Manager is a little humorous (just a bit) to hear and listen to members about each other's insults and hear about Sabbana Azmi, "Oh -t! " He says. <br /> <br /> Generally, baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ********** ** (2 out of 10)
