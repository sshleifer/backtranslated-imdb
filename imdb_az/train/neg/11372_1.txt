I've been using IMDb for years and so far I did not want to join the film commentary. There is a lot of trouble in this documentary, so I do not know what to say. I am not a Muslim or an Islamic researcher, but I know quite well enough to illuminate this one-sided view of the documentary. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is a documentary. Most of the documentary films I've watched closed themselves around a few valid points and then covered those issues with controversial comments and incorrect information. This, of course, is related to Islam: the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists in the world, and some are creating a documentary about Islam about a small part of the Muslim, but radicalized people is quite misleading. This is not really a documentary about the roots of Islam and much more. <br /> <br /> There are a few points that can help you here for those who want to explore some of the issues raised in this documentary. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the document. <br /> <br /> The document focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside that region. Compared to Saudi Arabia, more Muslims live in China, believe it or not. Approximately 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the document is questionable. While watching another translation, I was watching a documentary and surprised by the differences. I've been warned about the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary shows that Surrah says that the unbelievers will go to hell. On the contrary, I read: "Those who deny the truth among the People of the Book and among the Companions will be in Hell." On the contrary, those who deny the truth are those who know God and the truth of God, and who decides to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film does not have an Islamic morality, but that's not true. While it is true that the Qur'an and the hadith are numerous, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf" or "normative behavior." <br /> <br /> In the document, the "East" (Islamic Law), "Honor" is the united body that all Muslims will follow. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic laws and they go from progressive and modernist to fundamentalists in the legal interpretation. <br /> <br /> The tradition of the hadith is similar. There are thousands of hadiths and every law school accepts and rejects others. What is the choice of the quotations from the history that are consistent with your wishes and with longing without serious scholarships to determine which of the hadiths are true, real and applied? <br /> <br /> He is a wife. <br /> <br /> Spouse, doctors of the Christian RC, and so on. I know that suicidal bombardment is not the same, but the righteousness of fundamentalism is a matter of controversy. If you think you have the answer, everyone should be wrong. But if you have a reputation, you can work with politics, religion, God, or other people's thoughts about anything.
