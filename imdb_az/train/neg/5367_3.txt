I've seen every episode of this spy. Considering the expectations of the first season as a success of Gri's Anatomy, I thought it was a decent attempt. That's what I continued to watch. I'm afraid that the second season does not have the gravity, chemistry and, most importantly, its predecessor Gray Anatomy drama. Relationships appear to have appeared and that's the case. There are no intelligence and comedy instructions in GA. Formalization does not feel shaped and attractive, unfortunately, PP is not. I liked the participation of Kate Walsh in GA. Kate Walsh's life in Los Angeles is simply not interesting.
