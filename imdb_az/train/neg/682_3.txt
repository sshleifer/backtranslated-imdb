Please Please: I see different works, the original silent version, and the audio version of the same movie. I saw the sound version and was aesthetically light. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a reputation for being a filmmaker and that Louise Brooks is there, some of them are original and long-haired. <br /> <br /> After that, a little cult is a very technically weak film. Although Hollywood has been a lot for the 1929 vote mode, almost a mid-30s, many French films were mostly silent films. With some information and sound effects, the movie was shot low. Many lip movements and, in particular, this movie, do not fit into the published words, and explain how this can make a French movie like an American Ms. Brooks. It's just baseless and just a silent movie, but as a silent movie, it would be an average camera - a great camera work (sometimes) and sometimes a decent silent style. <br /> <br /> The problem I found with the film was a very simple plot. In the 1920s, the game would be good for a silent morality, but until 1930, the plot was somewhat clever (meaning "slutty" rather than "old"). A woman earns a beauty contest and her mao fianc√© can not handle it. He gives everything temporarily, but it is back for the fancy life, and this is the end of magic! A melodramatic, huh? But also a little simpler and less developed. <br /> <br /> Finally, the character of his fiance's friend (?) is very uncomfortable and unreal. Harold looked like Lloyd and abused most of the film and was selected by friends and everyone. She just picked up the movie and came up with no resolution, it seemed her character was already there, and she was medically encouraged to receive treatment. Did the controllers laugh like that abuse? <br /> <br /> In this period FAR has better French films (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others). ) and better silent movies. I can not understand the high rating of this movie.
