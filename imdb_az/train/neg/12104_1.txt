Bill Maher's Religions are not an attack on organized religions. It is a Christian and Islamic attack. Apart from shouting one another to the Rabbis similar to the Sabbath rules of the Rabb, they do not actually attack Judaism and are angry when the Lord really opposes the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher pursued his own logical hypothesis, he would have realized that the Palestinian territories were based on the "holy book" of the organized religion of Israel. <br /> <br /> This film is proof that it is not entirely or entirely objective, or that it is in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> I see that it's hard to believe that a person is an atheist and even that smart guy. Everyone laughs at a religious person laughs and says foolish for his beliefs, but what can you offer for them? As I was told nowhere, he thinks I'm stupid. What makes a "rational" person in the room? <br /> <br /> If this is not true and looks like a fool in the process, it reflects in a way. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the true treachery of religion, how can religion really hurt human civilization, see Richard Dawkins's "The Roots of All Evil". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The religion of Bill Maher is not funny, It looks like an arrangement and dreams of an elderly person who is not interested in Catholic education. I'm almost sorry for her.
