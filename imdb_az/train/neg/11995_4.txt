I'm so excited to be watching this movie when the promos came out first in November. It looked awesome and songs! When I went to watch I was pretty imaginative! This is a movie that combines 6 pairs. There are more than 12 players! There are many stars in this film. I think the director Nikil Advani did not handle the situation well and there was not a lot of people in this movie as it was made easy for him. "Salam-e-Ishq" is far behind in comparison with Nickel's debut, "Kal Ho Naa Ho". I think Nikhil should shoot a small star. In my opinion, the best film of this movie is the song! The songs are great and I think all the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsan-Loy has done a great job and has done a great job over the years. I think the ratings of this movie can be great thanks to the song! Something I'm disappointed in my life is that the film, shot by director Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar, is not nudity. I saw this extremely rude family! Someone can find this nucleus like a comedy, but it's something you want to watch with your parents! I think it's been executed by the best player Salman and Priyanka, and I think it's a great movie!
