Nacho Vigalondo is very popular in Spain. He is a bad kind of showman who feels sick ... Very embarrassed. Nacho has made some advertisements on television, and I remember one who was looking for Nacho as Paul Mc Carney (about the commercial Mc Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie resembles a Nacho trade: bad storyline, bad leadership and terrible speeches. I do not think it's such a disgusting movie at Kodak Theater. Rich Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho's wife, this 7:35 producer, could do with a very well-connected woman with Spanish TV businessmen.
