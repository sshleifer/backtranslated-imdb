This is the most terrible film I've ever really seen. <br /> <br /> Manufacturing standards are severe. <br /> <br /> <strong> Cinematography here is no excuse. Camera work, scripting, action and sound are incredibly strange. I think there is a plot, but we have only 10 minutes to watch. <br /> <br /> Hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this work have no credibility. <br /> I urge everyone not to spend time and money on this Wealth. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
