The East Palace, West Palace, along with Frank Sinatra in the role of police, reminded the Detective a bit and William Windom boy. This is a progressive film for China, but despite this, homosexual women continue myths about the subject of femininity: many men are made of Chinese myths. The film is in the center of attention of a neat person who wants to lead a man to the advantage and loss of a mace. The park is watching without fear - he hopes to be taken to the station by the officer. And in fact it happens. Then he tells the story of a lifetime when the officer was subjected to soft tortures: for a while he was thrown out, handcuffed and punched. This is what gay men want and secretly the gay man is in a difficult situation as a police man. The story is tolerable about gay life (including flashbacks), but when it begins to tell the old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It is a pity for Chinese ghosts who only want to fulfill their traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I'm not interested.
