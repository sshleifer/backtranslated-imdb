Err ... this movie sucked. Many. <br /> <br /> I read some of the other analyzes. As you can see, there are many people who write Woody Allen or think that the stars are something good automatically ... <br /> <br /> I watched several films, hopefully something missing. But they just sucked it. Poorly written trash. Heroes are all very stereotypic (not too stupid). Area ... I think it should have been mysterious. I'm not sure of that. The character of Mr. Allen ... Woody Allen, in any of his movies. <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of Woody Allen, watch this movie. If you are under 50, do not worry. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen and you're 50 years old ... well, you're atypical, I do not know what to say.)
