Ronald Reagan and a group of American soldiers are camping in the North Korean Camp. They are subjected to torture ... North Korean communists are studying bad people ... We learn that Americans' beards are slowly developing in the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but finally blurred in this movie. This was the scene when Mr. Reagan went to the communists to say he wanted to be on their side. Then he asks a glass brand. After that, the stone-cold moving moving, he is the dressing companion Dewey Martin to get sulfur to heal Mr Marty's assassination. Of course, North Korea's communist armies are inviolable as they come from. Thus drunk Reagan takes care of a box, though it goes to get something in the drawer next to empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes should contain something; but, of course, Reagan is causing enough shock to reveal that they are empty. I had to laugh! I think that the "prison of war" will appeal mainly to the family and friends of those who work on it - on the contrary, it is lost. <br /> <br /> War prisoner (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
