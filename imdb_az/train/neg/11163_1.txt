We loved Rock and Jack Black. It was not possible to see this movie and to go. In my life, I thought the film was too bad. My wife also hated me. Only funny parts were trapped. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the cinema and called for people to keep their money. The writing was terrible. The Spanish people had all kinds of terrible stereotypes. The film was not long, but it looked like an eternity. The people in the theater were very uncomfortable, and it was as if they were dying silently. I was convinced that my spouse would probably have some distributive parts, but it was not. Save money and time.
