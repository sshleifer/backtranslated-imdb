First, here are some things to do: a) I am an anime fan - I always have a problem (I've always been watching Speed ​​Racer in preschool). b) I love B-movies as they are cheerful. c) I like the movies of Allahzilla - a lot. <br /> <br /> When it comes to movie the first time, it will be your usual B-movie, it looks like falling into a unique FX. suddenly BOOM! Anime is coming! When this movie goes down WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is so bad and inexpensive, even more than I remember from SPID RACER, for cutlets! In fact, it's so inexpensive, that one of the few scenes from the movie reminds me of "me", when a group flies out of school ... and still the same guys! FX is also terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Additionally, animation-to-live transition is unmanageable; dialogs and sounds (especially my English dub) were strange and begged my dad to get a tape from a DVD-VHS player; The only thing that saved me was to get jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (season selection). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy the movie and at the same time will survive. Heck, I'm a B-Movie at Halloween. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Watch the same movie at the same time, I'm going to give this movie 3/10 because we felt unwillingly unpleasant. (According to my assessment scale: 3/10 is almost as boring and bad as well. If you do not find a way to have fun, you'll be entertaining up to 15 as entertaining to three)
