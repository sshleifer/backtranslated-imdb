Come to draw this movie and look at the wonderful range of talent: Kelly, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They say they will not be able to keep well-released bad scripts. The story line requires a large number of viewers to believe that its inaccuracy can even exceed Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original and "curls" are terrible tyrants.
