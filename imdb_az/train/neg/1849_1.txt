It was interesting to think of a movement that might be a rough diamond, but what I found was bad writing, horrible management (although the drawing schemes are not disrupted, the director is going to say what it is, looks very surprising and immature) edited by anyone with 2 VCRs and stock was low budget video. I was not the simplest thing as a mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to find out how to make a movie director, but edit, and so on. As well as a sandwich, there's been a lot of effort in this film. It would be okay, but this is supplementary work.
