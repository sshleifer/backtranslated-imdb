I do not believe Muncie City is so difficult because they want to embarrass themselves by letting this show take place there. This show is like a slap in the face of the harsh law enforcement officers working hard. I have not seen anything so foolish in my life. If they have invented a comedy that can be anything, it is not a lie to say that it is true. Only once I saw and was afraid of what I saw. I wanted to see the little man begin to chase with the bad guy. Which would be a joke. Nothing in the show was close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the Police Chief and all officials must hang their heads and never want to come from that city. Not surprisingly, it is not on television
