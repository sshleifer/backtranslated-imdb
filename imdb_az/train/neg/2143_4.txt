I grew up watching the original Disney Zolish and I always liked the tape a little worn out. <br /> That's why I'm thrilled to see Cinderella 2 coming to the TV and I'm really excited to <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> In fact, the super charm is completely NONE! <br /> <br /> If I recall that the character was telling a story through a song, it was very strange and almost brutal for me, and it did not look good on the noise of this movie. The best way to turn humanity into a human being is to read about how great it is to dance around and tall around, eating an apple and tucking around here and there a few small quips! In the ballroom, the old barn dance style has country music. Writers have forgotten where and where this story is. <br /> <br /> Cinderella 2 did not fear the original artwork and animation. The works of this film are very rude and less detailed. <br /> <br /> We see a section of the betrayal of peace, which will not feel right. <br /> <br /> The film itself could have been his story, and I think it should be alone. I can not say that I hate it, but I believe it has many drawbacks. Lovely Cinderella drops significantly from the original.
