This film was slow but tiring, and the shepherd was moving frequently to the ground. The character of Redgrave would not have been something like 60 as a woman trying to compete with Thurman for something like Fox's character (why outside). The title of the film should be "The Lonely People in the Lake". Players played as if they were in one training. It is possible to predict clearly. I do not believe this site is like a comedy!
