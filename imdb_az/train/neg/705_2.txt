There's nothing here about the fantastic Anna Rice book here. <br /> <br /> Some heroes - tense and striking characters - are brought to the screen and watered until they have no cause for work. <br /> <br /> Relationships between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the steady job between Marcel and Juliet? Dolly Rose Why is not the story narrated? What is Marie's aggression and the substitute for her greatest attribute (and fall) to cross the line and intend to marry her? What does the film end with Marcelin's beating in the hands of his father? We do not learn from Aglae that he is a bitch who hates her; Why is there no warning about this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for the performance, there is nothing better than the average, though it's possible because of a very bad script. The party's best, Richard is an actor, but the film's film is not enough to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like Dolly Rose, Jasmine Guy is also bad, <br /> Generally, it just scares. I would have thought it would be worse than any ANNI RICE EDIT EDITION, but ALL SAINTS EDITION makes this mess look like a critical hit. How is Rice going to be a prostitute, which will allow her to do the best of her works on the screen?
