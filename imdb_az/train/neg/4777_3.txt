The idea behind this film was good. Not too badly written. The cast of the FBI agent Sidney Poitier was a good idea and did a great job. On the other hand, Tom Berenger, in most of his films, knows only one feeling of anger. The character of Kirstie Alle could have been a great deal, and even once he had a number of possibilities, but the writer left us with the role of a desperate woman. It was not entirely compatible with the absolutely independent character. I'm not interested in Alley's operation. The film should have been completed in about fifteen minutes. The director dried the cow before the incredible last act. I will keep this in my collection just as an example of Poitier's speeches.
