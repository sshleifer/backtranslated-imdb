Spoiler ... if anything like this .... . . . . . As an admirer of Robin Williams, I felt it was necessary to get this movie as the first screen. Wow ... A movie that has worked harder could not imagine. In fact, the film makes a bad joke after each other that Artie will inform you and eat them after dinner. <br /> <br /> Some creatures are very pleasing to me, but this humor is not good-natured, or ribald ... it was just foolishness. Besides Robin Williams's fanaticism, there is no indisputable quality for this movie, just to have every movie.
