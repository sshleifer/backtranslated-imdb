I just watched Conventi the second time. I previously enjoyed it and thought that it would shoot a good drunken Friday night movie, some, some style, humor, and similar movies. I was sorry to say that I would not appreciate it much. One of the contemporary audiences had begun to review the episodes of the Cheese Stages as Satan's Evening, but lost valuable valuables. For the record I'm not even a big fan of the Demons night, but there were actually some things I really got about it. The convention is made of cheese, but not good. A sweet ceramic coming from the main girl (Joanna Canton's pleasant performance), goth girl and Adrienne Barbeau, was festering with absolutely the lowest levels of all the characters, moronic, insulting shakes. The film then challenges it with a great deal of lack of nudity, so despite the terrible dialogue, watching the characters and evaluating the good points of the film is difficult. The devil's nuns are original in design and can get very nice scenes, although the film is in a fairly clean state even though it's kinda cool. After Adrien Barbeau's appearing on the stage, the film is causing all the people to be killed and its misery. The stylized direction sometimes gives good results, sometimes the camera moves very fast. In general, it was a shining point for me, a movie that I could not prepare for what I hated. Those who love this kind of movie can love it more, but this is not a good time for me.
