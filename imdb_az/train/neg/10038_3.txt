The film does not have style, it means the original style. everything moves, the first speeches in the movie, songs, information delivery, etc. It seems to be copied, including. Yes, it was original, as it was originally, at first, the number of UP in a car and a few seconds later it starts to fall on a hill MH. There was a lot of movies in the movie :) Is there anything good in the movie? Yes, for kareena fans, if any, Bikini Kareena. For Akshay fans, her dialogues and action stunts. This is so. nothing else. So, do it at your own risk and do not blame the director or actors. The director is already mad and actors, I regret them.
