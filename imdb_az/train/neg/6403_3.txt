.... when it comes to the level of intelligence acting on this comedy. Perhaps the length of your length, "Can I do it?" "I need my eyes" (mostly) with dirty jokes. Many of them do not believe you know for a short time that you have to be punchline (eg Santa Claus gag); others do not believe you have understood that it's been a lot of time to build this punchline (eg students' rewards) for so long. And almost without any craftsmanship. Do not get me wrong: nearly every 10 jokes are really funny (iron / phone is probably my favorite). Again, the body of the woman, especially in the natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there are also some comedic men's nakedness), which proves there are many beautiful full frontal nudity. And I deliberately agree with others that the deliberate stupid hood title really crap! But none of these reasons are enough to give more than four films.
