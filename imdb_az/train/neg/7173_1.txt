I hate the plane crash ... All! In fact, I hate all of them with passion! First, they are cheap looking and no craftsmanship! Secondly, they are insulting the airline industry and tell people who explain what all the aircraft are ... EYES AND MORE BUY! <br /> <br /> Why do I look at such a cinema? This can cause bad results for any of us and the characters shown in the film ... the only cold weather of such a catastrophe rope. I hate this movie because all 50,000,000 pieces of stupid plane chaos before that! The catastrophe resembles all others: the clich√©'s overflow is nothing more than a dramatic scene of debauchery. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are those who are in the trap of flying: The three-person Cleaver-esquire family, yuppie baastard, and a flight attendant's bitch completed in 1987 with a great bandage. treachery to anyone who is at least afraid! <br /> <br /> My second sense should not be a full-featured movie, but a documentary that describes everything about Air Canada's "Gimbli Glider" event is to the "danger" security. /> <br /> My third and last passcode with all airline films (except Fearless) of this table Why paradise men's steward passengers gave instructions to remove shoes there? (I understand high heels and sharp, empty objects, but c'mon!) I want them to be more advantageous than the f # *! If this plane (passengers) did not know better, they knew that the land would be destroyed. Why 100 people can be injured down from a rubber slide, which can affect skin peeling and movement on the socks in the trash! <br /> <br /> Unusual and hit ABC series "Lost" has more depth and more realism in the air disaster "only aircraft crashes - stewards who are afraid of people have wheelless seats, shoes and shoes without jackets and so on. ) The same old purple at the airport in 1975! The crash film of the catastrophe was typical of me and I came to the cabin of Charlton Heston or Peter Grave cursed <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freefall's director, Hack! Why should we sit for more than an hour and a half? Wannabe rehash at the airport, and now I hope they will not make such a plane crash. It would be something to watch if the ABC series was like "Lost", but it was a bit wrapped and then a part of it. Stop airline crash into "Airport 1975"! It's not a "airport", it's a cheap cheap waste in my time. I will not invite everyone to my worst enemies for this movie or an air disaster film prepared for television.
