Yes, he did not like this movie for religious values. <br /> <br /> The director of the "Commando" film shoots the B-movie, but it's hard and unwise to think of a good B movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> '90's flicker, but the film's first movie should remind about 80 moving movies when this type of B-films is always high. These films have always been overlapped and have not paid much attention to the story or player. All this flying around, massive muscle heroes and bullets. There are all the ingredients in this film, but I have not watched this movie as long as I watch such films. <br /> <br /> What's really going to happen is that the story and the works of that kind are basically as bad as in any other genre film at that time. <br /> <br /> Probably the film is too ridiculous for a long time. All of these films have anxious moments, but this movie is just full. War, Dolph Lundgren, shirts, heroes, story. All this is not very good, because there are many things to say. Even the story tries to give a little meaning, and even what is the main plot of the overall film? His story is really all over the place, and the battlefields, weapons battles, and so on. It looks like it's written to create a movie. And these serials are not really good to watch. This Dolph Lundgren, first of all, will play a great hero hero, Dolph Lundgren, who will play the star of a great hero, how he can handle guns and other weapons, and, of course, Tia It's a girl who plays Carrere. All of this brings us to one of the worst montage sequences in film history, and I'm really one of the worst sexual sequences I've ever seen in any movie. Both are too ugly and just too bad for words. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really work. Good guys are police, but they are not the same. They just kill around them when they are not responsible for anybody, and they do not want to arrest anyone or give information to anyone about their discoveries. Even if he did not find a great Japanese murder syndicate, L.A. trying to get into the streets, and a brewery works like a drug factory and a cover for large-scale drug smuggling. Also, think about it for a moment, what is the overall purpose of Brandon Lee's film? <br /> <br /> <strong>
