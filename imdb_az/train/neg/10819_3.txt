I agree with one of the other commentators about good story and good actors, but I would say that I fled. It's about 24 years since it's a school book. But I noticed that Jane Eire had to know the story, and when he left it, it was not. For example, Jane & Mr Rochester spoke toughly and suddenly offered marriage! Actors do not have the time to know how the audience feels about the nature of everything that happens in the story. Actors are good, but this is not enough time to justify the story. I'm sorry to say, but I really did not love this version. Susanna York and the 1970 version of George C Scott will be my favorite video of Jane Eyre, but you will have the BBC mini series versions of Zelah Clarke in 1985 and the 2 major roles in Timothy Dalton. I love it, I watch it regularly. There is a short version of the full version for 225mins or 330mins.
