Hey, Arnold! slowly and a bit boring film. Land is not very creative. Paul Sorvino's character (Shenk) purchases all of the low-priced buildings falling down to build a large shopping mall, shopping complex and office buildings. The children's films of the 1960s are back to this question. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is not so excited, so his thinking as a bad man is not very intimidating. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the film, Arnold and Jamal's document, must be found with Helga's help, and his father hopes to be rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children need to move around the city on buses, and therefore the exciting discovery scene that deals with the bus is not just a matter, but the fact that this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the television cartoon is usually very entertaining and has enough humor to appeal to adults. Television animated film is usually faster and more creative than this movie. Hey Arnold is about five times more sedate and it's a great way to get everyone to sleep, including children. Hey Arnold was a difficult one to predict and stay awake all the way until it's completely boring. This is what you want to send your children to a completely untrue film. Instead of trying to shoot a 90-minute movie, the producers began with a 30-minute TV cartoon article and tried to extend it to 90 minutes. This Mall Story can definitely be covered in TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will add to a better writer, if there is no result.
