Ouch! Not so much worse than this terrifying adaptation of C. S. Lewis's favorite novel. While the adaptation is quite true to the novel, the toy is simply horrible and the set and special effects are equally scarce to a school game. The budget for the miniseries was that the budget was the largest that was given at that moment, but they were pulled to do this because they could definitely be pulled together a little more than $ 2. The worst of all is Mr. Beaver. I knew that computer effects were not at the required level, or even inefficient, but the costume shop guys were strange. It's best to cut the character in the movie better than this one! Avoid all costs.
