Why I leased it was just written in Fangoria magazine. This article looks interesting in the article. Yes, that's not it. It was a very dull, amateur-written and directed movie. All the actors of this film, Faye Dunaway, are always happy to watch. However, Gina was often targeted by Phillips and ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentine accent, you can only grasp both words. Nicholas Pauls is also in the hands of Gina Phillips, who is very fond of love. Bottom line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene, and this is the last five or ten minutes of the movie. I would give this one star, but I gave Faye Dunaway a lot because I loved it. But it was not so good.
