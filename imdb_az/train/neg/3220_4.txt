After spending just one hour on a movie, I absolutely hate it when a movie comes to an end. and what happened with this movie. I was interested in his actors and believed that he wrote the source story of malamud. I'm not going to read this story, but I do not think it's the end of the story. Because I have a library, I did not pay good money to see or rent it. ohhhh such a great move (especially if his wife was such a perfect) loss. Like a Jewish huh? !!!! Now it was funny. I have not studied its structure, but as a director it lost its marbles or played 3/4 through the movie. Before this point, a story and characters were developed, there were a number of dots, and often did not wasted. but for the last 1/2 hour, I do not know what it is if it is not the most nonsense, the most worthless effort I have ever witnessed. I hate only when I destroy faith; It feels like a violent act.
