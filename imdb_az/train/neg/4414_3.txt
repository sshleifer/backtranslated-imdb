Christopher Durang had to be taught by a memorable horrible nun, because he was not able to leave the concept alone. At least in the Hollywood - "Sister Mary Ignatius All You For All" presented in exactly the same tone with Diane Keaton's lecture scenes. Brother Mary was a spectacular lamp, a delightful religious and very sophisticated headman, and a bitter satirist starring by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that it has taken this exaggeration quite seriously and at the same time protects the same tone as "explaining all this". Two approaches are overlapping, and in the last twenty minutes, the film goes off, goes into the stream and explodes. There is no surviving survivor. With four old students, the sound of the scenes and the encounter with the sister Mary would work if she were with the Blessed Mary scenes. Or Sisters Mary's scenes were presented more realistically. It simply does not work.
