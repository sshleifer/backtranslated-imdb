To begin, I'll feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why and why. Finally, when you understand something, you realize that there is nothing more than just a wrapped pure opera that deals with adult whores, dead mothers, and illegitimate sons ... The characters are very weak and actors (especially young people) appear to be very reliable. <br /> <br /> Only Marisa Paredes is different, but she is not a great actress, even though the film is a clean garbage. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno is dibutant Pablo Malo's good intentions and he has taken several scenes, which are quite intense ... Well, maybe next time <br /> <br /> My degree: 4/10
