A typical Goth Chicken (Beatlejuice and Rainbow Harvest, looking at a cross between Winona Ryder in Boy George) bought her, and her mother's old hooded mirror anastasia, where she found a new home (horror), Karen Black, just about something good about this travesty). The actor's bad laughs (especially when Rainbow interacts with the mirror shown above) and there is no fear or retreat. This film is not intended for 3 sequels, thus making it less strange than the last 3. Similarly, people with a similar, but more superior cinematic effort, will be advised to find a geeky girl's old curse compact mirror by calling an episode "Friday 13th Series." <br /> <br /> My price: D <br /> Eye cream: Charlie Spradling provides mandatory T & A.
