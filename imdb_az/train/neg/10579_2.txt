The IMDb was banned in the United States, according to Takashi Miike's Horror-Sector, citing the Imprint. <br /> <br /> I thought that I would translate the Swedish interpretation I wrote for me ... <br /> <br /> It was difficult for Ichi to have no expectations. The Killer-director Takashi Miike's Horror Masters series. <br /> <br /> Describes a fairy tale of a journalist in the 19th century explaining the event that took place some time in a remote Japanese border. Comomo promised that she was behind her and promised to return. Tired and hated, she hopes to be the end of her long journey. One of the prostitutes tells him of a deformed and quiet girl knowing about Komomo and the helpless man's whereabouts and what happened since the moment she left him. <br /> <br /> First shooting of the first episode was one of the best parts in Japan. English language. But I'll leave it, this is not a big deal. But what is a great deal, and the rest is sad. Miike's story was moving so fast that I could not help looking at it several times in 63 minutes. The long stall scene in the middle of the film did not interfere in such a class and pornographic - as the scene was not interesting. I just felt that it was violent for the violence itself - there was no style and purpose. The only scenes that made me feel anywhere was the appearance of bloody fetuses beneath the flowing water ... and, in all honesty, their sense of hate was hate ... <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I always have Nitti's Dragos description very icy (and I'm a good way) and that's why I was disturbed when I found it so terrible (not good). Her player seems to have run out of feeling or empathy to capture the very bad. When his character, Komono, had to react to terrible things, I was sitting on the sofa, wrapped in it, and trying to escape the terrible operation put forward by Drago. <br /> <br /> Most part of life is described by Yuoki Kudoh, a deformed prostitute (Geisha memories, 2005). <br /> <br /> It is highly probable that the final is probably rebellious and terrible, but I just found it ... you know ... "blah" (and when I look at it again, for umptieth time, unfortunate episode will end). Maybe it was a little smile at the finals, but this was because of the thought of an episode of the Red Dwarf and Craig Charles and Danny John Jules could not help thinking about their <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Immigration finally came to an end, something painful that followed, Edward Shearmur (the same music used in each episode of this series) if anything - <br /> <br /> It is possible to pay attention to the costume design by Michiko Kitamura and at least in style and elegance. . But there are many other films and television shows that are very good in Japan to show "geisha-fashion". This is nothing else but I'm disappointed. Takashi Miike's heroic episode masters are boring, weak, and meaningless. In other words; This is really BAD!
