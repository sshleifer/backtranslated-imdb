This film is not so laughable - such a loss of stars captured as they forgot their stars. Only glittering moments are the head of the hotel who wants to decorate John Cleese - a high-heeled, gray coat and a hilarious hat, when you dance Donna Summer's "Bad Girls", you're loudly laughing at the podium. Remaining: USE!
