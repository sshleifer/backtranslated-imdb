Someone wondered why they would try to calm down successful movie spots already seen in this movie. "Wedding History" is one of the best examples of why not trying to rebuild under the name of a new story, something that should be left alone. <br /> <br /> If you go ahead with such a project studio's great honchos certification, then go with all the great stars and bright production values, so people come to the stars. Unfortunately, it's not what's happening with this wrong attempt in the comedy. The problem seems to be that screenwriters are mainly transplanting the story in London, which seems to be a typical American situation that can not even be adjusted. Then there are problems with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? There are more chemistry as oils and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Kat and Nick do not go to the movie as the creators of the audience think that there is no conflict. It is clear that Ketin will fall for Nick, but rather this predicted story. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> Junebug's best activist, Amy Adams, is like a whore girl who keeps her liars and who does not want to be cleaned by a man who loves her and prepares to marry her. <br /> For anyone interested, at the end of the movie, credits are almost seven minutes!
