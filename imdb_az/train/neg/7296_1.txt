Columbo films may have fallen rapidly over the years and may have fallen to this year. Peter Falk gives the same neat performance and comes in a creepy way. As usual in this series, there is no such thing as the crime scene protocols. Brenda Vaccaro draws the d√©cor and pants her face, and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unbearable woman. (His weakness, though, was hoot!) The scenario was related to numbers and delivery. They never brought Columbo to the ninety-one, but left us with only one or two clever plans with happy memories, better scripts and sharp characteristics.
