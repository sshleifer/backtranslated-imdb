I did not have great expectations for this movie while selling it for $ 1 for a movie, but the boxwriter promised at least a little more than "more sex than sex". Do not go wrong there! Yes, it should be said that the box is fraud. <br /> <br /> All this opens a brotherly staff like a girl from a home or another building and says something similar. An unnecessary crap for her boyfriend (?) Is watching her as a steadicam camera. Then he was pursued by a friend with a plastic mask and grabbed one another. <br /> <br /> Therefore, on the one hand, he cut "cuts" with something that looks like someone's picture. <br /> <br /> From there, she repeated the same subject of the girl, about 84 minutes later, two boys were killed unusually. Add a head stroke. <br /> <br /> There would be no problem with this movie, the box could not let me figure it out. If I rent a bad movie claiming to be more violent and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A full frontal shooting within 85 minutes from a dwarf does not scare the child and is in an obvious state and does not cut it. What if the Killer Cries, What's the Sting of the Theater? Of course, I suspect that the trash was first given to the theaters. Embarrass the actors of this movie. I've seen them because they did not see their debut screenings before, but they were set up before they were released. I do not know if the film was created in advance and the studio sat in the movie as long as there were no half-big names. But I want to know that they really spent $ 14 million on this movie!
