Hidden ... blow this movie. We're sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The group rents a fancy home and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then death begins. First, then one of the friends of one another is killed and eventually led to the sad and weird summit that leads to the expected results. <br /> <br /> An article by Dorie Barton is the Reese Witherspoon of a poor man? It looks like Reese, acts like Reese, and can go to a police squad for Reese. Maybe how did they throw him? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair players could not do enough for bad dialogue and terrible writing.
