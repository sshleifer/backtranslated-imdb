Before the actors were brought to trial, all the stories were not executed very well. The film opens with a big chain: a young naked young man has closed the road to Aborigin's girlfriend. But then we have to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... Why we do not know up to 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> Even though life is at this point in life, it does not really go anywhere. Two hours later, I asked myself: Was it a point, or did the symbols fight against accusations of racism and discovery? The story was ultimately dissatisfied and felt unfinished. Although it works well, there is not enough hinge in the film to recommend it.
