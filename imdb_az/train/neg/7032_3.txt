When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) looks at her brother's death, she begins to doubt something worse than "natural causes". When he approaches the truth, his father-in-law threatens Fiona (Helga Line) and other local Satanists. <br /> <br /> If you are sleazy, there are many things to offer to Satan-themed films, Black Candles. The film is full of abundant nudity and ritualistic soft base. In particular, a young woman and a goat must be believed to be a field. Unfortunately, all sleaze black waxes in the world can not save. Most of the film is a common hole. Except for a scene I have already mentioned, many scenes of sex are not shocking and, of course, not sexual. The best player is the best. Even your favorite Helga Line is disappointing. The area is not really important. Its main function looks like capturing the dull sex scenes together. I met a movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared with the darkest daughter, she combines eroticism and horror with skill, Black Candles are amateurish. 3/10 is the best thing I can do.
