I'm a minority in this regard. The Hurt Locker won the "Best Picture" award from critics for another year. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Arming, fighting, This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part does not stop the camera moving and is constantly shaking. The film has been the latest in the making and it should look more realistic because it has a cheaper, documental look. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about war movies and the "Hurt Locker" was no exception. But because critics love him, I do not have to do it.
