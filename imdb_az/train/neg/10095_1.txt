Someone really gave this movie 2 stars. <br /> <br /> Everyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you're not rewarding a star has a very high chance of having a professional help immediately. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is good ... Yes, there's not any porn or no real terrific bit of a terrible porn / snuff movie (moving, plot, story, set, dialogue and no sound) there is. I think it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Watching him in a fair way frightens; you will not be able to imagine the future of someone's future and you will not be able to imagine what the amateur torture videos on the home line or something strange that you follow in those lines. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad that I write this review on my mobile phone because I'm not trying to get rid of the same fatal fate as the rating is lower than 1.6. I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I'm the worst movie I've ever seen, and I can say (with a heartfelt hand) that it will never happen.
