After the success of the reconstruction of the Gilligan Island TV movie, a number of television films were filmed in the 1980s, combining classic shows. Most of these films completely missed the boat, as the humor is very special to the performances. The MUNSTERS REVENGE is really one of the most imaginative fighter because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy type comedy style that is not the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a beautiful comedy and series, is completely wasted - it's less than a 30-minute episode in a 90-minute movie. And what was the point of making them younger and rebuilding them because there was nothing but Eddie and Marilyn in the movie? With very little writing, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although some Munsters have seen their sad-nosed relatives, it did not like Sid Cesar as a very attractive scientist, because of its abundance and insufficient number of Munsters (ironically, in 1981, Caesar's old partner comedy, Imogene Coca, and BEVERLY Did not fall into a big part of HILLBILLIES 'return.) Another stranger understood at the start of the film has a Munster family represented as wax pictures in a local horror wax museum. Why are they "typical" (strange) American families, not popular monsters, supposed to be? Ended in a completely new game in the late 1980s and a television movie that played the role of DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, Patrick and Cathero in the 1990s. a family meal.
