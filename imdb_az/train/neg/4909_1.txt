True, you heard me. I'm a great admirer of James Patterson. I have 10 books and have read all the series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the scenario must be drawn. <br /> <br /> What is the rightness of any filmmaker to cut a fantastic artworks and turn it into the mystery of the mystery genre? I do not think Harry Potter cried, then Michael O'Hara made me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can say that the next scenario that solves this terrible book will do more justice. For Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not quit your job.
