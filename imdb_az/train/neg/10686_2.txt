Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! Summary of the film: First Lady's husband was killed for being deceived. This is so. <br /> <br /> Designed and implemented by a large assassination conspiracy that no one knows, except that Cuba and Angie are not appointed by anyone. <br /> <br /> Some special points are particularly fun: <br /> <br /> Watch Cuban and Angie from an news camera and see a tip. <br /> <br /> Believing that Cuba is the only human copy of the film, it is a great way to protect the film. PSM reports that there is no conspiracy. Cuba was claimed to involve more than one person. PSM then rants FBI, CIA and NSA included in the plot. Gosh, I'm surprised that PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, the first lady, is an incorrect artist. Cuba can not take a picture and says: "You are very close ... go back ... look from a different point of view." Can anyone miss this tip?
