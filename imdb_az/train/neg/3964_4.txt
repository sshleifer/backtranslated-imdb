According to all the rumors about this movie, I finally think that I keep an open mind. And though it's a bit slow, the first 90% of the movie is very good, some of the "old time" fears suddenly splashed and unresolved. I thought, in fact, that cinematography belonged to many of these scenes. However, Dark Remains is at its peak, where it fails. The film ends and the punishment appears to be like a MILES APART. This story is a totally unreasonable result, and the answer I most wanted is what Emma really did. - then it's not clear! The negative energy source was good and eventually I felt very deceived. The great fear movie finally came to a terrible end.
