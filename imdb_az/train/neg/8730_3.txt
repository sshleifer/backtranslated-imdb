What happens in our minds (unfortunately) is that of John Anderson (Andy Garcia) drifting into the city. You see it on the winding road through a forest that appears to be loaded with Redwood trees on its crossing to the Mercedes. Very nice. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia is playing a character with the name of Berlin, well ... Andy is just a lot of Spanish / Latin to be her passive. Maybe a caucasian father married a Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. However, I can tell you that when you put it in one of the hooks of agriculture and agriculture, it is distinctly prone to anger and headache when it is angry. Yes, I know, is there anything big? <br /> <strong> <strong> All victims are cordial and accuse them. The assailant attacked, but one witness (Helen Robertson) (Uma Thurman) suddenly gets poised. Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person in my surprise. I saw Lenten Henryke play Sgt. Freddy Ross I'm worried. Henryksen played some pretty strange movies, especially late. Pumpkin's Pumpkin movie still can not forget it. <br /> <br /> Berlin films L.A. entered a small town called a detective. Having found the body parts in the local polygon, Jennifer began to investigate his crimes. His brightness was blind in detecting one of the victims. Thus, * SPOILER * Freddy mocked with the killing, celebrity and similarity of the name. I suspected the logic of how eight Gokhan would be. And the reason why the killer was just curled did not get much from a fist. In the later period, this movie is likely to prove to be more accurate by showing a suspicious person since he has been passing over a period of time or looney toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich is doing a wonderful job in the question of Garcia! No police will be allowed to press for a legitimate hardship or an egg, but it can not be justified. As for the end, it's a little surprise, but it's just as controversial as Sgt. The murder of Ross. <br /> <br /> Killer decides to walk after being killed, I think. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are many opportunities to kill him, which is ridiculous. Despite the great rewards I do not destroy the latter, it's a good surprise. Later, it was likely that, like me, "the boy was lucky!" You will say! 4/10
