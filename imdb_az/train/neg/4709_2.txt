Cartoon Network looks hopeless for ratings. Network, starting with the abolition of Samurai Jackin, Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragonball Z, and so on. It was hell to overcome all popular celebrities. mediocre shows. While Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder are different thanks to clever writing and auditorium gratifying gimmicks, the Marvelous Misadventures that have other tips for offending off other terrifying remakes (Jungle of George) or other shows, or other shows, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! strong> Dexter's lab shows that this time Johnny has a blonde (or feverish) character who has suffered from the orange hair to look like Dexter, just as Dexter is the double sisters Susan and Mary. glasses, impossible technology. There is even a genius rival Eugene that Bling Bling seems to be sitting on the Boy or Mandark. Dexter's best friend and talking dog Dookie, one of Dexter's ... So, Susan and Mary's early experiences. Dexter Laboratory was probably one of the best animated films on the television, but an impressive art style, lovely mother character and long-lasting episodes. Johnny Test is very different. The style of art here is almost unimaginable. In fact, it looks totally horrible. Heroes are motivated by the fact that they are really annoying or obedient. Most of the episodes of the series consist of Johnny and Dookie, a girl from Sissy, a neighbor girl who loves Johnny's secret or insulted a twin boy. <br /> <br /> As these two geniuses see abs and Johnny does not want to co-ordinate anything, there is no contact between the viewer and the characters. <br /> <br /> One thing is Johnny, Susan, and Mary's guinea pigs who use it very much. This type of Johnny oil is ugly, terrible and even a woman. The Twins are helping Johnny in the scheme he plans against. <br /> <br /> This type of episode of "win / win" contract is usually withdrawn as it looks and does not go out of the rails, which will never end. <br /> <br /> Writing, but terribly. The episode "Oil" is repeated constantly: "There is Phat in PH. There is a difference, you know." <br /> <br /> Or is it a line that should not be repeated over and over again? Especially the episode increases child obesity, Johnny sees only being a celebrity star with money and videogame, which is fatty. <br /> <br /> 'Remove the Dexter Lab completely. The show, in many characters, is the military general and many cunning LOTS who need all the problems that Mr. Brown and Mr Brain, Johnny and Sisters have solved through many characters, the show again, Mr Freeze teen clone, the cats who dominate man (Powerpuff cats), bumbling maniac master, a trio <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (just like the sounds for Mr. Black and Mr Beat) to just divide the ear (Johnny, Dookie and all kinds of suffering in the show). <br /> <br /> So Johnny Test is not a good cartoon film. Its horrific references and jokes about young culture will break the interests of little children in the show, bright colors, predatory characters and drift episodes will disrupt teenagers' experience. Only one of these awesome shows (like rap against MTV) encourages people to follow Cartoon Network poems. If you need a show that will give your children a half an hour, the Johnny Test will be a better thing to SpongeBob because it is more than a more patient "test" than anything else.
