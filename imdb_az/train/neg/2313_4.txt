Sintaro Katsu is a wonderful character, earned Zatoichi's reputation. Zatochi films were a strange and incredible concept - a blind guy is the biggest sword in Japan, and each film betrayed the oppressors and punished badly. He is a wonderful person, and the films are interesting and addictive (I really saw every movie). That's because I saw this last part of the Hanzo Razor series, as I suppose it would be something like that ... and the guy was wrong! It appears that Henzo films are extremely sexually active in nature and have been harassed by "deserving women." As you can see, Hanzo is a police officer during the Meiji era, and he regularly keeps track of bad women and violently with "steel penis" and questioning them. <br /> <br /> It is something to convince himself how powerful he is. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not recommend anyone to see these violent and religious films. However, looking at other reviews, I can see that I'm still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent and dramatic fighting scenes, movies are just like brain contamination - I hate to imagine how the films affected violence against women.
