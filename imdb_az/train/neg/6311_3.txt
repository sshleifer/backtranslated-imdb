This is a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, real real movie for people is a good thing. Not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, bad, meaningless, meaningless, sometimes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the reason why those who say this movie are real. <br /> <br /> Very common places: black, you are a criminal, you are condemned and you curse. ends as a result of shooting or hitting one; Do not allow children to play with a gun, it can be dangerous; then there are those who go to church, and then good, very good ... <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a bad movie before. Maybe I did not see how important it is to be a photographer in a movie. Everyday, every day in the open air is clear and annoying blue. They did not even look at the color balance. Oh! Over 300 films in this database have been "appreciated" and this is my lowest level (3/10).
