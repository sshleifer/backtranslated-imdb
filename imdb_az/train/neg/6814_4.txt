French director Jean Rollin is definitely one of the most intriguing mixed reasons for great movies. One of the most important things about this production is the title. For a director who is well-known for managing erotic movies about Latino vampires; a film with the title "bare" in the title would look like a bare chest, but in reality there is no nudity here. Instead of unattractive erotic delightful vampires; There is a tough plan about a man who wants to escape hiding from immorality, a woman who has a disadvantage and who has a suicidal religion who can and does not do much. The film reveals a sequence of young girls waiting for a young French man who is a son of an important man, carrying a mysterious bunch of masks. With her investigation she soon saw that this woman is not a normal lady, and that the clergy is deepening; <br/> <br /> <br /> Last year, the film is interesting, but the area is very bad. It's possible to know what's happening, but there are many movies that follow those areas. The director knows that the plot also worsens, just as an excuse to tell the audience. There is a twist in the end; but without the movie would be better. I think it's Jean Roll's attempt to be a little original, but it's not a logical continuation of the story, it's like a laughing attempt. Cinematography is pretty neat and many images are happening in the Gothic areas. The girls on the ship are a pretty picture, and Rollin creates the logic and consistency, and some of them are in style. The movie was shot in 1969; explains the lack of shock, but this is not worth the movie because I can not recommend this movie.
