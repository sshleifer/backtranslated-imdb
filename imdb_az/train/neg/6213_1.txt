This movie has become one of my top 10 most horrible movies. Terrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment with a monster or another battle. There was no chance for each character to develop, ran from one sword to another. <br /> <br /> The scenes were stolen from other films, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> br> <br /> Previously, the spider machine was attacked by a spider at the return of the kings like Frodo exactly. (Elijah Wood is the victim of both films) and wait ...... his victim hypnosises and builds them ..... uh salam ???? The theme of all the machines and people was the Matrix ... Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why do you waste your time? Will someone tell me what the Nazi is? !! Nazi's ???? <br /> <br /> There was a story of a child who betrayed a juvenile. The film did not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie, and many did not. <br /> <br /> Just horrible. The least disappointment. Protect your money.
