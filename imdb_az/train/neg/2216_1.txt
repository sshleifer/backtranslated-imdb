B's lover, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in the sky. These films are good for stopping the thinking of everything in the world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh, and I still think it's a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, so terrible that I had to register at IMDb and warn others. Firstly, creating shadow man was a science that did not touch the film. Blood was given in just a few minutes to keep track of the audience's interests. In an attack scene, the camera fled from the camera attack, but you saw that the blood of a sieve staged to know that an attack was bloody and killed (what spectacular special effects) it was. When I returned to science, the woman considered that the subject of the test was naked and that the testers were required to be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway, this film was a rough development, a terrible story, and I was so upset to act pretty badly. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could not save this stinker.
