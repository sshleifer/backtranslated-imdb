Massacre is a film run by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now, with this combination of great talent, you would think that this movie will be a realistic eye festival. Besides, it could not be. The massacre fell on my grapevine and became one of the dreadful films I came out of from the Italian cinema. In fact, I was struggling to wake up in the movie, and I had never had this problem with the fears of Italy. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with an ax with a prostitute cutting off the road. This scene was used at Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This is not an erroneous scene, and it raises your expectations from the movie as an ax. Unfortuanitly, the film is so tight in the next hour. The film continues to shoot a film and many of these scenes have a lot of character development, but the characters in the film are moving in a very dull and bad way, and your interests begin to leak. The last 30 minutes of the film is not so bad, but it would still be better. It was strange in the film, and there was nothing new to Fulch's Nightmare Concert because he used most of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This film is not a very good movie, but because of the real Italian horror (as many times as I am), this is because the film is so rare. 4/10 stars
