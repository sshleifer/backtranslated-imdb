But this movie was a hole. The history part was beautiful, but there was no music piece. <br /> <br /> The Suspect, Jesus, "meant to be a funny relief, will never work." If John Adams thinks this is a seductive person, <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only symbolic characters of the whole film. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and slavery-related historical debates were quite interesting, but it's not enough to eliminate music deficiency in music. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few sweets, you can not dazzle your songs after the music, and nothing else breathes.
