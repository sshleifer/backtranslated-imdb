In a spring-filled, Snake and Da Vinci Code, this is a very daring statement in a spring boasting with such terrible stinkers. But still I stand next to him. Superman returns like King Kong six months ago, with hip-indulgent and eyeballs with CGI. My God, these things are my head. <br /> <br /> Richard Donner had the idea of ​​"keeping the truth" for his 2 trips. And you can find his approach to its most appropriate and optical effect. Brian Singer recalls a wannabe blockbuster watching us out of the story and always looking for the only way to admire an auditorium of $ 250 million (unexpectedly spoiling the CGI, which bombarded us) - unusual visual effects that do not fit into nakedness. We've seen everything and everywhere CGI can get us. There is no real atmosphere or attraction for this. <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, the shooting of the film is 95%. <br /> <br /> The film's "soul" or "a human heart" or "tender moments." Puh-lease! If you know who I've been in dozens of years in recent years, shouting silently at the hero's heroes and the SR has offered a completely new thing from this point of view, even leaking soil .Leik Luthor (the serious firefighting and cunning Kevin Spacey prepared to destroy America's landmass) was made in the first movie! And, well ... this is yours! Brandon Routh has a mahogany hat hat display personality, Kate Bosworth is a Pulitzer award-winning journalist like James Marsden, and ordinary and Kevin Spacey needs to fire her or her agent, it's amazing that they've been able to shoot at 5 hours! or just like a 250% throne needed to get somebody else's absolutely unkind judgment. Parker Posey, a member of the castle was a favorite. But I'm going to a strange-looking girls. <br /> <br /> Every year, more and more such films scorer. In the very near future there will be $ 300 million film. You need to understand that studios should be able to explore what they are looking for. For all the money he had spent on this muster, for all the resources necessary for the price of this movie ... was it worth it? In my opinion, of course not! This trash put me Superman for life!
