This half-J-horror movie was watched by a young woman when she returned to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell a family home and meet with her old friends. He finds that the priest of the village drowned several years ago. He and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. The gardens between the dead and the living are already weak, and the friends and the villagers see the spirits. Nothing about this movie was exceptional or very good. <br /> <br /> Unlike staged J-horror films, tension does not really strike, the result is a great threat to the absurd and the boundaries do not appear. <br /> <br /> This film is a little too much cooked straight white rice, despite the longevity it is mushy. Sometimes you drop into poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white knot for a while. You will eat, because you need food because of what is not baked Chinese or Japanese food, but the egg eats food for foolish tastes. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
