This movie is worth more than 1. But many pro-fan guys ended up getting a rating that would get the top 100 list. It's not a serious thing, it's not bad. A foolish classic classic with many frustrated fan guys is ridiculous. Probably still Chuck Norris laughs in his jokes and still say "I am rick james b! Tch", how old or worried. Months of bearding who want to be illogical since months ago, "I'm tired of the MFn snakes on this MFn plane." <br /> <br /> If you want to see the real movie, wait for Marine, who plays John Cena's lead role.
