I hate horror movies, it's no secret. No plot, bad action, and blood summary are the staples of these errors, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not believe some cable stations really run this trash. (This particular trash was pulled from the flat video, as I remembered). When I talk about another movie, I would say that it would be a great offense: All Phantasm films, all Jason films, Freddy films, Chucky movies and most of Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word: WORLD! <br /> <br /> The rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
