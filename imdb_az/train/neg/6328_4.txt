Why is the movie falling below these standards? Finally, the answer is a poor, humorous script. Thorough / average-looking Travolta (with a black-colored look, even with a large mullet), and Gross is well-behaved as two young work clothes, but still try to open the nightclub of the New Yorkers. In addition, the rest of the film is just watching. It's not really worth it to know what's happening at the top of the film at any level is not worth it. Kelly Preston squeezes her sex appeal and is a bit of a taste for the sex-related dance with her husband Travolta. Charles Martin Smith is extremely entertaining to watch KGB honcho fight with Bob Smith. Personally, the film would have been better if the part of the film did not change from NY to "Hind Springs, Nebraska" (after the former Soviet Union). You see the film ... It seems that this film was released in 1986 in 1986. I released Paramount for the incredible plot until January 1989. They regarded them as "unreliable". Nevertheless, this $ 6,000,000 film has saved a little of the $ 163,000 revenge, just as the movie was released in just about Texas and Colorado before the plain-to-video launch. This is evidence of the overall BAD quality of this movie.
