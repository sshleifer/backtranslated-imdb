Original Trancers are not a great movie in any way. Very large holes leading to internal logic and very few. However, less fun than B-movies, better things were done and could be surprisingly smart. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Trancers II most draws on the same problems with the flop sequels. Insufficient for the appearance of the land and insipid in writing. Apparently, the people behind this film are enough to bring the familiar faces of the first film and have not been disturbed by anything else. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the presentation: B category actors such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs did not have such a film. <br /> <br /> Brief overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) was sent to rescue government members from their ancestors in 1985. Trancers II occurs six years after the first Trancers events. Jack Deth married a woman who met her first film, Lena (Helen Hunt), both of whom lived with Hap Ashby, sent to the past to protect Deth. The brother of Whistler (his first bad man) traveled over time to create a Trancers' army, and people killed poisonous people to kill Ashby. Jack's mission was to shift Jack's former comrade, who had just died before his past, was sent back to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack is working with him. <br /> <br /> Two real problems with this movie. First, the method of creating Trancers in this film is radical to the methods used in the first film. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The variable is something that is a triangle of love with Lena and her love, which is a fairly weak example of Soviet Revisionism. Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) is given very little screen time. This made me especially uneasy because it was more interesting than the actual movie scene. I felt as if something was thrown to fill the movie. <br /> <br /> The nature of the diseased, particularly, is that she is only interested in getting acquainted with her husband to find her again. <br /> <br /> I think that watching this movie is something that interests the entire Trancers series (currently a total of six films). Otherwise, even if you are an admirer of the original Trancers, stay away from this warmth.
