I think the fears are creepy, so this movie does not do much more. <br /> <br /> A bunch of robbers in an airplane makes an emergency parachute and turns into a big field with fear. One of them has been looted and, therefore, pushes the rest while explicitly identifying the worst of them. Acting is all upright and terrible is unimpressive. On the positive side, the director can not stand up for static heroes. Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb runs under a table, and it's strange, and we know that the bomb is beneath the table, but it will not stop."
