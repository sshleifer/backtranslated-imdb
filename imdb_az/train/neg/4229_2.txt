I'm a great admirer of budgetary horror movies, but come! This must be the best monkey I've ever seen in S @ # t! <br /> <br /> In this sloppy: a cheap wicker of costumes and painting suits: from the warehouse of the house. Masks are made of tint foil look. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I should give it. However, the Burden of Ittenbach was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Attorney: It was awful! I did not dubble. I find this charm, like the Pretzent, the Pretzent of the Dogman. <br /> <br /> The following line: Do not watch Schnaas's films. There are better managers with the same regime and theme movies as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach. Check Premutos, Blood, Schramm and Necromanches.
