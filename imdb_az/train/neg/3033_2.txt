I'm a great admirer of Jenna James, but this movie is terrific. Jenna Jameson married Brad Armstrong and she was the director of this movie, and Jenna was the hottest porn star. So, of course, Brad tried to make a lot of money to hang himself by making this big budget porn movie. Now, I know, they're no big banned porn movies. In a fantasy world, porn stars can move, but this is a real world and can not move. For this reason, porn stars, if beautiful women such as Jenna were able to move, she would try to go to movies other than porn. Because you did not make a beautiful movie star. A fine example of this is Traci Lords, one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth when he was a teenager at the age of 20. He went down to the main budgetary actor movies and could not move. Now why? Jenna was very hot, but then got a better shot of Dream Quest. Come to Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk as we want to see sex. Additionally, Jenna would be more adept at making money on the film and making more money on the film.
