In the early 1970s, usually at "4am Film" or at 7:30 in "Channel 6 Big Movie" and still on the Creature Double Feature. This was the time when the local channels used to be part of local programs (mostly today in favor of the infomercial time). Several low-cost Abbott and Costello wannabees (Frankie Ray and Robert Ball) have extensions of retired soldiers (half a dozen children from the Army Surplus Remaining) sent to field maneuvers to look at a strange radius. They will go to the Bronson Canyon earlier in Batman on Batman and face the deadly "carrot wolves". Later, a young boy living in the cave, mostly a black suit and a paper-mache boy, followed him with strange things and ping-pong ball eyes. Two of them - full geeks, Ray and Ball - are caught and "researched" by space amazons - Dr Poona (nooo kidding!) And Professor Tanga, their beautiful bikini "form." Later, we were too young to understand what the fetish scenarios were, after offering more suggestions and suggestions for this "exam" scene. <br /> <br /> This film shows that their carrot monster has been stranded on the earth, trying to keep it secret and to return to the world. <br /> <br /> The movie tasted at different levels, but it was remembered when Eric Von Zipper and Frankie and Annette were in the speed of the comedy, the speed of the B-film's crew. So, just for a few dollars, it was natural to jump out of the congregation. <br /> <br /> For some reason, I just thought I would see the start of this movie. No, I really saw it. And when I was released on DVD, I was convinced. The comedy is funny, just stupid, but no matter what. The budget is non-existent, and if you think about it, it's a small miracle, even adjusted, and we can talk about a "revised" version and now it's over 40 years. The pay is girls who want to learn about "love" and "kiss", and this is a geeks that has earned our daughters and love. It is just goofy and silly and places nostalgic.
