A model called Laura works in South America when a hotel network is abducted and taken to the forest. They demand a great ransom to free him. Peter is hired to get his home safe and has a bonus for his money, as well as his daughter's return. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with fellow Jack. They try to give Laura a fake counterfeit instead, but the plan is a big mistake and they have to take a hostage on the helicopter. The helicopter is being dropped and they are still going on (so far). Jungles roaming is also a thing of the past. In fact, a naked black boy with his strange eyes and a respiratory problem. He begins to kill a few kidnappers and Laura runs away just to catch up with some primitive. The rest of the film is really a grace. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not a massive Jess Franco fan, in fact, not the second movie I've ever seen so far, I can say that this is not really one of the best efforts. The movies are dragged at a very slow pace, at least. The whole thing could have been easily adjusted to a 25-minute television show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Satan's hunter has been burned weakly (I do not think that the infatuation has not been burned), but in a very bad way, dubbing, weak movements and slow, he still did not pour me for a reason. I think that the main purpose of this is the hilarious evil scenes that occur within. For example, Laura was shot in a street on a real street because the mass of the crowd was flat in the camera. There is a gang of blood dropping in another tree as one of the friends standing in front of him, screaming for another minute, as if another funny scene was killed. At the top of the tree, for whatever reason, the man falls alone and hits the person under him. To be believed. Of course, there is actually a devil. <br /> <br /> This film was banned in the United States, the United States, and the United States in the 1980s. Now, I had no idea why. It's very small, and it's a tough shocking movie. I said that nudity could go away with almost PG. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Jess Franco fan. You have a lot of nudity in order not to fall asleep, and that's a bad scene. You may have a good laugh, but another wise saying that I just paid a ticket to South America and lost in a jungle. <br /> <br /> 3/10
