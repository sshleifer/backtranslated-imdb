I did not finish this movie for any reason, it was terrible and it was just moving. I do not understand that the film does not mean many and that violence is terrible. Probably, I love some naked movies (lol), but it's sick because of what's happening. ALL symbols disturbed me and it was only loud and the pieces of the camera shattered and seemed to be a result of blair, but not good qualities. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I would like my time back. I do not recommend this movie to everyone and I will not even think about it. (N)
