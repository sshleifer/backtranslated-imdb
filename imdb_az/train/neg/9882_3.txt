<br /> <br /> A) Bo Derek's unusual, poetry-inspiring beauty. There are 2 good things to say about "Fantasies" (also referred to as a previous reviewer). In this movie, he also has the shots he has given to Catherine Zeta-Jones, and that's a really great compliment. His nakedness is short and cautious, but it is enough to look at his face. b) Adoption of the Greek island with sun and crystalline blue waters. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is no story, the dialogue is horrible and sometimes unwelcome funny ("you touched the place where you were a woman!") and the character of Peter HÃ¶ten is calm. Bo overplays the character of his character, but then it is unfair to blame the actors when it is necessary to work again with dialogue again (in fact, it is a great irritation that almost every damn name is Damir). Oh, and although the film is set up an island in Greece, you probably do not hear a Greek word - the kids are old people, apparently, everyone speaks English there all the time. (*)
