I think I'm late for the party. Only in Sky TV I saw the Bye Bye Birdy version in 1995. <br /> <br /> I've been playing Albert a long time ago and thinking about being dedicated to amateur art. Show it to me that I am very entertaining. I did not admire this new version. He just did not have enough fun. It was not colorful. The youth did not care. The lighting was bad. Nobody mentioned this truth. It was moody music, not bright and defeat. Lighting decision is a poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a bug, a comedy mistake. There is no point in this version of my version. The lighting was terrible and drowned in general demonstrations. Dance numbers seemed like anemia. We have music videos today. At least it was necessary to measure dance numbers, some of the best, or the best of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although all actors were very talented, there were some really bad casting choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with many talented Latin singers there, it would not be right to beat one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, cute and talented but dirty. Jason Alexander's efforts were striking, he was always smart, but he was not Albert. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> You need to translate it into one. The music and music festival on the stage should be a movie. It is of no use to be loyal to the scene script when filming. The spirit must be brought to the essence of production. Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 film was brilliant and vibrant, and in 1995 it was unstable as lighting and dance. Very truly talented people appeared to have made a successful effort.
