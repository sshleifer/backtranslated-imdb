The 'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget movie about several employees of the Australian postal service, trying to rebuild their victim lives. Unfortunately, the player is poor, and the relationship between characters' past failures and today's mentalities is unfounded and very schematic. What is the frustration of everything, but there is a description of life under the heading of the film: there is no mechanism and it is impossible to determine what the staff is doing for any life. Part of the proposed section was threatened by the closure of the office, but such a task was closed in the 1930s, if this is true. Since the overall tone of the film is very bright and weak, there are several words in the scenario: but some details are unsatisfactory. In general, it feels the work of someone who is not a part of real life; a student film with an insight and outline, but just another little.
