Frank Sinatra plays an old soldier and an irreplaceable writer, a hard life and a hard drink, coming back to his Midwestern country and coming together with his ex-boyfriend (Arthur Kennedy), who now has a great interest in the city. smart girl. Frank, the hero Dean Martin, deals with untrained encrypted Shirley MacLaine, and has a number of run-ins with the law, but it's really something she wants to write down and put on the ground. The soap opera for MacLaine is a very simplified drama on the opera, a multi-colored and embarrassing sentimental (its drunken belt after "Your Drunken" is the highlight of the movie, and it is masterfully mastered). Director Vincente Minnelli makes it straight forward, but it's in a surprisingly conscious soul, and most of the big scenes are straight or tight. The picture may look awesome on the widescreen with a beautiful look for detail and composition, but the story and these characters remain in the curves. ** from ****
