Since it's a good movie to go somewhere inside the Hollywood formula, there's nothing fancy about watching a movie like 'Homicide Numbers'. However, there are no savings when loans are circulated. All this has been blown up by the story "cop side" by the unusual sex link that Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin have detected heroes of murder, the film's longer trivialized. Although Bullock is powerful in its role, poor scripts and lazy pacing are not enough to keep. Chaplin's talents wasted Chris Penn, who has a memorable role (he has done a lot better in her previous 'Birthday Girl'), and has a very memorable role to play for her as a gift for her. In any case, the plot is not really a fact in this movie. Two teenage killer who was performed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt is the only real reason to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry are very good and they play quite well. Very bad, they were not in a very good movie. Barbet Schroeder is a very safe place for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom Line: If you are a fan of a genre, you have a right to rent, but everyone will live a life without seeing it, perhaps with affordable commercial breaks on a white TV.
