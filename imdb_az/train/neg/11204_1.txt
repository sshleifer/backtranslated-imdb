:: POTENTIAL CLAUSES: <br /> <br /> Adam, this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> In one of the past films, the excitement of Catholic / false / retardation was much better. <br /> <br /> The suspect is a priest. Sex and priesthood. Politics and religion. The Church's hypocrisy. The provocative of the church. The dawn of a new era. Every kind of dark magic voodoo fights between good and evil. <br /> <br /> It's pretty stupid and naked with a weak story. The story takes place around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the anointing of sickness, is the last person to ask for forgiveness on the brink of death; Inspection, a person's departure from the church. Basically, a Circumferent person can not accept Absolution. This is Sin's Eater, and I will abandon her. Heath Ledger also says: "I am the forgiver of sin and the vein, without my darling I live "/ Long coat alla" The Matrix "<br /> I gave this movie not just to be unhappy and illegal, but also to insult my entire faith in the process. If you want to see something better, the "Prophecy" comes with Christopher Walken.
