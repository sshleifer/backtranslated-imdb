<br /> <br /> When I bought this movie on DVD, I wrote down below and betrayed misfortune. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the comments made since then, I tried to look again. Being a movie student and making budget-like budgeting (ie, budgeting) is based on my original comments. No budget student project (and especially good) on video / dvd to look like this award-winning movie. Thus, to think that the public is not deceived. I want my money back under the trader's description! Full trash!
