The only reason to make this movie was DVRd. Because I live in Cleveland and Shaq now plays basketball and 2. I've always heard how terrible it is. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shag's clothes. The worst part was something else. My 12 year old son, and just Shaq, could not see the screen when we hit and wondered if Max did not want to fix his forearm. But for all this, we have been unable to watch a lot, the story was hypnotic, like a black hole, hug, or sand puddle. But it was worth the laughs and just said we were watching "Kazzam".
