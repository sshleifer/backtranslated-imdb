My husband and I went to see this movie. Two hours later I asked for my money and my time. I'm very upset. The theaters of this film are mostly the best in the film. Surprise entries and so on. In addition to good times, there was nothing too intimidating about the movie. I found most of the "scary" parts to be more funny. After watching other films based on Japanese writers' works, I think the fear in Japan does not have any fears in the United States. My advice: If you are an admirer of real fears, rescue yourself from this pain. If I do not give you a free hire, I do not want to advise you to rent it.
