I think that any novel, such as Moby Dick, would not have been happy with the Depression-era audience, with enough of its own troubles. But the classic Herman Melville novel is a surprise. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie, as we know, is not a prequel, but most of the film has not been preserved. First of all, we know Axab Creely (he has a surname and brother), two legs and a happy lucky spirit who is going to marry Father of Mapple, Joan Bennett. Derek, who plays Lloyd Hughes, wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore, Axab's best performance. <br /> <br /> Barrymore did not know very well the soundtracks and gave a scene that could shake all the silent eras and the cinemas of any movie starring. <br /> <br /> Axab's Big Fish book is for Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation scene is terribly horrible. Of course, these were all before the Code. But I am sure that the audience in 1930 was heartfelt. <br /> <br /> Then she did not appear in the eyes of Joan Bennett, the story of Axab's hunt for his whale he thought. <br /> <br /> Melvil says Melvil's motivation is incomplete; in fact, there are no women characters in Moby Dik. <br /> <br /> A portion of Melvil invested with Axug's ship with Pequod's personalities. In addition to Queequeg, there are names of wildly harpooner, but not personality. Starbuck and Stubbs can also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would like this version of Moby Dick to see something serious and something else.
