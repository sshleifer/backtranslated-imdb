Carlos Mencia constantly shouted "B ** ch!" in women "N ** ger!" shouting. In black people, worse. It should be noted that the word B is the only source of violence that is still on the agenda, unlike N. "B ** ch!" women are the last thing they heard before rape, beatings, or murder. This man continues to be a victim of hatred using violence. She can be a woman who can remain as a female boy, so she will sound like a hetero. Fascist greetings attracted viewers from all the Nazi minds, and the foolish little bimbo white women were terrified by the crown hee hee, who stood by them to protest the wave of women's hate this day. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or supports free consultation for them! Come on, Carlos? Do you think that women have been able to speak freely, loudly and violently and defeat a great deal, or that "free speech" men just cry for women?
