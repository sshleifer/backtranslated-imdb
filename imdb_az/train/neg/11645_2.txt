This is 'The Freddy Mercury The Untold Story', Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most incoherent, weakest and most delicate biographical documentary I've ever seen. If the movie I've seen before in a movie theater is originally on television, I ask the paid filmmakers and distributors not to deceive the fake promise of a decent documentary feature to the filmmaker. In a documentary film for television, sitting in front of the flower arrangements in the hotel rooms and interviewing, the sentimental piano solos accompanied by lively and literary narratives, one bedroom Infomercial is more accurate. The only distributive aspects of this "Freddy Mercury's Unsurpassed Story" - or uhm, "Princess Diana's Unsold Story" is the original concert, video and television footage. Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) Brian May or Montserrat Caballe revealed new ideas that ignored Freddy's references and gave Mercury a sophisticated life and character compassionate. And ... How much do you like with boarding school segments like Harry Potter? Interviewing the first girl ("now a travel agency") and how did Freddy's first school group help me to really know about Mercury? The important stages of her personal life, her sex, her artistic style and her growth, the Queen's group, remain untested. The filmmakers do not ask a single, provocative question and are not involved in independent or visionary research on their subject, but they give sincere, clean, and very empty comments regarding a mysterious and brilliant rock legend that is not worth it. Some of your grandparents will be remembered by this Historical Channel biography, which will set out on a Sunday night.
