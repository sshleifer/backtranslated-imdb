I chose this DVD on the Dollar Store. <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> like movie. The film has played as an ad for more documentary or religion than anything else. I saw that the director used flashbacks did not add to my story line. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the chronology of life in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it as one of the other commentators, but again I will review this movie. Who knows, because it was Michael Madse's movie debut, maybe some archival value at a future date.
