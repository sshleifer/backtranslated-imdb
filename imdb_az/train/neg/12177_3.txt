Writer / producer / director Charles Bant has been responsible for hundreds of fantasy, fantasy and horror B films since the 1970s. Some are fine examples of how a small budget can utilize the maximum effect; Many of them are very bad. Trancers (1985) was one of these rare stones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Time-travel and action Terminator style tale, Whistler is able to manage other people with other psychic powers, transform them into obedient zombies (the "carriers" of the title) and try to alter the course of history with the killing of future leaders. Jack watched him in 1985 and decided to stop him. <br /> <br /> After 1991, Jack is still living in 1985. Destroying Whistler, he settled down and Leena (Helen Hunt) helped him succeed in the first film. But for a long time Jack did not remain calm and worried about Whistler's brother E.D. <br /> <br /> Trancers II does not lose the charm and simplicity of the original, and it's a great disappointment, considering the goodness of the original. If you have not seen the first movie (or at least for a long time), it's hard to get stories and there are unimpressive movements and a few weak special effects. The Trancers are very entertaining and inventive; <br /> <br /> For the only reason I can recommend this movie to fans of the genre, there are many names that are familiar to gamers, Sci-Fi and horror filmmakers: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, and Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them were on the "off day" when filming the Trancers II, and the performances were the best mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series has obvious fans; Four additional albums have been released. If the quality does not move massively, I do not think they are good.
