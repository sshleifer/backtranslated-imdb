Considering the theme of "Children like this," it could have been a decent film. Instead, it has become an average, different TV movie within weeks, and it goes so far. Acting is old, the plot is predmetable and direction is unavailable. For a better movie on the same subject, try the perfect Le Huiti√®me Jour, which really cares for people with Down's syndrome. "Children like these" are simply used as an excuse for a sense of foolishness. Very horrible. 1/10
