Two years ago, I liked Josh Kornbluth's directorial debut on Sundance - the Haiku Tunnel. So I was waiting for my brother (and frequent worker) Jacob, the Best Thief in the World. It's a drama that looks like a child grown up in New York's low-end area. The film is not without specific moments. But sometimes it looks like Kornblut works hard to express: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle and more important, our understanding is that, despite all this, some of the negative cultural roots and anti-social behaviors can emerge, these characters have no difficulty. goodness and humanity. We can stay in their language and their living conditions, but we can not diminish their intentions. And in fact, it is certain that struggles to save a family under this difficulty can appreciate the majority of them. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and proves the compassion of the people. <br /> <br /> By saying all this, The World's Best Thief draws a number of painful defects (including the title). The characters are not very convincing. The writing is uneven. And the cunning line only differs. And for many trouble, Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap among the scenes. To each: While I'm not questioning the potential realization of this event, I'm talking about having sex with and talking to a 5-year-old child. An unnecessary shocking value is an integral part of the interest rate.
