While watching the 10 minutes of this movie, I was amazed, looking at the 30 minutes, shining my head - I simply could not believe: the movie was really terrible. In fact, it's so terrible that I've got to watch all of this (!). Meanwhile, I recalled that I recalled a comedy called in Denmark from 60 to 70 years. An example is: Take a very popular comedian, make a comic book as strange as possible, add some jokes (especially a liners) and spice up with a few beautiful young girls - you have a movie and a success! I do not know if this film is successful, but unlike the Danish tradition that has been silently killed (with a few great comedians) there's a market for this kind of movie in the United States.
