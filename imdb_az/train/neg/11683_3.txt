The Inside Man was so inexperienced and incomplete to be artistic and real to avoid three lines of story and enough of each other. Despite the moments, the film began to look at a fast pace, causing an extremely slow shift, rapidly swinging high and low, and retrieving nearly 20 minutes of steam. I will give Denzel Washington a credit, but he has played a very good role not with a typical "super detective" with all his answers, but with a full understanding of the human side. Clive Owen was also quite good with the duality of "bad genius" and "criminal case" (not the same as retrospective). In general, each person has created a large subdivision individually. However, when the pieces finally came together, and when everything was counted, suddenly it was not "ah-ha". or collecting everything. With all that very little energy started, with plenty of plotting, questioning tones, and, as I said before, there was no place near Spike Lee's normal level. I must be totally satisfied with the word "professional critics" ... this is not a movie he has played for them.
