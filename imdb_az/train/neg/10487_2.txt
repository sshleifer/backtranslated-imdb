OH, MY GOD! Since Tom Hanks is as funny as an Elvis-in-the-box, I'm the only reason for giving this movie 2 instead of 1. But how did this semi-legendary tale come to make such a bum film? Maybe it looked like a good idea ... There was no laugh in the sky, stereotypes were terrifying, the molds vanished, the direction was amateurish. Now, I think, most of the offense is probably related to director Joel Zwick. He performs straightforward speeches from all participants. Do not waste time like me; But I've had a good train crash. Geez, now the system needs me more mistakes - go here: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it was more spectacular in the movie ...
