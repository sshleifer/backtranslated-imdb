The story of the FBI (1959) was Warner Bros. 149 minutes of epic respect to the famous criminal investigation department! One of the books by Don Whitehead came from a hard-working scenario by Richard L. Green and John Twist, and was directed only by Mervyn LeRoy, a flair modicum. Nevertheless, Joseph Byrok had a good idea of ​​colorful cinematography and studio music wizardry by Max Steiner! <br /> <br /> The movie reminds us that from the lowest starting dates of the 20th century, all age groups, James Stewart, relates his investigative experience to a class of young talent agents in flashback. But all this is very long and episodic! Young improvements include the American criminal law "Baby Face", Nelson, Ma Barker, Dillinger and others. Instead of producing a big movie, it seems like a mini-series TV, so as to comply with some of the most famous maladies. Kü Klux Klan, Nazi Spies and the Red Crescent Society. And here it should be said that the presence of the screen and the appeal of his star would have caused a forgotten catastrophe. Moreover, this is a problem with the picture - Stewart will take the whole film almost to his own head! Except Vera Miles - she has a long-term affair, but her husband has an unforgettable role - she is surrounded by a handful of smaller players! We look forward to someone like Robert Ryan, Jack Palance, or even a teenager like a Raymond Burr or a police chief, or any point of disaster. But nothing is as creative as it is! Sorry! <br /> <br /> In the development of the Bureau, the movie gives a good look! With Stewart's narration, we get information about thousands of men and women working for hundreds of agents in the field. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> > Steiner's remarkable account! A great, exciting and stable ride, which I've heard on topics, has a tempting love theme for moments. But Ku Klux Clan is a terrible and unsuccessful starter theme. The rhythmic Latin American music written by the composer for the South American scenes is even better, just as Fandango wrote for the Palestinian soldiers to come to his horse. The FBI story is one of the five points composed by the composer in 1959. These are Samuel Bronston's sea epic "John Paul Jones", charming Rom-com Cash McCall, Delmer Daves "The Hanging Tree" and Daves. <strong> FBI STORY. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jimmie Stewart, a rich color cinematography, Steiner's beautiful music and, of course, things to watch! <br /> <br /> Classical, but not feasible from the FBI studio ............. mild Nick Adams (after a 43-person aircraft crashed into the boat, including his mother) "If I get any letter, you can send him to Canyon next month or sentence to prison - then to HELL". Amazing! Wow!
