Yes, it is difficult to add comments after reading the ones here, but one thing I can say. I'm looking for a 'splatterfest' because someone puts it or even 'blood and intestines'. I have a little respect for the victims' relatives, though I felt a film shooter. - They were unknown, tragic and meaningless. A ship just for Dahmers sex antics. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie with a negative interest in thinking that "one man should be a murder killer". but also very little about the features of Dahmer's story. Here, people think that the movie should not cover the stories of Dahmer .. I.E. its history, or what happened when it was caught, and so on. but it is important! You see, I think you're an American, do not know all this. We all live in America. No doubt, in order to explain this story about such a person, at least it demands that the history and actual events be BALIED / explained. It does not mean blood or gut, it's a way of showing off horrible things in a movie or taking movies with others without getting rid of it. Even without touching on some things (I learned more about reading the user's comments on this site), the movie felt like a gap. At a time with very few substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer, because it is a poor film because there is a lack of leadership, very slow paces, EVOLUTION, strange images of homosexuality and a very unfortunate deficiency in attempt to end. I do not recommend that everyone spend time watching it. Determine a definite from 10 (for action!)
