Ulises is a literature teacher who came to a coastal city. There, he will be in love with the city's most beautiful girl Martina. They will start a land romance that will end with the tragic death of the Ulysses in the sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lived a quiet, tranquil life. One day, the appearance of Ulises will pervade to rise and act without thinking about its consequences. The site is pretty absurd, and none of the actors plays a decent role. At the same time, about three-quarters of the film is sexually explicit, yet film shoots are exhausting, and we want to see more development of this story. The Badas Bigas Luna film, which is very much sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere.
