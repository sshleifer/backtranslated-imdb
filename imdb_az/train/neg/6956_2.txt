Dirk Benedict is more likely to be more attractive than the new age of Kattee Sackhoff - whose passion is likely to be regarded as a "charming, exciting, visionary, guaranteed performance". today's reviewer speaks new; but in reality it is a tired, old-fashioned image of a woman with only a shoulder-to-shoulder town house.
