<br /> <br /> I read the Chris_m_grant description from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "1924's fantastic documentary, the geography of today's Iraq was strong in the early 20th century." <br /> <br /> Thank you to Chris and Bakhtiari Nomads, people interested in the mountains and landscapes of Zagros and watched the film Grass for a nation's war. The traditions you see in the film have been going on for centuries and will last as long as you live. I am myself an irony from this region. I'm Baxtiyari. <br /> <br /> Kris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region of Zoroastrianism is not in Iran but in Iran as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking an Iranian Iran is almost like taking a Mexican American. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Ziba
