Until the end of the war, the European war, with the ending of the war, which ended with the end of the Hollywood (a significant boost of the government), began in the era of Europe to create tons of films designed to make young people enter the Army. the military seems "cool". It shows that a soldier's life is deprived of work, the best food he can eat, and that the radio is lying all day long to listen to Ann Miller. I'm too young to participate in World War II, but I think there's more to it. <br /> <br /> Until 1943, I knew that the most influential people in the world were the most naive. far more than the ridiculous hijinks described in this movie abroad. I'm sure that this should be viewed as escapist fun, but I can not help but wonder if the men and loved ones of the war fighters are surprised or pushed by these trivialization victims.
