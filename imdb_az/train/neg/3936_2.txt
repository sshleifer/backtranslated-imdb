Amazing! Wow. I thought it could be insipid, but I was worse than I thought! Sometimes I love to watch a good "car accident": very bad ones, you will not be able to look at what they want to see what is bad. This is really the only reason I can leave the television - a morbid fascination. It was a player that was less than or less than expected, but it was a premise and structure that never saw the light of the day. The scenario also denies. As for cinematography, everybody knows that another segue device is "curling up", as is the case with another 50th TV show ... but without the mockery? From the very beginning, I thought they were intensified, but the film itself was very serious to use this language in a similar way. The account does not ask me ... only the high point is the final song by Morcheeba. I think I wanted to leave people with something worth $ 8 ... I'm glad I saw on TV !!!!! Just foolish! Do you have a problem with Timothy Hutton's recent job? If you do not expect too much and you want to watch a stupid tension, it is better than cutting the toes and making an evening.
