There were some great actors in this movie! Unfortunately, they have forgotten to act. They hoped the film would be getting better, but it was a robotics that the player was deprived of. Actually, it turned out that maybe the actors always read a script. Perhaps the Musical account or director himself, but something, the makeup artist needs another job! Face Powder was so thick that she tied her to the actors' face! This movie does not recommend to anyone, no wonder that you find theaters desperate. Cuba Gooding Jr. James Woods embarrasses children who have not given it all. The soil was very good, just a few things needed.
