Annie's parchment does not look good. Annie is lovely and pretty nice to play. Annie appears in the movie, his suits look like Halloween suits. terribly moving and terrible areas. This is a change from the 1982 version of this movie. I think that a small and small girl should have a leading role. Ashley Johnson describes many boys Annie. It's not a charming one. At least with the casting director Daddy Warbucks properly. Ms. Hannigan was terrific. Camilla Belle Molly played well. "Warning" this movie can offend your IQ, as it can only be shown to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the fields can be very fictional and difficult in a real world.
