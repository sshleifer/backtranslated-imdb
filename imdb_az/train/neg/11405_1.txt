I have to watch this at school. <br /> <br /> This film is such a loss of your time. Do not even watch the movie. Please do not worry. You will be very disappointed. My teacher thought it was good. How wrong he was! She even slept with her a little. The film actors were just bad. The best actor there was an old man and did not say much. There is a terrible structure with horrible symbols. So, it is unreal and I can say that there is no point. The scenario was unusual and mixed. There were points in the movie, and when I entered my eyebrows, "What?" I said. There were also too many empty contacts and lean holes. It was just terrible.
