Whatever its name (writer and director), it is necessary to despair as it has not been repeated. This is a battle with the most terrible movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad because they are really good. This is not the case. It made me angry. Seriously. A 10-year-old drunk could write a better script. Which is a waste. ALL the actors were not working perfectly, the CGI could not be accepted, the sequence of scenes had dropped completely, and there were several stories in it. It just decided: "I want this to be and this is but I do not think we own this place, hit it and put it here Whatever happens, I will go back to my trailer to choose my nose, and I'm here if someone calls me. " Do not be ashamed of what your name is. Shame on you.
