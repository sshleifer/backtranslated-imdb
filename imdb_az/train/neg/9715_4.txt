This program is really overrated. An investigator like Danny Pino was transferred to the "rubber weapon group" a year ago. The whole crew consisted of egomaniacs who have been judging the returnees for decades according to the standards of 2007. As long as there is no other Vietnam veteran, no veteran character has ever been murdered in Washington. There is only one black killer and put him on a white boss. The only Spanish killer was a "race traitor" who, of course, killed a Spanish to build a Spanish street boy for a crime committed by two wealthy white children. Several propaganda. Hey, scenarios: minorities and poor people are committing a crime. <br /> <br /> Moreover, arrests for crimes committed by people in the 70s, 80s and 90s are 50-60 years old. No real life will push a murder, because the state will finally be overwhelmed with extreme medical costs until it is pulled down. He would benefit the state's families and insurance companies. The prosecutor calls them intentional homicide and will not serve one day. Only the old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime patterns or former Nazis, and higher-profile sentences increase DA's career.
