This is the official continuation of '92 'fantastic action tension. The original Van Damme was among the few dead Vietnam veterans who acted as the perfect soldiers (Unisols). Well, Van Damm has a daughter of this age, and eleven years later, that's all. For now, Unisols works with a government-class installation to prepare the latest Unisol 2500 for any reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the super-supercomputer (Seth - like snake in "King Cobra" in the same year) goes to the power-crazy, unisols orders and even downloads his new super unisol body (Jai White) in his computer brain. In the next step of evolution, we look at the nation! Many of Van Damm's battles, especially with Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg). push with a truck - do not go! Shoot him, turn it on - do not forget! Most of the humor is watched by Van Damman's already outmoded and out-classed (he goes even gray around the edges). However, though, he gets a flattering, though, goes on! The vast majority of this species is nude - pale imitas of the original, and this, of course, is not a great hit, but it is able to be fun, especially if you are a wrestling wrestler.
