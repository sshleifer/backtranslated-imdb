I've heard that this movie is a little dry, though I'm watching Scott Bakula. At the beginning of this film I was very happy with the classic favorites, but it did not finish until 20 minutes. going big. The corners of the land were crazy and unexpected and very clever. I spent my finger on it, and all of that was a bit of a terrible mistake, and I understood that we were getting credit and making a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I was watching him and regretted that I left a few quantum leap in hurry to recover my faith in the great Scottish goodness!
