I remember that. I still remember that "America's most entertaining people". Certainly, this is called America's nakedness or nasty or terrible disgusting people. Dave could not save this show, and neither Bob Saget nor AFV replaced the hosts later. The Jackalope segments were cheerful and yes, Dave Bobin could overs better than the good ones. But this show went bold, because of the naked videos presented by people. Both Olson developed as several different shows with bare guest stars, including Gemini. Plus it was his head before AFV began to collect drooling ugly as babies like innocent. Was videos disgusting and naked? But still the theme poems!
