This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only positive thing I could say was that it was so bad that it was funny. First, there is no plot. Actors seem to read replica cards and make the most peaceful things. Just like those who are being persecuted by the dead, but want to go out and seek their comrades. And the zombie was terrible, and no place was close to Romero's work, and it was like a movie. And the most horrible part of everybody showed the flash game in the sequence of the action. As we can not get a video game, the zombie's fired. It also aims to target a number of weapons that know how to use weapons in one of 20 varieties. The way to die is so stupid. As they end up in the ambulance, so stand around waiting for your throw. <br /> <br /> RESULTS: If any of these actors are seen in another film, they are blessed, and if you run away from the corner in front of the house, with a second chance. The worst movie I have ever seen. The B-film on Sinemax is better.
