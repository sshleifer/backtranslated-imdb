Her thoughts on a woman (Ann), two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her past on her deathbed. Those who go to bed are connected with the weekend of young Ann's friend Lila's wedding. He meets Harris at the wedding, and will have an impact on the rest of his life. He remembers him as true love with all his career and the loss of his family life. His daughter Constance is older, more "responsible", has two mothers and works together. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nina puts her husband and wife into the business and is not sure of his direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's good. The film details the period details. Clothes, hair, cars, homes and so on. He really puts another time and place. The film has many qualities. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at describing her character as a key character and her fragile intelligence. Claire Danes is beautiful and young when she is a young (and prominent singer) doing a great job as the main character. Hugh Dancy brought the life of Lila's brother, Buddy, to life. <br /> <br /> Now, unfortunately, everything is something else. Things go wrong as long as it goes on for us. Chemistry is great between young Ann and Buddy. Have fun and dance. Then ... you believe that you do not like much more than a friend, and that his nakedness just shattered him. Therefore, everything was thinking, "he could be gay", something blue and did not serve one purpose. <br /> Then there is Harris. Character, wooden & creepy treats If this were any other genre, you knew Harris was the next serial killer. <br /> <br /> All these girls are an incredible extension to think of her as much as she likes (but other kids describe it as smart enough to try and help her). <br /> And everyone's biggest problem. Why Ann and Harris do not come together? They fall into one another. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Several years later, I took my foggy eyes against each other and could not help but wondered why. WHY? The film will not tell you why you have to marry other people, and I'm sorry for having to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Part of the story is extremely boring these days. Cliché is a good daughter and cliché bad girl. Nina is changing in the film, but why am I convinced? I'm not sure what to convince him to change his life. The babies look like each other, thinking that a butterfly followed her with the old Ann. <br /> <br /> "There is no mistake," Ann advises us. The statement is not true with the story. And after seeing the film, they do not contradict the truth, and they wish them good talent.
