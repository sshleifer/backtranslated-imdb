I had some problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) Scenarios - especially Kim Basinger's sounds: Movies are not books; let us know what happened * they have to do instead of voting instead. Sometimes I find a movie with a voice over these works, but it seems lazy to write here. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel the connection between Jessie and Brother Thomas, and Alex felt that Carterin's player was pretty bad. It was a major failure for me to identify the characters of Jessie and Thomas. She did not have anything to do with me, she wanted me as a stud and seemed to be a problem of sexual deprivation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some films, <br /> <br /> Moreover, I did not think the film was too bad for me to turn off the TV. . . That's what happened to me.
