Fine speeches and art direction do not give a good movie. This movie is very scary and painful, and I can feel no joy at the "happy" ending of the alliance. Humor attempts involving the pregnancy of the lake are completely disastrous, and any movie belonging to Baldwin's brother is already a holiday. In a positive note, Lang is still one of America's most influential actors, just doing it to keep it in the VCR. I'll give it 4.
