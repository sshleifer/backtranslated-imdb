Compared with dramatic films, romantic comedies are considered to be light (see only the Academy Award nominations each year). But the good ones are really art forms. See "Harry Sally," "No Sleep in the Siti," and "Rome's Holiday" and "One Night Hits" classics. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to build something that resembles a romantic comedy. But nobody believes in romanticism among the main characters, and there is nothing funny to do with this major disadvantage. Mod is the way to become a leading person - a particularly romantic lead. As the Executive Talent has been made, I'm sure he was a tool for himself, but not in a good sense. And Gershon ... I see the capabilities of some comedy talents, but there was no writing and poorly developed character. And who had the British accent? It's meaningless. <br /> <br /> Others have said this, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly thought out, poorly executed; the actors are pretty bad; <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> Go back to the "Moonstruck" rental.
