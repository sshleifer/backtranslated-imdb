I've seen worse movies than that, but if so, I do not remember. Or maybe it's limiting them. If I suffer from hypnotherapy, I know that I can probably remember them as a child kidnapped by aliens or with other traumas. If so, I would gladly recall my memories of watching these films. <br /> <br /> You have to give me a little credit for the movie: it was a sensitive answer. I really started to frustrate the scenes that distorted other movies and television programs that contravened the travesty unity. I'm scared that this movie will not be able to watch movies like Dr. Strangelove by smiling with my eyes.
