It's still a horrible movie, though it's a claim that this movie is a joke against critics. If you follow such things, at least a good joke ...... First of all, Jeroen Krabbé thinks that the poor person is Gerard Depardieu ...... Naturally, Gerard Depardieu hates it. In a very funny 'Iron Mask' . Otherwise, it's a poison poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse. The poor man's box office is not fair because it is not economically deprived. What if I say that the 4th Adam was a kind of criticism of the bourgeoisie? this is not. Come on, let's say hypothetical, it was not sharp enough. Satire is a difficult thing .... if not sharp enough, the audience becomes a cover of joke ...... I think that's what it is. Story, everyone is interested and interestingly or ..... (very hard satirical for a more interesting and valuable application without seeing any Luise Bunuel) <br /> <br /> [Potential Spoiler Alert] <br / Do you really care about the impact of Geroen Krabben's cemetery, where his character is so hard? funny Since Mr. Voerhoven should be a good filmmaker, I think he will be doubtful and have some misguided jokes out of control ... Although Jeroen Krabbé is the worst actor and every character he can play, an ambitious bourgeois attachment . It's like a weird cartoon. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did this for you? Jeroen Krabbé is the gateway to jokes? I just do not see it ...... So, do you understand the dilemma I have here with me? This is the worst movie for a good filmmaker. So there is some kind of merger. I knew it was terrible without seeing Patch Adams. The fraudulent packaging or sophistication of the 4th Adam, the Good Director of Voerhoven, and so on.
