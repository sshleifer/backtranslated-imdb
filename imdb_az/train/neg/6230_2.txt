I was interested in this movie as a dirty lilac. I was totally disappointed. It was the same frustration I was looking at, "Friday 13: jason gets from the manhattan". <br /> <strong> then stops. many chests and 80s fashion fashion can not help this movie. The only thing that is eaten near this island is the piranha! I'm not asking for the 'genocide genocide', but I'm looking for cheap exploits. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I really value the time it takes to watch it I do not think. I could show that no one knows what's going on and what he wants in the background. but I will not tell anyone, "Ah, dude, you see this movie GOTTA." is not good enough and not bad enough to pay attention.
