At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) that he's always working for an adventure. He said, "Because I'm a phobia." So, he can not take his life by doing some compulsory activities. Yes, I think its reason and the course of this film is very ridiculous. Because "Tracking Detectives" is a boredom. <br /> <br /> Does one of these characters actually really make something interesting? Neil is a geek who owns a very small video rental shop. She and other cousins ​​usually stand around the shop and watch together watching movies together. When he went to the Violet store, Neil completely lost his life. She is a little hidden hiding eccentric woman. In any case, after some dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who continues to do cheerful jokes about the Neil and can not really do anything normal, Neil is totally against her. The question is so. Will they fall in love at last? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Tracking Detectives" is a romantic-comedy cliché. And they were even worse by ordering something else. From the first two of the installation, we know that Neil is a very discreet person and has not really done anything. And then, Violet enters the scene, all strange and annoying. So, at this point, we all know that we will sit down despite all the trivialities about what will end. Is It Worth to Hold? <br /> <br /> I said that they tried to give more to the audience. She tries to talk about her commitment to "watch the detectives." People explain how they reach something they want. Finally, the things we have done with purple are all tests that Neil's willingness to win his heart (or everything). Yes, I think it's totally scary. Neil just told himself, "Do not forget this girl, this girl is from a nutjob!" This movie will be pretty fast when you say! After several decades of collaboration with Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 days later", Ken Loach's "Barley Shaking Wind" and Neil Jordan's "Pluton Breakfast") is a pretty strange choice for Cillian Murphy Broken Lizard will shoot a film with Paul Soter, one of the comedian soldiers. Anyway, He is not a bad (ordinary), but a talented actor like him should not lose his time in the film. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly horrible as Violet. It is a mess of acting. That is, it has all over the place and has many advantages. <br /> <br /> Tony Montana would be proud. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the film is completely irrelevant. You can not actually link a point between a plot and its name; and then you will end up thinking that you will not make any sense. In short, if the movie "Tracking Detectors" is an unforgettable movie, you'd be able to hold it on the cable TV as fast as you could imagine. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 4
