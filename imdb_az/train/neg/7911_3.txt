It was not strangely enough to be really terrible, it was just unbelievably bare. <br /> <br /> Half of life was not bad, but it was very dangerous. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was too fast to be emotionally involved with the events. It just went bad. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; How are you drilling Deadpool in hell?

And what happened with all the stupid helicopter movements? That is, we know that mutants are, but still have the field of physics. A round-rolled staff is not a helicopter knife, but super-duper can not fly fast. Any gambit will not be able to do it anyway.

The Knee Coordinator just rolled off her shoulders and left them all as children who had special effects. <br /> <br /> You've come up with all the mutants who did nothing after that. The mutants shown to have their powers in their cells (see Quicksilver Node) were f-stories when they left. <br /> <br /> Only Emma did something really-this-for-this movie-Frost and Cyclops. <br /> <br /> And when was Logan pretty nice? And stupid, "the bullet takes his memory." Do not you think that Xavier and X-Men X1 have seen large philosophical bullet holes in the adamantium skull while riding it? Liev felt apologetic for the Schrieber man, in fact brought a good Sabretooth, given the script. One of the simplest super villains of Marvel was the real one. But the film failed to get rid of its epic hallucination. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the Daredevil suck level. A good story, a good player, a terrible performance.
