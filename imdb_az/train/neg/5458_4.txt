This film is, of course, a miserable attempt to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do so, they were thrown in to a 19-year-old person, probably to "do it." They would not be able to throw children 12 or 13 as boys because the lovers would give the scenes to everyone (even if they were allowed to do so). Mary Ann's wife was my brother's son and was pedophile. Sixth grade, people. <br /> <br /> Pedophile definition does not cover many children - everything you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really do not care about his upbringing or unhappy marriage. She was responsible for not living for her students. The reason given is that it is bipolar, rejects the diagnosis and refuses to take her medicine. If he does not think rational, then it becomes clear. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> All this, on the one hand, was a totally convincing and perfect cast for Penelope Ann Miller.
