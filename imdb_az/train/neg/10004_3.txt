"It seems that many critics think that the Woody Allen drama is impossible." For good reason: they are tolerant wooden and ambitious imitations of Bergma. Let's not even take ourselves: critics have strongly supported Allen Bergman's claimant, and Allen accused him of contradicting it. This is not what I received: why Allen generally praised Bergman, but the modern Brian DePalma shook "Hitchcock in shouting / horror films." According to Robin Wud, it's a strange form of cultural snobberries, and I have to agree with it.
