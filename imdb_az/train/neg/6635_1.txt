Alan Rudolph, one of the guys who showed us really wanted from Hollywood four years after debuting with an art house snoozer called "Welcome to L.A". "Roadie" barroom drums, horny harpies, Art Carney is a frat-boy fracas full of meat with a wheelchair and Meat Loaf on the wheel. Meat Loaf (Travis W. Redfish) is actually a very attractive display on the screen, and maybe it's a little smaller (in a better movie), but Zalman's script is stereotypical redneck humor and desperate. Meat Loaf is kept wide-eyed and moronic . Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie takes all the speeches - all embarrassed. Of course, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO STARS from ****
