It seems to me how it came to production. The main character is a ridiculous show that is the least ridiculous. I can not stop the character completely. She had nothing to offer at the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon in the last 10 years, no joke. Story lines are both written badly and fulfilled. These jokes are as bad as Disney's Zack and Cody's Sweet Life. I did not like this show, it was terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. <br /> <br /> This show is similar to what a few 15-year-olds wrote about themselves based on character and that they were really hot and when they were really arrogant. <br /> <br /> Johnny Testi, go very far and fast!
