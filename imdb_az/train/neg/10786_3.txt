How this movie was created by many great stars, beyond me. This is a horrible cliche film that has the worst effect on any of the actors. It's really amazing that many of the stars on this list will be happy with this unfounded movie. Even worse, it is almost 100 million in these countries. But the big stars may scarce the film, but we can weigh. I'm sorry for everyone involved in this betrayal. Billy Crystal did everything he could to do, and the rest of the stars walked through movements. Whatever you do, do not fall for the perfect cast, because no one could save it.
