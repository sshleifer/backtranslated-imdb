When I was young I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH! This show is good, badly written and rarely funny. All three potentials were good players and funny men (Saget's upgrade was better than this show, Coulier was better off standing and Stamos was better than the average actor). After a while, Stamos asked for the show because he wanted to do something more serious (who could blame him?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br /> Kimmy Gibler is the most animated character on television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> < br> <br> Three people living together in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trendy guys - Girls all go to the latest shopping centers and you can see the posters of writers who wish to come in. <br /> <br /> Now this show is at Nick @ Nite, I would say it's a very difficult classic, because talking to people who are so talented, y But this show was just sugary sweet, after a while it could not stand.
