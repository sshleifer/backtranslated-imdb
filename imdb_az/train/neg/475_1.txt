One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. When I watched him, I wanted to vomit. I saw this movie in the classroom of American History and its purpose was to respect the lives of a farmer in the West in the late 1800s. What we see is that the pigs are shot and then cut off, human beings are branded. Oh, and finally, there was a calf birth and I tell him that the birth is not too bad, but all my many liquids have led many people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was. Story structure is a widow and daughter, and moves to the west to become a cowboy's home keeper. They live a difficult life and are a pretty clear view of life in the West in the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not see this movie.
