What's boring movie! To sum it up, only Nana Patekar beat her daughter, Karisma Kapoor, while trying to escape deliberately with her son. Will anyone ever say BORING? The concept was not bad, but poorly executed. Canadians and some of the village scenes were shot beautifully. But in general, cinematography came to a short time. It could have been a story, but the movie just drifted. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole film was "Ishk Kamina" and it was only five minutes. Apart from that, this movie was an excuse piece.
