I really hate this delayed show, SUCKS! it's a great time and personally I think this is a kind of fairy type (you think you believe in fairies); That is, they have to check the spirits of those who come with this joke? but also a lot of madness in this show (a bad school teacher is really old), and also a stupidity of this show (boy's parents and fairy-tale father) - two of the things that hurt me and hate me all over the world In general, I'm telling you this show is very worrying and you should not see the eyes that you (usually avoided)!
