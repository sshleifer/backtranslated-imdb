This movie is probably an elf in Peter's Robin Hood suit instead of a man in Robin-Hood suit and does not see all the features that really matter. This movie is a fool of Wendy. And captain Hook is a TOTAL clown. And of course, each Disney cartoon should have a character that has a large number of hits, they made it one of the Lost Boys. The only character that is not rejected in this movie is Tink. Only the star is for him. <br /> <br /> Story after it? Darling parents do not take the time to see their children go! Probably one of the most important points of the original story and it destroyed it! It is also a famous nanny scene between Peter Pan and Wendy - one of the small things that does not make the original story so unique - there's no clinging and gum. He is even a miracle that has lost his shadow and can help him. <br /> <br /> So, if you know it before, this information - it's of no significance to the original story of the Disney version - really child story, not just a great story. <br /> <br /> It ends me.
