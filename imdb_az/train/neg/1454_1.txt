I recently watched this movie twice and did not understand how vulnerable the sensitivities were to this pile. That is, yes, it gives Hitler a great impression of the environment, and in the end of the 1890s, I express the way to overcome Austria in the WWI and the War. What I do not understand is why Hitler is 100% pure, dirty, unreliable, mentally unstable. Certainly, he was a very thoughtful, loving, and intelligent person, of course, of his darkness. But why does the name of paradise describe it in this way? All of its positive aspects have been removed from the scenario, and nothing more than a portrait of a man who has the greatest impact on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the destructive 2nd World War. Yes, he was a racist and yes, sometimes at the end of the war was particularly unstable. All right. Still; Why Hell Are They Only Public? <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie is a warning to warn us. The real threat of the Hitler and the Nazis was the opportunity to rise to power in times of severe global weakness. It is so strange that this evil is so well-known that almost every life's apple (not the Austrian and many other people) is warning this modern civilization. Experts believe it to be like faith - I believe in the weakening of the German people. As in this film, a man was no longer the leader of the party - ReichsKanzler does not mean the word. <br /> <br /> 4/10
