I watched the mask in the 80s and is now featured on Fox Kids in England (late at night). I thought it would be a little cool during the day, and there were some toys, but now my eyes bend to tears. I do not really see how tough and soft this cartoon is. This is just a terrible thing! There is no place in the same league as Transformers, He-Man, or Thundercats, and almost immediately after the cease-fire was almost forgotten by everyone. I'm just watching Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 straight (for example, it does not let me sleep for the first time). One of the 80 cartoons I hope to fully renew after completing Fox Kids's airtime!
