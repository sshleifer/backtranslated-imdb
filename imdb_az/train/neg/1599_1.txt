NATIONAL LAMBON CLASS was a flop when REUNION was released. Not long in theaters in my big city. Why? <br /> <br /> <strong> Life is a companion. <strong> </ strong> <strong> Most of the people in the Caucasus were beaten up, and this was unknown after Turkey. <br /> <br /> This idea is really great (slasher flicks parody). <br /> <br /> Only avoid this "comedy". You have more time to spend a nanosecond watching this embarrassing mistake.
