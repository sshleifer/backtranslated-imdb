Although I downloaded this movie to 2 in order not to make a full effort when trying to create a quality film of fear, it was an unexpectedly funny scale of 10. I did not understand what was happening in the film or what people were, but I was not interested in it because I knew something would be a laugh at every scene. The dialogue is minimal throughout the movie, but I believe that they started drawing without a script. Lack of life makes the film versatile. It is not important to talk about sitting down or watching from the beginning to the end of the movie. Especially I love the area where prisoners kidnapped each other with sticks. I refer to a doctor as a treatment. Great!
