This is a cheap slasher flicker that makes me glad that this "movie" is still released when performing a seemingly incredible work. Especially I have no problem with the horror and slasher jump, in fact they are my favorite. However, when they are BED, they actually take the ape, and it is not surprising that there are so many difficult moments of the genre. The story is clich√©d and without the imagination as possible with a group of people in a forest cabin that was cut and hacked by the zombie / ghost guy. His most troubled story, his treacherous function and dialouge, led home quality and made a terrible soundtrack. Making funny effects and some unusual lazy movies - these morons mean to believe that it is still outside at night, but not at night? What was the hell with the director thinking of this action? Was there a day to shoot all this? He was afraid of the darkness? <br /> <br /> I think the positive side of the actors looks like people working on a local supermarket. so at least it was possible to escape without seeing this movie. In my opinion, "teenagers" play a bingo at the local pub - but it's 40-45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good for a laugh, but it's a movie and another loss of time.
