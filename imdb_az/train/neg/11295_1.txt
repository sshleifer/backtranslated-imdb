I realized that this movie is prepared for children and as a parent I live in with many films that do not hold my interests, but I value the way in which my children are accepted. Parents should be encouraged to participate in the activities of children and to watch the quality of their entertainment, so that children's films should be something even more appealing to adults. Disney has always understood that it's hard to figure out how it might be able to carry the name of such a complete piece. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, voices are awful, and all dialogues are dubbing and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but as it was writing a 12 year old project for a school project, the dialogue itself was horrific twice as it was seen. "Operation" reminded me of a school game and none of the children's players had a lot of emotions. <br /> <br /> Now it's something that can keep the worst child movie ever before coming out as a baby movie that measures the adult bar with a video-geek. positive message. It is not far from me to determine how to deliver a message as it is right. <br /> <br /> Let's go through this movie to see what messages have been delivered: <br /> <br /> If you are losing it, do not worry, you will find a way to your home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To the organized personalities obey and do not think you are right.
