2 star, I am generous. (small spoiler) Look, this gangland is a low budget zombie movie set up in Oakland. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film is: what zombies? All the "zombies" (even frighteningly disturbing) are sown and fake red blood is given from their mouths! No fearful eyes, no rotten body, just a group of people fleeing as foolish and foolish. <br /> <br /> The lid is also misleading. The whole film has only about 6 zombies, so all the "header" is full of zombies or something, not just a few, and it's never in the past. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it's not funny. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> No one in this movie can act (maybe one of the network members) and really merged into a very friendly companion, decided to take their families and made a weekly film. <br /> <br /> Final copy: what doctors do sometimes? Skip one, please!
