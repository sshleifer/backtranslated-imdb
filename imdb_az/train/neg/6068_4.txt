Vodka Lemon is a charming but very unmatched Arminian movie for some to delight and convey to others. Although perfectly designed, there is no real "zing" in the film, referring to many scenes that appear to the real art scene viewer as usual. The film has a few minutes of cinematic shine, unfortunately, they deserve a decent film. Vodka Lemon, which is a dark comedy and very dark for a serious drama, will leave many different images and finally hate. You can laugh, but these moments are a snowy sight and probably an infinite number of buses shingles. A noble effort, as a result, is a lack of narrative confusion.
