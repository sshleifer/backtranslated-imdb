This is just a scholarship because these stars are David Hasselhoff. Well, then give me a bash. This film is not too bad compared to the garbage that it calls today. It's beautiful Leslie Cumming. He is very hot, but he can not speak very well. She has a beautiful scene with her when she is exposed to congenital abuse. He shows his beautiful body. Linda Blair does not do anything like Hasselhoff here. 3/10
