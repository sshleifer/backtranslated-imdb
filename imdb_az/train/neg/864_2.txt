Despite over 180 film repertoires to choose from, this Succubus is often called the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even legendary director Fritz Lang counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. That is, maybe I'm, but I thought it was a terrifying awesome and boundless movie. Although the opening was great, Janine Reynaud performed an SM action on the stage. Unfortunately, it's all down here. The character of Reynaud is, finally, a kind of maneater that kills his beloved ones. He had a good budget to work with Franco and enjoyed beautiful places, a beautiful photo and a perfect musical score. It could have been really the biggest film, if it were not for a bare and uninterrupted story. It's likely to be Psychedelic, but I can say that sophomoric is a better process to describe the above. Half of the time, if you have no clue about what's going to happen, what exactly is said is that even in the shortest possible time, 80-year-olds look. Of course, this is not Franco's best film in my opinion. I do not advise even deadly fans. If you are looking for a superior Jess Franco movie, try to get your hands on "Las Vampiras", "Terrible Doctor Orloff" or "Women's Vampire".
