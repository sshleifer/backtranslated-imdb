After being drowned by a bat in a cave, a physician named John Beck is exposed to rapidly turning into a human body. His wife guarantees that she is not wrong, only rabies or rabies of drugs. Local police believe that John is responsible for several horrible killings. Jerry Jameson's "Bat People" is hell of a horrible film. The scenario is fatal, delicate, and there is no darkness or nudity. so you numbingly drill numbingly, so that you can hit your head with a stubbornness after suffering through it. Even the design of a human creature created by a young Stan Winston is completely miserable and unmemorable. 10 years.
