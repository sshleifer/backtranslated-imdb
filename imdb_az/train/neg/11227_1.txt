This movie was bad at the edge of belief. In 2004, I saw at the San Francisco Film Festival. About half an hour before the start of the event, the audience explained that half of the theater was out of the "premiere of the world". I do not think everyone in the theater understands how bad the film is going to be at this point. We all understood. <br /> <br /> It was sold even though it was a documentary. Dark Angel has filed a bad biography and Bettie Paige guilty of remakes just about the half of the movie, really just the old Bettie Paige movies. The film is only 90 minutes and the content of this 90 minutes is the smallest. One scene may go, some will say, "Wow, you're too big Bettie, why not make another movie?" It's almost a funny Bettie Paige remake as a normal part of this movie (and even more boring) will be followed by 5 minutes. Until the end of the film, everyone was laughing at the re-establishment of the Bettie Paige movie. It was ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in the theater, but the filmmakers laughed, laughing at the movie, had poor content and structure. The most laughable part is those who are thinking of being serious or surprised. <br /> <br /> I know that movies are expensive. I did a lot of cheap movies, but the cinematography and quality of this movie separated it from everything I had ever seen. The film looks like $ 12. The lack of cuts, scars and sensitive parts is a memorable experience. This film is "Dude, Where's My Car?" Look like a citizen of Kane. <br /> <br /> I left my friends and theater feel as though we were tortured only $ 8. It was only part of the experience that we had to laugh that someone actually threw this movie and thought it was good. As it turned out, the previous night, the director of the "premiere of the world" / writer / producer, had come to the audience and was able to testify to the film's laugh and walk. Bettie Paige films were destroyed. They must also destroy this movie.
