Since I know what the movie is and I do not have almost any plot, I will not be bothered by the synthesis of the apartment. I saw several editors calling for a violent film against the IYYG or even a feminist statement, and I said that I was dealing with the disapproving hypocrisy of these allegations. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see in this film? True: behind a beautiful woman. It was an attempt by the zero to declare anti-aggression - I do not quite believe it - it's all right next to the point. Film is a sexual abuse and sexual assault, and the material is as graphic as it is (it's all but true) that ONE ON, but it's a great deal of hard work. <br /> <br /> Aggression (s) is disturbing, horrifying, and difficult to watch. There is something terrible in this terrible light, but there is no reason for this scene to last for 30 minutes. The victim had very few features and only a fraction of the aggressors were less developed (moments before the killing) so that the scene is not at emotional level. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Certainly, only for extreme sexual violence has been introduced and we can talk to the ISOYG movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, several reviewers praised the writer's lack of documentary style and noise. However, given the extent of everything in the movie (actor, scripts, etc.), I suspect that these are financial decisions, and the film looks like a documentary because it has placed the camera on the camera and makes it the stuff of popular porn actors. /> <br /> I need to talk about the contents of ISOYG. I love the abuse / horror and video nasties. Actually, I give this movie only three stars, because it really pushes the envelope more than other films. <BR> <BR> <BR> Besides, this is also a weak one and is a boring strangeness for the rest of the film after the raid has taken place. /> It's worth watching once you're a heavy 70s exploit fan, but I say, the film is not worthy of a really bad and really bad stuff.
