I bought it under the title "Gray Article" ($ 3, okay?). I was interested in the novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe as Non-DukesOfHazzard. Other observers have warned that this is a very boring story of a very secret government test. <br /> <br /> Yes, though, there is a lot of shooting at a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the cartoon and the inside are so unusual that filmmakers worry that they will forget who they are, so they continue to shoot us by showing off the buildings. In fact, it's funny. After a while, a TV channel is perceived as a station identification logo and reminds us that we are watching Gray Matter. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed both of the noise rings. At one point, an angry subject of trial, "Scientific b! Tch!" One is responsible for calling it. This is just a few inadequate insults. Several scenes are then a different subject, this "scientifically tard!" Shouting about vomit. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will disappear forever. It will not be possible to find any copies of it at least ten years ago. Almost none like it. <br /> <br />
