0.5 / 10. This movie is a good thing in this regard. Imagine that one of the worst I have ever seen is that everyone is not terrifying here, not just a few, but everyone. This is a joke, the low budget looks hopeless, the score is very scared, I can not say that the film will be edited, it would be a more ridiculous word that would be crushed. Combines serial killing, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. No scare, no special effects are hopelessly nude. bad laugh along. The writing was filthy. Cinematography is actually cheap looking and very silver, while the camera is scary. Again, what is really bad in the movie is how all the players are. Cheese.
