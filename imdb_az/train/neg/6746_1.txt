* HOW TO USE CLAIMS * The title "Bleed", when you make this puppy, you know that creative juices do not work at a high level. The film is a slasher movie of your key betrayal. I am convinced that the main purpose of the "crime club" tries to be creative, but we learn that it is just a joke. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the main plot begins to recognize a new girl in the city. She invites her friend to her and tells her that she is a "criminal club" and has killed people. We know that it was all joke, but before the hero killed a woman in a car park. Now members of the Criminal Club are killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the film is down one down. <br /> <br /> The first 10 or few minutes of this movie is illogical. At the start of the film, motions of murders are never disclosed. I would say that it's a way for the director to come out, but the scenes on the DVD are deleted! I'm convinced why Bleed does not want to see more of the feature length, but it seems that the people behind the DVD were more interested in the audience. In the box, there are Easter Eggs, but why is hell I do not want to spend time looking for extras in this movie? <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and Bleed surrendered to that front. Although not a fun movie is bad. Everyone looks good in the movie and has plenty of nudity, but the toy is just scary. At least my favorite character is a man who is capable of killing ... I think he should be funny and entertaining, but he comes as an instrument. The fun moment of the film is that our hero killed a lady in a garage in the park, and I think it is a death-dealing death. The hero throws women into a parking garage cement pole, and the woman only blows everything and she spills a mouth and slaughters. <br /> <br /> For those who think that filmmaking is a complicated, creative process developed by professionals, see Bleed. This can be done in a movie you can change your mind and get any hack. <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this.
