One of the five worst films ever I've ever watched. And I'm not in a good mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Chuck Murdock is the star of all star small league cups, which is a base for the nuclear weapon. Soon, "Amazing Grace" Smith is all star Boston Celtic inspired by Chuck's story and refusing basketball. Demonstrates protests from professional level to college until the end of the world, with small league leagues. Then all the children of the world are about to silence. It inspires the president of the United States to meet with the Soviet Union. At this time, they agree to timely eliminate all nuclear weapons for the coming of the coming Little League season. <br /> <br /> The film ended with the first pitch with Chuck. The president said he would not worry about slamming each of his best friend, Chuck, who did not throw a baseball every year. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line kill a boss under the hell Amazing Grace. He said he could never prove that he could prove the murderer of the FBI at the time he was found. Thus, the president calls the world manager ("I'm one", "do not blame me, take him to the line") and say that he will resign from all the company boards selling all his stocks. <br /> <br /> Fourthly, this movie was unhappy, so I could not close it. Television was between 2:30 - 4:00 and I watched them all. I did not abandon my anti-nuclear propaganda. The spectacular division of all the organized sports stopped me. I did not understand why "Amazing Grace" Smith was killed. And because all of these famous athletes are Chuck's friends, his son is upset by taking his stand always with a base. When your father told Chuck he had a clich√© moment: "I never said that, but I'm proud of you." Cue hug.
