I agree with the comments of other users that Gary Gillmore and Giovanni are the person who plays the role of two main roles. It was an extremely bad event. Before the movie, I did not hear anything that Gary Gillmore knew nothing about, so I did not know what to expect. I would think it would be like Dead Man Walking or Palata, but how wrong was it. The whole movie was talking, talking, talking about parents. Only cool scenes were where the father would not lose himself. It was my only interest in this borefest.
