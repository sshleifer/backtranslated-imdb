I came back from the movie and was totally excited. This movie is a mockery of all humanity. Maybe in the theater there were 4 people. This movie was recommended to me and I did not believe that this person liked it. I do not believe that any wise person wants it. There was NO PLOT EVERYWHERE. That was a joke. How can you shoot a movie about something? This film is just going to show that Hollywood is in such an insanity. I can only watch the spiral and giggle of the "Horror Movie" industry. How much travesty to shoot the whole movie, it is also valid for all new "teenage horrors" for the Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. All this is garbage. Do not support this kind of support!
