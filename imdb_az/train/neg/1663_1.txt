First of all, this plot has set off - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves it, snobby girl interrupts, lost all appearance, the girl loves everything, everyone loves it, and so on. heroism, single parental problems and, in practice, predictable as you can read with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I hate trying to break classical music. They say that everyone who engages in classical music is just as snobby and close-minded - in fact I do not remember exactly, but at one point in the movie, Holly says: "Why are they so ugly ... so classic?" < Thirdly, I've been to ten times, but the only reason I can think of preparing this movie is to promote Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Yes, the actress who describes Holly was really a good voice, especially when she belting, they were as beautiful as they did. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
