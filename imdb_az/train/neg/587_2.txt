If the film does its best to prevent hatred in the crowd, it distinguishes itself from the "miracle of the human body" documentaries. At one scene, the camera closes on a young 50-foot zit because a young man just squeezes out and squeezes it. In another, the camera is semi-finished in a morsel of half-digestible food and stomach acids, and parts of pasta salad are emptied from esophagus and reptile. In the last round strongly, the camera tracker draws a dragged path into a forest. Unfortunately, I do not accept any of these. If necessary, watch this movie, but: bring your vomit bag and do not have a pasta salad in advance.
