Amazing! Wow. I saw that this movie pinched me a pants. <br /> <br /> It is absolute, meaningless and hopeless. <br /> <br /> As Ash and co. <br /> <br /> You can take time with the help of the "Forest Spirit" ("Princess Mononoke" helps?). Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) are naturally high in nature, hippies, and try to release Chalabi ("Spirit") from some strange hunter boy. I do not know what else is happening. All this went a stain. According to Gun.Az, since then, Ash and his rebellious friend, Sam, have come face to face with Celebi. Ooo;) Then, after returning to his time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually the father of his opponent. And so I think. Pretty retarded? If you love children, then you do not expose them. (From 10 to 1).
