Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors who have been highly appreciated throughout my career, and the only reason they chose to watch this movie. Yes, I almost regret it! These two great actors are totally disrespectful, but do not do it, to do something that is not contradictory to each other, and to respect each other (which is also not bad) for the kitch. The only reason I can think is that the director is their friend and decided to play a leading role in supporting his movie, because this movie is very cheap because I do not think anything else! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not frustrated me since. I strongly advise you to avoid this movie, if you do not want your opinions on two actors.
