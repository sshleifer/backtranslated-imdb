When it comes to gay movies there is a little curse. That is, happy endings are not very common. Except for Beautiful Thing, gay movies result in broken relationships or timely death. <br /> <br /> The creator of this torn piece is one or two things to learn about the structure, direction and time. During the first ten minutes of this film, I found some confusion, and even after the first appearance of Jeremie Elkaim's character had a little psychic session. As you can see, this film accidentally co-existed without endurance or persistence. There is no real way to explain when viewing a genuine or a variety of images. <br /> <br /> The New York Times newspaper Stephen Holden called this movie "beautiful and absolutely brilliant". As you can see, Stephen spent his eyes on beer glasses before seeing it, because it's really nice. I look forward to something that I looked at for this movie. Unfortunately, he went to the movie title. And at the end of the film (I have not presented any resolutions), writers, directors, and filmes see that all is Undone.
