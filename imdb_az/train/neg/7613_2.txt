The small California city of Diablo is packed with mysterious deaths after creating an ancient box of sheriff Robert Lopez. In the 16th century called the Azar, the barrel had detained the Mexican devil. FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate crimes and join forces. The daughters of the sheriff, Dominique and Mary, to fight the evil and bloodthirsty devil. "The Legend of Diablo" is definitely a trash. There is no fear and protection in the film, the player is amateur and the direction is bad. Animation is just one aspect Now I'm a big fan of horrors, for example, "Torched", "Live Fodder", "Bone Disease" or "Neighborhood Tracking", unfortunately, "Legend of Diablo" To avoid the wrong way.
