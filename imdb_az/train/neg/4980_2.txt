<br /> <br /> CGI monsters were a good animated film, but the worst way was to apply. The scenes of the battle were not in battles, but in many actors, and then with many wolves. When the monster had a relationship, it seemed to be the dye proop. I think you should use models and puppets if you have low budget. <br /> <br /> Beowulf, talking about some movies, did not work, but the rest of it was missing or forgotten. <br /> <br /> The scenario blurred me. They had a one-minute conversation that seemed to be a day when Shakespeare would set out to play another drama club. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying "I" but it must be 'ye' and 'you', but you need to find a one-sided balance, so the lines sound like the same person. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very shiny. <br /> <br /> Behold, he did not spend the rest of the movies found by Beowulf. Turd, but there is no one in the queue.
