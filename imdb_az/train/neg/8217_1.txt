I think it's worse than a movie I see.

The comments made on the Internet are quite positive, but the IMDb (The sum of the 1 Star statement is explained and they can not be wrong, would they be alright?) And I think that a person is completely betrayed by everyone and "the worst movie I've ever seen" is used several times, and I have to be fair and agree with most of these negative comments by reminding me of the same thing. The story is horrible, but it's minimalist, but I doubt that it's minimal? There is no reason and explanation for what's happening and it feels totally random. It has been going on for centuries, the amount of space here will compete to fill the thirty minutes prepared for the wire program and have a full-length feature. Dialogue is terrifying with these pesky daughters who do not seem like a brain cell between casual things and many screams. O God screams, these girls are screaming or crying, or screams that they only annoy and anger, and that any mind maker will not feel any embarrassment for them,.

The two minibuses in the film were run by the members of the production, and basically there were all the budget places. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. I've seen a few films I've seen in one of the worst films I've ever seen, and now everyone who asks me is the worst movie I've ever seen? I hated it, every aspect of it and its unhappy moments.
