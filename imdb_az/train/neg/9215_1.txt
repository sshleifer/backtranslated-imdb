<br /> <br /> Perhaps, one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen, the Maze and the Monsters seemed to waste 101 minutes of my life. The film's only quality of payment was the scene where they tried to be serious, but they started to laugh because they were too bad. Does anyone die? Unfortunately, for M & M (fortunately for us) did not develop a calendar and resulted in a trilogy. This film tried to solve a number of problems, the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The D & D ended the frightening video of stereotypes that helped Satan's movement in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to waste your time and money, avoid this path. PS The cover is quite interesting, so my brother bought it, so it does not happen in fantasy, unless New England or New York finds such a place.
