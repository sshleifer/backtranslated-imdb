Oh, my God. I took this movie and ... I ... watched ... everything. . . Okay, it will be fine ... I know I'll be fine for a month or two. Soon, I'm thinking of getting rid of the flash backs. After the film, I would go for something to eat, but it is not possible to try and find the courage to try and eat any dish right now. Is it bad? Yes bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, it does not seem to be a bad way to get the message in a bad way. Hmm ... It's not horrific, there's no word to imagine how horrible it is ... Hmm strangely raised / acted horridly, film shot / directed / wrote. Now I do not know what to do but throw it. Perhaps you burn, and I do not want a thousand years to go under an architectural gas. The most loved movie "Hey Happy"
