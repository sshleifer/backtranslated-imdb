Oh man, does not this movie ever bite? If you are afraid to see the Slasher genre rehash, be as cheap and at the same time careful (PC-friendly, no nudity, the classic element of slasher films). Each clich√© is refreshed without a sign of self-censorship and action. Oh, the action word resets the horror. I need to get to know better, as the headline directs the Dutch translation.
