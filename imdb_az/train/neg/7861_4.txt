<br /> <br /> This expected sequel was very good and I sincerely looked forward to the great success of the rebuilding. <br /> <br /> This sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and cautious. <br /> <br /> The spouses are like each other. <br /> <br /> Violence is very small and violent, because there are many evidences that there is a place where violence is exacerbated. I would like to say that there is a SWAT team hunting a family of mutton mutants. Certainly you are expecting something different! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < Remake like me is a mess that has diminished fans like me, so the sequels are never met; at least this movie is not like the original fear of the original of 1985.
