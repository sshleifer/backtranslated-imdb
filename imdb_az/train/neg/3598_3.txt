Do you know that you are looking at your old video camera collection and see just what you see once or twice and you do not know if it's worth the time to see them? Alibi was one of those films; I have already found it and decided to make a decision. On the one hand, the movie is really bad, and now there is another free tape ... Yes, you get it. The field is foreseen and is not genuine in any way. Pacing is bad. The operation is bad, but this is not really surprising, because it's the past two soap opera stars. These characters are badly written clicks. The film creates the easiest damn way to impress me (through the film): court scenes. It does not even make a single emotion to any of the cardboard-slim symbols. The film has no real redueming quality ... even the dialogue is bad. Surely, it is full of stereotypes that are very funny. And it's something that raises above 1/10: the comic relief of many clich√©s and stereotypes (though unwanted). I did not give much attention to the movie, but there was something to laugh at once every time I looked at the screen. One last note: I use the line "Tori Spelling is not acting" as a line, but I know that everyone knows that I'm familiar with it as well as more informative. All this is a bad film, but if it were anything else, it would be worse if you were on TV. It's good for a few laughs, if you take it. 3/10
