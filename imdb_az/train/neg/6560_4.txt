"Shadrach" is not my favorite movie. I found it very sensitively and was parallel to the game. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors believed. I did not believe Paul's parents would leave the Dabney family, especially when they were home-owned. Their social classes were far too far to be considered convincing. Dabney's lifestyle seemed exaggerated. There was a scene at the beginning of the film, showing that Andie MacDowell had come out of the car after entering into a sexual relationship with someone. Who was it? His son? What did the scene have to do with us? Why was the scene included? He has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and in fact has never been repeated. There was nothing to do with life and did not fit anything. There were many discrepancies in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was wonderful, but I did not believe that Dabney would be kind and generous as described.
