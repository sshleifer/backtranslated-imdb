One scene demonstrates the mindset of Terminator Woman: Karen Sheperd and another woman try to escape from the villain camp. Karen runs through an armed guard who shoots his gun, but in a few seconds he throws him and calls for battle. Karen shoots the ball, takes the gun and runs away! Once again, you know that when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / written by another member of his family, you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble are a bit funny early in the purple, and better when film focuses on love-hatred relationships. But after about 20 minutes, the film is divided and the film slows down, and sometimes there is no excitement for the battlefield. Finale Trimble fights with a Kiss in a cave, and Sheperd goes to a woman-a-woman on a fast boat, beautiful Ashley Hayden, but the fights cut off their flow and cut off their values. Good-bye to the suit department to give Karen a chance to split off the movie on the positive side! (* 1/2)
