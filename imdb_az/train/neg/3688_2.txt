As always, I went to watch this movie for A.R. Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. If it wants to end this movie with Rajni, it will succeed. But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure. He then gave a hit with Chandramukhi. <br /> <br /> I've read another user's comment on the Ragga. I found it interesting that the user is more than TN. He is an actor who acts in the heart, not from the mind of Raju. Kemal Hasan is not a method actor. <br /> <br /> Thank you to Ragga. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> .....
