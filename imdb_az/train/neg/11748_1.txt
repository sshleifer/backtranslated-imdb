This movie was forced to give the DVD one of the worst I've ever seen! If the film had more financial and writers, it could click on the story line. These nonsense and unhappy scenes are cut off from the parents' warning .... But the line of the story resembles an empty place. If something like a movie was a means of shooting, it would have benefited from it. This reminded many of the quickie films shot in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Only sensitive characters in the whole movie were barmen and strange. The rest of the film could easily be made by middle school children. I would rate this movie as 1 degree because it was really terrible and left the whole family cheated. My advice-Do not Don't Watch it !!!
