It was a cute movie until the end. Finally, it was a tougher effort to reduce the number of men and to strengthen women's self-esteem. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passivity and aggressive nature to use her will to put her own strength and the boy controlling her relationship with her. She undoubtedly begged her to sit down behind the driver's wheel in the car after she had to agree with her to take her back. This film is a triumph for all women who have a responsibility to control the responsibilities of men and their relationships. For this reason, it was a landscape movie.
