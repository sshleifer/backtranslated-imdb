This movie reminds me: "Irr√©versible (2002)" is another violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say that it's a bad movie, it's just special. Also, in Camping Cosmos (1996), I recall that a group of low class figures are residents of a camp in the Belgian Sea. With the same description of the person living together, the conflict with each other, and all the conflicts that are not compatible with each other. I also thought of the books of French writer Emil Zola, a writer of naturalist-style. I did not like the movie, and I did not like people in it. All this looks so vulgar, without any good taste. For the sake of the question, they all seem to be a great Persian member who is forced to live in the planet on their own. Or almost hell in this world.
