The Hamiltons describes the story of four hamilton brothers, teenage Francis (Cory Knauf), twin Wendell (Joseph McKelheer) & Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens) and the greatest parent David. Hamilton's move home is a lot of why France is not sure and does not like the job. People who kidnap, arrest, and kill his brother and sister in the basement do not help to relieve or calm Francis' nerves. Francis knows that something is not just right, and finally, when you learn the truth, you will never be the same ... <br /> <br /> As the Mitchell Altieri and Phil Flores jointly co-wrote and directed, Butcher Brothers up to April Fool's Day (2008) remake of just another filmmaker, it was not enough) that in 2006, Dark Horrorfest (or whatever called) maintained most of what I thought was Hamillons complete and completely unhappy. The character was really poor, not too difficult, and the slow-moving story could not have been imagined and interested me in the 85-minute 86-minute process. In the end, there is a negative twist that laughs at me, there is a really great thing to do in the Hamiltons basement, and how it will eventually be a small boy with teddy. Is this really scary to us? Is it really shocking us? Is that really something we talk about as the latter loans? Has a safe young boy graduated from doing the best 'curling'? Pregnants do not get anywhere to get all their money to buy all their homes, because none of them will do business (a slaughterhouse in David and many doubts) or why they did not. The scenario works every day with intense fear in drama and is a terrific job combining only two aspects, which are memorable and ineffective. <br /> <br /> It is mentioned in some films. <br /> <br /> Despite being a writer and writer in some of the movies, there is nothing strange here, there is a little blood splatter, and a few scenes of girls have been chained in a basement, but a bottle of tomatoes at home and a camera you can not do yourself anything. The film is neither scary nor very middle-class because it has a zero atmosphere or mood. <br /> <br /> So far, there has been a small budget theory in the city of Petaluma, California, USA. not bad, too much to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> The game that I'm not aware of is not something to write home. <br /> <br /> Hamiltons are also the main cause of dullness and boredom. will never recover. Add a very productive story, do not talk about it, dump a trash and do not touch the character, and you have a movie that does not surprise me.
