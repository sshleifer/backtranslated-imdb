Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know a little less about Japanese culture and Japanese pop culture. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm Spanish, I eat paella and love black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with this point, I can comment on the film: Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director - even though it's extremely pedantic postmodern things in the style of headlines, it's interesting and interesting - and I liked it. It can only be captured, but I'm scared, but I fooled the movie as a European audience loaded over a European officer. These jokes seemed bad, the script was cooked - that is, breaking the audience and shutting up a little lantern - almost to the point where my head was blown up on the speed of speech and the absurd movement. But, I thought the animation was really cool. This idea is great and it is highly exploited in the animation scenes. But the pictures are not infinite in all the mumbo-jumbo speeches on the pictures, but they end their eye candy after staying out of a funny start. <br /> <br /> I have read Mamori Oshii, for which it is planned later. This idea was good, but it was heartfelt. Perhaps the second part of this is the first good thing to do, and it can actually make an interesting movie, or maybe even more narration scenes. <br /> <br /> Of course, all these comments are based on the experiences of those in Europe. <br /> <br /> Of course, all these comments are based on the experiences of those in Europe. Perhaps this is totally useless for the Japanese people, perhaps a really funny movie that lost cultural boundaries and translations. Can be.
