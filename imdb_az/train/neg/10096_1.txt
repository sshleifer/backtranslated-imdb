This movie has to be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film encourages viewers to think with hope. The story line of the movie is best to laugh at you, which is ridiculous and frustrating. The name "Zombie Nation" actually contains a part of zombies when there are only six pieces. This can not be classified as a frightening film because of the use of severe 80 music during the zombie attack. The zombie actually speaks and acts as a man in the film, the only difference is the look that looks like something from La Roux. If you get the chance to buy this movie, turn it on.
