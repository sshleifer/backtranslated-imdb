For the first time in 1986, I read "Jane Eyre". At that time, I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a perfect version and it was like a book. Years later, he looked into this version and was terrified. William Hurt, like Mr. Rochester, is bad. Mr. Rochester is a sensitive character, where William Hurt describes him as a bloc block. The same thing is for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. It's a story about love and passion, but it could not see this version. No, go back to the BBC version. A beautiful time warranty is provided.
