What is the classic novel's empty and glittering? I would like people to stop communicating with classics if they do not know anything about true intentions and original points. This version is different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version was very bad, even though Kathy was like the fall of Juliette Brioche as the most terrible decision ... anyway back to this version. It aims to develop a contemporary and modern musical style story. They both succeed, but this is a high quality art. Perhaps for a rainy day to look ... The value was moderate and the arrangement was terrible. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma is a great adventure like Hindley and in fact one of the British wastes talent. The Heath part is played with great attraction and confidence, and I think casting is the most important point in this project. A more talented filmmaker would use his opportunities better. He explained that he was the director for the rental and did not succumb to the passion he deserved.
