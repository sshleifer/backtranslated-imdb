It's a horrible film as everyone says. It made me laugh, was Scott McNealy's Cameo look, one of the programmers who were killed in front of the SUN logo wall. McNealy, SUN Microsystem CEO, is a self-defending company with Microsoft's hate. They played an important role in providing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. <br /> <br /> According to SIA, the shootings of this film will fuel the fire. <br /> <br /> There is no public note about SUN's involvement, but the creators of this film are open to Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
