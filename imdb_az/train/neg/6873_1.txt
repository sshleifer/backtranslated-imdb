At the beginning of 2000, television production was poor and bad. Before the recording, such as Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk, the television did not have the right to be able to keep the attention and interests of the audience in the 2000s. (Relic Hunter), Mutant X, (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even Baywatch Hawaii, or at least as before. (Special Unit 2) was excluded. In fact, Black Men meet the nickname "X Files"! (As if they were a special unit 1). But this is a brilliant formula; he did not do a good job. It was hoped; then eleven X-files have been saturated with "supernatural" eleven years, so the natural spirit is to make this naughtily lampoon (imagine Mulder as a female actress!). Nevertheless, it was not a strong thing to do this the most powerful or funny Sci-Fi show (Special Unit 2). It was so funny, for example, every sexy situation should be turned into ugly disorder. He used bad taste from misery. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and very unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry (Alexondra Lee), as well as everything he had with any sexual interest. Of course, the show has gained a comic appearance, but in general it was a groundless one. Obviously, there is nothing more interesting than his main idea. (Evan Katz) should be the downside of these works as the other writer and co-producer (Seven days) or earlier (24)! In spite of his personality, he was often a foolish whore. That's why they had a goal, so they really created one of the thirsty! Indeed, it would be one of the rare occasions to be grateful for the cancellation of a show after only 19 episodes!
