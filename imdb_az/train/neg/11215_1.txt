At first, this movie looked pretty good, though it was pretty fast, and it was good, though it had only $ 60,000, but if she found her sister in a lake, and if you know who killed her, why would you pursue it? They shot him with a bullet around him and threw him out and ran away and killed yourself. Of course, after finding your brother dead on the lake, we found a clue and you knew who the killer was, why not give it a rope for a police officer who thinks he was killed? And at the end of the movie, he acted as a waitress, and when talking to a bad man, he met a place and killed him and said what he did for "proof." I do not know it was not happy with the end. It would be nice if this movie lasted longer and it was not so bad if it was better and finer! Do not lose your money because you like to write here.
