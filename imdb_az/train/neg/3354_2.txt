In my opinion, when you decide to shoot a very good movie, you should try to work better than the original; or at least give a fresh look. In 1963, Robert Wise, a remarkable novel by Sirley Jackson, entitled "Hill House's Haunting," deserves the admission price today. Now fast forward and rebuild until 1999. I shook my head and asked, why? The actor appears to replace wood, the story is unrecognizable, and the whole point is to replace the subtle horror of the original with the special effects that computers can create. I've heard that this update is bad; but they did not believe it was bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching it and saying how awful my husband was, he said, "They've earned good money!" He is right, do not let them take you. If there is no profit to be careful, it will probably meet high standards that will not stop them from building or insult their audience
