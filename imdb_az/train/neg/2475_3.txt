I'm disappointed. The film was a bit prettier and plastered on every side of the box. Having said that the heroes were well developed, the windego midi was used in a unique space and was quite strange at home, but missed it for me. I was expecting great AHHHHH or BOO! <br /> <br /> In addition, the film faced poor shooting of poor private effects. Thus, not to display a very bad thing and not to use the atmosphere and the viewer's perspective, to create horror and inaction. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube, if you're looking for a low budget, but well thought out horror movie.
