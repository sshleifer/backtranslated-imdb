Meera Syal, an author of the Anita and Me, the novel and script, appears less likely to propagate the English language, complain, and propagate common antipathy. This movie is a common feeling of English dominance. <br /> <br /> In this film, the English people are overweight, violent, bad, foolish, childless indifference, foolish, uneducated. Indian family is beautiful, intelligent, educated, multi-lingual parents who care and love, and grammar school feeds. The film resembles an indifferent analogue, which can be damaged in a similar way. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> , I thought I would sleep in my hair. Firstly, the gossip scene among women on the Divan holiday - Word: The British are ugly and stupid - men - themselves: British women are prostitutes. </ STRONG> </ strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ Weddings is a deception goal - all the way through the film is clear. Anita's character was so terrifying - almost frozen female trope - because I ended up frustrating the film. <br /> This is not about "bending like Beckham", but humor is a film about two girls who come together in a society that is in love with the behavior of a society and the exaggeration of the customs and the different rooted ones. Instead, Anita and Me state that the cultural apartheid is inevitable, as English is an indefinable caste in India, and the "other" community of this film is highlighted by many series of attacks: English. <br /> <br /> I feel Anita and me, a hate-filled, complaint-based piece of work. Accordingly, the BBC should not finance the production.
