This is a very bad western because it is a historic mistake. It looks like Jack Slade shot in the back window in California instead of where he lived and died in Montana, Colorado, and Montana. It creates everything that is known about this mysterious 'evil man', 'good man.' Scenario is awful; There are very few directions and bad deeds. Dorothy Malone was completely disappointed as his wife. Mark Steven never knows how to describe this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was the head of a very good line of scenes. He was afraid of drinking hard water by his local population. After being drunk, wars in Virginia begin and cause other problems. He never stopped watching the city immediately to secure Jack Black as a guardian to ensure he could not turn them into terror. This is a terrible film. I can not recommend everyone to watch this movie, even to see how the Hollywood butches history will be.
