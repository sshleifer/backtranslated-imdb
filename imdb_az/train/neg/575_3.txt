This movie is not very good. It's boring and not too blood for a horror movie. Land is not too much to do. And I think that women's vampires were very stupid. There were many possibilities to kill vampire hunters because it illuminated them as reflexes. But when one of them is stranded, he takes his time and everything happens where he does not cling together. <br /> <br /> RESULTS: No place is as good as the first Vampire movie. If you spend your time, you are a SUCKER.
