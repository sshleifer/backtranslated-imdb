Well, I've always been a fan of a Steven Seagal, and his films are usually big, but it does not give up until it's just left. This is very stupid in my opinion that I have not liked all this. The biggest reason for not dislike me is that it is very flawed and does not give me much. The player is very good, even if the Steven seagal does not move well, I can see because I just shoot videos from the rest of the actor. It does not explain a straight story, everything happens suddenly, so it's not very meaningful. However, there is no movement in this regard, and you usually need action to make a motion picture. Special effects are very bad and you can say fake. All of this is the worst movie of the seagulls, so if you do not want to see Steven Seagal, we do not claim that this is not present. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> General score: ********** ** *****
