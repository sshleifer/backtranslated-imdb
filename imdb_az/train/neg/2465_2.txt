If it were a good arrangement, it would be a Hollywood voyage that would be watched. It is based on the typical American thriller - "everyone will go out". Acting on a moderate level, but if the film's tension increases with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film, he is basically responsible. The film drowned completely with blank video and soundtracks, and most of it looked like raw material. In general, if you do not mind watching a movie similar to a student film project, this is a movie to watch. In my opinion, it is enough to say that everything can really strain enough tension.
