It laughed all the way through the rotten film. This is incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage and carries an accident in front of a real estate office. What is happening? The office manager comes and works for him! You! Something you know about two women. Yep, they're lesbians! There is nothing in the film "There Is Better Than to Live". Dialogue dialogue like "I do not accept the rest of my life as I have the chance to be happy". She has a rich, remote mother who does not accept her new relationships. Intelligent black girl - unbelievable, a film was shot in 2003 and there is black black servant there. Hattie McDaniel should return to his grave. She has a woman who is saddened and needs a juvenile imprisonment. Sheesh! No clich√©s are allowed.
