Råzone is a terrific movie! It's so simple. As you can see, they tried to shoot a movie to show their makeup life. Like many years ago like Zappa. But, unfortunately, there are no good young actors in Denmark. Leon is still very small girl at "Krummernes Jul" and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. plays a few times in the movie, and destroys this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if you consider a movie that I need to see. I do not agree with the behavior of young people, but I think that maybe if your child allows them to fall. It is also important for the sea to support new companies such as the movie and the people of the film! <br /> <br /> People should see Råzone. Not because it's a big movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important issues. It is also important to note that there are some violent scenes in it, and in fact, in these scenes, Laura moves well. - like the end of the weapon!
