STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday night ** Sunday night * Monday <br /> <br /> American soldier just launched a new secret fighter plane, unlike any other to run away. A colorful pilot (Steve Touissant) collects him to seize the US government with ransom. So, instead of being freed from a detention center where they have been deprived of all the abuse they have learned over the years, they have to send him the best John Sands (Seagal, who else?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <strong> I thought. But I decided to go to FOF, because the shadow man was not bad (by the same director), and hell, Seagal was once a star of my favorite movement, and maybe he could have shot a bigger one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> Undoubtedly, his next film, once at Hood, will appear at once (apparently) that the contract with Sony has ended, this horrible European lens action movie and the next film will return to the Pistol Prince cinema. Hell did it first, and Stallon could do it in front of him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a Fury crash. This is not even a fun flight. There is even a flight that can not leave. *
