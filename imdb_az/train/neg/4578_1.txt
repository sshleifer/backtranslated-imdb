Again, a religious reunion. It's not spoons, because the REAL end comes after looking at the people who brought this very extravagant, lying-scientific infomercial ... Ramthan's School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When I need any religion / philosophy, I'm away to hide behind a cheating deception screen. Thanks to Ramtha, I was watching a borrowed copy of this movie on a "friendly" recommendation ... it would be disastrous to spend valuable resources on this new century lobotomizer. I only hope that the "really can come to the water" is enough to come to the "logical" conclusion to the management ... in other words; walk, drown ... or shut down :-) As a movie ... it is worthy of "1" worth the entertainment value to create the most favorite character in film history (especially the roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!). . If you see this movie, take it from a man with a brainwash that recommends it.
