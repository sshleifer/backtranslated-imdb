This is a direct video collision in the Tremors series, for sixty seconds of inspiration (knife: you'll see it when you see it) and it's more tedium and filling rather than shaking the sticks. Tremors 4, of course, were hit hard at a low budget. Almost three or four minutes of precious worm was a mojo, with a special effect on human beings and peaks. The silent, clich√©-climb and hackneyed writing Tremors experience the remaining hours of 4 hours and at least fifteen thousand years of experience. Only hardcore Tremors fans will enjoy less this movie. Do not worry if you're not among them.
