I'm an actor, producer, director and what I'm saying is a fact. This project was the worst film in history. Editing the producer and the movie called the so-called movie is a joke, and I mean a great joke. Why Blockbuster released this kind of thing? My job is very serious, and this is an insult to me. Was the director trying to shoot a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen the worst Zombie movies, but this is a cake with Coffie and Cursing table everything. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! I hate talking bad about other filmmakers, because I am myself, but think of different professions. I am compelled to finish a movie, but because I have to ask, "YOU WOULD LIKE MORE", I would think girls' makeup, horrible zombies. To all the nation, if I could vote Zero. FILM ABOUT THE FILM AWARD!
