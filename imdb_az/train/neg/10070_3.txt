Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his appearance as the same gambler guy Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes, former friend of Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a mistake that's wrong with personality / accusation. <br /> <br /> <strong> Rogers is a "dual role" because of its development. Rogers are as charming as usual; but it really enhances the usual performance above - it's done by any potentially vulnerable material to deliver the memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance. A good pair to watch, Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye, Steward magazine reporters, are the highlight of the movie. Songs are good, though badly announced. Mr. Jesse James (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
