I just saw the premiere of this movie on MTV. It is necessary to say that this is very mediocre (the best). The dialogue did not explain the story very well, and I felt as if there were many field holes. Due to its weak functioning, there is no unpleasant character in this adaptation. Whenever I just love one, I see that all the characters are very satisfied. Also, the love of Cate and Heath seems to be very intimidating. They look more like lovers than brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on previous films and watched it for a few actors, but as I said, it's hard to love like any other character. Katherine Heigl's performance was a complete shock. He was afraid Edward would be his brother, and for me, Aimee Osbourne did not even have enough lines to criticize his performance. Johnny Whitworth did a good job, and recently it was a great deal to see him, and though his character was a bit strange, he was the only person who sympathized with me. When it comes to Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were claimed to be our heroes, but they were so exaggerated and overdramatic. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie or music. The Christian punk group had a short look at MxPx, but this small image did not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a great job to convince me that this movie was not. I just describe something completely different.
