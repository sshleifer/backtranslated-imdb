I remember those days when Basinger's typical Blondie characters were nothing else than a beautiful face decorating films with romantic interest or danger. However, she was awarded the Oscars as Best Supporting Actress for Oscar's role. the legendary LA Confidential, and I'm not the only one to be surprised by his solid performance. However, from now on, his career has not come to the ideal end. Without a doubt, the prestige won by this film is to participate in moderate prestigious films (like "I Know People or Door Door"), but we have never seen it with a significant character. and not only is his character very tasty, but also the movie is really crappy. The scenario of this movie can not be more null and void. However, Basinger brings some condemnation to his character, and this will earn a few points in the movie. This movie is full of clich√©s and common monsters. Director Susan Montford is really disastrous for a number of reasons, but mostly film does not get a good rhythm and tone. It's a smile. He does not recommend, despite everything. This film is the main cause of drilling.
