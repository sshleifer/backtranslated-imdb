... Or, rather, when your spouse laughs, your life has a bad time! In 1983, James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker" is one of the most terrible productions of the Sword & Magic sub-genre, but it is very entertaining. Acting is terrible, the surface is bent, and the effects and photos can not be more amateuristic. <br /> <br /> - They say: - Some movies, movies, films, films, very powerful and experienced warriors. One day, a good witch assigns him three chaos and power of creation, a sword, fox, and trousers to free him from the cruel king of the land, the wicked king, and the sorcerer Munkara. The sword is so easy to buy, the amulet and trousers are owned by Munkar. Fortunately, the evil king formed a tournament that fought against each other until the death of the most experienced warriors of the country. Then the victory will replace the king. Certainly, the king does not want anyone to take the place, so he plans to kill the winner (instead of organizing the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not just to get rid of the three creative creations, but to rescue the old, good-looking king's beautiful daughter (Barbi Benton) from the evil Munkar claws. Fortunately, she will not be bothered when going to the tournament, because she also allows the release of beautiful female fighter Kaira (Lana Clarkson) during this time ... <br /> <br /> The film is huge, incredibly stupid and funny scenes . Some of my favorite scenes are: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker takes the head of a bad man with a sword. But the falling head is not the head of that person. <br /> <br /> - For the first time, when the woman was described as a man of war man Kairan (Lana Clarkson), she was once seen once. black dress, hides his face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights with him and opens his mattress (below it, of course, topless) during the sword fight, opens his breasts. <br /> <br /> - The last fighter Deathstalker is a giant man with a head and head to fight in the tournament. a pig <br /> <br /> - Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a sky. <br /> <br /> Some reluctant, funny, exciting, great scenes. The player is strange, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are in the mood, and although I describe this film as "unpleasant funny," sometimes some actors have impressed that the film was bloody. There is a fair amount of unhappiness and many women's nakedness to entertain the audience. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still strongly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
