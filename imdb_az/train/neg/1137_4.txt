It was like trying twice to get this movie for the first time, and it was like pulling teeth and for the second time I failed despite having a large DVD conversion. The problem? <br /> <br /> If you do this in the dramatic courtroom, which is the most part of the second half of the film, it's hard to reach that point. During the trial there are some interesting talks by Abraham Lincoln (Henry Fonda). <br /> <br /> <strong> It was touched upon as it coincides with the progress of Lennin and its memorial statue on the screen. </ Strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> Good story, good act, and so on .... but not spark in the first half, the viewer hangs there. I doubt Abe Lincol is more interested in this movie.
