Every new dropping show deserves at least my "three strikes" policy. I give a comedy 3 laugh, 3 full episodes. After the first episode, he said, "I was canceled tomorrow". That was bad. Now I've watched the first 4 episodes of Cavemen, and I even smirked it. In fact, there are no facial movements, not a beater, a patch, a shorts. I will continue to punish myself by following each episode because I'm sure I will lose something in this show. I'm not just "winning", but I believe that the Prime Minister's comedy on a big television network is just funny; but I have no laugh at me. ABC will present the most funny comedy of all time at 8:00. I know that I do not tear my brains, but there's an internal joke. I read any of the previous comments, I bought the social aspect of it, but where are the fugitives? I'll suffer at least 30 minutes a week, but there is a moment of light and shout "Eureka" and touch my head.
