The first half of this film is a pure pleasure. Roman. Funny. Spectacular speeches. The nearest woman in Manhattan falls in love with her sister and sister! Adults. Bright. Charming. What more could you ask for? This is like a romantic comedy. It leads the untested area. <br /> <br /> This is a one-time-out-of-the-secret story that has been implemented many times, becoming a universal comedy. What a disappointment. It begins with a popular film. Why should I turn on such a pedestal "Who am I". <br /> <br /> Heather Graham's ice cream frame, highlighting the uniqueness of the last part of the film, jumps to celebrate "the happiness of finding himself." <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magic. The same old old ended up being old.
