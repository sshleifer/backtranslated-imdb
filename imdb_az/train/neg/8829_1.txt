This is a terrible piece of story telling. About an hour about the movie, about what we were thinking about; Heroes are often marveled at the miracle; actions often appear to have nothing to do with each other; no one is really worried about killing his daughter; a pair of swimming that seems dangerous but nothing is in the waters; The Irish people are strikingly face-to-face with their friends ... for the sake of continuing, the film itself would be boring. Only half amusing element is landscape photography; but everyone can take a memorable shot on a camera in Australia. Generally, it is terrible, unbiased, ambitious, and terrifying to ward off most of the suffering.
