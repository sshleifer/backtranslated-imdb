I was filming this movie yesterday at the FX and as I watched, it could have been the worst movie for me. Bad fun, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally incredible fighting sequences, stupid characters. All this was the laughably worst movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was surprised that there was nothing superfluous for me to look at ... and they went on!
