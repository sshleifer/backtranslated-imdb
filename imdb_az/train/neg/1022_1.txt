Beginning with the poster (Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only), the entire movie was a scam. Another stereotype, this movie was nothing, or nothing new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just got to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story relates to some wrong system. In the city, everyone is supported by a hidden loss of work and in the city under the expectation of some hot-shots politicians. What is the name of the mighty and the above-mentioned organization FRAT and what it means? They have a kick-ass loony police shooting and beating beating - suspect, girlfriends, name it. FRAT's police are corrupt and greedy, so they understand the mistakes of a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after incredible bad draw shooting and more stereo lines, everything happens to a happy end and serves the last line: you will not beat the system. Bah! Do not see the hardness of the film. Freeman and Spacey are totally 10 minutes!
