Sequels has a bad habit of disappointment and this is the best loan that I can give that keeps the old tradition. These three stories are nothing better than the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> The Trinity is the only one in the idol who comes to take revenge on the killing of the murderers. The second story relates to the lake monster, which seems to be nothing more than a drifting grass, and it surprises you that someone may be afraid. Third story is a tale of Stephen King as a truck driver, but is not a fairy tale about a deadly traffic accident victim for a person who destroys him <br /> Instead of watching the original Creepshow instead, If you have already done so, you will be happier.
