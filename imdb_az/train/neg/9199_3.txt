Lynn Hollister, a small city lawyer, travels to a nearby big city near his workplace on Johnny's death. (Yes, Lynn is a man in the name of a Christian who sings a woman). Hollywood first believes Johnny's death is an accident, but he soon knows that Johnny was killed. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red; "> Noir style, which became popular in 1941. Despite the subject, "a man betrayed" is a lighter romantic comedy than a crime drama. <br /> <br /> Hollister is in love with Cameron's attractive daughter, Sabra, and the film then concentrates on romance as in the shooting elements. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a Drama. An investigator said that John Wayne was not incredible as a lawyer, but that he could not play a cowboy in every movie and that a difficult advocate with organized criminality would probably be good at the companion. While Wayne says that Cary Grant is not an impersonator, she is the place I agree with the reviewer. Romantic comedy just did not come to the street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors may be required to play any part of their cartridges, regardless of their presence, and Wayne, as one of the few big stars running for the Republic Pictures <br /> Even Cary Grant he would not work as a comedy named "A Man Betrayed". This is not reflected in his comic talents; this film is a reflection of the general lack of entertaining materials. Anyone, no matter how developed, may doubt that they can have a sense of humor, so we can find something to laugh. The light hearted tone of the film does not make him a successful comedy; it only hinders it being accepted as something else. This is one of the movies that neither fish nor meat, nor bird, nor good red gum. 3/10
