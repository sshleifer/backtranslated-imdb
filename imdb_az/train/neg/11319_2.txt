Vampire cyborgs dominate the world and use people's blood as fuel, but they will change the power thanks to an evolutionary android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) for facing Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who plays cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Who has sang the most delusional country singer, Kris Christofferson, of all the questions he has left unanswered by the terrible film, as a cyborg fighter capable of giving it so much? . No, we can see Christopherson as a vigilante or something, but as a cyborg. Something strange is suspected of being written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren should have been wise to avoid it. But despite the disastrous fall, Kristofferson is the most unpleasant thing about the movie. It will give Kathy Long more people than ever. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) Despite copbanking, Christofferson provides a couple of curiosity. Lans Henriksen sliced ​​and Gary Daniels wasted, but in fact the Knights were an amazing failure. You wondered who Hell thought was a good idea on paper. (This is a film that Cristerofferson is spinning with a robot in a bag.) As a result, if there is still a nightmare on the possibility of such an event, it's finally something that's out of place. br /> <br /> 4- (Bad)
