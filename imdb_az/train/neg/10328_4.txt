I think the show was a very good concept to work with. But the executive was weak. The scenario is weak and it is bad to act. There were many issues that could be better described as a protest against gay marriage and finding a cemetery. The show can not be called a comedy show, because there is nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> This show has to say that the show has difficulty implementing the Muslim community's life. <br /> <br /> So far the second season is worse than the first one. I had great expectations about this show, but I was disappointed. I still appreciate the CBC to put such a concept in front of viewers. Anyway, I wish you good luck in the future.
