as always, is an incomplete picture of homeless people. TV has said many lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s, and claimed that everyone looks bad and that $ 20-40 per day will be closer to $ 100 per day. he went to a place where he suggested a job, and offered me a job, I actually went and started working when I was physically able. If claimed for $ 100,000 is id, at least 2 years and most are kept in the bank and still earn $ 10-20000, NL $ 1-2, and $ 2-5 in casinos. I usually earn money, and it would be good if I only owed a bank. Instead of earning $ 1,000 in a month, always buying the minimum purchase because of the risk of losing them all. I just did not want the risk of spending all my money for being homeless and sometimes over $ 1000-2000 on my shoulders when I was lying outside. Anyone who wants to communicate with yahoo messenger.i, sevencard2003, admits that I am very different from homeless people, even though I am very smoky or taking drugs. She is now homeless, earning $ 177 a month, earning SSI, and earning more of my time in online poker. My mother and sunflower worked hard to get me a different SSI. I was so glad that I was hiding at the casino congress center while lying at night, worrying for safety. This television crew had not chosen me a lot. Do not choose how to choose a shame.
