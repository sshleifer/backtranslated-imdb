"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolute horrible part of Luc Besson's classic "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is mainly a woman who has been trained and trained by the CIA and has to make a secret mission for them. (La Femme Nikita's many stories) Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in film history. Lamas's "move" is simply a bad Steven Segal personalization. Watching the Orental Movement in this movie is an exciting experience. <br /> <br /> In this film, writing and acting are very upset, and sometimes it is laughable. The film has numerous action film conventions: unnecessary car blasts, glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, and so on. People flying with him. "Hard to Kill" (1990), by David Michael Frank, composes the film's Steven Segal theme. The film has a lot of martial arts and is very good for low-cost American production. Strangely enough, and nevertheless, it does not allow the player, and I have to admit that I'm gentle. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had an appearance of star in the early 90s, but he is not a star of action, because he is not a soap opera but an action blockbuster. My advice is to skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita".
