A memorable line of short-term show. After listening to the episode of the line, the flag football team in the fraternity began to use the line to break off our attack. Ready / Break said instead of our quarter-back soccer, and the rest of the staff responded to BET! He watched the entertaining way to unleash a very small number of our opponents from scratch. Using this line, I will not be forgotten about the season so I can not forget it. This year was our best season in the college and thanks to the entertainment that we use this line in a small way. The show was pretty much a stinker, but the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi lives in the intramural flag football team memories of West Virginia Tech.
