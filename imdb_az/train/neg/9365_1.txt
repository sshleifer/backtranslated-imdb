Hybrid begins as a water source Planet security guard Aaron Scates (Cory Monteith) is involved in an accident that rescues him from the blind. Fortunately, the bright scientist who works for Olaris. Hewitt thinks that Harun will be perfect for his first human experience, when Andrea Hewitt (Justine Bateman) prepares an operation to transport an organ other than a species. Hewitt and his team transport a Wolf's eyes to Aaron, and he miraculously recovers. Bright, right? There is absolutely nothing, because Aaron sees the body's casual images and begins to develop lust for blood. Aaron Olaris escapes from the building and runs, but it is very valuable to quit it and is searching for a complete grab ... <br /> <br /> This another Sci-Fi channel, run by Yelena Lanskaya, is just about all sorts of horrible put, I probably started out as a straight 'Creature Feature' but I understand it as one of the most boring and boring Sci-Fi Channel movies Even the features of any monster or creature Hybrid is terrifying, scary and scary I'm not sure if the previous build is complete with Aaron's Wolf eyes, but Hybrid closes science-element elements and turns into a kind of dramatic drama, since it focuses on Aaron's mental state around a few local American women, Fi channel will not be able to shoot a movie about Kurds Do you think and do you place garbage on the Native American mythology? The dynamics of the character are strange, Harun is the only character in the film to kill anyone, and is a realistic, disdainful and ungrateful person. Hewitt still refused, and Aaron tried to help him. That is, Aaron returns his vision, but is Hewitt also unhappy? And the US military intervention is on a regular Sci-Fi channel, why does Aaron want so bad? He is not a soldier and, in the darkness, the Wolves are completely immune to their eyes. The script will not think that Aaron is in the mind or is real, and the end is bad with a semi-naked (rememeber is made for this wire). Aaron is a bit awful, wandering around in a wormy forest I think music must be sensitive, but it's even more funny. There is nothing wrong with the Hybrid, slower than hell, there is no movement, there is no Werewolf, and the film is going to circles who want to enter Aaron's mind, yet there is nothing like this ridiculous, terrible and boring thing <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something annoying towards the people living in the Caucasus. I can make sure your eye is exaggerated after an eye and an operation, and you can not open it, and there is no swelling or even redness, which can hurt like hell even if it is transporting her eyes while awakening in Aaron's bed. There is no special effect, no blood or pride, violence and nothing to excite you. Actually, I now think that there is no sense of horror or philosophy from far, I feel like a movie of the week. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Hybrid is a horrible movie that has been sold openly for a couple of times, but this and most people will fight for the horrible ending of the stitches.
