If you ask me, the first was really good. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a real, fairy tale girl, look at Amy Adams, she is a little hungry around her. It's nothing! People do not like it! Secondly, Sebastian was lovely and warm in the first movie, and now the "baby face". The story is not good and I do not understand. Why it did not do it first, this is the beginning. Losy actors, nothing with the story. It's not wrong, it's played. The first is better actors, a better story and its average. In my opinion, music is better than weak intentions, and music is better than violent intentions. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but first of all, it's not a big, big, big thing.
