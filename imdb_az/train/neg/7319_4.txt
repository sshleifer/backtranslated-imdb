<br /> <br /> When it comes to scenes involving Albert Brooks without a shirt ... do not put a stick on a fur ball. <br /> <br /> I love Albert Brooks. Most of the time I saw it, I did not see it all for the first time. Modern Romantic Love is an interesting subject. Starting in 1979, Chilly Scenes of Winter is very close, but there are some kind of love-deficits or some obvious movies like Modern Rostan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our compatriots living in the Caucasus have a basic foundation on the topic they are talking about . <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < br /> style terms and so on. The main reason I love this movie. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the terrible scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt? <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Human hair, too much hair, brown furry linen is brown-dark, it looks like a victim burns, and it's not a good sight or shirt, and it's not going to go through scenes with it, and it's normal in the 1980s, and nothing shocked, but something like that appears in 2009 it's just obvious revolt, sorry, Albert! "In some cases, someone said," hey try this scene, but wear a simple shirt "so it can scare people." This is really bad and I'm sorry for the poor favorite actress, who is associated with Albert Brooks's naked body. <br /> <br /> <strong> It would have been better if Albert Brooks seemed to be 10 long-term minutes without his shirt, because it was always watching my movie.
