Generally, I love horror films, but unfortunately, this is a pound of bargain friends at my hands. We sat down to watch him, we were afraid to be afraid, and we finished all the laughs wherever we were. The concept is not bad, but I would not be lucky if I did not decide on a decade. The worst thing about the film is the actors. The camera job was weak, and if I were generous, the special effects were not really bad, but the overall story was unable to reach any level because the actors were as effective as a small part of the bad science. They were a foppish young actor for serious adoption, especially as any government agent who was over fifteen years older than the throne. In fact, a state school looked more like a boy. She seemed to be bent over to the Germans as she was a brave lady, and then her crying clothes were hysterical, but then it did not have to be a comedy. I miss my heart to find something positive to think about this movie. The bride was ten lucky numbers and they did not do anything else, and I'm not sure they could get my ribs.
