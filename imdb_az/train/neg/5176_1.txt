When a movie is independent and is not judged as Hamiltons, I hope you have a normal heartbeat. I know that good movies are not always blood and violence, but I have read the comments I've read, visited the website, and even with this my friend agreed to my friend to pay $ 9.50 to see the roaring movie. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I'm awaiting Dawsons Creek, not with fear of incestuous undertones. My expectations were pretty low for this movie, but after seeing the film lasted an hour after seeing the first film that came out of the little finger, he was shot in the hell. There was plenty of land hole and too much for the imagination. I regret not to see happy Feet. In my opinion, there would be more violence and distress than Hamilton!
