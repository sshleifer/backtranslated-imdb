Accepting such thoughts is unacceptable. This movie is in over 10 to 5 stars. Because there is George Lucas behind him, and his name is "Star" and "Wars." These talented filmmakers and many have made a great story, writing and acting superior films, but did not receive a loan. <br /> <br /> First thing first. Story. Anak's Evolution? There is none. There is no one except a little makeup and a little shout around the eyes. Darth Vader is a young, stupid, rough Anakin Skywalker with a kick. In the original series of Darth Vader, it was his intelligence that was almost everything in the world, planning, struggle, and called it. The only consecutive thing about Anakin, which was adopted in the Prewel trilogy, is its consistent stupidity. <br /> What portion of Emperor Palpatin's Sithin legends does not indicate that Emperor is Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes used a large number of digital pairs. Everyone carries a makeup puppet house flying somewhere like teddy. Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, had a rubber digital double jump around almost every fighter. <br /> <br /> Obi-Wan and Anakin, who are in the middle of the intestines, will break their swords several times each other on a special fight in climatic warfare. I understand that battles are choreography, but my head was shattered by disbelief and hatred. <br /> <br /> The article was very scary. The entire dialogue was of a very low quality. Good actors like Evan McGregor and Natalie Portman did their best with their own line, but that was not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. There are many special effects, no bigger field holes than the center of the universe, and no one in any of the heroes. The biggest mistake in this film is that something new is not offered. <br /> <br /> Anakin knows the rough picture of everything, all Lucas is colorful. We knew that Luca and Leia were brothers and sisters, we knew that Luke was the son of Anak, we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda were going to exile, we knew everything. This movie does not offer anything new. <br /> <br /> Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader and asks Padme, and when he hears that he is dead, he goes out. unhappy with their weapons and says "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". This scene B-movie shouted all the way and I was waiting for Darth Wader to come at any time to "Danger Robson, Danger." That's it. The B movie, hidden by a large budget and ultra-loyalist fan base, will now decide what the first two films have to do with the Earth's pitfalls.
