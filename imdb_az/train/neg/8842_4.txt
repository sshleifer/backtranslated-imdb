I would like to explain a bit from the IMDb that most of the best views for the movie are people who have just watched a movie in the entire IMDb career, and you've guessed that the film is "Parasomnia". <br /> <br /> Parasomnia says parasomnia is not terrible, but in this case it seems fairly transparent. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <font color = red> Hannibal In parallel with Lecter, I could easily see what was needed to play an unforgettable badge. There are some nice visuals in the imaginary sequence, in fact, the film decided to explore the area, which could have been a better thing. <br /> <br /> The real concept of hypnosis's cunning abusive is very great. <br /> <br /> Although I understand the necessity of dumping a good story, this is a sign of a good story, a success that gives you that. If you are concerned that you can not find yourself unreasonable or straightforward, this story loses you and this is what happens with me. Other reviewers have mentioned here and I do not want to enter the spoiler area, but in the end I will say that the installation is particularly ridiculous and disappointing, but I do not mention the changing age of a character that is experiencing only one experience <br /> <br /> Generally, in diabolically outdated hypnotism There is a great idea of ​​microbes, but unfortunately, this movie fails to implement it in a particular thing.
