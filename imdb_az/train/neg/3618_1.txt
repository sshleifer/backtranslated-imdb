Clich√©-buried story of future divorce - or? - With the eyes of a 6-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone try to write a creative article? Does anyone teach creative writing? The real sign of a weak story is not to create any kind of punctual punishment - just finish the story. I have to ask, "This is first of all a story that is worth telling!" <br /> <br /> The good, but tough, debut of the child player Anthony De Marco is the best, unforgettable part of the rest. And how strange it is for anyone to watch indie movies! Nineteen minutes of my life will never come back.
