The first attempt to watch this was over in 8 minutes, and I could not handle it after about a television report. It's been nearly as follows: Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in the sky. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. <br /> <br /> A few days later I was watching it until the end and it was not as terrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with it. Almost half of the site can be easily canceled. <br /> <br /> <strong> Monopoly scene more was fun. "We all have a strong" Gods ", a monopoly role we already have and many different games." Monopoly? Monopoly ?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks tidy compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is too small. What has he done to make the hero crystallized? Why was not a big event when released in the end? Those sinirist followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What is a deal with a masked guy? How did a blue-haired girl look like? What is his vision? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> If you look at the misguided gods as a walking ride with the rotweiller heads, the visibility is more or less.
