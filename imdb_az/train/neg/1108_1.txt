A bitter and frivolous butterfly (bloody barren, but fluffy). Terribly written, believed and talked with wood. You do not care if the heroes (whether actors themselves) live or die. Small grace or attraction, small movement, a small point to everything. Perhaps a certain structure and aspirations are of interest - the gaps between the boards of all buildings can be right for life. Framework encounter is unnecessary and confusing and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy itself is both boring and complicated.
