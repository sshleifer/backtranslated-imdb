Jared Diamond pointed out that in the first episode, not only the peoples of the world, but also domestic and domestic animals, not to marry, and why we can invent steel and complex machines. But then in the third episode, when the Europeans in South Africa came too far north, they fled to Zulu and other tribes that planted cattle and sown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diamond, black slaves) was the largest weapon. If 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native fighters, and South Africans, who are not 400, can not defeat 10,000 opponents in any case, in my opinion, microbes are not important. <br /> <br /> The Malaria stopped Europeans from colonialism in the North, killing "thousands" of Europeans but not affecting Africans. (I do not want to know the real numbers, but he does not). Finally, Malyaria says thousands of Africans are killing them, so they can not hold us back. So this, Jared? Did Malaria help the Athenians stop or hurt the Eurpeans? And despite the massive prophecies throughout history, how did Europe go? <br /> <br /> He looks very eager to say that the cause of Europeans' failure has come. When the arguments threaten to endanger her dangerous theories, she does not want to acknowledge the success of Europeans. This obvious neo-Marxist confusion of sadness is trying to prove this point.
