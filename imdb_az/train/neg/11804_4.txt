This was the original reconstruction of Billy Wilder classic in 1973. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, good things. Lee J. Cobb is terrific Barton Keyes. Of course Edward G. is not as good as Robinson, but it's just one reason to follow. <br /> <br /> This repetition is just about the original development, the femme fatale's daughter Stepan Dietrichson reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> This is also good for something. <br /> There are many bad things. Directors write everything in an indefinitely: if you watch the movie after a silence, you will find that an interesting event happens. Thanks to the modern bad taste, the film should be colored instead of black and white. Bad taste since the 1970s, all kits are ugly ugly. Especially Walter Neff's expensive sight is terrible. <br /> <br /> The modern structure hurts many smaller ways. Train journeys were somewhat unusual in the 1940s, as Mr Dietrichs's departure decision was more than surprising. While posing as a white-haired Mr Dietrichson, Walter stopped the hats that began to hinder his brown hair. Women participating in the women stopped Barbara Stanwyck's slamming cover on the Samantha Eggar, and used it on the main stage. (Strangely, Lola still shows that she works on a black hat and cover without the need for her son). <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochko is the same as Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler writes most. However, he makes small, unclear changes to a slightly curved dialog where he once was lean and muscular. In a ugly way, the famous motorcycle-jokes joked, but look closely and you'll look like a post-production crossing with these lines. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna was just like Walter Neff. What makes this version more complicated is really beautiful Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, a standard villainess from Barnabey Jones. But who blame Eqdir? How do you think Barbara Stanwyck, a director interested in what's happening in front of the camera, is in good shape?
