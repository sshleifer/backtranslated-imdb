As I went to see this movie today, I read all the breathtaking views and comments about how the Oscars will be worthy. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other analyzes, you will learn how hard it is for the US military to function in Iraq. They reflected their views; as I play in the film, I think of a complete civilian thought, "saying," What will happen is that there will not be such a thing ... "2) There really is little in terms of plot, a new bomber throws a man killed a really unexplained death) The new guy takes the adrenaline leap from his work, and his attitude is jeopardizing others.THE THIS IS THIS: 3) This movie is not as close as it is claimed You want to try one of the Bourne movie spaces If you want to see an emotionally strong war movie, Try to rent Go Tell The Spartans, the Vietnam War, and star Burt Lancaster (PERSONALLY), this film, which has been a serendipitous supermarket, has been a source of pride for it and has been viewed as one of the most beautiful things and is still treacherous now exile Apocalypse Now) or an old British WWII Black & White Classic Zinc Bismarck English movie, an incredible heart. Do not waste your time harming your hairdresser.
