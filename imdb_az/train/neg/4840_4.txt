All this movie should last 45 minutes - maximum. Although it has an interesting concept / theme, it has not really developed as a story. After the initial idea of ​​the braving expert (cowboy), the courageous (stupid?) Bombardment takes place very soon, and the rest will be repeated. Characters were not investigated and location and policy directions were ignored. There were terrible difficulties faced by the troops in such a foreign environment, and there was a difficulty in distinguishing between comrades and enemies. But the way to use the unit is extended. Individual performances were good and special effects were sufficient, but not enough to eliminate the lack of basic content.
