As long as 3D technology (1950s), I think that animation has been developed for that. Especially remember that Donald Duck cartoon film with Chip and Dale. I do not remember the name, but the plot was Donald's work in a circus, feeding elephant beans, and Chip and Dale stealing peanuts. It was probably 3d in the 1960s. To show you Robinsons in the 3rd class of Tom, they featured this cartoon in front of the film and explained the details of its origins. Perhaps there are about 100 cartoons specially designed for 3d glasses. This claim was a bad act because it is not difficult to prove that it is wrong. Moreover, it looks like a bad movie.
