I wish this movie hearty, heartfelt and heartfelt. Of course, something more than a cheap promotion for the Wilco group. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of mopping and whipping about the "process", one-sided and undoubtedly one-sided images of a group of members. prima donna's lead singer / songwriter, for 18 years, by a fallen friend's friend, says that "friendship continues", and this is how a story album that is not talked about is able to get 50 offers from other tags (oh, tension!) wrote that they "burned their feelings" by whipping them. They have tried to look like a violence I doubt that there are smoke and mirrors to create a tragedy that does not exist. Even no story line takes into consideration the longest extensions we get from most of the newest songs that go along with us without a decent job in line, thought or cinema. <br /> <br /> This film is like a very small baby, surrounded by the band to find a voice that it does not hear. They have been a kind of guardian of art, and they think that they are not necessarily. <br /> <br /> I was asking for music and thought I was reading lyrics, but that did not say anything. <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10.
