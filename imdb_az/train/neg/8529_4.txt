Is it a good idea to place Clark Gable as an employee of a Liberation Army, who thinks he is waiting for the MGM? Succeeding heroically, another wonderful future star, Cary Grant, played two years later, a highly esteemed SHE DONE HIM WRONG, a Liberation Army boy. So far, it is easy to see the hearts of these roles in this work, but I'm surprised that the AIDS Liberation Army still thinks the children are "hot" and can look at these torn men and look at the real representation of the parts they play. I worked long ago for a Brotherhood of the Liberation Army (American Volunteers) and I did not see any researcher working there (and, unfortunately, to me). Maybe I should get a job instead of a rescue army! <br /> <br /> So it's a good movie because it's so exciting, but for everyone, weak writing, neat dialogue, and frustrating morality make a very slow film.
