Even after 20 years, Ninja Mission remains the worst movie I've ever had. Scandanavian ninjas silently moves into one area, burns wildly obnoxiously submerged sub-machine guns, and then silently releases them. Wow, how can we find these silent invisible assassins? Just behind the hollow paper and the smoke! Not a flood of Asia but a foolish bad dialogue (or a brilliant and simply bad translation)? Assassination is ridiculous, quite abnormal - then the ninja can not move again! Rescue yourself - Do not Follow Anything!
