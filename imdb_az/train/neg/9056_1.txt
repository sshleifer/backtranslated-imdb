I've seen some bad movies in my life, but it should be among the worst. <br /> <br /> We are Dodds (like Billy Bob Thornton, Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze Roy and Patrick Swayze as Charlize Theron) <br /> Lonnie is very happy with her sex life not because his wife betrayed Candy who wanted to have his lady's baby. . <br /> <br /> Roy is not quite sure if the sperm is normal. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the DVD behind, but I did not have a girlfriend and stumbled about 20 minutes later: "Yes, she will end pregnancy, but her husband can not have any babies." Spot, this movie is soooo predictable. Like a bum. And frustrating. It's meaningless. Sensitive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> This is an example of how wrong the movie is. Two couples set out on a big car for Nevada, when they stopped by two police officers, and they did not stop in the sign. Children know each other and finally two bribes are taken as a beer. Only this scene takes about 5 minutes for the film, which is insignificant and unimportant (or even relevant)! <br /> <br /> The conversation is just to talk, chat and chat. <br /> <br /> I still have to think about the end. Apparently, although Roy does not have problems there, he is the father of the child. How many times in movies ... do something new! His treacherous wife eventually forgives his spouse and best friend, and happily happens after all. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie ended with a few shots of Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> Why did not he keep this camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> And if you're still in this pile (Thornton really works) you can expect more, but you really do not blame them. The writers are ashamed of you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
