Alicia Silverstone (pre-Clueless) plays an adolescent teenage girl who is trying to solve a brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci was not particularly well-prepared, but surprisingly serious, and wrote and managed this B-flick. Silverstone, despite the kitschy shock of the picture, is an attractive and successful girl to attract an interesting young woman here. While the violence in the last movement goes on the boat, the supporting player (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad. There is not an enchanting camp festival, or something memorable. * From 1/2
