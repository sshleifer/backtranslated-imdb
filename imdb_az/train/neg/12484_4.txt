Woosh ?? Man ?? <br /> <br /> Perhaps, we see some mongoloid barbarians, which are a bad make-up that splatter some of the ruins. They are hiding around and attack a few people with a captive little girl. My friend runs away, Mongoloids follow him, and one of them seems to be abusive to the girl, but instead he uncovers one of his mattresses and abducts him. Then he sees a friendly (still running) horse and wants to steal it. Suddenly ?? a blond god-like looking hero who smells badly "This is my horse!". Mighty Deathstalker just made its appearance. The Mongoloids come and Deathstalker kills all of them (including the guy covering) melodies in some of the unfortunate Mexicanos western points (what's up with the 'arriba-thrompetet')? Captive Girl reveals their hearts. She begins to hunt for them and looks like Captive Girl. She loves lips and loves Deathstalker. When it comes to falling in, this old friend cuts off a perfect day for Deathstalker (and perfect for a short film). <br /> <br /> Tell me now! This is not a point where a feminist can frustrate the film, or any other person watching "This will be a good hell!" They would say. This is as simple as throwing a cats from your balcony: Deathstalker must get the Justice Sword and use it to steal the Life Crocodile and the Magic Wizard from the evil sorcerer Munkara. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I initially wanted to add a point to this movie. After 9 steps, I refused to count (if not half the movie). I was worried about the rest of the film. And it was worth the rest of the film. Totally crazy things. Check that Muncher, a creature like this mutant cats / worm, is like a pet and nourishes the eyelids and fingers. And an interesting question: What would you do if a man's body enters the bedroom and tries to kill with a knife? The answer is simple: throw it around a bit, take the blade, and then try to force it. Then you find her that she is not really a woman, so throw her out of her bed and tell her to leave the room. It works well, I tell you. Deathstalker is doing it, Deathstalker is the right way! <br /> <br /> DEATHSTALKER is a really good movie as shown in other commentaries. Slavery is bad. Women are delicious. There is blood, sex, violence, aggression and delicious chicken. There is an entirely meaningless tournament, which results in just beating, whipping, and breaking off one another. The favorite weapon used in this tournament was a huge wooden hammer, used to beat a poor opponent for bloody pulp. And my favorite opponent was undoubtedly the Warthog-head (an exuberant recall of Jedri's return Gamorrean Guard). <br /> <br /> I will not comment on the film's end, but when I say that the 4-way dismemberment is thrown at the top of the film, I'm going to enjoy it. <br /> Certainly, there is a beautiful demonstration. inadequate throughout the film. Look at a guy riding a horse behind a horse, and the next point shows that it is dragged onto the grass (no way). We see the great weapon at the magician's head changing magical magic in the same area (the left side of the head and the other on the right). Yes, Munkar is a magician. <br /> <br /> In this film, things such as "sustainability" have been created in an alternative universe that simply can not exist. <br /> <br /> I love it so much, as long as I wait for the other, installments in this series have enough charms to prevent me from passing this movie. Nevertheless, I am ready to give you the maximum amount of minimal points, so I can score as many points as possible to follow. DEATHSTALKER can be quite entertaining, naked and sleazy CONAN rip-off, which is also a abominable film.
