This is just a bad remake for a better version of the so-called prequel dangerous situations. Fields are exactly the same as the scenario. I loved the idea of ​​the book and liked the first movie, but I will not worry about the third movie. In Prequel, meaningless jokes between the two main characters could not have been completely predicted and unoriginal ... I do not stress how bad the film is. If you do not want to take my word for it, just watch it and I would say what. When you read a review saying "You love the latter, you love the latter", this is just one reason, because it's the same movie! Although the land is not even good. They were drawn more than the first film, they were forced to explain the movie you were watching.
