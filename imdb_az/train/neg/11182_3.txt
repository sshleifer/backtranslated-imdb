A stupid movie with a stupid liner and Jewish references. It was a serious film, but could not be taken seriously. A well-known movie plot ... To be in the wrong place in the wrong place. A swollen subplot associated with Bassinger. Very robotic and very regimented. I noticed Al Pacinos had noticed the difference in mobility. Problem solving is a problem, but there is nothing worse than Pacinos's terrifying Atlanta emphasis. Damage control should determine the damage of the film. Okay, my liners are bad, but this movie is not as bad as those. This film is not just boring, it is not a rebellion. Usually a rebellious film is good for wrong reasons. This movie is unwatchable. I was able to sit with it. If the site was written a little better, it could have pulled it out of the ditch, even though it might have been a little better, and could even eliminate the terrible subplot, even jokes. It's a dull, frustrating movie that we've been thinking of, that Eli Wurman is a Jew. Everywhere is ashamed of the good Jewish people.
