The problem with CONTRACTER is summed up in the scene. The CIA wants an international terrorist dead, so contact Black Dialog James Cillian. As it appears in the court of "Old Bailey" in London, where terrorists want to leave the rest of their lives in prison, they want to throw terrorists? It will come out of any circulation. CIA did not give a chance before being arrested? If you have a guilty verdict for a luck, kill him. There is no logical reason for killing someone who wants to pursue life in a maximum safe prison. <br /> <br /> If the author of this story has set up this story, a viewer may choose not to see the dry pit, but the assyria itself fires into the fire. Dial's colleague was killed by a police bullet, and the taxi still steals but just runs away. So the police were close enough to hit one person, but was it too far to avoid a car crash? This is a feature film. Later, Dial finds a police inspector, saying that "the airport is surrounded by armed coppers," but still finds a weapon he finds, but manages to escape easily without explanation. All film audiences rely on the things that are not explained to them. Emily's Day is an important supportive act. Why does Dial help even if it is a fugitive fugitive? <br /> <br /> This is a fairly weak tension and does not take the "big name". Wesley Snipes used to be a movie star, killing his career by playing more and more mistaken films. Charles Dance has also appeared in recent years as the HERO and ALIEN 3 big budget Hollywood production, but there is still someone who is known to go straight to the DVD movie these days, and mostly plays a cereo role. Lena Headey's favorite movies can come to be a great player, but, of course, the CONTRACTER has its own rubber
