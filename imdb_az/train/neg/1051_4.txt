While Frank Loesser's songs are the best things Broadway has to offer, they are becoming more and more animated by the release and inadequate presentation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz - just as you are watching a music. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how Loesser's tough, but tuneful melodies can be used to make maximum impact: for example, one of the best numbers, Adelaide's Lament, ends at the finishing table when Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) sits. Stubby Kaye's wrong-minded 'St Down', Rockin's 'Boat' artist, is just standing there with his support chamber sitting on the folded chairs. Mankiewicz wastes all the fun of everything after static scenes will last for a long time and adapt to the scene from Abe Burrows. There is not any movie about All About Hope. A part of the fault is simply wrong: Marlon Brando has caused music, Frank Sinatra plays a very nice person and does not have an edge to him (complements the song style) and Jean Simmons is emphasizing Shirley Jones's path. Just like Blaine, lovelorn showgirl Adelaide, our focus should be Broadway pro. Colored art direction was developed by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol.
