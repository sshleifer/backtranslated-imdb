The plot of the film depends on one important point: this murderer was also responsible, loving, caring father. It is not possible for a father and a murderer. But this man is shown to kill a teenager without provocation or cause and without feeling. This girl was a daughter of one of them. I do not think that a very caring father about her daughter could be too cold for someone else's daughter. Alternatively, she could be very cold and still cared for her daughter. The idea is that a convicted murderer wants to take the victim's parents to his daughter and care for her. <br /> <br /> Almost heroines were convicted by actors. I thought Scott Bakula had changed the color of the eyes, and it was usually considered more cold and dangerous. You could not see his eyes.
