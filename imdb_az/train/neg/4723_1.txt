First of all, I apologize for my English language. <br /> <br /> Everyone from the former Yugoslavia who does not have some extremist Serbian radicals will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. No Serb crimes were represented. Fortunately, everyone sees this movie is given by Serbs, so it is neutral. All the "professionals" interviewed are not professionals. <br /> <br /> Only a few people read a book written by a radical Serbian, the second is genocide denier, and so on. <br /> <br /> Slovenians have also been charged with this film. The whole war in Slovenia lasted only a few days, and Slovenianians were lucky enough to have only a large number of Serbians in Slovenia and YNA reached the Slovenian border in Croatia (after the Croatian-Serbian war). Each Slovenian is angry with all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Each Croatian will agree with something: independence was too early. Perhaps you can prevent all major conflicts. However, marking the Second World War and some unrelated things was a truly miserable attempt to justify everything. Just think about throwing nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington, and say that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are right. You will not find any evidence of the overwhelmed YNA soldier, and you killed the Serb civilians near Vukovar. However, you can find a reporter claiming that his allegations of Serb civilians near Vukovar are a lie. All over the internet. And let's not start with Vukovar's bombing by the director YKA (now Serb and Montenegro - 100% Serbs and Montenegro) and the whole Chetnik movement. Initially, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director did not forget about collaboration with Nasis, as well as the Ethnic cleansing of the Master and the Yugoslavian partisans. There are thousands of other things, but all of them can be easily checked. This movie contains too many incorrect things. Only a few of all the accusations are true. Each Croatia was angry over this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to dwell on the denial of the Srebrenica genocide and the genocide with numerous proofs. Think about the Holocaust denial film. This movie is the same. According to this film Bosnian Muslims bombed themselves in Sarajevo. Every Bosnian Muslim is angry at this movie. <br /> <br /> As a rule, the director did not forget that the territory of Macedonia (FYROM) was short occupied by the Serbs. Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered Serbia's borders. If you are not a Serb and you really start to believe in some of these movies, Serbs, Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are essentially Serbs forming their history. So ... <br /> <br /> 50% of the people are even "extreme" and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and I want everyone to: Tell yourself before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch real, neutral documentary films about the death of Yugoslavia.
