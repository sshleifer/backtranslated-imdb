Do you know movies that are closed in the movie theater? You've stayed at the best place in the house, just in the center of the line at your special sweet spot, which you've just changed three times before you sit right, and when you've been trapped there, worrying and frustrating, "F *** when the movie ends? " (You know, the idea of ​​the EU and the village). <br /> <br /> Well, guest Q provides a strange version of this feeling. I'm wondering when something started when I sat there for the first 30 minutes! This does not happen! Thus, "Arty" hurts. This is my first Miike Takashi movie I've watched. As you can imagine, he is filming more than that and I doubt if it will be the last thing if they are such an ambitious thing. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious W @ nk. David Lynch was among the top 10 directors for me, but a visitor Q cut, cheap, and an ambitious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you can now work - I hate it.
