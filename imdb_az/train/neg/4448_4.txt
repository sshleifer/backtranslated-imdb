Julia Roberts's character, Patrick Bergy, is a powerful start to the movie when hitting the face of an abusive and anal baby, and I felt that Farrah Fawcett was ready to experience a strong film at the same level as The Burning Bed. Yes, in summary, I'm telling you that it's a mistaken approach. This movie did not have anything like a Strong Burning Bed, and Farrah played a part of a woman you really felt and felt her pain and need to stay alive. While lying in bed, Roberts became an inexpensive excitement after his first escape from Iowa, which led to his death and death. At first, she believes her husband is going to die, but she begins to doubt that she is still alive and can leave after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game that gets a home in Julia and a city in a street town .... Of course, it has earned money for it, but at that point the whole movie did not pay much attention to me. She meets a boy (Mr Nice is beautiful) and falls for her, but her husband finally takes it, but the soup does not reorganize the crockery and cuisine. I was thinking about giving this auditorium a cheap excitement. But the film is a cruel thing, because I deceived the film audience. If she did, I felt her and her condition. Of course, the husband was killed and all of them are good for Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world were so close to it .... See the Burning Bed and realize that a movie is as if it were about domestic abuse.
