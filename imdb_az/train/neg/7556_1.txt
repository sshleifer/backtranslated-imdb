Anyone who has made a negative comment about this film has made an excellent analysis of why this film is so bloody terrible. I will not comment, but the film writes me a lot, especially the writer / director. <br /> <br /> I saw the original "Wicker Man" and really loved the love of music, sensitivity, idolatry and confrontation in the modern world. . That said, I'm not a part of the crowd who think that great movies will not remakes. For example, I loved the 1950s "Occupation of the Body Drive," but in 1978 they used it equally. Both films are on their own. Another example is "The Thing." The original, as seen in today's standards, is a lot to proud of in 1982 with Kurt Russell (my all-time favorite horror film). <br /> <br /> This film strengthened Neil LaBute's sexuality for me, because of the "The Wicker Man" and misogynistic trends. It also surprised me how the green lighting of the leaders who wanted to create a serious tension was a product against women. Cage has many scenes that hit women because they have difficulty in blocking the missing girl's investigation. Would the respondent react to such a response in other cases not encountered by the suspects? In fact, a society where men and women are equally involved in a religious religion. The main threat came from everyone, male and female. No sex hierarchy. <br /> Bees, drones and so on. Metaphor was a bit heavy and favorable, especially when it was allergic to Cage's character ("Drone must die!"). I was interested in why the men on the island were not retreating and that they simply did not physically use them to stop behaving like a scorpion. They were not women with special supernatural powers, and half were pregnant, the other half looked old and greasy, the remaining girls and thin blonde waifs, so they really hate women if they want to escape. They are physically preferred to them. When it was unhappy it seemed that there was no weapon or weapon to cut them off. But if they do not like drones, why not? They can be used as a threat to Cage because they will protect the society. They are drones, because Neil LaBute believes that the intended men of a society where women run away will leave. <br /> <br /> This movie has already been made. "Who are Stepford Women?") Women are classic signs of men who are with their help and who fear that what really happens when they are equal citizens. <br /> <br /> The problem is that when women start to beat women with hate men, Cage creates an unimportant film and creates an unusual humor. I believe that LaBute should leave the society on an equal footing, keep it intact and enjoy it, and push the keys of concern to the children on the island. Nobody likes pedophiles or children to make sexual exploitation. So, how did the police respond when the elders saw the bad things done by the surrounding children? This would be a logical weak leap of children abuse, so it is an urgent measure to save the missing child and help all children. LaBute said his fianc√© and daughter had created a story to encourage Cage's character. I do not think you need it. Any child will be exploited by an adult to react. <br /> <br /> Of course, Boy Cage "rescues" eventually brings death. <br /> <br /> Dialogue has become a dialogue. The third move was cheerful. The audience I saw was heroic (and later enjoyed). When the fictional writing of the letter was written and the movie was written to all the flashbacks that were cut to show how wounded the Cage was, the movie was wrong. We do not need it. Simply show up for the missing child on the island. Many in America have seen "Law and Order" and other police procedures. <br /> <br /> We're into the movie, as a supporter of Cage's mystery. <br /> <br /> So spend so much of your potential. Neil LaBute sounds like talking to people who enjoyed the stories of men's warehouse and those who are enjoying this kind of action. Stay with your men. Excitement for people who understand the tensions. Here's your honey honey. I'll follow it.
