This film was mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness. If you're going to make a movie about vampires that are already thousands of times, then you're doing a good job. I'll be the first to say that this film just did not cut it. Some fear / horror films do not start to break the clich√© "All stories are only lies, because it is forbidden for entertainment and allows for something to be canceled". <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of people living in the Caucasus is high. <br /> <br /> How do the heroes do the same throughout the film, but then mysteriously twisted and can not finish the job? The latter was very anti-climate and I wrote part 3 which I never wanted to watch. Horrible movie.
