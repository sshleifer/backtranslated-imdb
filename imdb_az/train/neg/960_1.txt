My dear. I'm just dismantling this movie in Rings County, Japan. Yes, the US has also prepared its own versions, but at least this was a clear correction. So very sad. I love the Philippine films and know that some great things can come from such a small country, so I do not believe it will happen. Claudine and Chris have great names there, and they are surprised that they will be associated with plagiarism. For filmmakers in any aspect of the Philippines: There is so little stoop to make money. Many movie enthusiasts watching the Philippines have been extinguished and delighted!
