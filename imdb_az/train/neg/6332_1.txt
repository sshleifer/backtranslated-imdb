I was waiting for this movie when I was a big fan of SNL. When my husband and I went to see him, the people from the early show shouted, "Do not waste your money!" But of course, we have to find ourselves. <br /> <br /> Although it's a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them are a serious 1 hour show of fun. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the Opera opera singer came, many people stood up and left. This made me laugh, because I realized that John O'Honey was just burying people's keys with this film. Otherwise, he was just crazy. No matter - you do not have to spend time watching it, it's bad.
