Although I do not agree with many things Bush has done, I want to start by saying that I am a Republican. I love the daily show and the Colbert report. On TV I have two favorite shows. I enjoy the curly jokes about Konan, Letterman, Leno, because I acknowledge that W is not the most delicate person to go anywhere (I do not believe he is the most terrible). But when it's enough, it comes to a point. It's not really funny. I see that it can be ridiculous and this (hey, it's fun to our position, sadness). Despite the comedy center, it only works hard to have fun. It probably means a special episode, but the whole series is just dumb. As you can see, the CC simply tells the same Bush jokes we have heard several times. I really can not see this show, which has passed one season.
