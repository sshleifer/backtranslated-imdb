I love horror movies that make a mystery, as I thought it was a "silent hill" (I was pretty good, but still missing something) and guessing it. I thought it was one of those films. Initially, the film begins with a really good excitement and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then falls just above the hill and goes faster and faster. I talked about a silent kick first, because we can see a lot of "stolen" topics in the film here .. All of this is almost a mere hill trail, better, more scary, much more decline and end. And the best of all, it does not feel ripped off as I did with it. It looks like just one "I want to film again in my really bad version" I'll rebuild the movie .. Oh and something else ... Lordi .. in a scary movie. .. "And I will love you forever" from the stomach.
