In 1987, Mark Pirro's "The Fame of Deadly Games" was a very unpleasant comedy for many, though it is sometimes very funny. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie would be much better, the player is strange, and some of the cheerful scenes sometimes make it difficult to watch, but the concept is funny and there are some hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> The near future (1991), the game has changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) performs a game called "Live or Die". The destroyed prisoners play the lives of prisoners and their money. Candidates performing in the air, using guillotine, power chairs, and other, more strange performance devices, followed the applause from the stunning studio audience. The show is more than a fight, and Chuck has created many enemies ... <br /> <br /> Deathrow Gameshow is incredibly cheesy and terrifying, but the player is terrifying, but surely, in many places, If you are an admirer of dark humor. If you do not see anything, we have not missed anything, but this is definitely a fun and good time zone. 4/10
