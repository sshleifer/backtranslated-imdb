Where should I start? When I waited for some degree of originality in the name of this movie, I eventually fell apart. This is not a story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene's story, but rather a Hollywood (or movie-center) story, based on a real-life symbol. I have to be a clue when I hear the heavy English vocals singing in the German language; blood red text (hood, artists) should be 2 tips. The story line is constructive (Lale Schwitzer was not deceived by Rolf Lieberman's parents, and there is no information that Liberman's Jews would help the smuggler from Germany, the original song was not controlled by the NS regime but was not controlled (there was an Lt. Vacation etc. The dresses were weak and incorrect for time frames (from border guard to SS positions, everyday use after war, etc), characters are stereo species (they are mainly SA bullies in a club outside the government). Do not.
