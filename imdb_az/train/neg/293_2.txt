This movie is a concern for some girls at the Catholic School, mainly because they decided to go to Florida after a red dyeing at a school shampoo and a vacation for the event. They meet with some kids at a local meal and then decide to meet each other elsewhere. The girls stick along a roadside near the forest and stops for a while and sees a part of the murder of one of the daughters of the surrounding sheriff. He is afraid and tries to convey the facts to others. Other girls decide to meet with her, and both are killed by the killer. Then the remaining two girls are arrested by a murderer and placed in a local prison. The Sheriff MP is also watching girls, and that the sheriff is a killer and they are ignorant, and this is a very bad operation in the film that does not look like everyone else's two and two. The best part was a rape incident between a murderer and one of his girlfriends who had been harassed by her detention cell, and she was really upset by the boy and the naked chest I saw, but her lips just got in the way. This movie is similar to Frankie Avalon's low budget thriller "Blood Song", and the same motif is just another character. The 80's is not even a rental movie for a low-budget movie, and it's the worst I've ever seen in a movie and left me wanting money!
