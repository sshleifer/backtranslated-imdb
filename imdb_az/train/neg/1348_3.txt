this animated inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak and the characters are less than little action.most for a small thing. the movie is a good gentle most entertaining, but really in any place and neglected. It's a good thing just about a 74-minute television show, not just a movie repeating just about 80's and 80's.it's near the caliber of the animated TV show, at least my mind.it's credits. Symbols should not be tuned here, show indicator, Inspector Gadget wanted to protect the day, but who really cares? Perhaps this is my opinion. The Last Condition of the Gadget 3/10
