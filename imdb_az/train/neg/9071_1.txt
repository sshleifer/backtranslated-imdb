Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends pushed through the way of Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) college. Creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) blackmails them to help them think with Angela (James King), a good, kindhearted student. <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - more confident - regardless of smile-induction. The film appeals to his target audience with his disgusting lamp - but not their business. In addition, it is full of useless, strange characters, and Schwartzman's character is so modest that he is a big tournament. The film uses the 50/60 sexpot / actress, Mamie Van Doren, on the most offensive scene of the film. YUCK! <br /> <br /> It is a waste of talent (still) of his entirely predictable and veteran comedian actor Joe Flaherty - even more attracted to him <br /> <br /> Generally, I liked the only one The thing was James (aka Jaime) King, he was very attractive and more worthy. <br /> <br /> This is from me.
