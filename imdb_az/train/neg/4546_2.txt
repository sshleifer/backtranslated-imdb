I just watched this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some places it is a matter of spirituality, evolution, synchronicity, and your share in the world for some time. <br /> <br /> However, there is very little communication between the film and the characters, which are easily overwhelmed by the immersion of the film. It is clear that the book loses many of this movie version. Events that are meant to show the synchronicity are almost unrecognizable. The viewer needs to do many things to see that the scene is a coincidence and that there is more to imagine something bigger. <br /> <br /> Enlightenment scenes are weak in sight and do not create a better feeling than it is intended. Do you remember the teachings of Keanu Reeves (Little Buddha)? <br /> <br /> The most scenes are badly executed. <br /> <br /> Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, have a lot of scenes that do not make much of an event that can not be better players. Remember it. It seems that the first two films have gained more stages than they had to get more scene from their characters and pay more, but that does not work. Most scenes are not really important, and the story does not help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> all. He is the only script that he first tried to convince John Settle to join. If an incident occurs in an explosion, the scene will be badly followed. <br /> <br /> This movie requires a great time, reads a book! <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
