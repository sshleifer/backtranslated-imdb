The film was very nice, and I believe I'm in one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen ... there's an "external" thing about the reality of the movie. and mystic. But then the storyline became more and more realistic. It's almost an understatement to say that the end is CORN and PREDICTABLE ... It's the most typical romantic end to everything that's all about 'likable' character. A scene that realizes that the main character is wrong and follows the "woman of the dreams" to confess his love before the crowd in a sympathetic glance. Come on. In the end, they get "good guys", "bad guys" needlessly ... You get. WELCOME to a potentially interesting film.
