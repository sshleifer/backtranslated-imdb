This movie is pretty weak. Playing is horrible and absolutely compelling. Also, making a movie like a docudrama is not necessarily more convincing, and you can easily make a Mr Dir Dirachezir√©rz, so my comments do not mislead you, but as you advise to watch this movie, it illuminates some of the psychological and non-existent psychology they commit. . However, the castle of the movie is not completely trash! There is no other way to put it down! It is clean and simply does not fail to capture any sense of the atmosphere! What can happen is that it does not give me a feeling of despair, panic, fear or fear in these terrible situations. Instead, you're leaving with a jaw "Did it happen?" You do not ruin yourself by the actions of these guys that have broken out of your tongue. On the contrary, you feel embarrassed for another movie just beginning with the potential, but at the most important point, it's over. Zero Day is really .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
