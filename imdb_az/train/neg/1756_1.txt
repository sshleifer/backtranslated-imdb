For many years in the rear burner (this was reported), this television mix, one of the most favorite characters in the history of the sitcom, started badly - from there it went straight down. Mary Tyler Moore and her best friend, Roda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), met in New York after a long arrangement and gained the lives of each other. What a new concept! But in one of the last years, something to be saddened and nothing to talk about (not a movie) happened. Instead, the content of the script itself has not completely disappeared with the lack of quirky attraction and sophistication, which throws itself into an old old-fashioned device (most with the older women in the workplace), saving the original victory. Support is instantly memorable, humor exists, and once the chemicals with Moore and Harper have been destroyed. Moore claims that he has suspended this project for years, waiting for his "only right script" before committing himself. If this is something that is considered "right," how has it been rejected on earth? This (inevitably goes) is not the age of the characters that make it, but the fact that the imagination is almost complete, without clarifying the elements that make use of the work. Once it was designed as a pilot, but not all of them were obviously interested in potential sponsors. Or between potential audience for it. Soon and forgotten, the film is a travesty and a classic insult.
