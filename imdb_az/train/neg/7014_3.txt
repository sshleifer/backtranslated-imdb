What a waste! This film could have been a really decent thing, but the writing is particularly shocking, and the main characters are numerous and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good and the rest of the decade of the late 70s was well-prepared, but in general, this movie has taken a lot of time. Instead, watching similar topics and the same basic timeframe is a great BOOGIE NIGHT.
