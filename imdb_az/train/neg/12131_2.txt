Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately his management is not his forte. Before I hired, I had a high expectation of the movie, so I did not like it. I am amazed at Spacey's attempt to shoot a film that's mostly in a small space, but I think it's not. The film was boring, boring and prolonged. Acting was not spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially because he knows most of the other films. Skeet Ulrich was frustrated, but this was one of his first films (it was a blow to how Scream star looked so young and noble). The only thing that affects me about this film is the weight of the above car. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and said the camera was moving along the line and crashed. However, this shot was a very "Moral Suspect" and my prediction was that Spacey's idea of ​​a previous movie (a very good idea). Follow Hitchcock's Lifeboat if you want to see a movie that is taking place in a small space. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before boots.
