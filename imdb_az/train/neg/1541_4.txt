I did not like this movie intensely, and I left the loyalist band at the scene where English was shot. The film blames the NI as a reason for its own troubles. This is a 25-year war problem, and Britain has nothing to do with Ireland's division and domination of its history, that is, in 1921, NI was created in Britain despite the Irish desires. <br /> <br /> <br> Heroes are described as a fool, although I condemn their fierce guerrilla fighters for some reason - they have artificial privileges on Catholic society. <br /> <br /> <strong> British intelligence collaborates with those who are faithful during the war, undoubtedly acknowledged that they are trying to keep Catholics and protect the republicanism. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, "maksimo", personality etc. Belfast is described as the so-called "mind" of the so-called unique Irish cause of violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - the old Irish in the green fields .. blah..blah .. - is a symbolic boy, that is, poor young fools who are struggling for a reason. Elegant, ahistoric, cheap and dirty trash. O'Sullivan made a personal statement regarding a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
