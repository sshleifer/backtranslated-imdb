Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six Different Love Angles. Eighty-five audiences in the cinema. We look at eight different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories had nothing to do with each other, but Nikhil Advani tried to make a connection between them. I wanted to find some lines that I could write, but did not find anything to write at 3 hours and 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> My proposal is a poor image of Hollywood's blockbuster. If you want to watch a really nice movie, watch the movie.
