I saw the movie in the theater. There is very little good point to talk about the film. Kareena can have some beauty and some songs. This is so. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Everyone involved in the film will be disappointed, even in Mumbai Indians (now for Chennai's semi-final). <br /> <br /> But the worst action scenes I've ever heard about the movie. Now Bollywood is trying to copy moving scenes from Hollywood. Hollywood directors have a great impact on appearing as real. But, unfortunately, most Bollywood directors do not have so much time. They spend their time watching the film's song and promotion. So many stupid scenes can work as South viewers because they pay for watching a favorite actor who kills many people. But in Bollywood it will not work. All the action scenes that we wanted could have passed on to me. In the end, some Chinese will never defeat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of the stupidity. The audience does not pay to watch these folly. I think Bollywood should now forget about action movies. They can not do that. The last good thing I saw was Ghatak and Khiladiyan ka Khialdi. The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for movie fans who act like me. Do these people see their films after completing them? Do not they understand that slow motion (with ropes) is very non-realistic and childhood? If you can not control it, you should not have the action scenes. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era, which, like Zanjeer and Deewar, had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very impressive in those days, but vision is better than the current one. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Do not shoot more action movies until you get the art of performing art.
