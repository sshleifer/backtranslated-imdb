I do not believe that this show is still in the 10th and 9th places. I could see that these votes were in the first two seasons, but what can they do to help them stay on top of that? I was a great fan of the season. It was engraved on me - all mystery, decline, unexplained events. You never knew what happened next. In Season 2, I was still loyal, but some of the key things felt a bit frustrated that they were not yet disclosed. And instead of answering more, it seemed like more questions. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> was enough. I'm not a big fan of the appointment, and do not miss out on an episode to get up. So he did not work for me. <br /> <br /> They are a shame who can not think more than a little smart and loyal fans. I agree that some posters look like ABC, they are only greedy and decided to look at how long this show has extended. They realize that they will lose more admirers than they could possibly get.
