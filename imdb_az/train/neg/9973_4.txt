"Problem Child" is one of the best films ever made. It's not bad (although somebody agrees with me), but that's not good. There is a boy in the 7-year-old boy who is foolishly admitting a boy who has funny weather (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck). This movie is terrible and unbelievable, because I'm not going to buy a child for a child to act unsuccessfully as a child is in this movie. I laugh a few times (though I did not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know that I was very kind. If there is a positive thing about "Problem Child," it's just a terrible poster. <br /> <br /> ** (Four)
