Disney is going through a lot of times, just as everyone who sees the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel clearly torn. King Triton, who celebrated the birth of her daughter Melody, Ariel and Ericin. The accident quickly hit Ursula's brother Morgana. He plans to use Melody as a means of protection for King's trident. Ariel and Eric are building a wall around the ocean, stopping the attack, and Melody grows up in wondering if he can not go there. <br /> <br /> This is a sad and horrible video that constantly explains. LITTLE MERMAID 2 feels that everything you watch looks like other Flat Disney movies. I do not know, Disney can only plagiarize himself! The penguin and the shirt do not mention any other than Lion King! <br /> <br /> Other frustration moments include rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chief. They played too! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Disney, giving LITTLE MERMAID 2 a shame, is better to hire and laugh. Then Disney can then prepare the rest of the other sequels you are going to drown.
