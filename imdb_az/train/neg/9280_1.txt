Honestly, I do not know what funnier, this terrible remake or comment on this board. The look of the Masterpiece made me laugh, which was very funny. Anyway, this film is among the worst films ever, and, of course, is under the barrel. The headline "Omen" stopped me and watched this morning at HBO, but it was the other three, especially an original slap. There are classic bad points, but the person I love is the person who holds the fire in psychic justice! nice moments! This movie is for the Omen series for "Scary Movie" for all genres. Avoid looking for a good laugh.
