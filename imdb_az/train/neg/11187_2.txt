<br /> <br /> Two examples: A late cleric suddenly attacked by a cemetery late at night. spirits After killing them, he keeps quietly when he comes to his friend. "What's wrong?" His friend asks for help. "Some devils spirits - something I could not handle." No reaction, no surprise, changed a wheel. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Example two At one point, priests need to answer a question and only one thing (or something that looks so far) can provide it. How? Why Should I Ask a Dead Man? The genie has a random person hanging in front of two priests, so they can ask the person who falsifies their questions and annoys them. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "This is amazing!" Their answer would be more realistic. They will never allow a person to go or stop - in fact, the closest ones are at least gloomy at reacting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> < >
