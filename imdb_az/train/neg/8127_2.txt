Currently, this movie has been featured as the worst 42nd movie on IMDb - so I leased NetFlix. But, in my film, though, it is not bad enough for me to be in the list of 100 films below. Personally I have seen at least 100 films worse than me. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a late honeymoon with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew (in the meantime, they are also married in real life). He is a physician who is in contact with the bats and requires a close cave. Once they are very, very, very stupid (the true view of the bad movie) and soon they are finished with bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people, and there are vampire bats in the United States - not all of them are correct. <br /> <br /> After a merger, the man goes to the hospital not even worried! The first thing in everyone's mind (especially a doctor) does not get immediate medical attention, it's not a boob. Soon, she breathes - still not interested in searching for any help! Again, you think you should be the stupid couple in the history of the film! <br /> <br /> After a while he goes to a doctor and is sent to the hospital. However, at that time it was too late and the attacks became worse and began to kill people for blood. Everyone understands that this man is a horrific murder machine; his wife (who has a grapefruit for a brain as his wife) refuses to believe it is dangerous - even if he attacks people, stops his ambulance and the police blocked the car! <br /> <br /> Moss had long passed these episodes, his eyes turned back and looked like normal people. Perhaps she developed her hands several times in a bat, and she used her a good prosthetic to see her as a bat. If it really was cheese, the film would have been worth 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a sense that does not make any sense, his wife turned into a dull bat pocket and kills a wounded sheriff. <br /> <br /> Although playing a role in television since 1974, Moss and McAndrew have a mystery, as they believe it will help their careers as a rule. <br /> <br /> Very dumb. The field is foolish and gives no sense and is based on people who are very intolerant to be strong in the truth. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that IMDb shows IT's ALIVE's schedule for the three DVDs, and it's two more films. BAT HUMAN WEBSITE. Despite the fact that BAT PEOPLE are seen as "ALIYEVA", these films have nothing to do with it. It's easy to understand my story - especially since they went out in 1974, but starred in the movie, starring Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and other film John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
