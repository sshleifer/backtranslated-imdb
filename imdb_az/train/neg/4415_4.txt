<br /> <br /> Like a game, it's a very funny Catholic fun. it is not a shocking fact with the church, heart pain, and the central princess, so he must give up his roots even if he started killing his parishioners (who made a fatal mistake who admitted guilty from the last confession) <br /> , is an example of how far the game is out of the truth and believes in the theater world. Marshall Brickman directed by Marshall Brickman, a beautiful castle that did a great job, but presented all these absurdities in a real way. fashion comedy happens to be a tragedy and you stay empty in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene game, you will not be disappointed.
