Okay, I'm blessed. I saw two new scenes called San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to one of these films, the movie is nearly unwatchable. I've been sitting on DVDs for the last two nights and have not finished yet. Wait a lot of strangers and lots of extra scenes and people on the way. Yes, four key speeches are very good, esp. Female Streep's. The comparison of the film with the scene is definitely an example of "less". The thickening of the game is a poor choice to ensure that the filmmakers need scene and specificity. Please, please, find a scene production nearby.
