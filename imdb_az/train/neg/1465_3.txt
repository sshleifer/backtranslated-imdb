First of all, I would like to add that I am a historical historian. So, what I see in a film based on historical events is really based on historical facts. But this is not here. Undoubtedly, the fact that the film is not based on entertaining and totally true facts is not a hindrance. Hitler was not an antisemit in youth, but even worked for Jews before World War II. However, during World War II, he was one of them, and then he expressed his thoughts on the Jews. His upbringing in this film is also a tiny brat, which is not as disturbing as Hitler's as a child. He had more or less normal parenting. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he does not really fit into his role as Hitler. Hitler's portrait was impossible and unstable. In his younger years, he was a charismatic man who "manipulated" the people with his own charm. <br /> <br /> His unstable behavior and anger blasts began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life, which is not based on actual historical facts and accusations. When people point to a finger on Hitler and others, I really hate it, and I'm telling the wrong stories to draw just one picture as a bad one. It is almost certainly better to say that everyone can learn the story! Those who were behind this film had to do some research before doing so. Because they do not really know what is happening. <br /> <br /> Hitler was not even shot in Munchda revolutionary march, but removed from his shoulder. <br /> <br /> This allows you to see a better documentary without seeing a documentary.
