The film begins with a beautiful song, Arbaaz goes suspiciously with Khan, but then suddenly we are forced to play a comedy. Like GOLMAAL, we deal with everyday flaws with children like Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal. Their scenes are initially pretty ridiculous and then annoying Tanushree's brother has a boring subjugation In the end, the true film tries to get serious with stealing heroes but here even the elder gets a long bashing bashing heart straight out <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Pritam is regular outside the first song <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the whole movie has a cheap look <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav, and the actor, like other films, is not from top to bottom, but Tusshar's not talking in a film, his dialing is a terrible consolation of Sharman Kunal Khemmu, the only actor who is very well-behaved, is for the first time working on a comedy film, but does not give much impression. Tanushree always takes less coverage than the evil Arbaaz Khan and the usual Payal actor, li Sharma is awful
