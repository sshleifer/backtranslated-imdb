Some children walk in the mountains and one of them goes to a huge tunnel and finds some old mummy gladiators. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> 1) A boy and a girl think they are in their tent and hear something outside them. This man goes out to investigate and finds another soldier abroad. After that, the girl is screaming at her husband, so they lead the tent - next morning they come! <br /> <br /> 2) These two peaks later release another girl (whatever, 100 feet away?), but they are scared because they are afraid of losing. <br /> <br /> 3) She travels around another boy and a girl and, according to the conditions that she informs the girl on her 10th scene, the protocol will no longer require her to apply as a professor. So, what ...? <br /> <br /> 4) The injured girl attacked Demonicus and stopped her, telling her: "First of all, this is really foolish, and second, some of his gladiator's teachings taught him how to wound him without killing him. we saw that he was wounded and not dead. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is hanging on the Demonicus bed, and if someone tries to free himself, he instructs this man to go and help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the only part of the film is that it has two beards pushing in the woods, then fights, then throws tents and does not see the screams of their friends, and then but they are a little bit wandering around. It's so dull and meaningless after downloading DVDs halfway down. <br /> <br /> These characters none of them is sympathetic, especially the majority of the screen Demonicus laughed at me every time I saw him - he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, scrunching to look bad. I can say he runs, or as gay. <br /> <br /> Generally, perhaps, this concept could have produced a bad film if they had more time and effort. this is to get rid of ridiculous dialogue, to create characters with actual unpleasant personalities, to have a logical flow of movement, and maybe Demonicus turns into a female character with a sexy gladiator material. But instead, we take this nonsense mustache that will lead you to death.
