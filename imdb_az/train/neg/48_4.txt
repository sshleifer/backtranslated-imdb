<br /> <br /> There are some nice shots in this movie, some of the landscapes are so beautiful, in fact cinematography is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = <br /> <br /> <<<I've been a Xmas gift because there is a feature to work with movies from an abusive actor and Matthew Mconaughey was just awful in the "Kill time" and "The Newton Boys" Fourthly, a DVD called Matthew Mconaughey is a film that uses it as a marketing affair, there are several lines and the screen is not too short at the end of the movie, it's mostly additive, and it does not explicitly illuminate the screen, Kill the strongest fans in this regard, I'm not worth it. <br /> <br /> Although the films are Patrick McGaw's eyes are very beautiful and very easy and his character is simply very beautiful and kind and caring, true saint <br /> <br /> Truthful Mcconaughey for the brightness I have seen, I The "Greater Than Your Life" and "The Angels", although you have not felt like a movie, "One time to kill", "The Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to lose one person within 10 days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" "<br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <strong> not a bad movie, but the screen's theft.
