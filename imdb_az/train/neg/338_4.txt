Eddie Murphy's one of the smallest movies is a nonsense about a mysterious kid, a three-hundred-year old dragons and a "chosen one". <br /> <br /> Murphy offers the "selected" opening song, "the best man in the world." A man who has lost children and missing children is approaching a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis), who says she is a "selectable one" and her destiny to find and escape the "Golden Child". <br /> <br /> Because if the child dies, compassion will die with him because he is the carrier of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus did not destroy the potsus rubbish for you, then the movie starts. It is enough to say that the plot was an assassination and destroyed the whole film. Being a tool for Murphy's humorous egoist brand (the comedy is not such a big idea), the film has failed at a very high level. Even Charles Sardar Numspa can not do a lot for Charles Dance processes. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
