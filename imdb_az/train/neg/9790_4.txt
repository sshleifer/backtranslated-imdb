Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) set out to bring a small, beautiful couple from a small, beautiful little home to a new younger brother, George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They come home with a strange new brother ... Stuart is a mysterious mouse (called by Michael J. Fox). Yes, the mouse. Stuart has found a sense of identity, even though the new family's pet cat, Snowbell (Nathan Lane's version), is in the super-dimensional world. Stuart begins a family loyalty and general friendship experience. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing dapper in the Stuart model boat race would accept his younger brother. <br /> <br /> Four in a row: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty, and Jeffery Jones. And sounds: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
