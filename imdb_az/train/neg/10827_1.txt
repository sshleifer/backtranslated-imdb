This ambitious film draws on the extravagant plot of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. This lumbering elephant, which is a very high derivative of much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet "Network"), takes too long to go elsewhere. There are several ways to go wrong along the way (a shameful musical intervention, biblical plague). The performance is not uneven. Especially bad: William H. Macy, the character and story can easily be completely eradicated; Julianne Moore, for his unconvincing angst. How many times should we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack ("Chicago" and "Hour" enough)? Is Tom Cruise Compared To Good? Its misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was quite entertaining. When speaking of foul mouth, the script was loaded with a "F" bomb in such a way that it never lost its impact. Talk about this awesome soundtrack, filled with insipid and bored vocals by Aimee Mann. At the beginning of the film, I suddenly accelerated my extension of the number of "maudlin" to distribute me to one another. After writing on the wall, I kept myself for three hours, then pushing it to the edge of paradise. Another paid feature not shown in other reviews is by Melora Walters, Claudia, the best performance of self-destructive coca-like damage. His reliability has gone beyond all others. This film showed itself in a very serious way and did not know when the time would end.
