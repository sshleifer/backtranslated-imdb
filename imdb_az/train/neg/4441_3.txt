The "Summit of Love" proves that every author of the Comédie-Française, who uses the word Shakespeare as a concealment, is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Brittannica says that while Commedia Dell Arte-inspired writer translated Marivaux's adaptation, she lost something: "Her nuanced sense and clever words were known as tulips." <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino was enjoying three comic novel romance, her trousers' role in the "Figaro's Wedding" in Cherubino. <br /> <br /> <strong> Fiona Shaw was the best, like the deceived spinster and suits. <br /> <br /> The viewer's eyes and the shutter curtain call for the fact that all of these works have not really helped. <br /> <br /> (previously written 5/29/2002)
