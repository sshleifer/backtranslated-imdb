I invested one night on a cable channel just a few minutes before the credits, so I did not know who did it at first. The longer I saw it, the more thought began, "Jesus, it looks like a Albert Pie." For two main reasons photography was pretty good (and the desert scenery of Utah was beautiful) and Scott Paul gave a hilarious performance like a murderous cyborg Simon, but with some style and sense of humor. Paulin had a very clever liner shot, because Albert Pound did not write anything far away from the comic or related story. Unfortunately, Paul does not have so much screen before leaving, and the film is worse for that. Lans Henriksen, who plays the worst head cyborg, is enlarging his path by the same way as in other films. I did not know what Chris Christopher's hell was; Perhaps he wanted to see the likes of the Utah Desert and make money for it. She goes through a film that watches just awakening (and sounds) and actually spends the last half of the movie behind the tent. The protagonist, Kathy Long, has a huge body, has a charming, big body, has a very good fight, has a great body and is not important in a movie, despite the talent of the players. this is. It's packed with the brands we love and celebrate when we are filming Albert Pound: a sad and terrible dialogue, angrily editing and losing a cylinder in the middle of the image, and, unfortunately, "Oh, though it's as bad as this movie, Pyunun's other it's a shadow above most of your efforts - it's in line with Citizen Kane's brain. "Adrenaline: For example, feel the Rush. The cases are pretty good, repeat (say eight or nine kids behind each other, you say "Alright over, go to something else") and Long Athletic (and like the previous one), a great derryere). It is not a good movie with any extension of the imagination, but it is not close to the place where Pyunun's ordinary extravagans are inaccessible and impossible. You might be worse than having to rent this movie - not too bad, but worse than that.
