You enjoy movies like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic refusal. Loss of resources that are never to be discussed with loudness, without loss of poverty, inexperienced; less than actually registered and sold to consumers in a non-skeptical way. It's the worst movie i've ever seen in the last 18 months; All 86 minutes of work-time mind-numbingly bad. If it were longer, I would not write this theory without using it. Alert yourself!
