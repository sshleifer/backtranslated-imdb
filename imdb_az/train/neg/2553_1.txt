Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. What else can I say? Kate Jackson had to be helpless to be direct. Perhaps she should return to the actress ... she was a bad actress because she had a second opinion. It puts money to get something bad. I love anti-Christ films and usually have a good laugh and strange fear, but it's just bad and bad. The movement of the stars was worse than in a soap opera. Special effects are ridiculous if you can call them. If you play scenes in the dream, you'll see the bleeding bleeding. I have to turn off my drive only after 30 minutes. These films should be destroyed by the original traces, all discs and tapes should be destroyed and all people involved in filming should pay for rent to filmmakers. Therefore, no one should ever allow anything to happen, manage, or film.
