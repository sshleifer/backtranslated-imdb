Why should we try to describe these times to others who do not know what time in the past? Replace the Woodstock with the Civil War and change with the Titanic sink down to Apollo Moon and you have a real whistle when you filled this formula soap opera with a very low life trash. And what are the guys who are too young to go to Woodstock and fail classroom school compositions? "I'm going to show these old meanies, prove that I do not know the nut about the topic to turn off their movie and still earn money!" Yes, we know it. One thing that followed this movie was to give me some insight into the subclassing thought. When I see a prostitute in a bar next to Diane Lane, I try another way. Allowing parents to raise worthless children is child abuse. It simply means mass stalking to erase into a flick of Woodstock and moonlanding, ipso facto movie is the 1969 portrait.
