This incredibly overrated anime television series (26 episodes, every 25 minutes) is a giant robot pilot to defend Japan against invading creatures called Angels on a 14-year-old boy (and two girlfriends). There is little explanation given to the angels, or why they have increased in recent times and have never come out of nowhere (why not attack each other? Are you trying to destroy people?). Robot fight scenes try to use different obstacles, but the movement itself is boring to perform poorly. Almost every episode resembles a space gap where there is nothing interesting. <br /> <br /> Some are concerned about the fans who are talking about (very few) symbolic references here, but all of this - to religious or philosophical concepts that have been coerced by zero craft. Generally, the series is incredibly exhausting, as it is the surface of the characters, and is actually nothing else than self-humiliating foolishness. Psychology is committed, in my heart I simply "hate my father" conflicts repeatedly and repeatedly, without any progress, their value. These symbols mean that this series is pushed into an angry-garbage garbage from medium to hardship, spending time in the latest episodes with endless, angry diatribes, extremely repetitive psychobabble (some of them totally meaningless). <br /> <br /> I say that this series only gets worse and gets worse. Every day, I was looking at DVDs in my living room and I told myself, "Damn, I have to watch the next episode (inside)." The real stroke episode was only 25 minutes, but it did not take a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It's really a very frightening critique of this series. <br /> <br /> I do not ever get chased by watching a whole series of my life at all like the Evangelion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Evangelion" is a lack of anime - massive dull, intelligent cinema. The universal acclaim for this crap is simply incredible; and the ridiculous imagination by fans of this series, "one of the greatest achievements of humanity," is probably the most modest interpretation I've heard about IMDb, and I've seen some strain.
