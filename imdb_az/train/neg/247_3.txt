Yesterday at 21:30, my friend was on a camping trailer and we were very upset to watch the South Park (new episode). Undoubtedly, in my country, we got up at 10:30 am in South Park, and now we watch the testimony and decided to lose the time with the father of the hero. I'll just start by saying that I look at episodes. When I looked for the first time, I saw no good and bad for nothing, so I thought, '' Holy shit, I have an early morning football game, so I should not watch foolish cartoons. ' But yesterday, I tried to give the Prophet the second chance. <br /> <strong> The Simpsons has a complete disassembly, but instead is replaced by lions by replacing the yellow human symbols. <br /> <br /> Why did the TV-14 score get the second thing? I feel more vulnerable to The Simpsons, and in this show only real vulgarity is some unfinny jokes. The Simpsons are also very fierce (Halloween specials) and raw. I've heard that the creator of the series manages Shrek 2, well, I know it: Shrek 2 was better and I think your family is very thematic. <br /> <br /> I would also like to note that Pride's Father smiles three-four times (even laughs once). <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not care for my dignity. I do not hate it, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> <strong> I've seen a better way than The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
