One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comic, turned into a bratty child. Both sold the ones worse than Pryor's character. Two: Harold Lloyd is a terrible, very sensitive article that can be used in the film. Three: Choosing a black player like a player; his racist subtext is unbearable as never before. There is no message here, part of the Pryor can be played by any comedian actor. Four of them: Oh boy ... I wish I would be back in time and never want it to work ... it was such films, Kid Co could not ... and my childhood would be free from their power of mind. So if you want to watch a few beautiful comics, the patient must defile himself with a sweet kiddie flick. If you want to see them in a good way, look at something better than the old pace of Pryor's movement and Baleares to Gleason.
