With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly one of the most ironic films ever made. About those who want to be a comedian cruise ship cruise ship Shecky (Sandler). First, there is no funny or intelligent line of conscience in the whole film. It is not so painful that it is miserable. Not too romantic or sexual humor, not surprising, f-word is more. The budget is really small and the film is damaged. It can take place on a cruise ship, but there is money to hire a small boat and there are only 10 coins for Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are cheaply revalued and just bad. I hate this movie, and anyone who sees it will hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. R category for language.
