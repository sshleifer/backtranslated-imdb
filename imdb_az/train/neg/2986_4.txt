Where can I start? I would like to use this movie, but I did it. Still, I wanted to benefit from being another zombie film worthy of my trophy, and it was not. It was a different taste. It was unhealthy, and I was watching one of the most funny movies ever seen. And no matter how much I care about Fulci's excuses, there's no excuse for how this movie went. It was a bad movie, but I could not give it to 4 under it, it's like it's because it's good ... at least I laughed at this mistake of a movie. <br /> <br /> I had to imagine these zombies on the ceilings of all these buildings ... they thought they were bored like bodies and, therefore, had toss themselves above stone erections, or because they saw the meaty lifestyle of the shaking around , many airwaves were staged. Hell, what else do you have when you're dead? <br /> <br /> During the war years, some of the zombies they were looking for, such as the storms and the splashed, had to laugh, and some shouted as traditional meat-eaters. I had a party on a floating head, which I did not know. I have been watching for a long time, the flames of the Phillips, fog, heavy doses of fog and ponds have fused like boats. I designed a design for the treatment of this illness in an octagonal paper with the "Dead One" written in the middle, with stretch marks from every aspect. I have to ask myself ... if the treatment of zombies is not easy, then can I do something to start a zombie epidemic? <br /> <br /> All the impacts are the fear of the stunt, the original, the awesome, the zombie contrary to the poor, even the worst of all, and the women are ugly, but I enjoyed it. It was an entertaining hour. It turned out to be a very bad movie, and I do not recommend this as long as I'm a bad management film, but still say ... it was a good laugh. I do not want zombie films anyway, but it should have been better when it was connected to Fulci's name. I think the Holocaust was better.
