I rent this horrible film. I think I've seen the worst. I believe that grade 1 can be a better job. The bad movie I've seen, and I've seen the bad guys. There is no fear that I've paid $ 1.50 and it's 1.49 too big. Acting is awful, symbols are bad, and the film is just a piece of trash. The scenes of the desert house give an unprecedented appearance, as the Oscar nominee, for such a budget. In a word, I can say that if you spend a good evening and spend a bit of money rent this terrible snort. When I sat down in a bucket to sit on this flop again, I would watch the clay mud out of space
