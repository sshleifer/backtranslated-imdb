It was drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. Actually, I did not even finish it. I want my money back. Once again Hollywood's weak attempts will come up with a new idea. Something good in a refrigerator in a lemon container. In any case. They had given Nic Cage a hat and an ox lace. Swashbucklin '. Cage's rise to Arizona or the departure from Las Vegas is the "lemon". Completely and completely sold people (and most of them) should love this movie. If this movie were animated, I would have taken it seriously. I paid more to see a totally stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie, and it made a more incredibly loyal attempt to test and hide the FACT. <br /> <br /> It looks like all SHEEP likes it.
