The lid on the DVD and the disc is awesome, and I still thought it was a movie about sweet tooth wrapped in black with a really good idea, but the actors of this movie were then performing at Benin's pearl port, the better quality of the porno and the better actors . I'll buy a DVD, but fortunately, I gave it a hire, the plot and the script were terrible too, because the film did not really come to an end, and the film was not really meaningful. Poor attempts to frighten you using Flashback scenes are better than those used in the 80's sitcom shows and eventually leave those who want to shake your head against your home wall.
