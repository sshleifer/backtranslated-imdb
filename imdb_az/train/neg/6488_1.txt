Yep, the subject is a flat quote from the movie and I think it's quite right. I'm going to die with this deliberate effort. All the flashes that did not make any sense after the first 20 minutes, and so on. It's just a bad movie + Epileptic, you'd be dead at least five times. Of course, all David Lynch admirers raise a banner for this kind of turkey and do not make sense because there is no "best movie", and in any sense art should be art and the art should always be good. Right? I say lying. This artificial art lid is just a saturated way to try to show you that you are a good film artist. Anthony Hopkins as the perfect actor should only act.
