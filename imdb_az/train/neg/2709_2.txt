The only way to get something from this movie is to treat it as a comedy. It is seen in the light, it is transmitted. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> This film has no depth and offers little to no direct and one-sided examination of "issues" without any consideration. <br /> <br /> A film about stereotypes and a stereotype of each character in the film is a very weak strategy, especially when these characters only hackneyed patterns are predictable, stereotypically broken. <br /> <br /> The Busta Rhymes and the Ice Cube movie are almost beautiful and Michael Rappaport turns out to be a good performance, but the script is terrific and public commentary is surprising, it's hard to find anything.
