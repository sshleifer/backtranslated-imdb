Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unexpected directors / producers in history. He is from my favorite horror movies (Edgar Allen Poe adaptations like "Red Death Mask" and "Pit and Pendulum") and some unsatisfactory cheap and sticky litter theses (like "Creature") "Haunted Sea" and "Shark Reef 's Gods). Is Corman just a classmate and made several films? simply put it ?? It is not possible to make the right decision. "The Trip" can, for example, be labeled as somewhat psychedelic abuse, such as imaginative "Gas-s-s-s". In other words, they were impressed by the rather bizarre hippie-culture movie. Half of the time, you do not have the slightest idea of ​​what happens, who goes back and forth with the screen of these characters, and where all this hell goes. Assassination is simple and highly effective: strange, but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released and immediately destroys the entire population of the world over 25 years of age. This * can be a major cause of atmospheric, curling and nails. post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn a "trippy" road-movie comedy. Not even one of the characters works to avoid the inevitable deaths; they just go to the party on the streets and find a small crime syndicate. "Gas-s-s" is a hard work to get heart stroke and strange. The whole script seems to be born in place and is not ridiculous. Certainly not my cup of tea, but there is a loyal fan base in the movie and many fans, so who is worth your time or money?
