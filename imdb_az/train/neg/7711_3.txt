It is said. <br /> <br /> Two years ago, what happens when you are attacking vegetables or fruits. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the magic magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomato on skateboards, people watching tomatoes on the screen, throwing basketball-sized tomatoes on the screen to actors), tomatoes really attack everyone's leaf. <br /> Then Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I do not want to be on the side of any government to get rid of a sin. Naturally, there is a controversial correspondent (Taylor), the worst period of time, dancing and reading army soldiers, a Japanese man with a Japanese voice, a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, San <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Diego Chicken </ strong> <br /> <br /> Actually, after watching them, you could improve yourself .
