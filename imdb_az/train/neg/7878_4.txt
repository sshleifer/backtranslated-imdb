I am a great admirer of the original book, and this adaptation is just bad. First of all, it was difficult to decide whether there was a kiddie or an adult. This led to some terribly violent scene, which was a foolish little duck that gave birth to "mysterious" moments of adult storytelling. But this is not very important, the film is simply a dull, entertaining and original story. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> They did not learn something? Who is the next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
