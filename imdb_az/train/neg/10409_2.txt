The story is not hard enough, this film shows the cows with sudden hurricanes in a five-minute slaughterhouse, while telling about their early life as a hero hero. Strange things. Then the girl / her husband has the key points that she would not go with her if she were a girl. Is this man too far away from things that are a psycho, a masochist, just a condemned queen? And what was the traumatic childhood period? But he was not accepted and had to live with those who hated him because he loved him first and then charged him. He tries to explain to us the reasons for what he does, but it is difficult to empathize so much. To destroy such a sad and unusual self. Was this funny? What was really all this?
