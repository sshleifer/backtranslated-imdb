It's worth it; Morvern Callar is both a blessing and a disappointment. It is very mysterious, original. Is it a way to deal with a loss of pain that is so far and mixed with it? Or is it a revolutionary name as a reviewer? <br /> <br /> Morvern completely disconnects himself. Do not worry about using your money to inform your family or give it a fitting fun, dropping your spouse, leaping to selfishness on a trip to Spain. It appears to be deprived of something that is envy of human beings. The only element that allows viewers to see the human side is their close friend. Finally her friend was thrown out and Morvern had nothing to do with humanity. <strong> </ font> <br /> </ font> </ font> <br /> <strong> There is nothing interesting about the film, it is really shameful. Less than 90 minutes, but feels longer. Morvern appears to be interested in attracting attention, but it has nothing to do with it, just to keep it away from your characters or movies.
