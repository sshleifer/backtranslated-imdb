I recently got my DVDs, forgetting how hate the movie version of "A HORNEST LINE". <br /> <br /> Because of the popularity of Kassie's relationship, the music ensemble's premiere comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the music numbers sped up and fled. <br /> <br /> <strong> When Kassie is characterized, the song she sings is completely broken. <br /> <br /> Summarizing is very self-critical. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the movie is an attempt to squeeze out of joy and spontaneity, a large number can still be used.
