This movie is a bad indie with A-list talent. All the roads were ridiculous till the end of the plot. In the 1980s, my home video market reminded me of a lot. I would give it to each other, but there are short moments that you see the actors really tough enough to do something worthwhile. I think the worst thing is that the underwater scene is out of the dock. The underwater lighting did not come from anyone, and it seemed to be an air tank, though we were not close to the air. I missed it if nothing else happened on the shelf. Good day.
