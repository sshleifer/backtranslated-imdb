It's not a mixed up with Wiz or Mr. Wizard, but the Wizard review. The wizard is a 80s film about a serious silent boy playing video games and walking around during all opening credits. <br /> <br /> This is an unnecessary update of Wiz Wizard of Oz and Mr. Wizard is a man who unites 100 sticks and is drinking from a few children. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got all this way, I say: there's really no reason to see this movie. Just 100 minutes of Nintendo trading, Powerglove, Zelda, and Super Mario Brothers 3 legends. Since I see this movie as written in a weekly fashion, I use the word "design" in the most loosest sense possible. He did not play Nintendo and conveyed the guidance of a man who meant less style than my grandmother. Perhaps, when the writer and the director were sitting and really playing together, they realized they wanted to shoot a fool, instead of going to a vocational school to learn how to install a car stereo. <br /> <br /> I hope this has been a great experience for you. Certainly not for me. In fact, I may have lost some braincells in watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're at the video store, The Wiz, The Wizard, and The Wizard of Oz are all sitting in a very small row, playing all over and playing Duck Hunt.
