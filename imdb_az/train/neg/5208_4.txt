This mini series, designed by Alex Hale as a "Queen", tries to use similar formulas to build a long history after the family's life for many years. However, when the result of the "Queen" ended skillfully, Mama Flora was also inspired here. First of all, it is probably the book itself and, most definitely, this TV production. For many years, it is very rash, because the opening saga is not as superficial as the 'Queen'. It was very carefully prepared in the previous sections of the film, but as the film progressed, it seemed that the dallasian-forsythian had become an unusual blend of three or three hours until the end of the last. I hoped for more; Haley has been less inspired than his biographical "Queen" recently and Peter Verner III is not a match for John Erman. It is only recommended for those who have appetite for such long fairy tales of growing generations.
