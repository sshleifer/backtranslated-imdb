This is a really terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I just write that somebody is watching him in one place. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be happy after losing the precious life of a person watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's stars are alienated, thinking that they are always an interesting thing to do. <br /> <br /> I realized that this movie was totally deceived to follow the incredible drive. <br /> <br /> I do not believe this movie has reached a high price as it was in IMDb (I saw 5 votes last). <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie!
