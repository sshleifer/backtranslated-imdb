I have never been a great admirer of Mormon films. When I was a Mormon, I always felt that humor was very special to the LDS community and it seemed to us to be a very obsessive wackos. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This will be at least a little laughable, as it has the B-list talent, like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (One of Some). In addition, church basketball is matched with very cheerful gags and such potential. But I have to say that during the entire movie, nobody knew what they were doing. Every joke has fallen flat and every opportunity for a really funny gag has been ignored. The dialogue was bland, and the film had the worst character I ever had. Every character of Wilson was less than one. It is difficult to believe that after the ninth post, the film is still unclear as a train crash I witness. I can not speak of the wrath I felt that I was sitting with these words. As my friends and additions to our latest gaming scene, we went to premiere at the UT in Washington DC. Director Kurt Hale was there and I must say that I did not get in touch with him after the show. He seemed ready to wait on the door. <br /> <br /> His film did not bring me alone for telling me that my life had destroyed a good time and half, but I would never forget that it left a bad, painful trait. <br /> I had a few problems: There was a little story of love story between a rapporteur and a skilled pianist, but these two characters did not come out and could not care. it was supposed to be caring about these two naked, indifferent characters. There were many subpodices every now and then everywhere, each of them laughing, but everybody came and even went to a smoke-free smoke before it started. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great frenzy and I feel bad for anyone who is waiting for the first REAL funny Mormon movie. True, this joke is not specific to Mormons. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. No doubt, it was a joke, and it was difficult to say what was a loud voice in my ears. Make a fantasy in your mind that this movie is fun. Join my disappointment myself
