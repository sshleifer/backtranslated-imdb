The first film of an actor is something that lets you overlook - it's the first thing that really is not a movie experience, and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than 1982, it's hysterically funny, though it's so bad. Completely drawn to the Chicago area with a small budget, most of the shootings are harsh, wooden and caricaturized - a cross between secondary school games and a bad community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often goes out of the dialogue, and dialogue is open, not mandatory and natural, but mandatory and expedient. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Big, secular audience , but often the creators of such films focus on their autobiographical relationships with the "Message" or the project where they put aside good film production values. (I am sure that the main character has the same name as the manufacturer / director / editor and cast member) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was more interesting and convincing - See his next movie. Careers like him are not built in such films.
