I just saw it at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. The synopsis in the festival book was very good, so we decided to check it out. <br /> <br /> It was boring, besides being saddened. <br /> <strong> The previous bite was a clich√© without mockery, with no high scarcity of fun. The film would have been better than the Hunt Hoe had gone with a horror feeling on a camping. Instead, he took himself seriously and resulted in this boring film. I can not recommend this movie. It is too long and generally feels just flat.
