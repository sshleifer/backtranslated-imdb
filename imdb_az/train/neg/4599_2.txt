The word "Do not judge by the cover of any book" is confused as a warning to those who are not visible on the surface. <br /> <br /> When I called my works of art "The King of Bliss" I immediately thought HORROR! The backdroping proudly reflecting the black appearance touched a dark vision, which was a crime, betrayal and revenge. <br /> <br /> Chris L. McKenna's book, The Kings of the Blocks, is designed to prepare a middle-class man, like Sean Crawley. Even though a name in the world would mean killing. Except for Sean Crawley, he does not care about anyone, and I have never felt any sympathy or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is obviously unbearable, but has turned out to be an irresponsible speech like Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), which shows that the absolutely funny dialogue that is forced to read is the worst. <br /> <br /> <strong> In Kari Wuhrer, as a sad widow, coincidentally lacking confidence (especially in homelessness) and little thought, and George Wendt as Duke, basically, in this movie (source of lid images) There are several interesting "hallucination" series, but this movie is no closer to that world. He prefers to bomb you with non-compelling characters, bad dialogue and unexpected events. Oh!
