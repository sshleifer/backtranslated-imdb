<br /> <br /> There were two really funny scenes in this movie. <br /> <br /> All the scenes were satisfied with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear!). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stereotypes, sliding speed, and "soundtrack" are generous. <br /> <br /> In both cases, really, really funny scenes include Amy P. He is not only really funny in animal species. SNL and Lucille Ball have a mix of that monkey guy. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just earn money. She gave birth to Sarah Palin's parody, and then we can say that the black guy has to become a role of a servant in there to help more people. <br /> Blah. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Oh, almost forgot. The mother of "The Two and the Half Man" is in this film, and it looks like the 30-year-old mouth, as in every scene, I'm trying to straighten his face or put it in my mind or answer the question, "Wait. Do you have surgery? " Because as an audience, I do not want it to be a plastic surgery.
