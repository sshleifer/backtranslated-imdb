Since I was a great fan of the 1944 movie, it was difficult to watch this movie and be fair and objective. This was not the best movie for me and for many. It's just a movie for a shortened movie, and most people have dropped it out, I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare it with the '44. After the scene, I compare what I'm on stage and I remember playing with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. <br /> <br /> That's why I've seen the famous role of renowned actors replacing Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, when it's over, but not exactly for the 1944 original. There were two major areas where the film was not good for television: (1) the lack of electricity between the two potentials and (2) only 90 minutes when they had a difficult time to develop the area between these symbols and chemistry. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and there was no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck, as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson". <br /> <br /> It was another character at the place where it was repeated, like Barton Keyes and Edward Norton. Norton, like Cobb, Keyes and Robert Webber, was terrible as the head of the insurance company. Also, houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines and so on. It was about 70 in the mid-40's. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just ran. <br /> <br /> However, a review was enough, and I'm happy for the rest of this classic story and movie, so I'll be back to the original version.
