James Keller, a journalist working at the Public Telecommunication Center, interviewed a German professor of Floridian University, a crew of unknown creatures based on a meteor (s). However, a man named Anderson is trying to control the whole planet, and it kills his professor and his assistant and loses vitality. Thus, Craig and his new human soul associate, Joanna Fitzgerald, can communicate with human beings not only with humans, but also with creatures abroad, trying to find alive and send them to an alien ship ... the film has some great shots and cadres. For example, NIGHTMARE City Laura Trotter, creator of special visual effects, Dario Argento's masterpieces, Sergio Stivaletti and director Alberto De (legendary writer), MARTINO TELEPHONE ON THE WORK OF ACTION, ADAM EYES AND KILLER. And these talented people take an incredibly bad film, which is basically E.T. EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL and THIRD FOLLOWING DEFENSE PROFESSIONALS is actually something called a MIAMI GOLEM, a mixed-up movie. And it's not just an error but also something worthy of a crammed movie; genetic engineering with psychological research. As a result, the film has at least one scientific and / or technical shortcomings; genetic engineering and psychological research are never compatible. (Strangely, this strange child-conscious genetic engineering and psychological research lead, Craig, also says that short-haired psychiatry should be better for Joanna, but the whole story of the film does not present or present in any way a better way .) In addition, this movie is more laughing; problematic music. The composer, who credits Robert Marry, is nothing but strange obedient BEVERLY-HILLS-COP-delicious music. I do not want to say that BEVERLY HILLS COP's Italian theme is particularly bad, but it's clear that music is not compatible with any movie. Who really thinks only of BEVERLY HILLS COP's compatibility with genetic engineering and / or psychological research?
