A stylted demolition called "Murder, She Wrote," is far more surprising than lasting eight full years in this badly written trash. I'm convinced that most of these people are slimy and seventies, and just remembering the star of the old Dick Van Dyke show, because they did not do anything better. In the 1960s, Van Dyke, who was just a decent career, was not an actor (with his own perception) and the series was too old to be a doctor when he began in 1993. It looks like entirely old, chain smoking and heavy drinking for years. Rarely a throne actor in everything that does not include his father, his unlucky real life is playing in his son Barry's son.
