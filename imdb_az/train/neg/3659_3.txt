This review generally refers to the film's breaking out as "Wolfman's Anger". There are additional images that I understand there is an unlimited version and I hope there are at least eight or nine important scenarios missing from someone known as the Wolfman Anger. In short, the film does not mean anything in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Valdemar Daninski, Paul Nasin, Paul Nasin, is an ordinary man, of course, the lanthropic antihero, which reflects an infinite number of films. a trip to Tibet, where an orphan attacked. Anyway, it made him a savage. Daninsky is a physician, scientist, and educator who seems to be a college student. Ilona Elmann, one of her female friends, is in the form of an indefinite hypnosis ... The "cematodes" are a ridiculous word used to use many wire meshs on the victim's head. <br /> <br /> According to Elma, "allowing the human brain to change direction", of course, gives us the opportunity to dominate the world if we can add to all the news. Elmann enters the Kurds as he kidnaps Daninsky and leads him to his secret lab. There are many people who are stranded there. Some are like gypsies, weakened, and diverse. Others are obvious hippies. Elmann feels that one day he can "help them again", but at the same time he controls them with chematodes. Waldemar becomes a dark stroke, wandering around like a hero zombie - until the film shoots decide that Naschi's fake victim will come from the film, "Frankenstein's Bloody Terror" (Interrogation), <br /> <br /> <strong> > <strong> <strong> No? Well, good. This is the grace of saving the movie. It does not work at any intellectual level and does not attract you, it just flies at full speed, just as you can collect every nonsense or cheap fright. "Wolfman's Anger" can be the best Halloween party movie. You do not need to pay attention to it, and in fact, you will be completely mistaken.
