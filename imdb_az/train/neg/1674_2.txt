The film was interesting, but, unfortunately, this film just does not give her justice. Casting was pretty good and it was beautifully drawn - but the stylist was in contravention of most of the direction (overstylized fast regulation had no effect) .... I expected Steven Bochko to work with a credit after a trade), characters only coke (and everything that Boogie Nights has for all the character development) and has no hilarious characters drawn to the story of the audience. It's a very memorable movie.
