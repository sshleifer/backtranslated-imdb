: Spoiler: <br /> <br /> I'm glad of the joy of love. I was really looking forward to seeing him, and finally, when I was re-publishing Thursday night in Hallmark, I was lucky. I love the first three "Love", but there was nothing I could think of. The entire movie was sad and troublesome, there were many goofs and the correction was very flawed - many scenes in the context. I also think that Katie's death takes place soon, and Clarks's appearance in the film is not appropriate. Unfortunately, none of the actors really wanted to be there - nothing had ever happened. <br /> <br /> It seemed that there was no interaction between Mission and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the script writer is going to go further. Every film made so far is farther away from Janette Oke's writings and appears to be seen. In the film, they did not say anything, either of a substance or two boys, or Clark did not complain about it. And Missie and Willies think that reactions to Katie's death can be heard and heard more than just hearing. <br /> <br /> At least I love the Abiding Joy of the four films I have ever prepared. With the upcoming four films, I hope the book is more and more Clarks, and I hope there is more of it and I hope its part is not so soft. I also think that Scottie and Cookie and maybe Marty are more, but those who know they are keeping with the writers of the script.
