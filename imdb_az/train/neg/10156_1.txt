It is written by S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. The main character I was happy to play fungus. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie hit a lot. The actor is well-featured in the E-list and in the movie. Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are as low as they play the same person. The whole movie appears to be shot with a camera instead of a half-decent film. Another favorite I love is the film Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper's funny. They made me laugh too foolish. Apart from this, if you see this movie in Blockbuster, let everyone hide behind a lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks about this film should be considered mentally.
