A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment on Nightmare on Elm Street and the worst continuation of the series is worse than the Nightmare on Science Street 2. I was lucky to get Kabus on Elm Street. There was a DVD box for my birthday and I watched all the sequel. The dream guy was the worst of all, and I was very surprised that the last two slides were so good. But they think they have lost the charm, the story was just strange, and I was not happy about where I went. Alice hated her, not Nancy and Kirsten, but she did not work for me who took this movie with her. <br /> <br /> Alice was back and she could not have been happier when she was carrying a child. However, Freddie also returned and in the fourth film she was easily defeated and she would not be too bright. But anyway, he wants his child and is born again. Does Freddie have parents too? A street in Science Street: Dream Child explores and Alice soon knows what Freddie's childhood is and maybe he can defeat her. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child is an insult to a whole movie and series. I do not think everyone can be happy with this continuation. Only one story was really foolish, probably could have worked, but it was still wrong. I know that if you want to see the next section of Nightmare on Elm Street, you have to watch it, but I really do not recommend it, at least not worth my opinion. <br /> <3/10
