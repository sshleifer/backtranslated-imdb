(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors is likely to release the worst theater movie. There is a plan for a girl who has nothing to do with anything, can be dead or strange ideas about those who have not died. The whole movie is made up of random pictures of things that do not really resemble one another until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> something came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
