Strange people living in a city walk along their lives. There is a man begging for everything, a scattering diver who finds a body to live with, a naked girl full of clothes like her, a boy who wants to clean up the girls' evil ways ... in extreme black and white, this shooting is better than the shooting. Monochrome is just two steps away from the feeling of home cinema. Like a Troma movie, this movie is entertaining and entertaining, but it's strange for strangers, and soon it's a whistle-hole as you can guess it's going to be a lot of time. but I have not had enough of it. (I have not seen the cleansing). There is nothing to watch and the next Golden Gold set is worth the hit you expect from Netflix.
