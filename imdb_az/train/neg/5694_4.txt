I'll be honest - this is a great admirer of Kyle Chandler (in particular, Early edition) because I leased this movie. He is usually a good guy, and I wanted to see him as a different role. The field itself drew me; to be a petitioner (Tony Greco-aka Mr. Chandler), to kill a witness or a murderer who will testify against one of the "family" before his death. The movies were as I expected. It was sick, I hated the last (if you see, you know why) and there were many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was bad and gave a bit of meaning. Yes, it was a mob movie and yes guns go to BOOM. But there is something more than the movie. It did not have time to reach the details of the film, just to act and understand it. Actor for the truth - James Belushi, "The Rose", was quite entertaining. Sheryl Lee looks like a believer as Angel can be. He was most surprised at me. And Kyle Chandler was also as convincing as a newcomer to the "family" at the same time. Only the script executed the actors.
