After watching Blanche's first 20mn (he would not apologize for being too late), I confirmed that he did not approve it. <br /> <br /> In fact, this "movie" is an insult to the true French actors participating in this whimsical part. It begins with a well-known concept in French comedies ("Deux Heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronical tone / dialogue. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, Lou Doillon, the horse's tragedy, is all supported by brilliant actors and the "terrifying" direction of the "terrible" heavy comedy "stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, and Blanche's comedy is just a scary movie, frightening for the cinephiles who want to challenge and shock Fight in the middle of this dark crystal kitchy-prissy fare, watching beautiful actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort.
