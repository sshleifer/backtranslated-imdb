(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Although written in English, it has been prepared for Italian TV and has never been to the previous DEMONS movies. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the director Lamberto Bava should be called the OGRE, which has been released. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian villa for summer. Female (Virginia Bryant) has dreams of repeating itself as a little girl who goes to the old wine cellar of this villa. It is glowing and covered in pigeons and resembles the spider or insect legs hanging from it. <br /> Of course, this husband does not believe in anyone. <br /> <br /> OGRE itself, as seen in something seen as a 16th-century costume, gives us strange sounds and strange sounds in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> There are people who are angry against the people living in the Caucasus. There is no real body apart from some skeletons that are rotting in a basement pool similar to the bottom of a modern pool, and OGRE itself simply flies away after its family's Jeep Cherokee drives. /> <br /> The Shriek DVD movie I was watching was flawed and the picture was filmed for about a few seconds in a few seconds, with additions to Lamberto Bava, explaining how it was later, and so on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
