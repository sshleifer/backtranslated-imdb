What is the price I give to BOOM, because of Sardinia and Rome's superior location photography. Otherwise, it is only for ELIZABETH TAYLOR's heavy losses (its downward direction) and RICHARD BURTON (it's his eradication phase). Tennessee Williams says "Milk Train Stop Here Anymore" and her game should be very fond of this adaptation - but it seems she was just. <br /> <br /> According to Taylor, this money hates and Burton needs money. <br /> <br /> In any case, it looks like Taylor's legs. <br /> <br /> Among Taylor's supporters, this is likely to be a "must-see" thing. But you sit down without a drink in your hand, it's my fault. Unfortunately, this is a film that Taylor's end was a movie actress, even after winning two Oscars. Burton was equally disastrous and critics called him BOMB. If you have the courage to judge yourself.
