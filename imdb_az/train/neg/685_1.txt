My husband and I thought that film should watch at least with the cast and director. We were wrong. In fact, after 45 minutes we refused. Crawford, Young, and Tone are British, but the idea of ​​speaking with American accents is unrealistic for me - it's hard to believe that Britain has no talks with English accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and the idea that Cooper and Crawford are expressing their love for each other suddenly without any reason to be reflected in the previous statement. There is no reason not to worry about any characters, so we dropped half of the towels. Because none of the rulers have spoken to the Hawksian rat-a-tat delivered brand, Hawks found it difficult to direct it. So, get rid of your time and throw one.
