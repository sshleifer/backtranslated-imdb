Firstly: I bought the video store. Secondly: I followed it. Third, it was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: The majority of antiques were naked. <br /> <br /> I had a strange film in this movie, which was a general fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a great Adam Sandler fan, despite this frustrated and forgotten movie. I'm sorry it's his first movie. Do not watch this movie though you are a great Adam Sandler fan. Instead, just shoot the video, place a yacht and throw it over.
