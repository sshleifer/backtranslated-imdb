(some spoilers) - if you do not know how to deal with <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very good trades, such as Paul Verhoeven and director Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, are a very interesting subject - invisibility. Each premise was made for the big movie. Unfortunately, these things were not important. The movie was a very exciting and very scary week. <br /> <br /> About a group of scientists who discovered invisibility. After successful tests of animals, Kevin Bacon decided to test himself. In an invisible time, he changes the advantages of being unseen. <br /> <br /> There is a very thin line to kill your spouse. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a dirty film. There are many new movies that suffer from the disease: special effects. Verhoeven, a culminating issue that can bring a huge downturn to the psychological tension of producers, destroys everything focused on special effects, without cursing the true value of the film. I have to admit that the fx was awesome, probably from the Matrix, but it's not enough for the movie to be good. Actually, there are problems with movies today. Like Verhoeven, most managers only pay attention to spectacular scenes - and much more. Exceptions are very small, and Matrix is ​​probably the only film combining fantastic fantastic effects and great structure. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven again disappointed. Instead of the big movie HM cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. Special effects 2. Jokes with Superman and Wonder Woman (I do not break this moment for you) <br /> Okay, went wrong with the movie? Everything. <br /> <br /> This is nothing. <br /> <br /> This is very much anticipated. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> - Very cliches. <br /> Of course, the bad man wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> As each low quality horror, separate the first rule symbols as far as possible. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Example: Initially, Bacon should scan its finger to access the lab. <br /> <br /> - We will not be able to look at some of the things. <br /> Sometimes, the place. Then, Shue and Brolin quietly and slowly leave without looking back. Is it normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, and kills him again. And then Shue shouted "I heard an explosion" (a few minutes ago) and suddenly ran inside. <br /> <br /> Did you hear the explosion a few hours ago? <br /> <br /> - There's a scene that's on the open microphone. <br /> <br /> Mr. Verhoeven, I was expecting more from me! <br /> <br /> So about Hollow Man. A big movie has become a fraud. <br /> <br /> Sound: from 10 to 4 (for special effects)
