Frustration and annoying. The screenwriter does not have the true concept of human nature, but rather combines clich√©s in a similar way. Character depth is not explored. These are the puppets pushed into a dramatic element that confesses to the relationship of the girl with the girl's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid gives her a perfect performance, despite some characteristic situations and errors that are passive to push her into angry daughter's eyes. Screenwriter Darren (Daniel Craig), Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde burns cocaine before the great scene, for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> An authoritative writer could do more with this topic.
