If I had not been forced to look at the workplace, I had not been in the first 10 minutes. And even frequently transmitted through parts. The '63 movie version was pretty good in all relationships. Yes, I've read that this is more loyal to the original game, but it was a good thing to change the script '63 'for the writer! Extremely stretching, dragging, songs in this version and in the movie version are boring and unusual. The 'version' version of '63 'was very funny and was a real classic of parenting humor. In this version, Who is too old, Conrad (though I hate when I shave a shirt from someone ... the director of this version does not know what's sexy). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing the song (it is impossible to remain silent) and simply pushing. Elvis Presley would have been really done before his career started. As for other actors, while waiting for dance, I was waiting for the Alexander topple, and Daly was just like Momma. See the performance of Stapleton in the movie version to see the same role as someone who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a total loss of time.
