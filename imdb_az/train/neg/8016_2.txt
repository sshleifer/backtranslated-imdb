First of all, this movie moves slowly in an unusual way, and we can completely lose the majority of the audience in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the film's theme is a great movie; <br /> <br /> This writer works in the hands of a writer, such as Lanford Wilson, as a mountainous lionlike symbolism. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good script that supports the film, that director, with the same taste and even the same actors (for example, a pupil did not give me a poignant poem), a child had a "strong" however, could offer a meaningful and tactile description of pain and combat at the time of suffering <br /> <br /> However, it is without foundation and armed with an indefinable, boring and not-so-curious script, and no sensitive structure for example, when reviewing it, I believe you will not be able to show climactic scenes and instead, <br /> <br /> "Without a good excuse, we will never be too excited." characters, their trials and difficulties are simply boring and boring <br /> <br /> Without a good structure, dramatic installations and scenarios The freedom of leadership is more surprising and confusing than adapting to the story line, and I do not believe in the creation of Leah, for example, and I think that most audiences were totally surprised by the traditional method of telephone conversations. <br /> <br /> As the film stops, I'm afraid that I will not be able to advise. I will never be able to understand, so a movie, like a movie, is not being re-created by a filmmaker ... it's not all the usual rewards for films that are extremely good in the first issue! It's a good article written by well-known writers, and I think this movie can easily become an unforgettable classic of an age-old aspect of tram-rarely treated men. All the elements that are very tedious and appear in the movie (guys' wand posts, "Leah" scenes, television screen fantasies) are a bit of a "gay" theme I have seen a few comments about people talking about this movie, and I think it's a mistake. Obviously, the "crunch" described here is an old boy who has a newborn boy, but Logan's character is too young to settle any kind of sexuality, and we really see it in his fantasy of masturbation. all kinds of stimulus, sexual and non-sexual, as we would expect from a young man like him. I believe that such women as Logan's are "fractures" among the young men who prefer the sex partners.
