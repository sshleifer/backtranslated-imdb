An offender who has died under Matt Dillon cooks a late-day theft. They escaped, but were quickly rushed to the police station in the hot pursuit of a terrorist. Of course, the police make a mistake for the terrorist robbery, the real terrorists are moving away, and the thieves are forced to flee to a small dip in a bar, taking hostage and not knowing why the police are using them. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Completely. And from there it falls. Spacey has achieved a good moving talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but all of this has wasted. Due to the majority, all the characters claim everything we do for the rest of the movie after staying at the bar. Endlessly and purposeless. Long before the movie ended, you stopped cursing on what happened to you.
