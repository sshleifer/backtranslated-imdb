I've seen this movie a few times (and when I read the film lately), and whenever I see it, I slap the fourth one. Tom Hank's character does not actually have the clue that D & D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he behaves just like character") does not include the game seating. After this and three-month treatment, destroy all of these and give delusions! <br /> <br /> Those who make bad names of RPGs are such behavior. <br /> <br /> Also, the Cornish love ballad and the cats on the piano and stop us if we are very worried. It's almost enough to put your teeth on edge!
