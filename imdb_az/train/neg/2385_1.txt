I watched this movie because I'm a great fan of Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give my brother a try, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry to check this out. It was embarrasing and that's what we wanted to name the movie. Sissy was just strange, and Jellybean sits in a towel lying alone with the old man in the mountains, no matter what? I'm not so happy in my life. It was just a common trash. I do not believe that the actors have agreed to pay for movies, money, time and space. Sissy did not go to being 'wonderful'. I was thinking of everything. He had his thumbs stupid and what could he do on the bus? WHAT IS? 0 to 10, no embarrassing sound, 0 or even 1. Hopefully Rain is better than other films, which means forgiving him for a performance, that is, I will not do anything better with the movie.
