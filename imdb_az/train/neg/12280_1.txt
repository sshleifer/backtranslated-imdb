I've seen one of Denver's stage performances and was less affected. The word "vagina" is all mentioned. Body part. There is no shock here. I can say to my doctor, "My left arm slightly hurt after the tennis" or "Vagina hurts after the bicycle" with more or less social commentary. I could hear "Tricep Monologues" for all the fun and radical comments I have heard. The monologues were bored, but they did a drama, the topics were outdated, and I was bored and disturbed in turn. I think I once laughed, but maybe I did not need it. Surely this is not really a hit. Oh, and spoiler: there was a LESBIAN! - oh, wait, maybe, do not think. And inconvenient fondling! And a Crack Mama! It covers it.
