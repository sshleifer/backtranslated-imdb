The Latvian direction was for Japan, which was a star of the great roles of a woman who had been associated with a Chinese extremist group in 1928, reunited with an old lover of Japan before the Manchurian occupation. Each drama and story of the story is directed by Ye Louun, somnambulist directing style. The characters still look at each other for a long time and do not want to say anything that the hand-held cameras repeat repetitive repetitive repetition of the same reaction on the faces of the continuous reactions over a longer period of time. At the beginning of the story, we do not know anything about the characters, and little new information is given as the story progresses, silent and static images, which interact with silent dances but do not share any emotionally sincere. Many sleep movies.
