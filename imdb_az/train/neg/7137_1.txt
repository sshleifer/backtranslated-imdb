Cars in this movie were awesome. It's a horrible person working in this movie. Field and driving scenes are not very significant and are just as bad. Get rid of the problem and the money when you're upset with movies that shifted and suddenly ridiculed. A good movie for racing fans? Yes, there is a place where they mistakenly refer to a NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can not tell the difference, you can watch it, there will be an explosion. It really comes down, in this movie there is really a really nice car, they are frightened and totally non-realistic. The player is terribly bad because they are pretty bad. If you want to see hot girls, switch on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such nice machines will be represented in such a bad movie. If the car meets the class, it should compete with stainless bikes.
