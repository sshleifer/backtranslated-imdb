Well, I must say that this movie was so bad that if I did not need to consider the case, I would go. The worst part was that, as the newspaper lists were wrong, I saw that they were drifting around the city, paying $ 10 for two times in the park. Vince Vaughn is playing every single guy he has ever played - only once I saw him playing with John Travolta. In any case, it has a characteristic potential - it's been heard in the preface, but it's completely laughable, predictable, with a low scattering point. And they were hoping that the Christmas feast would be a Christmas movie to be saved, and Santa did not need a replacement, but not. Only cool part was a sledgehammer and a small child. I'm sure this movie will be fine for young children, but it's so nude for adults that it's nice to sit.
