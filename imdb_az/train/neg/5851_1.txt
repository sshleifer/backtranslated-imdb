Undoubtedly, even if Jigsaw is hip, the whole LSD theme is a clear attempt to capture the secret of a murder, to capture the young audience of the era without showing the concept of at least sixty conspiracies. Despite its historic background, Jigsaw is experiencing numerous problems, including numerous problems, such as LSD flashbacks, which lasted 60 minutes for the first 60 minutes even after the home shooting. actual intelligence on paper is just a great tool to do so and it is extremely surprising and predictable (very bad TV show does not recall) that the summit is actually an anti-rise. If it were a better movie, we would be able to cope with some of the poverty we enjoy, but the weak side serve to emphasize that it does not look unseen to viewers. I saw Jigsaw on TV, and it was definitely late at night to fill the airport and someone would have to spend some time to kill someone's insomnia, not something that someone should look for. At best, three out of ten.
