For me, the only reason to look at this repetition was to see how bad and funny it is. Since I have seen "Voyna i mir" (1968), I have no doubt that it is funny and bad. Let's get started! We went here ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornelm and Pierre Bezuxov of Brendan Donnison - a liar who does not lose the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - a fright, his description can lead to sleeplessness; Robert Dornhelm and Andrew Bolkonsky of Brendan Donnison - an embodiment of an OK (as mentioned above) as a Russian spirit, and a "fight inside" (as mentioned above); Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a very striking leader; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Prince Bolkonsky - English-speaking tower; <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ span> <br /> <br /> They look and talk. They act like modern EU citizens prepared for a one-day masquerade. All this seems cheap and does not come close to Russian men's and women's standards at the beginning of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Good fun to have fun and entertain. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - In my opinion, there were a few giggles in our office when we recalled today's product and on our television previous night. many young people have never watched our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) or have had a strange feel of the quality of "Tarantino-Spilberg". Our Hussar friend ends, turns around, goes into exile, and goes on a bridge boom? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning and art to create a better version of the novel that has been properly demonstrated once in our country. But it would be happy to watch the remake of the Russian "winds gone". Hey, filmmakers, wake up and deal with it, instead of breaking our classics. <br /> <br /> Now go back to the discretion. On the one hand jokes. <br /> <br /> What I mentioned above is fatal, even exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It is a mistake to make foreign actors who want to go to Russia (when they are connected to very serious epics and dramas), and those who make a movie are doing it again and again. Of course, it leads to numerous laughs - especially Clemence Poesy is ridiculously worried and his dance and singing is a Russian audience: "This is so commanding that funny!"). <br /> <br /> I would like to note the new, pace of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very lightweight. Stories and scenes are not a natural flow - they pop up like a modern video and pop up. Again, I have to remember "Voqne i Mir" which is natural, and the narration is so simple that we simply go back and "go with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought Borodino would have a good fight (in many cases to restore many deficiencies), but there was no match for the battle scenes in 1968. <br /> <br / > It should be a good thing in this movie, and it seems that all the actors are working hard to work, but they have not been able to start from the beginning, but still join the team of "losers." 1 point for misfortune - this is a Russian scene worrying - some scenes <br /> <br /> This is the last part of what I love about this series, which clearly shows how everyone got "salaries and taxes." However, when I look at the film, I thought it would be an adult sex scene that would definitely kill the whole project There is no such trash in fortune. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not a "Harry Potter", and now we, too, here in Russia, do not have enough artists to film properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of my life is getting worse? Fortunately, during the Soviet era a fair film was screened. The American version of the 1950s was somewhat justified - we did not exist yet. <br /> <br /> It is given from 4 points (starting from 1 point, 1 pervasism, and 2 part for the last part.
