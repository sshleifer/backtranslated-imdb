I've seen yesterday's movie and I really like it. The film's expectations have been so far since I heard it was being prepared. For some days, I've seen something awesome and dreamed for a few days. <br /> <br /> Although I was still a fan, this movie had great hopes, but in the end I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I love Richard Donner's films, and sometimes I did not like the nature of nature or the changes they gave to Superman's character and authority. <br /> <br /> Singer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Although Lex Luthor is somewhat dark, he is still a devil, an ant and a common criminals. It's no more clever than Gene Hackman played. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but in the end he is exposed to encrypted writing and improper dialogue. <br /> <br /> Her thieves are even two dimensional than comic bookstores. Most of them do not have a full dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** CLAIMS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost identical to Mrs. Tetmacher. <br /> <br /> Looks like Lex Luthor as bad and cold, but when he sees the submarine, he is content with the swallowing supermen, and proves that Luthor is betrayed in a much-anticipated manner. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Langella, Perry White. Donner was not a big fan over Perry White in the movie, but there was at least one soul. After being told and done a careful veteran reporter about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing more than a corporate stooge. He wants everyone to concentrate on Superman-related stories because they sell the papers despite everyone doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Leyla Luthor's real stories that have come out of prison, the real secrets of the Gypsy and the worst things of Lexel are that DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober, and there is still a downstream stream that allows you to know that the waters are still deeper. <br /> <br /> Frank Langella is grassy. Brandon Routh is a bad player. He, however, still does not have a memorable line in the entire movie. The actor's fault is not. His movements are designed to appear clearly, affecting the way he flies, as the longest of his fingers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Kate Bosworth wrote a strange good way, Lois Lane wrote choreography and artificiality. Unfortunately, for Pulitzer Prize winner journalist and writer, Dawson Creek is strange as any teenager. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor in the movie, mostly Superman, even from Routhdan. Without any super-force, Lois understands Lane's message, flies a plane into the ground, enters Luthor's yacht, and rescues Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> In the film, all trapped cellars and shipwrecked water just like the flood. You see them sinking slowly in the water. You know, Superman is coming to save them at the last moment, but still can not help, but will not feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> I first said that the organization was in a very excitement. Singer says that it's a returning superhero and a movie to find a place in the world. After returning, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is happy to see him repeat. Moreover, it can be one of the most terrible heroes of the universe. A large green part of the meteorite was unable to combine enough points to find out that Lex Luthor had been kidnapped from a prison, had already learned about Superman's powers and weaknesses, and that Luthor would still use kryptonite. <br /> <br /> According to the film, Superman is good only to raise good, really hard things. The sequence of action is incredibly predictable.
