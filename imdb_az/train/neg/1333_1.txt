I'm totally disappointed with this movie. I've read some of the other reviews here and have had better expectations. I was expecting a drama with a more intense character development. But never in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but some reviewers are not as good to convince us here. Repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> The movie was deleted 70 minutes from the DVR. to the film. There are better movies than that ...
