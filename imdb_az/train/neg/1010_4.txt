I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, so it looked encouraging. Justin Timberlake was up to the stage. He is a really bad player and should not be allowed to shoot any more. That is one of the most boring, defective actors I've ever seen. It does not give any feeling to any line. Why did Josh Pollack put his role in paradise? I think Matt Damon would be a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so fragile that it looks like America's beauty at Se7en and a bad mixture of John Doe's character. <br /> <br /> Now Dylan McDermott's player is very good. It's about a very good little thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Although part of life was a little open and exaggerated, it was good. When Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, I was expecting a great twist, but nothing really happened.
