This "bad movie" is a bit attractive for fun fans. It is more appropriate for students of pop culture in the 1970s: a great "female lib" for fashion, furniture, relationships and the fact that it was still renewed and romantic for a self-employed, independent woman in the early 1970s. "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) has improved his career (though not a flight attendant, but a 30 min-foot gurus - it also comes for men), earned money to earn a lot of money, slept with many people, and protected himself and others (with karate) and is not bound to something. "Hot stewardess" was a powerful archetype, because it is a free woman who is threatening the juice of anti-feminists, from the retrograde claims that no woman has ever been married without her husband. <br /> <br /> By the end of the 1960s in 1970s (even about the "The Family of Partridge", I remember that Ruben Kincaid, a shady copper, always stewardesses), and in this regard, this stupid movie against AIDS an important pop culture time capsule, freedom of love, women's clothing, and seventh year. The area is terribly though. There are nude tits for the viewers in the audience.
