If this movie should be renamed, it should be "Hazzard's Jackasses". <br /> <br /> This film is about 88 minutes of punks in two immature countries that have made the joy of dodge Charger known around the city and around the country 1968, but the girls are pursuing and obtaining the law. <br /> <br /> The fans of the "Duke" and the characters you missed the movie are key. Kufr, sexual references, and a large number of drug use have named the "Dukes" a good name for the novel's trash can. <br /> <br /> The player was terrified of the player to compare him with a television show. The only actor who found the right was Dodge Charger, named General Lee in 1969. <br /> <br /> "Dukes" suffered more and more injuries from the 21st Century Hollywood TV screening. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie and get a TV show on DVD. <br /> <br /> My point is: F.
