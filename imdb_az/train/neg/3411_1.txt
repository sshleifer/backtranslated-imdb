Exotic tropical places, babes in exclusive clothes, explosions, beautiful-looking Dudley Do-right clones, his best years behind (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts and sexual villainess (Tracy Lor .... Sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords ) and would be for some escapist fun. Is not it! This is a terrific television movie, and although it wants to introduce itself as the "Charlie's Angels" contract, the original series or even gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent C.A. movies. This disgust is best described as the THYD RATE Andy Sidaris movie. Andy's "Airplane Airplane" is not as enjoyable as anywhere, but some of the battlefields are worthy of it. Girls spend a lot of time trying to look prissy and after a while they become annoying. There are better genre things there. Oh yeah and "babes" are hot as they want to think like. Horrible noise ... when there is.
