The miracle really must accept the truth: I'm like this cheap, cheesy 70th parody. The vast majority of killer tomatoes are a great idea to destroy the United States, and despite the fact that the moovie provides a bit of a decent giggle look of the horrible additions that go away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. This film is one of the previous attempts, as well as Kentucky Fried Moovie, which is very popular in the 80s and 90s, mainly on the plane. It's pretty poor, like moost spoofs. Many attempts at the throat are heartbreaking failures and are very irregular. But thanks to the naughty tomato army, the "Love of Invincibility" song and the cunning helicopter crash scene, the Killer Tomato Attack basically gives some commodities despite wrong reasons. There is something wrong with this movie ... and it's so difficult to tell right. Tons of 2 moore films and a return to a cartoon series should be enjoyed as well as quite people! Most of the time from the tomato is quite boring. And earn over 70 dresses, buddy! ; = 8) This tomato is delicate and striking, but worth a giggle or two; MooCow tells you to catch a pizza and a tomato pop! : ??
