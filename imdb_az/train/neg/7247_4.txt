In a word: this is a romantic comedy of a cookie cutter that TRIES really wants and much to do. Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, want to be The Graduate. She wants to be deep and human. Interesting photography, lighting, music, editing, all of which give a sense of an important movie. Dialogue is clever - sometimes. <br /> <br /> David Schwimmer - Joe's sad sack hanging dog before hanging dog with his jaw lying on the floor empty? <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - he is really here and is not just a chest. His role is supposed to be a lively, beautiful, careless girl who only leads himself to misdiagnosis and, ultimately, is very mixed, and there is no chance that such an immaculate whisker as Schwimmer has. But Gwenneth is very bored. <br /> <br /> (I described another in this role - for example, Kate Hudson). 3. Scenario and plot - what is happening mostly does not contradict truth; At the end of all the problems looks like a whistle wrapped up in such a smooth and neat summer, and the script writer only said, "Oh, there's a train to catch the time to hug it." So they pulled out Hollywood formula books, checked all the boxes, and went home.
