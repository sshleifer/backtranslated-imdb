I was really sorry you were sitting here and watching it. I love independent films, horror films and generally all zombie stuff. But when you add it, a line that has not passed to anyone has passed. Hopefully, people in this movie had a great time to do so, at least not a total loss. Still, we never know it. Script? You're joking. Acting? I think the trees were even fake. Kinematography? Yes, there was a camera there. Period. I do not think there is any realistic planning in this film. I spent a bit more time, so I would not extend it further.
