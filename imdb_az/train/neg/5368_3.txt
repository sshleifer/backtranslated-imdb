Private Practice had to be a medical drama. My biggest complaint is that there is no originality in the medical storyline. Having watched the house, we "solved" the medical secrets of two "doctors" ("the ninth") before doctors. Boooring. Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why do not you copy some of the old ep episodes or some swallowing Brazilian soaps? <br /> <br /> The second biggest complaint is that these people will be forty, but if they were alright? Why are the 15-year-olds forced to act with emotional agility? It's really three weeks to really realize that your best friend does not want to be your "friend of affection" is really a must-have for three weeks, perhaps you want to endanger your friendship, not because you do not want to hurt you? <br /> <br /> The nature of all the thoughts is psychiatric in this way - the storyline is unrealistic because you can not really get the "drama". What is the show we know in Gray Anatomy for Addison that everyone loves ... Even on the one hand, I do not think it's funny how it ends lusting after Addison's losing Pete (Sorry, but everybody trying to cure Is anyone losing one of the insomnia with Mozart's Requiem, a doctor or not) and Derek ends wandering away in contact with the miserable, away from Meredith Mile in Seattle? Apart from jumping very little with Mark, they seemed perfect for each other. Sometimes, I think, Shonda is trying to say that Rhimes's subconscious relationship is often the right choice ...
