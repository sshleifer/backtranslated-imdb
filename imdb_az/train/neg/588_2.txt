By reviewing this IMAX feature, I have to write as a way to keep your money on others. Almost any episode from Desmond Morris's "The Human Animal" or David Suzuki's "Nature's Nature" could have improved the materials presented. In addition to the IMAX's incredible 65-70 mm movie stock and giant presentation screen, each part of the screen is extremely unimpressive considering the previously mentioned programming capability. Viewers get acquainted with pregnant Heather, his wife Buster and his nephew and nephew. We eat them, sweat, listen to music, and so on. We look at about forty-one minutes. We go to the scenes in the human digestive tract and study the natural diving reflexes of babies, although we learn more about the most graduated alumni? Have you ever even enjoyed the transatlantic Heather? Are we taking care? Avoid all movies. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I paint a beautiful picture of "India: Tiger Kingdom" or technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
