I'm sorry to make this movie 90 minutes of my life, I regret that I'll never go back. The stage is really interesting - in fact, it's a zombie squeaking from the perspective of these songs. Unfortunately, it does not succeed in giving an attractive story in this context. An almost unbearable mix of life-oriented characters can add to the reality of the film, but it performs all the entertainment values ​​a bit more to the audience they would be more likely to go home to social commentaries.
