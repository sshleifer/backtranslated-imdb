I bought the "Bogeyman" DVD and this was a feature added to the stunker. I think it was Boogeyman II, because it was originally linked. But you know that they say "accept": "u" and "me" is "donkey". I read BII before taking a look at the original movie and looking at the actress's lover. While watching "Boogeyman's Return", I decided to move away from the original images to see the toothbrush scene with the death-dealing death. I knew, the movie was over. Disassemble. I think this was BII, because there is one similarity to BII's alternative names. Well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Refuse to talk about my mistakes and talk about the movie's mistakes. Too many, many mistakes. Who is this boy Ulli? He really thinks the same film will sell in different ways. There is nothing original that holds the third part of the party. In fact, as it's all, it's an original flashback with a psychic look that gives us a frightening awesome play-by-play. This is a movie. Oh, and a stereo scene of a death, but you can read it from someone else's review. My interest to Boogeyman II is endless. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to come back.
