Since Don Wilson has been using martial arts to abandon a programmable robot to destroy him, he has also married a blonde correspondent (Stacie Foster) in the first film, now a new conspiracy that unites two heroes and dominates the world. an organization that wishes (this is no trick to rebuild anything) and Cyber ​​Tracker 2 becomes the virtual replay of the first movie. I acknowledge that I have received DVD from the bargain booth prepared by the Prime Minister, a company that specializes in cheap jack action flicks, which means that the PM has more than a few bursts of explosions, small story, and nothing at all. Some of these names are soft (Good Man and Swimmer), but Cyber ​​Tracker 2 is stuck with the Don Wilson casting. Compared with the heroes of PM's efforts at that time, Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees compared to Don Wilson. Another explanatory mark was directed by Richard Pepin, who appears to have worked in an activity segment with much more expensive feelings than that of Joseph Merhi, who owns this directorship. Even though C. Thomas and Wincott are both more expensive to get. Richard Pepin's sense of personality pedophile materia is still intellectual ideas, and that if Cyber ​​Tracker 2 is a rip off with Capitol R, it's almost a lot of stealing for better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier, even Halloween III!) or at least the uninhabited accessory, Cyber ​​Tracker 2 falls flat. A player who has not been borrowed and supported by a better movie has no great advantage. The only exception is from Tony Burton, a good mile. Stacie Foster seems to be better than a good material. But Cyber ​​Tracker 2 is noisy, gentle and irresistible, but without any real battlefield to retreat, it's all over, there are plenty of cars to break down and bankrupt. <br /> <br /> <strong>
