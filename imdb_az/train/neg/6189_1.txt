I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my friend who loves the version that was broadcast on television. But the DVD version was a disaster. Lighting was non-existent and all scenes were simply excised. In a situation, Adele is set to go to bed, and we immediately fall into another area - the average penalty - to the next night. <br /> <br /> The characters like Grace Poole and Mason have never been presented and they do not want to be filmed for a few moments. <br /> <br /> The DVD we have seen is made up of Platinum Disc Corp and even if you're <br /> Watch out for what version of this movie you've purchased! We send this one back.
