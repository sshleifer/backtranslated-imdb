What else can I say about "I do not see it" about this movie? I waited for something (or something) to happen, and I waited and waited and did not come alone. Watch a strange look around two people while recording a record for most screen fulls in a movie. What are they doing? Do they solve a mystery? Do they collect tips? It is difficult to say, it is possible. At the end of the movie, after decoding of many radio signals (some kind of illegal PET monitor), this person gives some lectures, the plot finally emerges and is removed as soon as possible. Some foreigners want to return to their home utopia and are happy to want to blow up the earth (I do not think they love the exchange of wealth). My guess was over, and they saw their 35-minute work or art (trash!) And decided to turn the editorial staff into a 88-minute feature film. Look at your own danger, not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
