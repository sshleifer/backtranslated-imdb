I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park. First of all, I want to say that this is a good thing behind the film and the creation of the Amber Alert system. But the film itself is also weak, and the player was terrified. The biggest problem with the film was Nichole Timmons and his father, Glenn Park, for the second time. Events covering this part of the story are not entirely accurate. My father suffered from mental illness at that time and Nichollo did not do anything with no intention. She loved him as a girl and was in the mentality that she believed that she was from my mother's mother who rescued her or saved her indifference and generally raised her to raise her mother. In the film, my father described some of the ways in which it would damage the shape or shape. The smile is that Nichole sometimes spent many nights in my ancestors' place, and Sharon worked or did what he did. At the beginning of my father's violence, the reason was that he could have weapons on his truck. My father was in a panoramic view. The things they saw as weapons were the landscapes that he always had to work with his truck. My advice is to film this film with a sliced ​​grain, a good story, and based on real events, the details of the film (at least Nichol Timmons - Glenn Park part) are largely inaccurate and describe the director's failure. Finding the Truth About Explaining The Story I smile, if the director had met with friends who knew the condition of Sharon, they would have clearly stated what I wrote here.
