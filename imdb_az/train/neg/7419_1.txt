This movie was terrible and an insult to the audience. Stupid script, bad cast, infinite boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the US government is always bad. The Communist-sympathetic, most of Hollywood, likewise likes Eugene McCarthy as a rock-paper, and describes him as the leader of the great movement. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he was considered an outsider character who exploited a legitimate concern for the political interests of the Soviet Communists. <br /> Yes, the United States has brought all these bad Nazis. Like Werner Von Braun, we would not have a place in the program. She really loved to be America and has become a great wealth to the country. <br /> <br /> And still in mockery, Hollywood believes that a lot of people who have lived in fantasy have to be ruled by the government, yet they still have to handle everything. and give us everything we want. But it is still a film that is often described as a bad filth in movies.
