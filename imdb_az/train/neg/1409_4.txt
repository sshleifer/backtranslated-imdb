In my opinion, it is not really a spoiler, but I wanted to cover myself. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the viewer to appear in less than 10 elements, or less, with intentional injection in many films, but not just mentor / all - subject. He plays an alternative universe, a semi-wash of real Morgan Freeman. She is researching the role of a child coming from Brentwood to Carson, CA in an old Econovan. Why Carson, this is a mystery. Cal residents. He would have rescued the trips and went to any place in the San Fernando valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is a great place to watch a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, who is the ultimate source of Moragn Freeman's research, which plays a giant grocery inspection on a giant but slow local market. His character is only known as "Himself" because when the actors encounter average people in real life - "Psst, it, its," and so on. "Unfortunately, unfortunately, he had the wisdom to keep all my secular wisdom and his home in Brentwood, no money or debit card, or a pocket phone with him. , then I should not see a strange and strange force and a strange and mighty power in which nothing is really happening, but when it's replaced with one another, it's playing with the idea of ​​adultery, but then this idea fizzles. It did not look like Steve Martyn's Shopgirl without sex, he was pleased with Freeman and did not believe the audience.
