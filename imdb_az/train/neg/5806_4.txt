In fact, nowhere is original. It is a very clear picture without bringing anything new to the story. But leadership is very weak. Basinger is weak - without good guidance. Baldwin is just the second league in comparison with McQueen. I was a great fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I watched him from the interest and took what I thought. Almost B film, which operates and manages the second degree. Not even surprised, I do not know what to do. <br /> <br /> This is not a really good actor at that time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of a beautiful photo. br> <br /> This is a complete loss of time. Save yourself for 2 hours or watch the original (again :))
