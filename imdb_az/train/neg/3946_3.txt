I've read Blaise, also novels and books of misery, and he's really a hero for me. Although Quentin was not a big fan of Tarantino, a few years ago he was interested to hear that he was thinking about filming: could he give a modest healing of humility finally? A few months ago, I heard "Humble Humility" and checked the stars given here, and my favorite characters were not surprising that the score was not too high because the fans were often overwhelmed by difficult moments. The heart is not exactly right. So, I did not read any reviews and decided not to see the movie, and I watched it in a good way, and I was very surprised and strange, yes, it's strange. <br /> <br /> It simply and frustrated that an hour had passed to a filmmaker or a movie that did not have anything to give to a Blaise-character movie. I'm less and less professional about this movie, though I have to admit that I've seen some actors in other films before, but I can not blame them wherever they are. But the scenario and guidance ... God, why such a crap with such production prices is a bit bigger than your average TV movie but worse? I do not know the background of this movie and I really do not really want to know it, but we can not help just wondering how Torantino will be in a straightforward face, he loves modesty and then puts his name on, he has lost a lot of respect in my eyes. Leader was not the right person for this job, and I would like to thank him for destroying the night. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 3 stars, and these stars can have actors and technical qualities. worse than ever. Missing remaining seven star is that this movie is not good. Well, I hope, at some point, that the Modesty Blaise will be a serious production, which has some other purpose. Though people like Tarantino make decisions that I did not hold onto my breath.
