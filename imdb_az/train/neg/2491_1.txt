My daughter is just Voyage. Immediately I would like to say that I watched 5 thousand out of it and did not stop now. As mentioned in another statement, this film does not fall into all bad, it's good, it's just bad. The player is strange, sfx is poor and the story is mild and stupid. <br /> <br /> Do not enjoy watching this movie, just something special about it, at least not something. No matter how low your expectations are, you'll still be disappointed.
