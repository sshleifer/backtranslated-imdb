<br /> <br /> I read Ben Mezrich a few years ago, and last night I accidentally came to see this match. <br /> <br /> Even after years of reading the story for the first time, the novel and movie are enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> If you have interesting things, go and get your novel. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
