This is a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". Sound correction is pretty bad. Listen to the set dialogue and at the same time you hear a sound booth! An amateur film shot from Boston and filmed around New Hampshire. Living in New Engnald and reading this comment will be wowed by the capital W. This movie is full of flaws. You heard the director voicing the voice and giving directions to the actress. "Stand up now." As for other symbols. There is a voice and this man who speaks with the mind instead of this blue wildlife. The wild man speaks in a deep voice. Hear the voice of the player when he yawning or grunting in battle. As for special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early job of crying loudly! The creatures are good, but the animation is indestructible. It's definitely unbreakable. It began to work like Karl Zeman (1955). Special effects are creative. Thge music is good. In the lower line, this movie resembles the EQUINOX or PLANET of the EINSIN'S DINOSAURES by Ray Harryhausen's epic. Did you know that MISTEROUS PLANET was a home movie and was a shoe string budget? We should look for a post-graduate filmmaker.
