This film is a good example of Jerry Bruckheimer's best-selling since 1997 - a film that was shot a year ago without leaving the film, not a good quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this movie could have been predicted as it came from. Every attempt at a joke, an attempt at every moment of touches and a love story in a love story was what I foresaw in my mind. Give yourself a blessing and save your money in this way.
