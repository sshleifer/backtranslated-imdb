I'm sure that this is "WOAH!" In 1982, Epcot opened its doors, but now it is a disaster. The film's message is clich√©. "Circle-Vision" is disorienting. And in the end it's grating the horrible song. I would also like to place seats on them. After a long ride, sit for a few minutes. There is a movie that you see is a pretty glamorous sound! Do you enjoy sitting, right? Lying! You stand there for a short couch in 18 + minutes. Disney should take the attraction as a new Maelstrom to attract and replace this dull, dingy movie. Not FUN. Jump. In fact, if you eat there, skip Canada completely. Direct to the United Kingdom.
