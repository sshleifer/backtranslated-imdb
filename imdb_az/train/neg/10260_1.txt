This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the movie for about a 5 minutes and knew it was a bomb. The player was bad and there was no space. The monsters were soooooo fake. mouth does not move. Why can they have a doctor who plays xylophone to kill their monster? You just do not spend your bad time. (1 out of 10)
