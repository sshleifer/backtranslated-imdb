I watched this movie for 45 minutes and evaluated 9 pesos. Every 5 minutes is a kefalandÄ±r. Seriously, though, it proves that this film works. If you do not break it, you do not need a fixin. A master of the ex-cop martial arts fortified with a serial killer with a streetwise-yet sensitive heroine, golden heart and "issues". Pure magic.
