I will keep it as soon as possible. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made by Schnaas' s other horrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. ZOMBIE has managed to sit at DOOM a bit (but ...), but ZOMBIE 90 is so extreme - I have to put everything in the first 10 minutes, compared with Schnaas's other horrible movie. ZERO's acting skills, spectacular, terrific camera style camera work, ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on. I really can not find anything about this trash - I usually find it to be used in any movie. This is really one of the worst films you have ever warned ... 1/10
