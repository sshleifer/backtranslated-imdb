Whatever it is, Guy Ritchie is rebuilt for the Wertmuller movie. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. When I saw one person in the audience, he left about an hour. <br /> <br /> For the reason I did not go beyond this movie, it was the only reason I continued until the end. <br /> <br /> But I sat on this piece that Madonna Ritchie might think of a really good movie. The dialogue is laughable, it's a moving player, and it's just a beautiful scene in this movie. Ritchie drew Lina's film and made another "Blue Lake". <br /> <br /> Cinemax is a movie that will not waste time, though late. Time is so valuable to bend.
