When I saw this weekend at the Palm Springs Film Fest, I did not expect much. It is an alternative choice when the other two films are sold. I still hope. It was a bit like the "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. boy, a Indian beauty, parental failure, blah blah blah). B & P is not perfect but it was a pleasing movie with pleasant laughs and unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Revolution" did not have any of these. The actor stilted and looked at the numbers. The story was such a clich√© that the story could have been written by a high school first-year student. Technically, I was disturbed by the sound. The conversation seemed to have a dubbing of many dialogues. I mean a lot. Sometimes I know it is necessary, but half of the film was filmed with a glass and was very fun. <br /> Two stars are somewhat generous.
