If you see other movies, they are better. Omega Man comes to mind. According to the credit of the studio, they went away from the extensive, unnecessary, big budget technology that illuminated these first films. In addition, construction and layout were excellent: four people who did not belong to our past are trying to get away from a major infectious deadly disease. What a bad thing, everything else! In a film, I was tired of an infinite stupid, careless, weak, ineffective, arrogant character. Everyone in the film describes quite a few things at one point. I rented him and we screamed on TV many times. "No, do not do it!", "Why are you so lucky?", "Wait" and so on. A real lack of character development is understood from half. A movie should have a strong personal relationship with at least one of the characters, so be careful what's happening. This is not the case. Also, the more involvement of the film was longer.
