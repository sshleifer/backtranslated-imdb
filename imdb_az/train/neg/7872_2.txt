Everyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! Gives you information about each bug in order not to correct the movie! My dad may have done a lot better! But this is not the only reason why the film is really bad! (It's really bad that it is impossible to write a dishonest sentence!) The first episode of Les Visiteurs is a very good family comedy, along with comic jokes and prayer dialogues, and then the receipt of the receipt. The assumed parts were counted on one hand and perhaps half. Clavier plays more role than he does in the first part, Robin tries to act like Lemmercier (he replaces it), but this is "grotesque." Lemercier Lemercier, Robin Robin! Even though Muriel Robin is funny on the stage, he is not in this movie because he does not act like that. I know that it is difficult to replace someone who is good in one role (Lemercier has won the Cesar award for his role in the first film), but he made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, played the role of Lemmercier! As for the story, it's a lot! Of course, we knew that it would be the end of the first movie, but Poiré and Clavier had to try to write a more simple story like the first episode. Gags repeat, child and déjà-vu. No, you really do not have more than 3 funny pieces. Only good things can be suits and some special effects. So there are only two reasons to follow: 1) how to make a movie; 2) if you want to spend your time or if you really need a brainstorm! 2/10
