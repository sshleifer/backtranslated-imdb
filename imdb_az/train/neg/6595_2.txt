I put these players in the hotel room to entertain us in the morning to go home because I packed all my toys. (Toddlers do not want to watch "Regis and Katie Lee" or "Appearance"). A four-year-old scene was funny, but the rest was "very stupid". It is a nation for the fourth year. <br /> <br /> It was like telling the Holocaust that it was a little wrong to say that this movie was bad. There is no really laughable and absolutely terrible word in this "movie". The player is bad, the basket is stupid, and the script is incomplete. This is a comedy, so you can even laugh at the filthy picture. Bronson's "Maybe" Pinchot, the worst with some strange fake accents (Irish-Pakistan-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun I can say), but all the characters are terrifying. I have not actually watched the Laurel and Hardy movies, but I'm able to get a better way out of them. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: derivative debris. Avoid any price unless you have some strange Bronson Pinchot fetch. 2/10
