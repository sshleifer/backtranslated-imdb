Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how it came with this movie! After 11 years, the idea of ​​giving the situation and the views of the American Society are hopeful, bringing it to 2. But this is not a movie. The best one is a good idea (the collision in the West) and there are important things happening in the Middle East, and it is given on the screen of the MAC * with the fingers of the Amerian Daughter, who is really stupid (only ignorant of the facts) .Notes are the best thing to do with religion The idea is a bit funny for me. On the last scene, Lana says that she is just calm and trying to listen. And the background music says, "I pray ... I do not really belong to religion but it ends. It does not want anyone to see it. "ps:" My home is not a place. People "The only thing that comes from 10 to 10 is the sentence, but it is spent behind this movie (By the way, America's best young people like" someone "are not good, they are only" poor "and" good " the "desperate" people who are part of the army that needs it.)
