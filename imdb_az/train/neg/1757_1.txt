Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. <br /> <br /> <strong> Dan was a gold medalist at sea Olympics. <br /> <br /> But Bill Corcoran puzzled such a bad film about the incredible Dan Jansen story. The story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! In particular, when you look at this movie in the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, Matt Keeslar and other actresses are skateboard, their technique, the dimensions of the accelerating oval, are all wrong! <br /> <br /> Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen is better, better! <br /> <br /> From 1 to 10
