This movie is the best mediocre. Angie Harmon is funny as a bag. In a failed attempt to comedy, he has his own treacherous behavior from the Law and Order. Charlie Sheen is the only thing in this terrible anti-comedy without injury. The only positive thing to get out of this confusion is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. Hopefully, this effort will produce better results.
