The story of this movie is bad enough, it can happen in real life. When I see this bad movie, I do not quite understand. I have a reason because I say bad. 1. If Madonna is rich and she can do everything she wants, then why does she fall in love with this bad person? 2. How vulnerable is the story script? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < </ STRONG> </ STRONG>
