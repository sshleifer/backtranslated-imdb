This movie was pretty absurd. There was a very interesting team. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I remember that goes to the inside of the film. I thought it looked a little too busy to be a funny boy I was cooked. I did not understand how much of a millionaire he still is and how fools he is. Anyway, I love Ben Affleck. Some shit, but I can forgive him. I do not mean that I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli had all the sins, I love him at all. <br /> <br /> My advice was to escape this craze. Indeed, an employer did not develop in the structure, and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy G. could not be used. They are better. Generally, this movie is not a single home, but a Christmas story, its NOT holiday or other classics. Forever Forgotten.
