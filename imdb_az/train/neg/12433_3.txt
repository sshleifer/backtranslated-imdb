I like to keep my review short and simple, but it's pretty much. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, including the ability to direct Chris Columbus, you can not eat the original two. <br /> <br /> This film was a terrifying film that was even more horrific. <br /> <br /> Even I do not believe these guys are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Sitting and watching is painful. Storyline was a complete joke about a hidden chip and neat research to come back on Russian terrorists. Rent one of the awesome, original tractor and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The film was not identified as Christmas at the time of the original. Home Alone is an excellent Christmas time family comedy film has turned into a joke with no morality or space!
