I'm 10 years old, I have not. It's a movie, after a plot, and / or a pretty tough time. If someone tells you a comedy, do not be fooled, about 98% are single-drama and 2% comedy. While all actors have had a great performance, they can not be denied, but they really lost something in one place. I do not know if the original script is good and should be lowered or adjusted. It had the potential and instead it was a flop. I really want to have an hour and a half in this movie, but the video returns on time. Keep your money and see something else.
