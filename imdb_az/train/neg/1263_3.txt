There is nothing like watching giant robots fighting in a deserted desert and delivering Robot Wars. Of course, the player is very bad, the dialogue is small and the characters are of one size, but there are huge robots! Special effects are good for themselves. They are, of course, not polished as today's standards, but at least they contain computer graphics and instead use miniatures, so they are very well aged. The shortfall of short movies is not easily taken into account, and it has some kind of language-cheeky humor in the most unpleasant parts. I encourage you to encourage those who are proud of a huge robot or jealousy fantasy.
