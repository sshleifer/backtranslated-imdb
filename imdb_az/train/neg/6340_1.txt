The type of movie I'm most scared of. An arrogant and irresponsible, a sketch of the Colombian conflict, which is an insult to all Colombians. The performances show that Grisales (his naked scene is completely miserable), Bejarano, Fanny Mickey (who survives a timid fear of Tim Burton), Díaz, has made a lot of effort to bring a life into a life - Disinfection, so written for all to write cliched and evil it is a mustache. No, I'm not talking about ending, Ed Wood is a modest festi that he would do. Jorge Alí Triana has always been a very bad filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. In all ways, cinematography, art direction, suits, makeup, editor and most often fail. I can not say anything better than this money, except for the hope that Colombian directors will learn a lesson about honesty, integrity, and responsibility from this anticipated fiasco.
