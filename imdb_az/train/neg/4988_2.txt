In short, Time Corridors is a success story because the film reaches its target: thousands can be seen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Strong> France, an average-aged knight and his nearly barbaric lifestyle. Due to the proud, old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he is honorable. Then comes later. <br /> <br /> First of all, Les Visiteurs' great success no one intended. <br /> <br /> According to the "General Times", Les Correors of Time did not have a film expert to make money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and for a while, paradoxically, there were a few additional scholarships. Description: Jacquouille has no use to get stolen jewelry back; Does this beautiful red brilliant and expensive car he remembers at the end of the first episode? Where do you think you are earning money? It sells jewelry ... And this is just one of many holes, Poiré, trying to prevent ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Just look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's a bit boring. When it comes to Frenegonda ... another story: Valérie Lemmercier decided not to reconcile himself later in the role of bourgeois roles. And Muriel Robin was trying to imitate him in a way that I found so painful for him, and I felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that it's not a cast of humorists to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about time missions, concentrate on digital effects, story, and see <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie for young people, say, to the age of 13.
