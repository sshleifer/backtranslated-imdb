This film (along with Rinne) is the smallest stones between HorrorFest 8FTDF and the strange dignified pics that have so far turned into horror films. And yes, a really striking definition. <br /> <br /> Because the atmospheric atmosphere is not worse than cinematics who think of substituting for a sequential plot. <br /> This film is almost entirely produced by the director. Of course, it would have been nice to transfer the film to the movie, but it came to replace it. There is a very nice movie with a few real fears, but for the crowd of cineaste, the last crunch latte.
