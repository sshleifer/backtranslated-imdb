Believe it or not, I have my very own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought for Walgreens for a great whole dollar. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not sure it was a dollar worth a dollar or a dollar foolishly. Pretty beautiful set of designs and clothing. As you can see, many thoughts and efforts have begun to be prepared. Set designs are very stylistic with Mexico. I really liked them. And Santa makes a lot of impact. <br /> <br /> I guess the original purpose and purpose of this movie may be something striking and entertaining for a child's viewer. However, in some way, this is pretty foolish. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is dubbing in English, it seems very unsettling and surprising. One of the reasons I prefer to live in the original language and using the English subtitles as dubbing often brings unexpected surprises. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the hell at hell should spend their free time dancing? The children's voices were dubbed at least with actual child voices. ballet in tall Are not you I did not do it until I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Now this is a jerk. I can not recommend to anyone in my conscience, because it is strangely uncomfortable. But his unexpected oddity is something that is worth watching. Decide what to do. For myself, for myself, it felt uncomfortable seeing the devils who have always been the boldest actors of the ballet. Now this is not wrong.
