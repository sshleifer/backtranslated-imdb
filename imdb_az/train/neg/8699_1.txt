Carnosaur 3 is bad ... very bad. It's strange to the point where it is strange. Although I'm trying to convince myself, I do not believe anyone in this world can find this fun reason for a serious reason. So come, even the veil is bad! Okay, the special effect is absolutely funny. The "Carnosaurs" are really ridiculous. A scientist says that the soldiers are moving incredibly fast, but you see them fast ... an actor in a rubber suit, trying to work as far as possible. Explosions are funny (there is no other word to describe). Initially a bullet hit a JIP, a child "What was it?" He says ... Other explosions also laugh. But the worst thing is the scenario and the so-called story. You do not expect a good story (or anyone who rents this movie does not expect a good movie), but at least the story should try to be meaningful. It is almost as difficult to kill people at least consistently, making a story about dinosaurs. It's incredibly difficult when you look at it. Oh, and if you think it's easy to make convincing commands like this one, tell the writers of this terrible, terrible piece of trouble. I would like to say that one of the sick people will make cheap jokes after one of his friends dies? Most of them do this. And if you think that the dinosaurs can be at least motion-filled about the movie that soldiers have killed, WAKE UP! This movie is incredibly boring. Attack on Carnosaurs (this naked name has probably invented?) (Do not see a lot of boring moving sequences). Soldiers think about how to beat them (very difficult, but not even a second can be persuaded). So they attack carnosaurs, but their thoughts do not work (another funny action sequence). Another ridiculous scene planning (a few dumb spots). And it goes on, and over, and. And do not forget the player who is convincing as special effects ... and the story ... Oh, OK, this movie just comes from A to Z. <br /> <br />
