I could not decide whether this film was good, or to quit Enid Coleslaw, "it's so good and it's back again." No matter, I have been forced to look at a spark of a strange vomiting of the same way, and even offers a number of scenes that you will not forget even if you do not want to. There is a young, young Ray Liotta who describes her creative writing cup as a pigtailed Pia that resembles a penis. A little later, Ray again turned to Pia, not a cup shaped, but a bond hose. There is a company that Pia tells Ray's geezer father, Domineering, who wants to go to bed with Walter. There is an actress in the cemetery hanging on Pia or the best line written by everyone: "WWWWHHHHYYYYYY!" Because Walter shakes this Pia's face and bumps, he again has the garden hose "Do you like it more?" The salad, when Pia and her date approached each other and tore apart each other's clothes, made it ridiculous. There is a Pia shower, but do not forget to forget about your clothes. Perhaps the best thing is that Pia has a typewriter, but instead of the buttons, they say miniatures after the most troublesome (and then afraid to open my laptop). Finally, at The Pia, Hollywood did not spit on this cesspool, nor did it spin its second best line. "I'm sure I'm not alone, and I'm not alone." "I've spent a lot of time commenting on the" The Lonely Lady "for better pictures." Be aware, though, when you start waiting, after losing two hours of your life forever you will not be able to grab your eyes on the screen.
