I do not want to go to prostitution, but ..... this is the worst I've ever seen. Worse than Avengers. Insufficient handling, disjointed writing and horrific actions are all consistent elements. Very cheap video shot, looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a Sun-Gun. The sound is better than a microphone on the camera, but everything about it is just scary. The soil happens in a strange way without any major or subsequent resolution, the techie elements appear patently absurd and worse than the rough cut. Not bad enough to be funny. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00 debt.
