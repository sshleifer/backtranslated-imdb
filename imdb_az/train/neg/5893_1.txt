This movie was a great fantasy film, horrible as hell. and I have this pulse and IT and Omen etc. means that you have to endure the right of a knife, which means you are confused with a great movie like that? RIGHT! These films were disappointing. It means that a ghost is back in a chick house and now I think that's what I call it and it thinks it's the right time. right? wrong my ass! I do not think the Spirit is Satan, it does not happen. His film is, but the worst movies or similar movies are praiseworthy, but they have not done so. only showed us what I was saying and people do not think about it. Can anyone ask me why you do not see the pernicious part of all this? The movie ended up in the hospital for me, and that's all. Check your donkey stroke on Number 3
