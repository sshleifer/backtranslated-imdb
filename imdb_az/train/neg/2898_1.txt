Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, finally finished watching this terrible movie! I wanted to delete him for 10 minutes, but I thought he would give me a chance to get a good result. Or at least I think of at least a movie of the kind, or a really good or very good film, or some of the abilities that I thought would be something ... It took half an hour of my life frustrated. Why am I not going to be terrified, because I can tell that this loss of my time could be "spoilers" ... IMDb, spoiler thing to be calm and be careful that movie grade and commentary write good reviews or take on movies or something else is not. I thought it would be very joking to see the price would be bad after this horrible film and I was shocked to see enough high ratings ... all 7-10 stars star ratings should clearly be different ... I'm still a big IMDb fan , but this should be rated higher than maaaybbbeee as 3 of this movie, because seriously consider reconsidering this rating process.
