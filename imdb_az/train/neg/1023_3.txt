LL Cool J performed better than I expected in this movie! He has done an incredible job as a "denied" police officer within a "unreliable" department. From the very beginning, it has done a great job to create a tracking empathy for her character and the difficulty she is in. A rude foreigner can be scared, yet open to the heart of the "giant giant" from the very beginning to the right place - and does an incredible job. <br /> <br /> It was a performance that Morgan Freeman could not get any award. This film was, of course, a step after the scenario films like Shawshank Redemption. His role in Edison simply did not allow her to show her real talent as an actress - she put her in a modest rear hinge in terms of the meeting. His character (Musa Ashford) may have played a major role. He was not disappointed and did not become empty. <br /> <br /> Timberlake remained in the music industry. The description of a young journalist was weak and unacceptable. This movie (at least in the first place) is a typical motion film that has been similar to that of LA in the past to break the police work. As it's a motion film, there are shooting-up-up scenes, blood and gut share. These scenes can usually be predicted in an unreal and painful way. While watching the movie, there is very little tension in the end - think about what you expect from a good cop / bad-cop and usually look a little like the REAL police. <br /> <br /> What hated me the most was how Timberlake's character behaved during shooting scenes. It starts with a weapon and does not use them. When he finally gets around to using it, he turns off all his life as a weapon of fire. Then he runs away from bullets and does not have the weapon - after 30 seconds, without moving or doing anything - there are more fully loaded weapons and more weapons? </ p> <p> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTOSESSION </ font> </ font> </ font> Personally, it's not important for me, as long as the movie's MIX is realistic. Do not believe that life is the truth. The story was so strange that I was very pleased.
