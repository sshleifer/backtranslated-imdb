I saw this movie on a Westernbound American Airlines flight. This was really bad, as the flight lasted longer. The arson had potential (who did not like a movie about a woman who accidentally killed an Elvis's wife), but actually spent a million different time with bad writing. Until the time a group of Elvis emperors is thinking of a return to the throne of a gambling thinking on the roof of a casino, then a group of stars moves together to create an "Elvis" constellation, which instantly strikes a bolt in the emperor's lightning, . Yes ... It's really bad. What is the theme of the entire movie? I will not pay all these expenses.
