City girl Meg Tilly gets a horrifying phone call from her mother and, apparently, shakes, when she returns to the countryside's village, it is only a mystery: why do all the residents move in strange and disturbing ways? Radiation trilogy, despite the hatefulness of the ecology, residents of a small town went to Berserk, two women looking at each other with their desires, and a combination of Tim Matthews (laughably) who spoke to a girl sitting in an office. The picture is too silly for words, Tilly's insomnia and frustration make it difficult for her to quit, so she can not hope to go out. Although some of kinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is a good (especially a fire sequence inside the garage), he is down by rectangular editing and pretty bathetic finale. The simplistic scenario is somewhat of a surprise or an original part of your arm. * From 1/2
