This movie was great, not very good. <br /> <br /> Mormon tells a story that reflects the style and style of the Singles Ward, directing the lives of a young, divorced man to his single life. Comedy similar to the Ferris Bueller Day in the 1980s. However, there are similarities. "Ferris Bueller" is exactly the opposite of "Singles Ward" when it's funny, original and good (as far as so-called comedies). It's very difficult to be funny.
