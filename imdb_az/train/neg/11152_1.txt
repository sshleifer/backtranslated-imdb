If you have great movies to see, why not worry about this movie? This is the total loss of time and money. The film is so bad that I'm bad for those who want to watch it. Everything is OK. Players were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. Only good moments are the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. An interesting thing is that we want to die, because it's so stupid that we can get enough. (I do not remember my name, it was a mistake of the "Selected One"). /> <br /> Note: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is the right choice. 10 to 0-Stars
