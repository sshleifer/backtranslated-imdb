I would like to love this movie. How can I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. But Suzy Parker's train crash broke all the experience for me. Her player was terrible for me because I was sitting with my open jaw, which did not believe in my eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous and beautiful dramatic form, says Qafqazinfo.az. Jayne? Having a nice, cheerful and clear ball. When Suzi Parker sees her trying to talk to a ladder from a tree, a dead, a cluelessness, San Francisco's city is captivated by all striking, retro elegance. it simply opposes belief. Can he give this creature ACT? Month VEY, people.
