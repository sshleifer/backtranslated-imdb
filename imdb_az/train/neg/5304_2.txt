I'm out of a movie based on source material and I'm not one of those who automatically say "Book is better". I know better than reducing the cost of film because it's not a good fit. Sometimes there are long and many decisions that are under the control of the director / editor / cinematographer / producer and, of course, to shoot a film that is under the control of the original author. It is therefore unreasonable to expect a movie to be a word, word, a book or game or video game or a Disneyland Ride or anything! A movie should be evaluated for its standard and how it is compatible with society. Moreover, a successful film should be taken because the material belongs to the society in which it belongs, and if it is based on source material, its importance should be re-examined and developed by film artists. <br /> <br /> The films like blood after such a paradigm are based on a book written in the turn of the century, in the case of Oil, Iraq, war and energy. The film originated in the United States, and it happened. <br /> <br /> Even King Kong, based on the original film, takes advantage of new technology and human rights concerns about animal rights. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I do not understand why you're worried about this movie. Along with great performances, guaranteed Oscar nodes and Shane's directors / writers will receive the rights and royalties, which will not come from anywhere. It should have just been a game. The film (actually the same as the game) is a film, punished sexual harassment and, in many cases, covered by the Catholic Church here and abroad. No new or different from the original game. It is also not possible to help another movie, which was shot at the same time: Frost / Nixon was also based on a game. Frost / Nixon, as regards Nixon's regret, appears to be appropriate, because it is time for President Bush to get away from his post. Nikson was easily reflected on Bush and his presidency, as regards the war and its presidency, as shown in the game / film. From this point of view, Frost / Nixon seemed more relevant and really benefited from the widespread film transmissions because people talked about and reflected on their political status in the country at that time. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is "good", speeches are not outstanding, and that's a very good thing. scenario adaptation apt, but what? Why not just stay in the game? Why is it a film for marketing and financial reasons? He did not give the audience something new to debate on the horrible topic.
