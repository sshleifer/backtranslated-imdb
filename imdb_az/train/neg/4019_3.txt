Dakota (1988) was another instrumental starring Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie resembles Harley's release. There are several differences, but both are identical. I do not know if someone's coming. I think they will remain one of the mysteries of life. But both have difficulty living in the "kids". These horses instead of motorcycles. They're basically the same movie and they're just like hell. If you have a serious L.D.P. fan then I advise you to look at them both. You are overwhelmingly insulted and detained by LPP. <br /> <br /> L.D.P. supporters!
