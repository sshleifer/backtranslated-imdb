How can anything happen in a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel? Believe it or 'House Bunny' made it even better and funnier. Hopefully, the managers spent a good holiday and took some money - this film was a shame to all of them. A cliché from start to finish. Clicks can work well with a script or at least one idea. This film uses cliché after the cliché more than ideas or scripts. Instead of developing this character, he uses the actress's predecessor identity. Bad, sad and trash. Now you have 10 text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT business manager, this is another example of an inappropriate coding.
