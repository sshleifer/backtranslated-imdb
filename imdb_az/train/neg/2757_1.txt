I am a guy who loves boys movies ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting the cool special effects of the army. But this was the worst movie ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the story was terrifying. Event transitions were the worst I've ever seen. If your life is in danger, why would you go to the beach to relax? The movements of the snake reptile were so badly written ... and the attacking ability of the snake's creep had changed widely throughout the film, and several times the main characters were killed. <br /> <br /> The director was in the midst of the film in the most stressful time, but it was not clearly seen after the movie, I love the movies, but I had to force myself to watch it, thanked God, did not buy it, I paid it from a friend <br /> <br /> Do not buy it, do not rent it, watch the discovery channel ... much more interesting.
