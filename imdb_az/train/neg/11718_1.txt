This is incredible! .. Now, someone wrote before me that someone spent time watching and watching this movie .. it! Do not do this! I'm totally ranked! I loved Wesley Snipes and set up a funny movie when I created a movie. Anyway, I would like to see this movie (at home only), but now I'm completely disappointed! It was his worst movie. Inwatchable !! Bad player! Bad cameraman! Wrong scenario! Only one good think: this beautiful girl! Sure, it should be manicin! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 line minimum? I do not want to waste time reading my thoughts! Hopefully, I was clear and unstable, because English was not my native speech method. So, as time goes on and see good movies, I'm also working .. Peace!
