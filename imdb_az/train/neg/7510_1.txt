The movie is a clich√© collection about something there. There is no focus, no target, no real message. Symbolism has been pushed from above, and clicks are plentiful and dirty. This film can not prevent the desire to produce drama where it is not available. Every little word exchange is instantly transformed into a long, unfounded dialogue characteristic of the actress class rehearsal. If there is no substitute for this exchange, actors (regardless of the normal situation) can not help, but they can not compensate for "excessive shares" by inflated emotions. Imagine, simply put it. The director has no help here. This non-story can not save anything. It is compulsory, lying, and tears are boring. The Who, portaaring with punk rock, is incompatible, piercing and stylish 90th outfits. Characters play without role, detail and motivation. Places are strange. <br /> Good DP. It was destroyed by Saturday Night Fever, sense and art with Good Fellas on Boogie Nights. <br /> Good DP. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This is Lee's flaw. He sold it as the rest.
