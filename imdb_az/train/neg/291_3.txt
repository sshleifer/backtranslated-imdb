The film version of Sandra Bernhard's off-Broadway show of a woman is very strange. Sandra spoofs operate in the lounge and superstars, but the sense of mock is just a fitly interesting and fitting fun. His admirers say he is nonsense, and this can be true. But in this genre, an unapologetic, incompatible with a film, also shadows with face-to-face bravado. She does not want to be beautiful - and she is certainly not a friend - and always many people are rub rub rubbing the wrong way. But even if you have been acquainted with it half a year, its material is not there seriously. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, worked as an executive producer and director, but has a cold, independent signature style throughout the film. Bernhard wrote a show with John Boskovic; Their most bizarre touch was that Sandra's entire audience was totally bored - many realistic viewers would probably feel. * From 1/2
