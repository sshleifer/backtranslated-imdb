Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not very good. While playing a pool of money, I play many games at the airport and have a change from the woods to the airport. The film reflects the same qualities First, the film has begun with this team that tries to capture this "Phantom" boy or anything, they look like a professional team and wear uniforms and mags shoots autocockers. A boy is a bushy sport. Along with the movie, it was not a mistake but more of a feeling that it was very cheesy. Well guys have a lot of kids and there are some woodsball players who have dreams to get a better weapon, and other teams are always chosen and insulted because they play wood and blah blah, helping the kids to get out of this tree <br /> <br /> So, what is wrong with the movie? Good budget is a great thing, a paintball movie is not bad, but the budget is pretty low, and the film feels like an amateur, and there is a great name in this movie, and the player is very disappointing - it's too bad to have Paintball, which means everyone is going to go fast and all that is indifferent, It was just a movie and paintball did not give a real perception St is not all the friends as it is to be a real paintball, it's not "respect" and is a lot of cussing and bonus balls playing with the rules. Do not watch this movie and then wait for a scream to be "4 1!"
