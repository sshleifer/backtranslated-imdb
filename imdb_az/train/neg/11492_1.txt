How can such a mess happen on a large German television station? It's strange how key actors escape every player's talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John is very flawed - especially in a double murder - how enthusiastic .......! The layout of the screen is very, very long - perhaps to fill 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! Set is a very clear blue screen, f.g. ship scenes with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, sound and dubbing are very weak - probably the cause: different languages ​​of actors - but other international production is so much more professional. Tip: Tracking - it takes a diabolic time!
