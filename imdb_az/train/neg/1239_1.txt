Since I was a great fan of the "other" PLANET of APES films, I rented this DVD despite everything from Tim Burton. Once again, he is unsuccessful in despondent direction. Monkey makeup appears to be a second degree of cruelty taking into account the terrible budget of such a monster. Mark Wahlberg once and for all proves that he is not an actor (BOOGIE NIGHTS is not as proven enough). Embarrassed for real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Of course, their taxpayers motivated them, perhaps this could not have been a scrambled scenario. I rented this DVD for $ 1 a night, and I still fell.
