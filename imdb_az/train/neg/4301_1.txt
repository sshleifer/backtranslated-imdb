I stayed overnight and was very bored around 2:00 am, so I turned off the canals unnecessarily and H.B.O. it was playing "classic". I was happy to look at something that started in the beginning, but my happiness was about two minutes before the movie. The whole movie was centered around an attractive man around the many fat and very grieving cousins ​​who were frightened of women, working in the uncle's canteen as four waiters who worked as a waitress, but also among the empty-looking women and their neighbors. This film is a bit fascinating, but of course there are some strange twists worth looking at. Basically, it works better if you do not have to spend a little night or immediately. However, children are made of many skins, so it is good to watch them in noise, but it can even be boring
