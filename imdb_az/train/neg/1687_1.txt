If you see this movie, you will respect the movie theater, the director, the producer, the actors, and the one who tells you to see it! Sarah Michelle Geller is embarrassed for putting your name and face on this poor excuse of a movie. Japanese actors could be more intimidating if they speak Japanese instead of 'move' in English. At the end of the film, I wanted to be heroic ... The real disappointment after the hip-hop that propagated this bare cash producer after TV and film jump. Sarah Michelle really did not do anything to make this movie ... she just used her skimming skills. Do not waste your time or money in this movie.
