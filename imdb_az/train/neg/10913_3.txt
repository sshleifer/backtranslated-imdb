Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a cop who has been dreaming of her lifetime. But when the car is crashing, the luck changes (very bad) and was found by a doctor. The doctor should use animal organs to restore it. From then on, he begins unconscious wild behavior and comes to the forefront of being the best cop. Over time, he changes and his animal instincts begin to take on the human side. At that time, she finds a lovely girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, that is, she needs to behave self-control and behave as a cult. I'm not a big fan of Rob Schneider. Actually, this is the first movie I've ever seen. But I can easily say that he is the best player to ever get injured (Ally McBeal is really funny) .And there are good parts in the movie like flirting with the past. The biggest problem in such films is that the script seems less intelligent to the viewer. I am sure that this movie will look as long as it is not taken seriously. But it's so sad to see such films in the box at the very best. Animals are not the worst movie I have ever seen, but more.
