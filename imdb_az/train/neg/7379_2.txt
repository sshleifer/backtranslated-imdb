What did Steven Seagal think? First of all, I love Seagali. I love all my films until the mid-2000s. His first things are the best in the genre. However, this is not a good name. Attack Force (a protagonist Marshall Lawson (Seagal) with Seagal is expected to be a typical liner ass assimilated form with Seagal, but it is a secret crime that we have acquired, with little or no action associated with a political tension. It's a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, a shame, and a shame for Seagal's dubbing. a funny battlefield that shakes hands like a girl looking at the camera. "Revenge is a two-way street" seagal says in this movie ... do not forget the revenge Steven needs a rescue!
