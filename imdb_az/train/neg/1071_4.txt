A very weak film, mainly due to a poor story, is also an irrational behavior by many poor characters working on Robert Downey Jr. You can enjoy this movie if you want to put your mind off and just love watching a movie based on creativity or acting criteria. Personally I can not do it with a drama, and I found it very far away. <br /> <br /> I am particularly disturbed when the main character, as always, is a smart person. imbecile The main character in this movie would not be a movie if a person behaved normally. <br /> <br /> The first highly anticipated move was played by Embeth Davidtz, who said that Mallory Doss had been kidnapped by a successful mafia boss, Magruder Kenneth Branag, and had a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> He tells him about a strange father who is a sort of strange sect and strange things. In the poorest part of the city, when they come to the curled door, they see that the car is on the roadside. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <br /> <strong> Yes! Also, your father's strange, there is an accident in his house - everything has been told to Magruder, "It's strange for me, I'm here!" <br/> <br /> <br /> Therefore, he lies with himself, and then motivates his story and sex, trying to achieve his father's deed. Is it probable that the temporary attorney would be 16 years old when she was late at the office wearing a shirt at night (who claimed to be a woman in office)? Magruder's police claimed that he was angry at some time, and when he came to the police, he was sure that his father would be offensive and would not tell the police. <br /> <br /> This is not very difficult.
