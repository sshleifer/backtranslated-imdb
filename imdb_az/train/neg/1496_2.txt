Evil Sex is a very striking flick that, unfortunately, is good. The film appears to be promising, but in general it is a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as a player. Acting is cruel and unbearable. symbolizes the lines heartily and even if the purpose method does not work, the characters are irritating. Some of the killers are innovative, but it took too long to shoot. About half an hour after the movie, the first death (beginning with the start) and then every five other characters were shot in the next five minutes. The film then dropped an unreal karate, a man's intestine from a * sscrack, like ridiculous characters, battles. Someone's funny this is just plain smashing. The movie is ultra-scary and ultra-pointless then. Most characters have clich√©d for the most slasher standards, and as solid, but left to the left for 5 days. Eve Sex is not even a funny bad, so the main task fails. Wait for the Texas Chainsaw massacre, do not see any evil for the pre-Dawn or the real slasher.
