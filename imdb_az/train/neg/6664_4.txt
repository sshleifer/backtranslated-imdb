The adventurous and mildly unpleasant romantic tale changes that started out as a soft country, as Edward Norton's predecessor Harlan was increasingly telling himself about, and the cause of everything's failure, because the movie gradually became a modern wild west from the southern romance. <br /> <br /> A lovely rancher (Norton) travels to the city and is a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), who seems to be rescued from a depraved romantic lifestyle with her bad-tempered father. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A real chameleon player who plays a country naked (by altering the facial hair), the emphasis is a bit frustrating, but maybe he is just concerned about the accent because it tries to move the part without. While getting more information about Harlan, of course, it's not so easy to make all the smaller sizes. But with very small changes, we're never convinced of the exact location of Harlan and is increasingly confused with Norton as a good performance. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood really likes Norton to have nothing more to do than do eyelids. <br /> <br /> As a slightly unequal tale, due to the change in velocity in the valley strokes, it really underscores the sympathetic sympathy of the audience to explain the hero's motives. Should we love this nakedness? It is not clear after a dramatic event. We will not be able to arrange the story as it is uncertainty, the loss of the movie, the talk of a wizard like a writer, and the desire to place. When the film was one or the other, this could have been a solid film, but the confusion we have is something. Old romantic fans will receive a portion of the film, but they will get out of the dark tones. Fans of Norton Edge (or fans of the sophisticated d√©cor of the San Fernando Valley) give this one a miss.
