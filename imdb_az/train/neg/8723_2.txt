Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad film. It is rare, but this defenitly does not need to hunt down. The Italian jaw rip-off is most of the time and feels the rest of the time. The "messenger" is not convincing, and many sub-fields are no longer available. Whether you're a local video store, monsters, if you're fond of movies, would like to watch it, but not worth the hunt.
