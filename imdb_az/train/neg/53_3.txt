I'm learning Catalan and I was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with a Catalan dialogue in my art house video shop. <br /> Hmmm ... I have not seen it. <br /> Yes, other reviewers were saying that it was well-made and beautifully painted. The childish sequence of children is shocking, despite the violence, well-behaved and convincing. (For most, ie ... Mallorquins, in the middle of the square, will find a corpse for intricate preparation in the middle of the full man's look of the 10-year-old boy) Oh, good ... small details. <br /> <br /> After coming to the forefront of the three surviving survivors, this was part of a magical Pan's Labyrinth. age. Francis, a nun and two boys working in a tuberculosis sanatorium, Manuel and Ramallo, are both sick. <br /> <br /> Like some Spanish films (apologizing for Almodovar fans), it is strange that the characters (Francis) are very dangerous *. Their motivation, personality, and dialogue are often not naïve. <br /> <br /> In addition, some are becoming horrific. Get ready for pain and LOTS blood. There are many reviewers who call the "Potboiler". If it were 40 years ago, the poster would say, "SEVEN LIVE!" RAPE !! QUESTION! SPORTS FANATICISM !! LIFE STATUS! BETRAYAL !! <br /> <br /> Opening sequence is insufficient to convince the characters and their relationships. To work, these flash characters must be flash multiple flashbacks. Here's a strange and overwhelming cross between Brother Sun, Sister Moon and Pulp Fiction. If you see something like it, enjoy it all. <br /> <br /> As for the catalog, it is the Mallorqui dialect, which differs from Barcelona. dialect, though I was surprised by the statement that I needed to understand Barcelona, ​​even Catalan subtitles.
