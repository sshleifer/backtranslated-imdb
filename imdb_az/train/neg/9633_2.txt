Is the rich, sick Elizabeth Taylor referring to the Angel of Death in the island of the Mediterranean, or does he simply react too extensively? In fact, both of them are directed by director Joseph Losey, in accordance with the so-called "Boom", respectively, because the thunderous, luxurious conditions are almost ready for explosion. Richard Burton raised Mount Taylor desperately; he completes a samurai dress with a sword. Even in a very wide picture, the picture is quite deadly, even when Liz's Dick-philes fails (a group of stars belonging to the hell of the 60's), an ego-mad is rare here). Inefficient, confused and confused, "Boom" is a disaster - Tennessee Williams, who wrote his film, "Milk Trail Anymore Stable Anymore", was not very popular! * from ****
