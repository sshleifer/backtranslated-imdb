Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw twice. For the first time I was a kid and the movie was very entertaining for me. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of days ago, I saw that it was funny and interesting, and the main character was good. It was horrible. Indeed. I do not know why I think so funny, but now ... I'm not laughing. There was not even a little fun. It was just dumb. The story was weak. The player was something special. <br /> <br /> This movie has great actors, but the player is still the best mediator. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that this film is racist. Indeed. Do not get me wrong, usually I do not complain about racism in movies. But I've seen people complaining about the absence of black men in "The Shaolin Temple" or "The Street Fighter," one of the bad guys in the movie ... Whatever the point. Everywhere there are people who are racist. I'm surprised at how he reacts to a movie like The Meteor Man. Why? Why will I say? There are no Asian in this movie. There is no white man among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white man in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All good kids are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, good man is not black or white or yellow, or pink or green ... My focus is on the truth that we can deal with with a white man. This is a movie I've ever seen. It's not just realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, there is no problem with the 'street warrior' - most people in Japan are Asian. But if there are only one white person in an American movie, there is some kind of problem - most people in the United States are white. It's like taking a Japanese movie with a completely white cast and pulling just one Asian as a bad man. Not just real. <br /> <br /> This is also the case. I gave the movie 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with him as a child.
