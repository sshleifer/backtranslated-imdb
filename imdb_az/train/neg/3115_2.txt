I am rarely writing a negative review for this site, but this time also caught it. The night's listener is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this movie, I did not care for any characters, I did not. <br /> <br /> With his spouse, he did not look at anything until the whole mystery structure. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no motion, no excitement, excitement, nothing. There are no spoiler - there is nothing to lose: a dog climbs from a window, a dog on the edge of a room, a car that goes to a rough place and a dog steals a truck bucket. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the One Hour Photo and was hoping to have a heartwarming role from Williams, but fell in disaster. The more disappointing is that there is a good movie there - the idea was interesting and I felt kindness for the characters, but it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I can even give you 1/10, but that account is reserved for Producers' rebuilding
