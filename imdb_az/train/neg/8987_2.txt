The only quality of this film is a true story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The player was bad at worst and his design was unattractive and very rich. It was worth the story, but it was very difficult to watch for all the pitfalls. I do not recommend watching this movie ... The only quality of this movie was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... In particular, Ryan Bauer was a soap opera star. Some of the edits were good, but there are persistence errors in all places ... I just got sick and tired of watching bad movies ... Can we get a good thing soon?
