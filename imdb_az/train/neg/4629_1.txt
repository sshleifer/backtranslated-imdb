Undoubtedly, in the 1950s, stripper Misty Ayers was forced to show his "acting" skills. <br /> <br /> A sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers), a small fairy tale, turned into narcotics and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she gets acquainted with loved Tommy Cole, who is in love with her instantly. She wants to help her escape, but can she? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The rest is simply a miserable little story, a miserable "comedy" (no prostitution is laughable, but what do I know?) And a dull post-dubbing dialogue. I knew I did not come to the end, but it was not enough to sit. And Ayers' toy movements are hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid it.
