The Twilight Zone has achieved a mythology about it - like many Star Trek. Because there are many dedicated lovers in the show, no matter what each episode is supposed to be. They give 10 points to each individual show and can not objectively evaluate the show. That's because I've been reviewing all Star Trek episodes (good and bad) some time ago because of the overall rating and ratings being very positive. <br /> <br /> It's time to do the same for Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> When I was hitting the episode 10, it was just bad. The writing was actually a bit embarrassing. In a major battle, the two men from the opposite sides appear to wander through the entire episode. After a while, when they come to a truly foolish and totally unsound conclusion, it is clear that there are only two on Earth. Usually the episode wrapped in the end is great - it killed him!
