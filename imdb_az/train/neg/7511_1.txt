This was one of the most funny and dirty films I have ever seen. I've never loved Spike Lee, but I'm going to give it a try - it's a mistake. The film shows how Sam's real life murders affect a neighbor in the summer of 1977; I really did not know what I was doing, I fell into the center of the most boring faces, so I doubt anyone's concerns about medicinal problems, marriage problems, and so on. The scenes describing murders are just and much more; a shooting and then Saturday Night Fever! Spike Lee's choice to feature as a reporter in the film is not even funny: Spike, tell me, you're not in Hitchcock, it's getting worse and worse. The most foolish dog was a dog with a sharp voice in the scene, this scene was described at the scene as the cause of the beating? Spike, what did you think when you created this movie? I do not think it is my guess. People who think they will see a crime drama get my advice and do not waste your time or money. In this case you are better than watching Jerry Springer! The film's waste I gave it from 1 to 10: terrible dud.
