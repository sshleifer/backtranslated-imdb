Why do not you believe that these guys are shot on a bunch of actors created by some scenes, hunting animals to get them out of the old, using old images? The old films of the countries are beautiful, but it is painful for the local population to watch and enjoy these films. I know that racism is good in these old films, but there is more to losing credibility. Martin Johnson did not fly their airplanes, they blew up, Martin Johnson, old friends like Jack London, were unstable, denied the apparent depression of his wife while earning money to earn money. They did not give any information about the first arrivals or the first writers in this land. She was film-shooter and OK as a photographer, but about that.
