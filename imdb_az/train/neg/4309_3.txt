A school principal (Keenan Wynn), a lost basketball team, does not want a coaching trainer just to become a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby), but a catalyst for new winning ways. Are you really surprised? On the way, romance develops between coaches and team star player Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never informed. <br /> <br /> There's really no movie in this movie, packed with a snack movie along with other Crown International Pictures. This can easily be turned into a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great, especially with his exclusive suits, as coach Randy Rawlings, but I expected more than the R-rated movie. Considering that former NBA player Sidney Vicks with the help of a team, the side field that surrounded a hypnotic frigate center by team mates is not the real cause of the new team's success, not Cathy Lee's coaching. It's a great disappointment, not too much annoying and not enough sleaze.
