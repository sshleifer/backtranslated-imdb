Indeed, I can not say anything bad or good about this thing. His symbols are fairly liquid, powerful in production and design, and professional-looking (other than the cheese wolf suit). However, there are no differences, ideas or anything you do not see in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON, and / or OUTLAND. Only one other formulas, cookie cutter, "terrific corporate drones" flickering in comparison to monsters in a deeper place. Spend too much time.
