Two days after seeing this, I'm still grieving when HAVING is seen. It's so bad that everyone should be surprised how they can write this trip, allowing less public attention. Stilted actor, a leading man in the sleeping bed and Alison Eastwood embarrasses himself. The action is an indicator of low budget film structure, which means bitterly bad. Plot? Yes, if you were 6 years old, you could write this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and just a straight lame.
