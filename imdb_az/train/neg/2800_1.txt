One of my best friends is this one night film "Want to watch the worst horror movie?" He brought it with words. I always have a good laugh when I hit a bad horror and said yes. I was expecting your typical non-petrol b-slasher, but this was B edge. The Z-slasher, at least down. Obviously, such as a low budget, extremely bad movement, bad lightning, no area, really bad "special effects", vibrating cameras and a terrific soundtrack, these films are regarded as Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about this subject is one of the topless characters acquired in 15 seconds - he had many beautiful tits. There is a lot of things I have said in this movie, 'Wow, this is actually BAD', 'This is the worst movie' and 'I'm not quite drunk for that' line. So ultimately, do not waste your time (or money).
