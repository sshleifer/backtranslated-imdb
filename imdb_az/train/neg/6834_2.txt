Gee, the story of a movie! ... I said that I wanted to become an expert on bad movies since decades, so I decided to start. This was a pretty good choice. I've been into this adventure to find some missing stones and undoubtedly masterpieces, but I have not seen anything in this pastel colored turmoil. I have not watched a lot of bad movies in the past, but this is the feeling that it is "good", probably not curse! First of all, there is inaccuracies. There are fraudulent inconsistencies, physical inaccuracies, and psychological inaccuracies. The latter feature, like Van Damm's blue spandex, is crazy like his cheeks. There are many trivial mistakes, and I will not even begin to talk about some enthusiastic action. Not everyone who is involved in the hot mixture of a movie, especially when it is a special case, is not exactly bad. Geoffrey Lewis looks like Frank, which looks like a miserable look. And I'm really glad to tell you the truth, Van Damme did a good job playing twins. It succeeded in reaching a different tone and mood in two convincing roles. But the film was very heavy and the sad part, prepared by a big movie studio ... Now it is bankrupt.
