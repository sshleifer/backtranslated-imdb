I must admit that the New Age mumbo jumbo is too catchy. When people make "energy exchange", I'm always surprised how the kJ really has been exchanged and how it can help solve a global warming problem. When it comes to power, "I'm always wondering how it might violate the entropy of the law and still do not get the Nobel Prize. <br /> <br /> When people feel that they are able to walk freely from the complexity of life, they are wondering how the train does not do a simple job like finding a station. <br /> But still, this is not the first movie, but with the holes in the field and most of them find it perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If I were to refer to this "Celestine Prophecy," I will not burn this movie, but it's not, unfortunately. Every actor is squeezed out of his head and can not really understand what to do in place. <br /> <br /> This is the result of many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s" results when talking to someone who knows what he is talking about and how he understands quantum physics. <br /> The direction is also thirsty. Something else can be expected from the person who named "What Dreams Come", but he thought he was well paid for the job and accepted the attitude of a taxi driver in New York: "This is your money, my friend." JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, the only man who is just like a fun guy all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a work, but also one of the few actors of this film. In this film, there may be several clever cracks in this eternal and very boring New Age conversation. <br /> <br /> When you realize that this film is a horrible hole that your dinner looks like it is not really able to shut down your dinner. <br /> <br /> After a while, the words turn into small ping pong balls thrown up in pain. <br /> <br /> If you are having a good time and want to choose between this movie, paste the safety pins inside your eyelids and advise: choose the latter.
