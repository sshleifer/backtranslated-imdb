After watching two or three times in a row, and finally enjoying it every second, it has finally been possible to see her in the Transformation. I really was really dissappointed because it did not meet the high standards first of all. People with a 90-minute baskets are not my best movie idea. For this Philip Glass account did not have the power or power to do so. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this movie seemed slow and meaningless. Barrack's filtered version is the same idea, but better. I really hope that the third film of this series will not follow the example of this waste.
