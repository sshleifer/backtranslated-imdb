Yes, mostly film! Blair Witch welcomes Sean Penn's ill-advised fantasy about how "Combat Against Terror" really goes to Iraq to show what the world is about. Scenario sounds as written by 8th grade student (no crime for 8th grade student); two main actors are moving on the whole movie; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong movie (I did not know anything about these things - but I did not look like documentary films I watched), and all the Christian Johnson had the worst idea and sucked it. This reminded me of the fact that I was trying to draw my dog ​​and ended up looking for something that looked like a huge turtle ended up with a really bad stick figure. Blair would be better than watching the Witch VIII.
