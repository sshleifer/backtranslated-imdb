"Sky Captain and Tomorrow of the World" (a strange incovenient title) is simply a bad movie; no heart, no deep thinking, nothing special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds seem to be interesting, but in the end, the whole thing is drawn to a slightly annoying focus. In addition, the film uses the same style as "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - DOES NOT TAKE PLACE. Strange, just awful. Except for old movies and TV series, gobs, gobs and gobs, etc. No new ideas. There is no goalkeeper here, because the film can only exist. Save your money and time. It's not fun.
