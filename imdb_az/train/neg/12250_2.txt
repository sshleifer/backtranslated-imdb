In 2000, after watching Tobe Hooper's crocodile, the crocodile, I showed great interest to the collective / crocodile exploitation / monster genre. We look forward to a sophisticated producer to follow this beautiful taste of campfire with a few readings. Only Ed Wood can bring a sense of treachery and respect to these remarkable writings. With a room full of monkees, writing Ed's editions and creating crocodile-like effects on the computer, all the things needed would be fed with Russ Meyer breasts and Rhoeke pectoral implants. <br /> <br /> When Tobe Hooper's crocky opus appealed to her movies, Blood Surf chose to dine from a giant window of the other films on the theme of aging.
