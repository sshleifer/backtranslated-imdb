At this extremely low budget, I'm planning to shoot a video clip when I'm in House House, part 13 of "Burning" and "Friday" on Australia's low-cost home-made home movies. They are kept by a serial killer burned several years ago. This movie is also called the "worst movie presented by a DVD movie". There is only a point of sale! All in all, completely and completely garbage. <br /> <br /> In some films, there are even some shooting. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> My price: F.
