It is not worthy of any other observation than even warning potential viewers. A little general heart story about an actress who flies to a studio during a WWII era drama. There is no fear, no thirst, no surprises. A little shocking moment, a bit silly to fall into shock. The visual style is very straightforward and boring, although there is a really nice editing process. The story never comes together, the movies are really just a bust. 4/10.
