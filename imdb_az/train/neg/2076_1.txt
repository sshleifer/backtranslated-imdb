Yes, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! These jokes are extremely unusual (not waiting for PG movie) (Canadian PG) and not funny! I was expecting this big cast to be at least a good player, but I did not even get it. I am a great fan of Rainn Wilson, and I'm very disappointed with his performance. The symptoms of Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman are at least unpleasant, and I could have looked at both of them as little. I really did not expect this movie as it was in the past because I really liked the director (Six Days, Seven Nights). This movie was not worth $ 10, and I am very glad that I do not see this movie. I guarantee that you will be like me by asking this movie to end.
