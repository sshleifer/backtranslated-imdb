Yes, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I think it would be. I really did not feel that my rent was getting out of my money, and sometimes you might want it all. The field is not okay, bright or new, the player is pretty bad, but the toy is pretty good. The director does not go through, but the effect is terrible, especially the worm film, which is a huge problem. There was a fairly decent nudity that was pretty good to me, but it was not so hot. In general, if you're a direct adjunct to a video movie, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the inspiration of a genre. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees, a few) keeps the bonus case horrifying.
