This film is a badly-designed and poor design set, as well as chain lines and a bare plot. But watching is very entertaining. Everything about it is hilarious.The main area is to capture a bad employee who intends to destroy all of the worlds of a group coming back in time to travel time. The 'futuristic' laboratory of scientists since 2033 is a eight-year-old "futuristic" blinking button and a room with a time capsule that looks like a meadow. Actors convey their lines to a complete aplomb that the lines typically "hesitate twice twice for everything". She twice checked everything twice? He has four times checked? Not only that, they nourish all the movies in the first five minutes, and continue to shoot at a fast shot until you hit the middle ages. Roger Corman ran out of money. And over time, and eventually, it had to stop the different sets. The medieval set is a funny thing from the late 10th to the 16th century. They used the suits they found. I do not think that the chain was in the budget, because the guys wear the masked shirts as armor. Struggle scenes are funny, men are accidentally thrown into cardboard swords, dying from death and die somewhere. It sounds terrifying, but I love to watch it every time. Single lines are enough to fit you, and everything else combine to create a mixed B-movie. And once, read the review about Unknown Movies. All funny, really terrific bits of movie I love to hear them.
