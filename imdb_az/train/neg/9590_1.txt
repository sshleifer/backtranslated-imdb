Journalist Colin McInnes wrote three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "Spades City" and "Mr Love and Justice". I read three. The first two are good. Last, perhaps, was not a trial. But McInnes's work is very high; and in the right way. This music is the latest fears of a romantic one - to see the fruits of one's mind transforming a film that captures the soul of London in the 1950s and makes it a flawless, evil, soporific dimension of apathy. <br /> <br /> Colin McInnes did not give thanks to this witness.
