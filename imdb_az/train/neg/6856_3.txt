This film begins with an early scene with Frank Morgan's daughter Anita Louise advising Gary Cooper's marriage. While Frank Morgan plays with an unforgettable gold digger, Cooper is shouting loudly in the hands of the family for his worry, including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am an admirer of all three actors. Frank Morgan is a Hollywood treasure, a legend of Cooper and Louise is a very nice, versatile and low-cost actress in rare occasions. <br /> <br /> Theresa Wright offers nothing but heart warming, though it's a lot of blessings, though it's nothing against it. <br /> <br /> From a prospective opening, this story will slide to the end. I did not find anything laughing about burning Cooper's home. The bull in such an aggressive, non-smoker home would never allow Cooper to continue to smoke, or alternatively, would provide a way of putting his bad time cigarettes. Moreover, no one who has a healthy mind will not let himself be buried in a burning cigarette without any means to burn himself. And finally, nobody snaps a cigarette in his right mind and puts it in his pocket! In all of this sequence, Cooper appears to be foolish and laughable. This is a bad hypothesis - not a laughing matter, but a thought-and-get of a film that laughs. Cooper's compulsory medical examination is equally controversial. No one is permitted to carry out a complete medical examination without knowingly or unwillingly for his purpose! This is because Cooper is so laughable in reality - it's absurd! The kidnapping of babies is a serious offense, and this is not a laugh. Finally, Cooper's sensitive, neurotic attention scenes on the baby's nutrition and weight can cause the nervousness of several people who are worried about newborn babies. But it seems to me just gentle and slow. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> They run on all the cylinders. Laughs do not come for a minute, but more like light-years. The winners of Eurovision Song Contest 2012 have been awarded the prize. room together. Perhaps there is a magnificent rich humor on the earth, but nothing has been eliminated. <br /> <br /> Finally, one of the two most loved girls will be harmed. In the future, this is Anita Louise character, a nightclub of his wedding night! While not in the camera, this is his fate and not particularly funny - even an empty result. He did nothing in this movie (unlike Gail Patrick, my favorite wife). To end a happy ending with Anita Louise, I ultimately hope (perhaps a better promise in the context of the movie "hope"!) <br /> <br /> Such a nice character, especially in the end of the movie, is really "happy" for Cooper and Wright end "effect. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen, the films of the period are characteristic ... And never was delivered. Here's a good performance in a slightly different role by Frank Morgan.
