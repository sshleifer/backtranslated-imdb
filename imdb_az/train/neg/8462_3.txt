"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but after 5 years, the video is filmed for no reason. Why? It is possible: Story-telling story, incomprehensible dialogue by Oliver Martinez and annoying editing? Must be. I think the plot is going to a mystical road trip to Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacques Oliver Martinez. They meet many illogical symbols and prevent some bad ones. The movie looks great and has many styles, but there is no substance. Do not pay attention to many movies, while trying to be subtle, unresponsive space adventures and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is most in 2 minutes.
