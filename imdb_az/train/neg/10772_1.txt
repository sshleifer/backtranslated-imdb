The worst part of this is that I will not be back in 87 minutes. I knew this was a terrible thing, with a man dressed like an Indian head over a roof. (See, in 2008, face to face). My 10-year-old boy now turns into a baseball, and we decided to rent a rainy day. Despite the taste of some of it, I had to grieve when I heard all the unpleasant rude tongues. Bad, bad movie. This was a terrible violation of bad news stories. Completely shameless and totally unpredictable. If it were good, I would not expect a movie, but it was not.
