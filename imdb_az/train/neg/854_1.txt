Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the film "A Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad movie, which, unfortunately, is regarded as one of the most deadly horror films ever made. people should shatter their hearts when thinking of a real fears film. There is no shining, no real horror, but what we find is merely a naive, foolish attempt to create a terrible horror. Everyone knows how good the attempts are, a good thing in the movie is the appearance of the icy valley. The hotel where the majority of actors are given is very good. About actors Jack Nicholson looks like a missing, discreet soul, who is never sure of what he or she will do. The colorful actor who engages in pampering a child's player the most times. Need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. The film is prepared and poor Kubrick can not avoid it as it is not right to make any changes.
