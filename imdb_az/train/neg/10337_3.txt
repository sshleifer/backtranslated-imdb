The end of this movie is as immeasurable as I wrote all my movie aesthetic class smiles like crazy. Now the majority of the film was good. It was a few unusual funny scenes, but it was a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who created Baby Jane, Phoenix's Flames, and others. It's not a problem, direction, action, or technical thing. The film was destroyed only by a third actor. Why? Murder, Folds, Turns and Symbols Have turned round the nuclear material? What was the smoker when he came to this job? The only way out would be the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all complaints about the Burton Planet's Apes, I talk about the life of David Gale or Notorious, which is the worst end. What is it?
