Very honest, the Omega Code is the worst movie I have ever seen. When I sat down for the first 30 minutes, I was surprised to try and decide whether to return it. But first of all, I did not pay for it, and I thought I would stay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will soon go downstream (consisting of some spoilers): Casper Van Dien's two senior lecturers, such as Gillen Lane, is wrong. Characterization was contradictory; For example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. There is an unreasonable description of the fulfillment of Biblical prophecies; We see many silent news clippings accompanied by ridiculous computer pressures from the translated Bible Code. Also terrifying "action" series: Lane escapes from harsh situations without explanation, and once Lane appears to be in danger, a dream sequence happens! This grammar school is sweet to writing exercises, but it's an unreasonable device in a movie. Pacing was bad: After a long opening, the first three parts of the movie change the scenes every 90 seconds. Then the pacing is improving, but it still jumps to a very unnecessary place. As others have said, years have not yet passed to anyone (Lenin's younger daughter). <br /> <br /> There are some good things though. The quality of the movie (for example, lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. Shots were well spent and the layout added realism touch. In the last part of the film, there are a few moments when Lane God has summoned him to help him - it was a very exciting thing - even someone who did not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it hit me as the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, they were watching it with great misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> Heroes, dialogues, directions and movements seem to be ALL of us. Michael Ironside has nothing to do, and Michael York was just strange. Manufacturers think that they want to do a lot; this area was closer and more focused, and the film would have been better if the characterization was intensified. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the Omega Code declares. I do not necessarily pay for it. I'll give you ten stars. <br /> <br />
