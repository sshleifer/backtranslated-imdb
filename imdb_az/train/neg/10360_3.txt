I was thrilled to see the commercials of this movie because I recently read a book and really loved it. But the movie did not meet my expectations. Reading the book recently prepared me for the occasions when stories were translated to the cinema. These characters did not look good with the book. The direction was weak. It was difficult to get into the heroes. There was no real connection with what had happened to the audience. The dialogue did not explain enough what happened. It just seemed to collapse and fled. All this was very upset about the film. You probably did not read the book, it could be. At least you can read this book more and you will love it more. <br /> <br />
