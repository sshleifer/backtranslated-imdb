Why such a general title? Santa Claus??? So soft and unexpected. Earlier, "Santa Claus Conquered the Martians" was at least fun to watch at his camp, and all the scene scenes used for any reason, seemed happy to me before trying to give money to the holiday spirit. But this movie is just about the corner of Milad and it is the joy of all the children. Santa lives in a space? His enemy, a devil named Pitch? Does Santa Merlin Help the Sorcerer? How casual is it! Yes, after making it in Mexico, some of you can understand how the film was built. I have to admit that some of the impressions are unreasonable. That was all madness! Despite all the difficulties about the film, he still feels like a Christmas movie. He conquers good deeds, and Christmas is still part of the heart of every good girl or boy in the world, or thanks to the universe, through the Santa Claus, to the Martians. So even though you are always one of the worst holiday movies, you have to try it ... though you should put a smile on your face every day.
