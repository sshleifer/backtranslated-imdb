<br /> <br /> As we mentioned above, there are very positive reviews for this movie's best films. <br /> <br /> Many of the best international films that often complain of slow pace along with foreign films. <br /> <br /> I often see artfulness in the foreign movie arena and I love the lack of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So, this movie did not provide a worthwhile value for the time I spent watching it. There is no way to emotionally participate in any meaningful character development, attractive story sequence, emotionally involving any characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> . <br /> <br /> Although the paragraph above is fast and dramatic, it will drive you in the movie script. I did not attend three sessions so far to complete it, so far I did not regulate it and even did not do it for positive assessments. <br /> <br /> If there is no academic interest in this period, I'm definitely in this direction behind the steering wheel.
