I've seen the worst DCOM. Ever. Well, maybe it's not as bad as Smart House. It was just bad. The player and the story were beautiful, but the effects were SUCKED! <br /> <br /> They were too fake! Only a good battle scene was between the brothers and Sen. Probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> In general, we were very disappointed with this movie, and the type of movie was suddenly over. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give Brenda Lirik a lot of funny actresses and four for a fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
