This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The site is virtually non-existent, and the best available (especially Affleck) is weak. Ben Affleck fans are likely to defend this film, but they must agree on the depth. It is explained by the fact that Ben Affleck, a millionaire vendor, can gather a plan that he wants to go somewhere reminiscent of his childhood and to forget about his childhood. By doing so, she completes a family living at home to pay for Christmas for her family ... and that's it. The film goes on and as a result she comes together with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
