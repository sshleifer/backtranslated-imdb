This film has no area and no focus. Yes, it should be a slap-stick, foolish comedy, but screen writers have no idea what the film is about. Even the title does not go with the movie. It was called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. Heroes do not develop and nobody cares about what happens to them! The only person who was able to watch the guest room character (from the 70's). He was cheerful and stole every scene he was in. Others need to be sure that their college diplomas are in their jobs because they need a career other than academic activity.
