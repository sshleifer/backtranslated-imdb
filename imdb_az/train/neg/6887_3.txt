Again, a "boy will not grow up" flick, and just like the other ends. Why was Napoleon threatened with another bad wig for the third time? Anna Faris is always unforgettable; Jeff Daniels is about this, from a different state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how would you write this night to a career? Please do not worry. It does not say anything that has not been covered here a few times. I will say this; 100 times better than Failure To Launch. There are very few funny lions in the movie you do not even think of Eli Wallach's funny laugh. Yes, yes! He's old and f-bomb dropped off! Tee, hee, hee. I'm happy!
