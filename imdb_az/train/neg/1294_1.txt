In this film, the main subject seems to be a turmoil, relationships, tuning, entertainment and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of the ordinary and has no unusual accuracy, direction and intensity. To make matters even worse, his character is called "Che" and we are only called "Che", which is a man called "Che", only directly to the film (by the narrator). Family relationships are not clear until the end of the film, and once it has been established that the family is divided - the younger generation is for America. So clich√©. Others see how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a child's family; But the director's political position is in the best of darkness and we are fully convinced that blood is responsible for blood. So, they lost their property (gambling profit) - what is it? It is a single and cowardly choice to refuse to hold a political position while filming a Kuwaiti revolution. Do not say that the movie is in English! Why do these Cubans speak English? Not surprisingly, they are not allowed to film in Cuba. If it is important to look at family life here, it would be good if we could figure out who we are - at the outset, we're offering them all - a cheap way to clarify relationships throughout the movie! The player was more shallow, wooden and incredible, the time was all around. 'Special' visual effects are intriguing and remarkable. References to American films - and black humor as a Greek chore - from indecisive, intellectually intense and consistent. I just watched the whole movie, because I am looking for clarity or looking at everything. It never happened.
