I'm a great fan of Ted V Michelle and the original "Corpse Grinders" is a real reason, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The bewildering legends of the legendary Liz Renayan (Desperate Living) could not save this worthless trash can. This film should serve as a lesson for all past, present and future movie artists ... when you were a successful movie like the original Corpse Grinders, you probably should have been sleeping dogs and you would not necessarily try to revitalize them after twenty years (Herschel Gordon Lewis "Blood Feast 2: All U Food"), though you may have decided to do so, you probably have a little more money than what you did for the original and for God's sake ... NEVER shoot a movie on a movie. When filmmakers try to do so when they know that everyone's quality is going to be ugly ... I still see a film worthy of a hell of a blow to that kind of hell ... If you can not get a better result than your original movie, for someone who produces ... and Ted V Mikels is this god Wadding script (or cigarette) thinking? That is, the dog and cat from another planet mean "aliens" to come? A painted cardboard box to look like a devastating machine to carry people's bodies ... bone and clothes and all? Out of Liz Renay, any of these actors have paid more than five for their ugly performances because they are pretty much paid! You can film this movie at all costs and watch the original instead.
