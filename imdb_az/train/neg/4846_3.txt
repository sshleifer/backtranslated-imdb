HELP THE PROSECUTORS ..... I was surprised to be honest with the high rating of this movie ... really am. Everything I saw was a slow-moving propaganda film, which is almost nothing to say. (To check the rating for Plato you have to check it) This movie was so black and white ... Americans are good ... everyone is either bad or useless. The British troops I took from SAS (I think I am one of the most select units in the world) lost 3 people, others fled, but not US troops, even elite soldiers took on the battlefield and deprived them of a vicious eruption on the Iraqi people. Aye, dead chains. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is when it comes to the sniper SAS man ... from the distance crying, good sound ... really good done, but the rest ... how old are you? !! <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> his wife and small child ... he must not be registered for one year to fight bravely with a lie! Why ... young men because of anxiety or something they need. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I do not hate America I hate the message of this movie even though it does not seem to want to deal with an illegal war, because it is clear that there is a fair war For any reason (wanted to say something else), but hey it is so. But on the one hand, it's a good and bad thing to leave a one-sided film like black and white and treat me like a child. There are many gray in the war and believe in the two (sometimes more) parties. Star Wars is something with a dark side of something, not the signs of goodness. F 'Hollywood really when you take people for trophies ... then 7.8 .... you can still be right, but I will not buy. I am amazed to hear this movie astonishingly. ;)
