Try to pass as a kind of allegory for a fairy tale with the true meaning of monkeys for the palm tree, and then immediately begin to ugly on the animation. The Prophet (saas) says: One minute later, Palme is a humble hero looking for herself, looking at a woman with a strange psychological illness in terms of health. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, Palme is also poorly identified. Although you have several fan girls in the castle, you do not make any contact with the characters. The writer seemed more interested in the drama and complexity of this movie than exploring the motives and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> The last five minutes of the new, futile story lines were filmed. The writer needed a serious story. Perhaps he tried to be epic, but it was just a matter of a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie, I just could not do anything, but it would be better for a series of television series or graphic novels with many sizes and symbols. no matter what quality of quality already exists, began to laugh about how the characters, relationships, and the whole plot evolved. When I touched my companion, like a young man sitting in front of us, he began to injure me. We worked hard to control ourselves, but we can not just get the terrific quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the brilliant side, the animation is incredible, and the audience is delighted with the cool sources and the attractive nature of the designs. The animation manages you instantly; When you do not think about the heroes, he tells you how to feel.
