I can not say who is the main complaint to this film. Racism is not meant, but all these Asian people are the same! I can tell the story a bit, but the heck lasts so long. People's identity is not a mystery, but if they are a mystery to care for me. Instead, I did not leave them on the ASAP screen. <br /> <br /> This film features tons of shooting and silent emotionless tones. <br /> <br /> Heck that is boring, I only know these people, but they are sitting there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's a little better than Andy Lau's "Full-Time Killer" (Which was a big movie?) You've been thinking about a good budget that can look like at least 90th Hollywood. I did not know Chinese were the beaten robes of this art house.
