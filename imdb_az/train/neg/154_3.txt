Watching the DVD in English with the original English subs. The subtitles are very poor, or the actual dialogue does not make much story and does not give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars on this subject but there is no need for them to become better or worse than the movie. It's just bad. Bright and colorful images made in CG are appealing to bright colors and glow, but will be very animated long ago. Anything thinks of me as a child's film, cg, war scenes and crap pillars. I believe I understood what happened in the film, but the story was all too bad.
