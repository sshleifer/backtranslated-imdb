This film took hours on TCM. It was clear to me that I had some problems with the film. First, the kids have not been adults for 10 years. Several parts of the film had problems of sustainability, and for some reason, the actor who played the youngest guy, seemed to be the oldest 10 years later. <br /> <br /> I saw the copy was missing for about 20 minutes, at least a large gap with a black screen appeared. This is very bad because the comedy has left everything, but Bergman & Russell have played a very good role. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is the loss of a large congregation. But what can you expect here? The scenario removed Bergman's character after childhood, but was later brought back to care for them when they were adults? Some of the time lines are also meaningless. It looks like 1929, but children have a stock market crash that is growing to fight in the First World War. All the nations that support this film are good. I was just surprised to see what's missing in the 20's in the invisible movie.
