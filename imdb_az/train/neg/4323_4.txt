The European Vacation (Aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of the Hollywood movies (from the top of the first and third films). Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the role of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time a weak script is given to a very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, and the jokes are not very laughable. To be more specific, this is the reason why this film is suffering, like the "jokes", is pasted into a document written directly together, not to serve a central area like the other Vacation movie. Well, they can not win it all. From 10 to 4.
