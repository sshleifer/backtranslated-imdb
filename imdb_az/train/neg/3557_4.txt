Seriously, the blood of the screen, gore and repulsiveness on the screen is very easy to keep strangers about the physical damage to the stomach, but actually doctors harass the women who do not worry about this movie and take a worry watch. She speaks of Rosemary's Baby's John Cassavetes, the massive uterus, the dry compound and the red (?) Sperm mass, which is the least common in the medical world. As the incubus is said, STRANGE is a horror effort. Is it absolutely terrible? although not very good, what? but it's just strange. The mixed and sensitive script is primarily intended to kill a murderer (although the title is clear in the presence of a supernatural creature) and does not cease presenting new heroes. None of these characters, especially the key, are sympathetically encountered and some of the reasons why they have never been disclosed remain dark. The physician's daughter has a strange interpretation of her lover and acts as a suspect, the city sheriff (John Ireland) is always in a drunken state, and does not even care for those who continue to harass and kill women in her area, the female correspondent is very strange and Galens (an old witch and grandson) only becomes defective. Together, they work desperately to solve the mystery of those who destroy the reproductive cities of some or any of their organs. Seizures aimed at aggression and murder are like atmosphere, and bad deeds are bloody and disturbing. Basically, this is a very positive factor in a fear movie, but the description is not very appropriate and it is very unlikely that characters will be a really good movie for Incubus. Also, there are some weak points to fight with yourself (like the images of Bruce Dickinson's concert!) And usually John Hough's direction is quite unclear. The final shooting, although effective, is dark. Personally, Incubus for me was a disappointment, but there are just a few reasons to recommend this single piece of horror in the 80's for an open-minded genre.
