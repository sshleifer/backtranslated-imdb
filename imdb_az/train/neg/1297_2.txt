For an updated samurai story, playing the role of Easy Tadanobu, I saw Kitano Takashi seeing Zatoichi bright again and taking it mainly. These two films are separate worlds. Zatoichi adds humor and depth to his characters and demolishes traditional samurai film clips. Gojoe goes deep in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate the movies with other symbols, instead of telling the audience what character is the main character instead of developing the character. In the presence of Benkei, almost every character says, but this internal turmoil is transmitted only inside itself. Instead of developing the character, we get scenes of exaggerated, boring, heroic scenes. The character of Asan is not developed and even looks boring and does not know what to do there. I know she is generally far and cool, and this is part of Asana's appeal, but this movie does not serve her. <br /> <br /> Many of the camera moves are awkward. There is an eternal scene where the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and more anti-climate. <br /> <br /> This kind of budget does not really make good samurai films in Japan. Colors, decorations and suits were very good, the rest was simply a waste of time. I see the legendary version of the Kabuki better than one.
