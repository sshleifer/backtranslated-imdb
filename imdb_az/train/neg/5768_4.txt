Yes, at first I was thrilled to download an animated film, an open-source movie, to demolish the demo. The animation is perfect, lips synchronicity is awful, and you watch the hope of realizing what the movie is, just to see if something goes wrong. You will not feel any emotions for the heroes, only regret to the creators. I have seen short films twice in half time! It could have been a perfect short film if only a real director took time to work. I am sure that Blender is thrilled to show everyone the program and show skills, but sad guys-story talk movie.
