The developed / incredible story line, (I figured in a figurelike way, I'm no longer careful), bad cast (come ... William Macy as a cunning man?) Managing badly, (Tracey Ullman did not look bad?) (Needless to say, What happened to John Ritter's character is unusual?) wrote a bad article ... (Of course I'm not looking for a formula script, but it's really terrible) it's just a really good thing to do with that kid. Line ten? If your comment is less than ten lines, is not it good? Who has the advantage? Why do not I say at least 10 lines? Is not this kind of arbitrary? Why are there fewer comments than 10?
