The film begins with an interesting scene, three people drink and talk little at the bar. All of these are some strange stories. As the film opens, the most ugly story turns out to be true. Besides, the movie bar is not interesting except for the scene where the main mystery occurs. This is a time-lapse of the film, and it will be very sincere. The rest of the time runs out to a god who abandons the Russian village full of sad and creepy old women. Of course, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but admire them for a long time, and offer any possible plot or character development. Instead of making an exciting story, filmmakers found it intriguing to look at strangely interesting stories and stories not related to several nuclei (the story of meat trade), as another example of a bad or lazy movie. to understand all the probabilities and consequences of leaving the audience. There is a similar appearance on a surface, but there is nothing else but talent in this situation.
