This is a terrible movie, a terrible post, bad direction and an unusual end. There are also bad performances, except for Clancy Brown, who committed crime here and Michael Pollard. <br /> <br /> The shooting of this movie has been postponed - you'll do enough to loosen the bad karma movie. <br /> <br /> A father and a boy appear to be appearing in the film could not be any. could have been. Some parts of the man's body are not well written and appear to be uncharismatic in this role. You will notice that the area is one mile away. The actions of the woman and her brother are also meaningless. Thus, at the end of the film there is no author of a major scenario of action.
