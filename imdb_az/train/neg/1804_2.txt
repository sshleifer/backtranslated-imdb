Antonioni took the film and picked up the role of Pope Smurf as Smurfs, a small, long-haired, American, radical student. He took them under the guidance of the European communist wing and thanked America for the exaggerated ways of the United States. (These Desserts are red and wearing, nothing else around them). Radical Smurfs, a long-haired Smurfs, a smart elderly man of the Lenin communist-beard who effectively drank the beard, symbolized something smart though, although he did not know that the beard had such a profound effect. Another wise, bearded man, Castro often used force to uncover the forces leaking on bearded beards with foreign beasts. (Not Che Guevara: the beard has a certain je sa sais-pas-quoi, would you like to embrace Marx and his beloved, pacifist teachings immediately?) The movie begins with a radical pupil, a radical student, really re-defined the word "mixed" engaged in dialogues. A high-rise building is like a blind-folded dog that falls into a bottomless pit. Suddenly, the film's hero, Antonio's hero, rises and tells her left-wing left-wing partners that she hopes that the "mega-coolness" show will improve James Dean's image and increase her chances. Do not cover with the best "chicks" in the next mass hippie body. Finally, he is worried by the police (ie pigs) at the rally and holds the film under the blue American capitalist voice seeking freedom. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's anticipatory attack on capitalism was not just an intellectual vacuum but also something new; it discusses employment contracts with just the same old trigger-happy cop, businessmen (and what's wrong with it, how to get Antonioni movies?) and endless shooting of television commercials and billboards. <br /> <br /> Papa Smurf Antonioni, its like a long time ago, the terrible, unhappy, disillusioned, and the Smurfettes of the late 60's did not see the clearest and most vital aspect of their foolish actions: they allowed these courageous meetings and their anti - Organized their views freely, Countries that are fascinated by the Left-Wing systems (and still did not). The biggest mockery of the Hippies - Antonioni, of course, did not even know (his decision was mixed with cocaine snoring and LSD's excessive consumption) - hippies are the rubbish of capitalism. It's an incredible mockery. You can find a hippie named only in a successful capitalist system; <br /> <br /> The film itself seems to go on forever. Antonioni takes a tremendous amount of time to get in with him, when he is entertained with seemingly insignificant scenes with a very ridiculous factor. His symbolistic attempts are annoying and surprising. His expressions are undoubtedly the best. This is the way Antonioni says that a violent revolution is a solution. <br /> <br /> This is what we get from the old, saturated, poor, rich, oily film maker living in villas and dining at the best French and Italian restaurants. <br /> <br /> I have never seen any of the massacre in which thousands of pupils participated in the Chinese movie Tiananmen massacre. But when a western student shoots Che Guevara's face to face all of our faces, we get ten mainstream films. Is Chinese life a thousand times less than the West? at least the film's left wing hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> If you are a Marxist neo-hippie and you do not like this terrible review, click on the "NO" button below.
