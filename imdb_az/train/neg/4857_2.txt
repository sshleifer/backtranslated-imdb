I really liked the ZB1. Actually, I did. I have no problems with very low budget movies and I like films that have a worse production value than ZB3 (if you imagine such a thing, check 'zombies' vulnerabilities'). <br /> <br /> Hollywood directors do not understand what the "zombies" are about. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was very bad. Weakened. I do not want to be dignified in my criticisms. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> br /> 1. Pacing was PROTECTION. Everyone spoke on monologues. Even though they were a single line, the functioning of the camera and the correction of each sentence and the placement of a F-bomb assemblage arranged FEEL as a monologue. At first, I was amazed at the time of 90 minutes compared to the 70 minutes of ZB1, but there were actually fewer events in ZB3. It's all about talking. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore effects were stupid. <br /> <br /> <STRONG> Despite the epic exposition, there was really no plot. And the exposition is really epic! If you follow, you can not spoil it. (Do not follow.) But then, there's a bunch of lame characters browsing around and ~ 80 minutes colliding. or less.
