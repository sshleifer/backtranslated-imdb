This should be my movie. Even sucked, even my alley should be straightened up; I love Hell, Congo and Allan Quatermaine. In my heart I have a mild place for foolish alien / devil / adventure films. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> Fear / Sci-fi is almost always interested in me. 2. I'm a great admirer of archeology and this movie contains a rare treasure. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally love. 5. Tara Reid is dear. <br /> <br /> So, this movie had at least the potential of a video shop's cheese-scare, but the boy pulled this donkey. Only backward aspects are Slater and Dorf, and everyone does not like them as fun as me ... So, let's get both melodramatic. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Though the film is bad at all, Reid's performance is really terrible. We just do not talk badly, I talk about Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know how he can operate, but he's playing a museum curator, he's just out of his league ... completely. While trying to take on the role of an experienced scientist, it's no different than watching pornography. I want to say that it's not just bad, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Even Reid's speech, maybe the film might have worked, perhaps only a plot of domination and was written by a 10-year-old person. After looking at the DVD, I did not realize that this was a video game, but instead I would appreciate the real dumbness. <br /> <br /> There is, of course, the story that happens in Slater's childhood, a terrible thing happening during childhood, of course, amnesia. In his adult life, Slater was hired by some parentarous military force, some of which was probably a prank of hunting, or hunting something by some 713. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, and I really do not know if he's actually in the noise of the zone. The film begins with Slater hunting and acquires the latest work after some relationships with the "Chilean torture force, which later specializes in selling rare ages." <br /> <br /> Some of the hell are some hell on Earth, experiments on children, super devils / aliens, human hybrids, "photon" bullets (devil things can not stop the sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf get rid of everyone will work. <br /> <br /> Jesus, even clich√© elements. There was a need to shrink the main focus of the scenario and re-work to provide some depth. I do not mean, why is this bad scientist so badly damaged? Indeed, people are doomed and only try to save their human heritage. I know he was infected? How did it happen? Indeed, he has one of the evil devils in a cage, and he takes his blood to hit him. How did hell happen? Slater, like a half-super-ribbon like Blade, why and why super slugs (oh yes, they used to keep an old sci-fi stand with their host's spine "parasite aliens / slug", but its boards " "Oh, and people with these" bundled "bones have been as good members of the community until they are half an alien / devil and after the killing of a zombie after no secret signals have been given. <br /> <br /> <strong <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> At least something can not dynamite. <br / > <br /> The worst thing you can see is a really bad movie.
