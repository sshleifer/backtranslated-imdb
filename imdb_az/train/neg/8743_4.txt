Although the antitrust is completely flat, it falls to the category of films that seek to reach some beautiful points while encouraging. I do not hate the movie, but such basic elements are incomplete. There have been other attempts to shoot an exciting film about hackers and computers such as Net. They all fall short. The incredible end of both Net and Antirust is almost identical. The end of this movie suffers from a major mistake in detecting: People with PC coverage have this bold self contained voice covering the population waiting to hear the latest PC and software news. <br /> <br /> As in this movie, I have worked for many companies and industries, and all of them suffer from a glare that has expanded their importance. Milo, who is a fatal allergic to sesame seeds, immediately fooled one of the bakers in a restaurant, foolishly crossed the line of fool, only his "girl friend" who escaped death, including Milo's Big Mac breads and Sesame Seed make the miracle as well as cats as they are, like the baking sushi .... Sesame Seed breadsticks and Big Mac buns. <br /> <br /> Antitrust also does not provide much tension, embossed and predictable plot folios it was easily understood after revealing easily (probably a really striking person when Yee Jee Tso was killed), thereby destroying any real shock, and here again there is another movie that the bad guys they are pursuing good kids to get. "We have been in this Simple Simon for about 20 years We have a moratorium on the issue, but it's still possible to come to an end, but it's a totally funny end that we're the head of the company's security, and another bad guy, and he's been a good guy to get Milo down. CEO of N.U.R.V laughed at Gary Winston. And, of course, Gary Winston's arrest is worse than Hinckley or Oswald's arrest. Gary Winston, played by Tim Robbins, is the same character Robbins cardboard that is played on the Arlington Road. <br /> <br /> In the years to come, it's likely that this movie will be destroyed, but only at your local level. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Antitrust" and "Anti-Original" is a third-degree UHF channel.
