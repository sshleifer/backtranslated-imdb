It is undoubtedly a stupid and submissive debris piece that wants to be a clone on Friday, 13th (1980). A poster for this movie will be a penalty between Jason and Freddy, who can draw filmmakers. There's nothing good about this movie about this movie. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a camping adviser at Camp Rolling Hills, who is as nice as she and hopes to stay uncomfortable with other Campers. On the other hand, other campers understand that with the statement they have to send Angela home, people will not lose one another. Is Angela a human being killed? Was he a man who had a sexual change a year ago? Who knows? <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, many filmmakers were at home, making it the crucifix between the Mad Slasher and the Dead Teenager genres. Some have an area, but not some, but so bad. Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers are presented to young people for 80 minutes and then stabbed, drowned, cut, cut, burned and crumbled. All this is a movie. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I recalled the 13th Friday film that the message of its followers would result in death in the main function of adolescents. . The director of Sleepaway Camp II has the right to be ashamed of themselves. Think of the patient message presented by this film to young audiences: "This world is a totally evil place", which says: "He will kill you, what is your dreams or your hopes, whether you have a new lover or a new girlfriend, what you think, you do not know what you are doing or what you plan for the future. "<br /> <br /> And it's a difficult thing - and not too far - the film just sets up afterwards. Why not? Probably, they made three to four parts of these films and took them to the bucket. I missed the original Sleepaway Camp (1983), and after watching the first sequel, I hope you'll stay in the other sequels, as well as the original. And for parents, if you really know the guys who LIKE this movie, do not let them kids history.
