You can give JMS and boys this transition, because they were in a series and a small budget, but the movie is still low. Do not get me wrong, the B5 array is in the best TV series, but if I were an exec who saw this movie, I had not ordered the series. I'm not like O'Hare as an actor, suits are silly and have tons of clicks. The same thing can be said in most of the first season (except Babylonian square and Survivors); Bruce immediately set fire to the series and went on a spectacular performance. See if you're fan of B5 and ventilated this movie. If you're a B5 fan, you do not want to watch the series ....
