What an empty opportunity to take a really interesting film on a complicated subject. There is little intelligence that you really feel like being a straight (or gay) worker in a gay gay environment. Dancers talk about their art as no erotic component. They can not all be prostitutes, but they are really sex workers who sell special sessions that are really fantasies and dance. One of the films will be to appeal to women who go to gay clubs and then start a "dancer" for special sessions. Shows in the club show only women in front of the scene and "dancers" only play with the audience. This is not the reality of these clubs. It would be challenging to live in a private dance for right wives and couples. So what do they really think about their gay fans and clients? We learn very little. Instead, we are full. A gay activist who does nothing for the dancers. <br /> <br /> Mexico's photographs are general. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> , is a very simple film showing only a few pictures of beautiful guys who dance, and the rest of the film is an insult to gay men.
