I'm sorry to think that an Enzo can actually continue with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The S7 weight gain can be weak. S7 has an 3.93 lbs / hp weight, while Enzo is 4.61 lb / hp. End of S7s is very good. <br /> <br /> As for other parts of this movie, I just have to say that it is very important to be unhappy. The story is very weak. <br /> <br /> It's worse than the daytime soap available in the lemon. <br /> <br /> I can say that it's a type of negative psychology. If this is not a clear definition of narcissism and sophistication, this movie is nothing. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <strong> "1 Star" rating because it did not actually force it out of the theater. I also think that having a stunning gem with a deadly blue eyes like a leading woman ensures that she is absolutely terrible .... her Variety 's playing is PS: Jason's man is SOOOOO James Vanderbeek and skid series version.
