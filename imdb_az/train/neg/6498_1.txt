I've seen bad movies before, but it's getting some far away from the "Worst Life of a Lifetime" award! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to put his name together - everywhere! I'll never see another movie with him, direct him, and so on. I do not believe in other actresses and actresses who like so much (so in this way) to be part of this disaster! There must be some great medicines! It is beyond me to avoid being ashamed of being part of such a movie! Save this money! FLOP from the beginning to the end! Mr. Hopkins embarrassed you! Also, shame about Christian Slater! I do not believe that you put your line on this line of communication!
