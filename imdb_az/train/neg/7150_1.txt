After seeing the preview, I felt that this movie would be a great development on a fast and angry set. So I was expecting a poor story, but at least this time with fart cans will not be loaded with a weak citizen. Unfortunately, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is what I've seen is the worst movie I've ever seen - or I'm not going to get a baseball game for the nuts as others have said. The story line was not only extinguished, but also the movement was twisted. As we know, the director could only designate a group of women and exotic cars, then a movie. For an example, there is a point in the film where the man flies over a SLR McLaren to push the Nos button and throw it into the air and win the Lamborghini. And after Eddy Griffin's fight with the "girls" (a single imus statement would work in this case), she wanted to get her daughter out of PANE and, of course, in the desert. After this wonderful scene, I could not get it anymore. So, I just did not see half of this crazy one. This is the first movie I've ever had. <br /> <br /> Therefore, for some drinks I had to stop all of the broken brain cells to kill them. <br /> <br /> I gave it 0 because 0 is not an option. Getting to the local car show is a good off off stopping a lane joint on your way home. I will keep all my audience in my prayers.
