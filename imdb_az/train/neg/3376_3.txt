For anyone who is in love with the music scene A CHORUS LINE on the stage, the film is a shady replacement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, let's just note that, according to US President Barack Obama, this was just Michael Bennett. His idea, choreography, leadership, Broadway and the rest of the world. This is really a two-hour heavy blow to the "boy" and "the girls". The film, however, is a lack of empathy and depth: the actors are just like voting for CHORUS LINE rather than voting. Each movement, each line of dialogue seems so heavy and planned; Michael Douglas, in particular, has a great deal of control over our belief that Zach is an extraordinary treacherous choreographer. You can not even believe it even when it reveals itself, because every gesture, every word, every nuance, is so obviously prepared. And because of his dance: Kevin Kline sang for Zach's role in Broadway. Michael Bennett loved reading, but Kline could not dance and eventually lost his part. I wish Douglas did the same thing! A CHORUS LINE is a show of orphans and one of the few known people (as Vicki Frederick, who plays Cassie in Broadway, as one of many television dancers starred by TV's NewsRadio, Sheila and Xandi Alexander) can not know any of these people . Because you know these people. <br /> <br /> <strong > The best sequence in the show (Montage: Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love) is severely cut to go out for a new song called "Surprise, Surprise", which is one of the most striking Oscars nominations. Cassie's "mirror dance" has a new song and a disastrous choreography with disaster - why it is so messy with a job form, and why are you worried about a movie version? music theater and scene version lovers, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they love and love. For those who have never forgot their original production, either Broadway or tour, this film is forced to go alone. In the late 1990s, a small show called CATS will surprise you, as long as they are the longest released music on Broadway's history. But this is a different story, and it has not even started there.
