Do you ever get a spoon to kill one hour or two and watch a movie bad because of a reason? Yes, I'm seeing this box artwork for rent of weekly films and looking at T-Rex. <br /> <br /> According to my invitation, it was very important for me. at least. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, hidden formulas, a company are more concerned about life and wealth than life and, of course, the big, weak animation, socks-doll T-Rex. How did the film merged with me in other films? Rex's hunger is never satisfied. He does not know what the pain is like because he does not actually have a throat (actually, when you cry, you look like a toy or something ...). Now I sometimes love the incredibly bad B-Movies, because it reminds me of how good a blockbuster movie is. It was a funny one. I am not convinced that this should be a tension or a comedy, because there is a scene, you do not make mistakes, you smile. <br /> <br /> I blame the movie's budget ... yes, but the player did not help. Okay, Tony Todd was really good, some women's roles ... do not cry when you cry? Meh, I will not be angry with this movie, and I know what I'm into and if I'm looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, then what I'm offering here: Follow this movie, then watch Jurassic Park immediately and then back. You will write the letters of Mr. Spielberg the next day.
