What is the big fuss making INDIANA JONES WANNABE when there is an actor carrying an adventure friend who does not want to go out on such an adventure? Who wrote scripts for JAKE SPEED may have been dismissed, but for some reason, this movie is too small in excitement! It does not mean no action, but look at the dark side of the picture. It's no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure excitement that has scattered and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was propagandized by intelligent propaganda to make me and some other interested ones! Besides, I did not hear the boy, who should pay attention to it?
