The film is pretty laughable and will be drawn to about four dates, and then you (and even your "friends") can not really stand a man into a clear trade. This is a very interesting concept; The film is a research history to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that sometimes it is incredible (and bad) scripted and self-propelled. The writer / actor is very aggressive, irresponsible, indifferent and simply unobtrusive because it is difficult to draw attention to any character. You are ending your sadness for its history.
