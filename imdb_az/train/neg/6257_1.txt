SPOILERS. This film is considered to be strangers of generous taste. <br /> <br /> Scripts: Terrible. As Tom and Dan "meet each other" to get to know one another, the discussions show that a person is open and I suspect that he is a well-respected filmmaker. At one point, Dan said, "Did you hear the HIV virus?" <br /> <br /> Acting: White teeth and a squeaky face does not make a sensitive performer. Speedman was well given, perhaps frightened by Mars - in captivity unconcerned, incredible, and frankly ridiculous and attractive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Half-hour moments were not exciting but heartbreaking and weak. Marsden tries to try the keys to the door and then try to shoot them: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee. Avoid slippers of black-and-white flashbacks that are sounded in several voices from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important, the most dangerous, the worst and the insulting, is homophobia (external or internal) in a film that is believed to be a weapon. Tom says Dan has taken the condom or has not used it - forgive me, did Tom run away from sex? <br /> <br /> Generally, there are several villas with a partner who goes somewhere like a gay man's villa.
