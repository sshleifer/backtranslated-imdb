Jet Li is one of the best hands on fighting around the world. He has been shocked by others for over 20 years. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> Black Mask "First of all, it is dubbing up, though the cost of the camp may not be the same (even though the dubbing is not even close and the tone is flat), the second one is directed by Daniel Lee He's doing a horrible job, but he does not know what's happening, and the camera shakes and flips the other time, watching movies for Jet Li's fantastic martial arts, but the director makes the scenes even quicker , you know who did not know half an hour! At another time, a scene hangs (ie Li starts to cut a hole in a jeep floor, badguys arms up arms, two seconds later, and Li's interests are also under the car!) Other scenes they're completely ridiculous Point over (Killer CD roms? Just shoot it Stars!) Li needs a less-prone filmmaker to cut machine guns and create a kinematic mise-a-scene. Additional rap / techno music passes to be okay for intervention. Land is available, but it is protected by cartoon symbols that are deprived of any credibility from the film. And do we really believe that the interests of love do not know Simon because there is a half mask? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try the Iron Monkey or the classic Shaolin Temple. This is the complete loss of inclusive mixed time ..... 2/10
