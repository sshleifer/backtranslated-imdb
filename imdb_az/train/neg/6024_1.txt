Finally, I watched this movie about 30 minutes before I got sick with this movie. Soundtrack, so-called "plot" and every actor. All this is the main part of the film and "I WANT TO ME"! They say. repeatedly. The bad guy has bad guy music and says things like bad guys, not just catching up. Well, if you do not know that good man is a good man, he does brave and noble things. And the lord, the plane scene. "MY HUSBAND IS NOT THE BIBLE! He is my God! HEALTHY SHOULD NOT BE DESTROYED OR EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT BEEN AGAINST TALK AND TERRIBLE!" <br /> <br /> Yes, I know she had her clothes still, but honestly, she began to panic before she awoke and spent time looking at the spot she was in. <br /> <br /> Religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the movie when I press it. <br /> And I'm back in 30 minutes.
