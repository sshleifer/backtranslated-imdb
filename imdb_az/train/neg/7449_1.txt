Lorna Doo's very disappointing version. Many too many missing characters, romantic scenes, changes to the storyline, very short, low budget appear. If you're not familiar with Roman, enough dialogue is enough to understand the story. In some scenes, Lorna's upper lip has a cold wound. I'm sure that makeup did her best to hide her. Unfortunately, they did not want to stop filming until healing. Most likely, this movie has no kissing scenes. Finally, it's just a ghost kissing scene. Lorna Doone should be said to be a great epic tales and true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, more pleasant, and more accurate.
