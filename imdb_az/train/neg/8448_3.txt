Slither is a scary comedy that does not have enough horror or comedy to train like one or the other. There is a scene that is pretty good for the movie's protection, any zinger that works, but very little real, is scary and not quite humorous. In addition, the script does not pay attention to the heroes and heroes, and in many places it clicks away from the kilter. <br /> <br /> The main failure of this film is that his hero, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), was first introduced and then became a monster. This part of the film is drifting - Michael Rooker's character is not interesting to us as a human being and looks at the passage of a series of movements while his soul is in his curiosity, and this is a ghost-comedy, if it's a portrait of a man. In the final analysis, the problems of this movie are in the script - it does not matter how the monster works or disseminates. The terrible comedy's goal is to keep the heroes in a corner with a shotgun and to throw them into steam if there is any fear or disgust. Instead, we are conducting a study on the habits and tactics of foreign people that make up this part of the film's drift. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In this image, the hero (Starli Grant Elizabeth Banks) is more central in this section, but despite this, if the movie is not scheduled for the next Grant Grant as soon as possible,> Fillion and his position begins to cook when the film is finally alien, but once again is a problem script. In this regard, the audience knows and symbols should know that Grant is not alone suffering from a single illness and accordingly (shotgun) - on the contrary, despite the increasing evidence, it will help "a hospital." Their reactions can be human and real, even though they were supposed to perform characters in a motion picture and simply the film's action - an action. <br /> <br /> FEATURES AHEAD *** After the first confusion and blasting of a wild tale sack (small, character, and possibly the best scene in the movie), the script will betray the film again. At this point, one of the characters is falling on a stranger and developing a stranger's ideas. The writer-director (Gunn) chooses a completely new character from one of the smaller characters that have already been developed. Why? Why do you need to give an entirely new character in the movie more than an hour? When attacked by this character, we will not know anything about him and care less about him, even though he is a strange teenage girl in his hammam. Gunn decided not to use this character and simply used one of the few smaller symbols that he had avoided from introducing the family and could save his time and money. In addition, the hero and hero were included in the plans of an alien who had no extra symbols and could take foreigners to capture them more quickly and stronger. <br /> <br /> The latest criticism of the movie. Gunn is basically a writer, maybe budget restrictions, but this movie was ugly and uninteresting. Most of the action is carried out day by day in trees or in the field, and the screen is simple. The sets at Wheelsy (the so-called city of action) seem cheap. All movies look cheap. Box Office Mojo says the budget of the movies was $ 15 million, newspapers said $ 29 million, and given that they did not use any talent, the money was not showing up. <br /> <br /> The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions. Fillion and Co., hunting Grant / wild begins when a woman has disappeared and Grant is known to be predatory of animals. At this point, I was waiting for the FBI or at least the State Police to quit the sheriff and take it away. A woman lost and probably was killed and had a local psychotic activity. Time to call the attorneys. <br /> <br /> Although this film is an apparent horror-comedy, the most similar movie is Dreamcatcher. But basically, I hope this happens. horrible occupation and type and intentions of the monster. With the Dreamcatcher story (especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplode), it has a great deal of problems, especially the main characters are stronger, but more important, because it looks so beautiful, in many ways stronger. Although it is anathematia, the overall plan and structure for the production values ​​dominate the film, which shows that it is not just about the look of the Slide.
