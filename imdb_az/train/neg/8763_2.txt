I read somewhere that it was the production of the latest Monogram, but it's not important whether it's right, because it would not have been it. This is a deadly dull event of John Carradine with a little gray hair in his hair to look like an old scientist who has experience in reviving the dead with the help of this young lamp (Robert Shayne). Each time the subjects are animated, they have a white-facing look like marble (like a miracle) wrapped around the lab desk. Carradine tries to revive his faithful dog after death, and gains an extraordinary ability to walk on the walls like a solid dream (wooooooooohohhh). <br /> <br /> For the cheapest Monogram quickie, this thing uses at least the fancy-lab experimental device compared to what's actually going to be. The most entertaining joke in the film, "old" Dr. Carradine always says "young" assistant Shayne "m'boy," actually Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45!
