I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. A quick summary of this movie will use. <br /> <br /> After the explosion in the US in Kashmir, reports on what happened in the US city of Kashmir were published. . I suppose, in fact, you will get a tip from this movie, which in fact has had difficulty returning the Indian army territory from the Pakistani troops. <br /> <br /> I'm not really a movie in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was almost watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The whole Indian audience, who wants to make this film very patriotic and clear, also laugh at scenes that are not funny. <br /> <br /> The scenario was terrible. This has impressed Mr Dutan how the army operates and does not use bad war movies for reference. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect to move from most of the goals, but given the scripts given, it's hard to criticize them. <br /> <br /> As for the mills, I can say that they are the lovers. <br /> <br /> Editing was also pretty bad. Good things: Cinematography was very good, though it was a bit tricky that the movie did not look like color (the color balance is often different from the scenes). Also, several songs in the film were pretty pleasant - at least a dozen verses in the first half. Unfortunately, they spent more than one time. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime? This mix lasted four hours. What a good 1.5 - 2-hour film can be squeezed out of a good editor fire. Unfortunately, there was no good editor in this movie.
