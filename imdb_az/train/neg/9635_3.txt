HELP! WOW! Very horrible things. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor's traveling exhibition contacts Sardinia landscape and arbitration director Joseph Losey with this stunning Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dead widow, who holds a very loud voice, minions on an island that writes incredibly sick memories. When the Trash claims Burton is a poet and an old friend, Taylor understands the time. Extremely horrific - it is difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are not acting badly or intentionally enriching Williams' characters. If this is the case, the player is brilliant! Burton cheers his lines several times, including the BOOM word, and Taylor shakes himself. He is really terrible. Christmas Coward, like Taylor's mastiki, like "Capri Witch". <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, BOOM knows how much time it takes and how fast life works. --- The two standard Williams theme, but by mistake, by mistake, by mistake, by Taylor and Burton, many of the monologues that believed in them, would be completely diluted with any substance of the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> Supporting player Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli's Taylor like a dwarf guardian like a skilled physician and Michael Dunn ... and her dogs are number one in Burton!
