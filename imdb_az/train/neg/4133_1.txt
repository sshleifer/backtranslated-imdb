A few months ago I watched this movie with a few friends, and still think about a lot of folly. Only the first few scenes were cheerful. I would not break anything for those who want to see it, and I would not want to destroy the laughter. It is not worth mentioning that this movie will be watched all the time, trying to clarify what is a part of the characters in this movie. The beginning of the last movie and the shock of the last film is a shock to us all. There is no story and there is no mark of decent activity. Cartoon kindergarten is well developed as it is in the book Learn to read. They even did not care about a lesbian sex scene.
