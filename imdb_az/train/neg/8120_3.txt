Among movies that have at least 100 voices or more. Is the candidate for the best screenplay written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for Best Actress in Leading Role? The Best Picture Candidate? I do not always agree with a lot of Oscars picks, but this movie can be the worst movie of all time to be awarded very well by the Academy. Writing and acting were both terrible. Particularly, Blethyn's performance was one of the worst things I've ever seen and is probably the most performing performance of all time. The film is not worth the big screen, and is not worthy of any cable or television channel, including HBO (I saw it). I'm grateful that I did not actually pay for one of the most popular films of all time.
