This is perhaps the least deserving fame from Jess Franco's official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon, and Between Women's Bars), so it's a terrifying dull jungle clunker <br /> <br /> Ursula Buchfellner, a powerful blonde, plays Laura Kroufordu, a film star, kidnapped by a group of relentless kidnapped and taken to a foreign tropical island. <br /> <br /> A Jewish tribe who was worshiped by the agent of Laura, worshiping the "god of the devil" in the woods (a great, bare, naked, lover of nubile women who love to eat). A $ 6 million ransom, a bounty peddler Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and a Vietnamese vet pilot travel to the island, but bad guys have a double cross. During the confusion, Laura runs to the forest, but goes to the island's local population. <br /> <br /> Franco is in his usual torpedo style and uploads it with laughable effort. its fearsome trademarks are: crap gore, murky kinematography, fast zooms, numerous crotch shot, focus images, terrific sound effects and ham-round editing. As a result, it was a real fight to sit from start to finish (he took me several sessions to finish it), and even his compassionate Buchfellner's appearance in his natural glory was not enough for me to make this movie a haste.
