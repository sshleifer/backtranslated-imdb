Each film of the 30s is historic, but if you only watch John Ford movies, watching others look more dated. ie Grand Hotel is relatively modern melodrama. Together with Ford, he always sells one's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always emphasize that heavy weight is bad. Always vulnerable, unusual and clear scripts. This is no exception. It's a smart enough device to deliver. <br /> <br /> Here, I'm surprised at how Ford did not bring me to Lincoln's assessment, just how the United States was solved by the entire population of the moron. . Ford went to shoot decent movies. It's history to be a very bad thing. Feeling completely lying. <br /> <br /> The fake burly Henry Fonda is strange. No one in Illinois can say "S" or say "Shonuff".
