Alan Alda is a real-life "Sports Illustration" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. On the contrary, drama is not surprisingly complicated by fantasy. Director Alex Martin takes this material in an interesting way, draws it in a documentary (with spatial interpretations) and is still touched on the Capraesque foolish tale; it still creates cinematic shocks in this structure and turns the main story into something. Alda's luxury, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, although the supporting player is full of real-life athletes (and sintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - for what fantasy?). * From 1/2
