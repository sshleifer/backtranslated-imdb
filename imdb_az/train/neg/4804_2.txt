I'm not watching television and I've come across this show. Reality shows? I hope this is not real. If I were a human being and there was such a nag, and someone was married with so much snotty, it would be the basis for divorce. In my opinion, it sets a bad example of how a person should behave with someone he loves. This is something wrong with our world, in bad relationships, arbitrary, and what really means love for each other. It is not something that needs self-sacrifice and merritt. This does not give a good feeling to watch what private consultation is. If the identity of the show is real, it truly deserves a true genuine love and one who cares for him and who judges who he is. Is this show a reality or a rating for ???? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
