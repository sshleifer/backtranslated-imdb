Waiting for a ticket in my hands, I was awaiting an exciting fantasy fantasy film that could eventually feed my appetite for my robotics technology, but I'm disappointed with every aspect of this, with some of the more special effects that I've been thinking of, helping me dig deeper this year can not do. The actress in this movie would not be pleased with me, and Will Smith did not show anything new in this movie, but I've never seen the Black In Men change its player. He was retired, not breaking his name by names like "I, Robot" and "Men in Black 2". 4/10
