Together with Alice's director, I will survive the previous nightmare series, once again with Freddy Krueger's deadly desires. This time, the humiliating murderer draws attention with the dream mind of the unborn child of Alice. His purpose is to "be born again" to the real world. Freddie is the only dead mother who can stop her, but can Alice release her soul to save her son? This movie was really good, because Alice Amanda saw Kruger flee to hospital and later hospitalized, then fled to the hospital, she was pregnant, and Amanda was born Freddi, Alice and Dan Two, and recently, just recently, Freddy won the new Friends again. <br /> <br /> Freddie did not seem scary in this movie, and the nightmare was not really scary and creepy. /> <br /> The actor series in the film was okay for the 5th movie, but in general this movie was really Dull. (The worst movie of the film yet, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
