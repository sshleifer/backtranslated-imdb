Not as bad as you hear. In fact there are some funny tracks and Affleck and Applegate have a pretty good chemistry. Affleqt is particularly appealing and delightful as Affleck's interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are regular professionals. They are very good in everything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you will ever see. Unfortunately, this is unforgettable and most of the comedy is compulsory. The attempts in the dark humor are bored. Affleck endearingly works hard to be spastic and overenthusiastic, but comes as anxieties. The cartoon character of his character is brought to a high relief when it is followed by Gandolfini and O'Hara's more silent, convincing speeches. Even with the relaxed standards of the rest of the movies, Affleck never never lets you rent this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> Separately,. <br /> <br /> The X-mas home is full of strange humor (a boy looking at his naked, provocative pictures of his mother). <br /> <br /> In order to make matters worse, the colors of this movie are ugly, almost elegant. <br /> <br /> The home of the movie is the most stagey and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is for most Affiliate Duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and Affleck). It continues to show how long the damage will continue.
