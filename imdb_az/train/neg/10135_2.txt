I just watched the Starz movie. I do not go through a few things I think I've been doing; actor, writing, management, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It turned out that the writers had no idea about the film. As you can see, in 2007, when the dollar is stronger, you can get super-advanced secret bombs, which are not entirely visible to $ 75 million. Now one day these things cost about $ 3 billion and can not be invisible. As you can see, in an hour you can fly from the US to the Middle East. There was a totally occasional lesbian scene, but I had no idea, but it seemed like a bare attempt to see more children. The camera could be magnified and randomly switched to random scenes. Oh yeah, can be predicted as hell since Steven Segal's movie. I'm doing all this correcting.
