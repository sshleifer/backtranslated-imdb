This movie was very funny, even though I was not watching, in fact somebody prepared their own version and dubbed the movie from DVD to DVD. This movie made me sick because it was terrible, but it wasted 2.50 over !!!! It looks like my brother and I went to a house and put the film on ourselves and corrected the cemetery! Even though the BTK Killer did not even deserve more credit, even my cows did not have the true meaning, obviously they dropped out of game dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG THIS MOVIE WATCH NOT !!!!!!!
