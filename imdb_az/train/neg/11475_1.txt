A movie you want to throw yourself away from the sword. I've seen chocolate in my time, but after seeing unhappy blends, I do not think I'll ever be able to look at another movie. Premise - The Ex-Army is looking for a girl who sends a Xmas card while on a quiet stud, a typical character of the inner dress model (actually acted well). Right-wing loggers are home to the cabin living-granola type family. The family takes him and takes 2 hours to see that he is a liberal-looking, French-speaking drinker, driving porsche, loud mobile phone, lazy, urban slicking, Jewish-looking fianc√©e. <BR> Bad-1d characters, 1d themes. Beat your head with a Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. It's over.
