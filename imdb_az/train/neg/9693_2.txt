The Bonjour Tristesse's over-heated area is taken from a young novel written by Francoise Sagan, the best vendor, although God knows. There may be a specific appeal for teenagers who want to get rid of their potential stomach. David plays Nive's mother-in-perspective with his father, Playboy's father and Deborah Kerr. Unfortunately, Jean Seberg's fragile shoulders stand out. He fulfills the image of a beautiful and easily spoiled young man. The point is that he creates but can not move. Everyone seeing Otto Preminger as the Joan's Arc in the first film of St Joan-Seberg knows he has not reached the age of 19 in a movie. This film, prepared by the Prettyger, also performs the first "word". His second film was; Now it was 20. What did the pre-engineer think? Can Niven and Kerr compensate for Seberg's lack of ability? Is there no chance? The character of the storyline is in the center of the story, and although it may be physically as young as 17, it is quite convincing, though it can not meet the emotional requirements of this role. I do not know if he is a successful actress in his short life, because his subsequent pictures did not affect my consciousness. But anyone who thinks this movie needs a better taste than mediocre. Despite Niven and Karr, this remains a childhood story that is being performed by a beautiful young girl who needs a little actor lesson.
