"It's not like a great mechanical toy," says the jaws, an early character. Well, "Blood Surf" just wanted to be as convincing as a monster "Jaws" series shark. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are DAY. Acting and leadership are not very good; a more suitable cocktail film for a deodorant or a bubble-ticle looks more appropriate. The behavior of those who work in this film respects not only the genre but also the audience. When you say "you like this movie," let the movie maker offer this shroud more and encourage further destruction of the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
