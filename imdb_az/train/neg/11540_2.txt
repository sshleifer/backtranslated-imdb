<br /> <br /> It reminds me of Michael Winner's crappy 'Dirty Weekend' with so many SOO with the best English low budget sense for me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say that I'm not a fan of serious exploitation and serious film. Thank you, I say, this is Demented and Sol House on the Last House, which is undoubtedly a pitiful cruelty. <br /> <br /> It was just meaningless. <br /> <br /> Like a British budget director, say "spit on the bed", thinking that this horror is back with fashion in fashion. <br /> <br /> Everything is not just a place or a point. What is the attacker's daughter? Why do you worry about being a specialist in security cameras? Panic
