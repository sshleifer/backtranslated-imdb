- Bad Stuff: This movie is really twisted. For some bad stunts, they thought they were fake "I thought this Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are pretty useless. Some part of the film thinks it will improve its life by taking it to a window. I would like to know the casting director, and if he was at a high level, he was afraid of the adults. In this movie a sucked scene even sucks. He killed this movie book. The book was very beautiful. I do not recommend this movie much. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> Good things: I really do not know what to say. There is a slight decline that he has to go, but it is shot at a quick pace with a bad stunt job and action. <br /> <br /> - My judgment: not watching.
