When you're excited about the attraction, I believe you have to do all you can to help stop the cursing of the audience for the film's functioning. Some pictures (for example, "Rosemary's Baby") have completed it; others (such as "Necromancy") and potentially scary material come in as cornice and closed. There are some atmosphere moments in this movie, but about half of the dialogue (sometimes poorly marked, sometimes only incomprehensible) and Orson Welles have a role in getting the best billing, but there is a BENEATH I think it's hopeless for the job. Or maybe just fun ..... (* 1/2)
