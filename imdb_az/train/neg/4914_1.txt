<br /> <br /> I love the wisdom of love (and I am a boy), but when I leased the "Love Story", I prayed to come as quickly and painfully as possible until the end, and it was only contrary to the character of Ali McGraw. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw, who has been away from my hand like Jenny over the past 15 minutes. When he learns that he is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, he will suffer a severe loss for Oliver's death, or anyone watching this movie will not be able to help. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if he had not died, his majestic personalities had thrown Oliver out and eventually dropped into a divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70's.
