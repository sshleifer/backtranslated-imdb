That's not really a way to beat around the rifle saying, Lady Death: Motion Picture just sank. Given that the main character is a beautiful blond flying in hell with terrible bikini with random flaws of heroes, the film appears to have been based on the motions of the 1980 cartoon summit. The bad man himself talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has an obligatory anointing, and lives on an old lunar saber on a pattern visible after the legend of the Black Star cartoon. Sometimes I do not expect any humor except the ungrateful dialogue. It looks like anime tale that is better suited to cartoons than others, but despite the physical appearance of the hood character, no gender, sexual harassment (thank goodness!) And very few sexual references. If you do not count half the naked hero and bloody deaths, there is simply no adult edge of this material. In fact, the things here are an episode of Prince Ra's Ra-Ra, but with many dresses and more eyes.
