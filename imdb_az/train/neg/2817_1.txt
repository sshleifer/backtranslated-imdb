Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest fluke offered by the horror genre. Like any other terrific fan, I liked the Texas Chainsaw, but you must have at least one hit movie to put the title on a movie. Indeed, Hooper has not influenced any movie (himself, Poltergeist), actually influenced the horror genre or the film world. <br /> <br /> In some movies, Night Terrors is not my idea. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund lends me a good job with at least a terrible material he has given. He did his best. For the film itself? Clean rags. Unnecessary naked scenes every five minutes, a story that we have to write in a story and really just a terrible scene, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie can be redeemable. <br /> <br /> Generally, from 10 to 1. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems to be just before it starts. I hope he is able to erase at least one good snap, so he can justify his religious status. <br /> <br />
