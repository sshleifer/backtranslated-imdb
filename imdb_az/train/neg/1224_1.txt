<br /> <br /> Is not it so stupid in their right mind, as in this movie? <br /> <br /> The accidental killing of a security force ... two-dimensional characters drawn by two-year-old men can attract them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> Is a red tool box of death? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Living in the Caucasus disrespect towards people. <br /> <br /> Violence against the people living in the Caucasus, Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was entertaining and funny, it was just pitiful and terrible. Success in the future. :-(
