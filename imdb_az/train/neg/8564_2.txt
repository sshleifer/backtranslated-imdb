The film itself is very miserable. She portrayed smokers as if they did not hear the unheard of. True, some deaf people pay attention to the ability to hear people, but they are not frustrated by the story of Marlee Matly as the character. The deaf do not go to the bar and dance to Matthew's way. All this is worse than the film itself. It is very boring to believe that this is a film that has been exhausted. If I have a problem with sleeping, I can just watch and watch inside a small God. <br /> <br /> Behold, he'll fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Remember, this is a deaf man.
