"Gung Ho!" Film: The history of Carlson's Maker Island Raiders was made in 1943 to raise the morale of the American people during World War II. The film shows a better way to create a propaganda body. The value of the film is not just collection and artistic. It is unnecessary to evaluate leadership and actors in the propaganda film. Watch the movie if you want to learn about propaganda functions in the movie or to learn that Robert Mitchum plays a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, they are better and more objective. I appreciated it at 4/10.
