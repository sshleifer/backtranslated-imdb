I saw. Not simple but interesting. The children are quite natural, but ................ The graphics / absolutely the scene where the aggression is riotous is yes, and yes - the attempt to compare the images of the Second World War is an insult to this terrible comparison. The real misery is real - this is just a shame. But there is a look that the movie can draw you. But this does not seem to me the "New Costume of the Emperor", but in fact it appears in the opposite. Although the movie looks good, the direction, story, content and feeling you are taking in this movie are important. If a feeling can be important - that's it.
