Andy was not convinced that Sidaris did not repeat the success with the Malibu Express cinematography. With Kill To Fit, Sidaris proved to be a serious filmmaker, not just a director. The plot written by the ungrateful Sidaris in the Academy is a complex scenario that covers many unprecedented curves and shifts. The main characters work for a sexually explicit radio station, known as KSXY. In fact, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. Kane, who wants to steal one of Russia's most valuable diamonds in the Kill Ugur, has long faced with Nemesis. A well-written script is not a complete, but a perfect film that helps to classically support this classic. This film, which was banned by critics and cash registers, will be appreciated in the coming years. At the moment he loses the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but will definitely be recognized in the future. I imagine that no critics have accepted the trademark of Andy Sidaris. Suits, special effects, all help to complement this beautiful movie shoot. In this movie, you can count the 3rd rating and do the best for hiring yourself. The private rating is 10/10. Drama is like a smugger Runaway Bride, and is better than action or kinematic masterpiece with the Last Action Hero. Andy, do a good job.
