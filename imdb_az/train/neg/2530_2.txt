This movie was terrible. Some are not as good as they claim. First of all, the main character is very attractive gingerman. Secondly - WTF continues with Van love. In the field, the boy wants a sex, a minibus (fairly fair). In an incredible way, he points out that with many chickens looks like a new one! And fail with some. Then she realizes that she likes this dowdy bird playing scores with a really hot chick and hard to get. Then he drags the races through the lover of hot chicks. And he advises his van. At what point does Danny devito end the day? Although he did not need it, the gingerbread boy crossed his line as he drew it. I gave this 2 * as I wanted to accept because I got over 70 Vanning subculture and I have more than 70 boobage.
