A strange, strange, comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly as a bird through Houston Astrodome. The semi-comedy prepared by Robert Altman, the eccentric symbols, is strange that it starts to pull weight early. Sheinley Duvall is a filmmaker for the first time, and Sally Kellerman looks at all aspects of Bud Cort's "bird's bird" vision (explaining the role of Altman and producer Lou Adler!). Bud Cort at the Arena - after "Harold & Maude" - is genuine original; Michael J. Pollard is not a charming one, Cort is geeky, trying hard to make it unreasonable and harmless, a tough move to pull. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's wrong ideas. He can build a cast and a demonstration, but with a little inspiration and throw down the spiral. ** from ****
