I'm very happy with this movie. I was expecting another film from Thelma and Louise female friend. Instead, women in this nonsense escaped, there was no feeling of loyalty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plan their escape and the survival of women to find the secret of money was very selfish and cruel, and was to rely on each other for a long time. These women were not released in a positive sense. They began to be part of a bunch of barks that they could not respect only for themselves or one another. If you like female criminal films in the 1970s, watch this bomber and see the Big Texas Dynamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
