The Omega Code is interesting to read viewers' comments ... most of the positive comments were almost raised from TBN TV channels ... the film was prepared to go directly to the video Many series of devotional activities carried out by some religious groups in the 70s ... Do not you remember? You will remember it in one or two years. This is the first movie I have seen for you that you have a religious duty and that you take as many tickets as you can to get rid of the spirits ... very embarrassing ... it's just a son of a telegraphist, and you play a prominent Hollywood producer who sums up the lil ole ladies. .
