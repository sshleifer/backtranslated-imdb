Nobody can get this movie worthy, but if you have a sense of humor and use schlock movies for the quality of MST3, this is for you. There are characters, sets and story lines that are faced with the "Road House". The bad post really hit me: "I do not want you guys to contaminate these guys ..." F-14s come out of the carrier, but when they are formed, the F-16s want it! Without a hint of fury or no doubt, Segal returned to work for a few minutes before the General, erasing a secret "secret" over Seagal. Segal ran into a knife from the bullets and resorts to kill the guards. So, of course, guards are releasing all their weapons and fighting with a knife! The hand grenade is a bitch, but it is burning anyway. The smallest fighter flies all the way from California to Afghanistan. Later, Segal goes to California - a long way, that is, Europe, a carrier that provides 20-minute air support to the Arabian Sea. The carrier has CIC 3 black computer, 2 flat screen TVs and dimensions and maps on the wall. What hoot!
