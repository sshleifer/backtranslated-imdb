LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And that star? We need to know EDISON FORCE better. Actually, I knew better. But I was able to lease this STV at the moment of weakness. When you're a big name like Freeman and Spacey on a STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. Just like in Sat-i-shelf. Those who did it did. For good reason. This kind of criminal murder killer group is composed of MAGNUM FORCE and "journalist" Timberlake is brave enough to open them. It is targeted for his efforts - or maybe for his terrible player. One of the bad guys was put out of the ale after I shot down and I was careful not to smile before the fall. Just horrible. The real tip of how this flick is bad is to see Freeman on the cover and on the film with a shaved bearded sport that does not look like hobo. Only you know that the director is not in custody. Freeman is clearly vulnerable.
