This is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is more capable of watching this movie. As you can see, there is nothing more than an anti-racist bus, white nets, and a black status quo. The film is about a group of black men in Louis Farrakhan's bus trip to a million people. There are all kinds of people you can imagine in the bus: a gay, a Muslim, a supporter, and Tom Uncle (although it's thrown off the bus). There was only one white man in the bus. He was accused of being a racist one-minute drive from the bus. Although he is a Jew, he is happy to explain the situation, to be racist, and to leave the bus. I hate to say that, but such movies require their own hypocrisy and stereotypes. It should not be perceived as a victory, a faithful dissapointment. I can think of it as a racist to write, but I say good. Better chance for Spike next time.
