They were all full of me to see this movie. I was in New Zealand for a year to get rid of it. I'm not sorry and surely I should not set myself up for Clark's worst movie. This movie has a great deal of error. First, some of the players are great as Nick Stahli's 'The Bully' and brown brown-haired girl (I can not remember her name), but most of them are incredibly incredible and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of the Clark films, and he's so bright in Kids, but Bully puts his scene in such a celebration to turn his scene into a true parody. The scenario was written by a movie student in the first year. I do not want any apologies, a middle school student ... who has never seen a movie before. I did not understand Clark's intentions. Was this trying to show that the existence of children was meaningless? Hell did not enter into a bad curse. I'm not prude, but I did not need to see my 5-year-old teens and arms. I still retain Clark's best film, 'One Day in Paradise'. This is a fantastic thing and I do not think it will never exceed it.
