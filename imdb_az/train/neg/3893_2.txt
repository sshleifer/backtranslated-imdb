I thought that after the shadow was over, the main character, the astronaut, the poor condition of the case (his condition, skin, hair, muscle, etc.) could always get more movies. He should work like Blob. The front of this crack is pretty naked. An astronaut exposes to sun radiation (think) and begins to act as ice cream cone on a warm day. It is not just a thing, but it looks like it should kill people and consume their bodies so that it can protect some sort of cellular integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that when an accident or accident happened, it immediately turned into a killing machine? Why is this? <br /> <br /> The cosmonauts break up at night by breaking himself up, "breaking through" (without any security). Apparently, because he wants to return to space, he may have enough memory to head the pad. <br /> <br /> So, a part of the film is trying to find a doctor with a doctor wandering around a Geiger counter, trying to find the melancholy that the melt erupted. He kills a fishing groom like Bill Gates, a little girl, grieves Frankenstein's monster, and ends up with a ridiculous old couple (punishing them for stealing some lemons). Then there is a short scene where he breaks his former generals and is a very long scene where he killed a young potheater and followed his lover. I thought he would run away after cutting his arm, and the scene may change. But there is nothing ... we are shouting and screaming at a ten-minute corner of the woman, even though the monster goes. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is lamer than the rest. The melancholy man turns into a goo gathering, and then ... nothing. This is so. This is the end of the movie. Well, at least this meant that there was no place later.
