Madison county bridges are a better version of this story. The end of this movie was not as sensitive as it was in the original English movie. This movie is very sensitive, if you're crying in a movie, if the hero dies, you love this movie, on the other hand there is a warrior in life, and if you think you're crying, maybe a really good topic is Indian. Taboo was as good as his brother and mother. Everyone did a good move.
