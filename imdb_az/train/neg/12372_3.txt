High expectations of this movie (title, translation, "How are we to get rid of others"). After all, the concept is great: it has been decided that the right wing government of the ruling elite has come to the conclusion that the so-called freeloaders and generally the left wing have been the result of persistent verbal and legal persecution, and that everyone is killed. <br /> <br /> In many cases, it has become one of the many countries . <br /> <br /> This is perfect for Satira Bite! Only, this film is totally challenging. This satire is only available on several stages and absurd outputs, but this satire is not continuous; neither sharp nor witty. And for an ambitious comedy, the movie has no comic scene. I think that comedy situations are likely to be absurd, but the situation is very worried and very serious, instead of evoking laughter or thinking. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full of graves and errors. The action should focus on political aspects and how wrong a thing is, but instead of exploiting new laws is a fun young woman who is trying to save everyone, and it is a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this with the point! Such a film should not look so serious! This is a satire! Political statement. However, it does not even begin to solve the issue in essence. Maybe he was afraid to get too far? How cowardly! This is not art. SÃ¸ren Pilmark, very serious and now one of Denmark's absolutely top-level actors, was very good. It was a little fun of the movie. Everyone: There is nothing special (well, maybe, except Lenin Poulsen). <br /> <br /> In fact, most Danish films are a natural song of nature. No formulation, nor delivery. Why is it difficult to sound right? Why should it be so fashionable and artificial? Hopefully, people do not consider the general talks of the Danish people when they look at these films 50 years later. <br /> <br /> From 3 to 10.
