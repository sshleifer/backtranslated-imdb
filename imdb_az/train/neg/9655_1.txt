At the request of a woman I started watching this movie without any consideration. When it came to interest, did I think that there were people who recommended others to watch this movie? <br /> <br /> I was shocked to find long and positive feedback on this website. It led me to a scam. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers delayed or watching the retardation of viewers?" <br /> <br /> So, this band is a children's and a girl's (leading actress) is; it is assumed that there is approximately one ROCK band on the permanent presence of guitar. Hell, dancers began to be a part of the Rock band? Anyway, if you accept it as a Bollywood-version-of-a-Rock-band, but these two guitarists have all the cool "ROCK GESTURES" instruments, the guitar sound completely lost! I just do not understand the size of the stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I'm going to be here because it's not worth it to show any defects in the movie. Bollywood managers no longer look shameless !!!!!!!!
