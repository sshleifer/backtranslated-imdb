You will see how he is trying to imitate the "smart intentions" of the intelligent and powerful at the opening and how far he falls. And you will see what they do by rocking Robin Dunne like Valmont ... Then on the second stage, you'll see two of the best two things, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers, as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you acknowledge that Kathryn is not a blonde in the first movie ... Then if the film continues, you see a cheap romantic story after about a mile, and Sebastian has already met an Anette. past, here called Danielle and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... How original is a prequel. Later, he turns out to be the type of 'Wild Things' movie and many 'oh-my' twists. As I said, Robin Dunne is a very bad choice. He is not a bad actor, he is good ... He does not have the character of Riza. In my opinion, Amy Adams, one of our most talented young actresses, surrendered once again. But with all the talents in the world, this trash can not save. Generally, this movie feels like the episode of Beverly Hills, 90210. The score was stolen from 'Horrific Intentions' and 'Jaw Crusher' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER account ... Did they at least leave it alone? If you like More Thorough Intent, Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons.
