From the mid-1970s, Kris Kristofferson was able to climb on the screen near La Strauss's humongous ego and discount store feminism. <br /> <br /> No characters are really unpleasant; <br /> <br /> Glad to see Christopher's Ferrari go over this hill and crash. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie that can play a rock role, Buddy Holly Story_ (only a year and a half after this devastation).
