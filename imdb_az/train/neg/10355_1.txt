The 5th grade teacher liked this book because it reads it many years ago. I read it in each of the 3rd and 5th grade classes in the past 18 years of teaching. Probably a movie was prepared in the past, but I could not find it. Well, I was thrilled to hear that my students and I were showing Disney Madeline L'Engle's excellent book. <br /> <br /> I was hopeful when watching the movie. As I watched the film, I became even happier. They drowned badly! Ever since I've been in love with the movie I love from the book. I understand that films can not be booked, but I do not have to change them! Most, if not all, travel from the book was absolutely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I've just kept myself and I just discussed the film with my students. Yes, it's not just me. Even almost everyone did not feel the same - Madeline L'Engle was so skillfully created. <br /> <br /> Why was the miracle of the Student Khanate Star Wars movie like Chewbacca? Why did Calvin hair not be red? Why does not she have such a clever game as her "witch" material? Basically, all of us wondered - why should each detail be changed? <br /> <br /> I always imagine how beautiful this movie will be. I'm still waiting for this movie. It was the Wrinkle of Time in the most widespread feelings. I will write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over!
