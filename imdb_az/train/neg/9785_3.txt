This movie was special after school, it's not bad and it's a problem. Nothing will happen. You still feel like in the classroom. A boy teaches a young bunch of good paint ball players. We will not view this bad as bad as the good player teaches them. All of this suddenly turns into a good player. There are also many characters and character development. It is often spent on the main character and her sexual partner and is not enough for other children. This was a girl in the whole group of boys, and it could have been a feeling of Bad News Bears (original), but it did not make any difference to this movie. There is no sense and after watching it makes a bewildering pain in your bones, enjoys a bag, is fun and just kind ... there. Plain Do not bump. Something you're watching at the school after pre-evening nap. The day is long, dull, and this film is long and long awaited.
