It is not one of Lucio Fulci's best spells without any stretch of imagination. The area is very bad, a millionaire is killed, and her husband is calling on her to find out who she is. However, my biggest problem was that everyone was in need of care, except for knowing who killed him for 10 minutes to watch the film? Father, it is a great silence to everyone that everyone (including the daughter who asks them to help) come face to face and it is difficult to pay attention to who killed him. But nobody really looks for Fulci's flick for a really good movie, so it's like watching a porn for writing and acting incredible. She usually tries to compensate for her films by adding too many scenes, but this is not enough in the movie. If you are looking for a good Fulci beater, look Beyond.
