I've seen a lot of original films from the Sci-Fi channel, and since 2002, I've been watching them (first of all, it was Sabretooth, one of the more entertaining Sci-Fi channels). Their quality varies. Some are average, but worthy (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Heaven Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously filthy, and then there are really terrible things. Raptor Planet is the last one. <br /> <br /> A blank poster for the original Raptor Island of the Sci-Fi Channel in 2004, Raptor Planet is a challenging, unobtrusive blur of a film with a really sad movement and lazy post. The effects of dinosaurs' lives (puppet and animatronic, as well as photographs from CGI and Raptor Planet) are one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a budgetary budget. Gore's effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Some of the land (why I forgot) have a bunch of commandos who go to a planet of alien dinosaurs. This is a true nation, dinosaurs are foreigners. Dinosaurs in the space. What is next, the shark? The rest of the site is simple. Human pumps are taken and eaten. <br /> <br /> Now we have come to expect a large number of dinosaur films and novels, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've ever seen in the area where the dinosaur attacks really are. <br /> <br /> There are, however, a few giggles. There is a scene that is munched by a man who has been brought to life by a Carnotaur (originally brought to life by scene scenes) becomes a ghost raptor in seconds. Additionally, some trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur fired from his first film on his death scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Syfy has already released. Unexpectedly close.
