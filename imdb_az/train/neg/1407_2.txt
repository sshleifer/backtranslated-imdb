Life was a miracle, and I did not expect too much. It's hard to believe that these films are prepared by the same person, for example, if you remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is a two-hour horrible antics without any story. Underground's wild and humorous humor has turned into dark bottles here. As you can see, Kusturica went on unsuccessfully running comedies that confirmed life. The Black Cat starts with the White Cat, but I thought there were some signs of dementia. I liked his first films very much, and that's why it's particularly disappointing to see something like this. We hope the future will be great.
