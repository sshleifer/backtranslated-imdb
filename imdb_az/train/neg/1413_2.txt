I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, seductive and talented actress. I'm sure that would be a good movie, something happened. There is nothing. Short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes long. After one hour of disappointment I scanned the remaining 20 minutes. Freeman is playing an actor - exploring a piece of paper that he can play as a paying secretary in a supermarket - a non-working one. She looks at the supermarket she works with. Nothing will happen. She decides to go home and an Arby's, a Goal, go for a car wash. Nothing will happen. They talk about their lives. Nothing will happen. Nothing. <br /> <br /> I can not get it. But Bill Murray can not get the words "Missing in Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you love these movies, you will probably like it. Finding many people for this charming, seductive or frustrating cause - find out that the dialogue is interesting. In these first films, a common device is to have a long silence after reaching a line that the actor must be meaningful. We must understand this because it is followed by a two minute display on the screen. Sorry, I must be a Filist. I can not get it. For me, such films are not funny or attractive, thoughtful. They are only drilling. Why? Because there is no comedy. There is no drama. No tension. No laughs. There is no tension. No activity. There is nothing to watch. In short, I do not go to my movies. I can be free. I see oddball / quirky characters in real life. Going to the destination, fast-food restaurants and car wash. These elements do not film, and even the stars do it. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and you just love to hear about nothing, have fun. If you want to be beaten on Paz Vega, you can look at it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. General snoozefest.
