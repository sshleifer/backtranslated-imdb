"La Furia del Hombre Lobo" is an entirely unique story line that does not fit in any way with the previous Waldemar Daninsky movies. Someone has commented that this film should take place before the "Wizard Shadow" events, although they were later released ... they might be right, but I'm not sure. In any case, in this film, Waldemar Daninsky was crushed by an orphan in Tibet (a great dialogue here - an orphan, but that is impossible). he can prevent a wolf from changing the shade before he finds out that his wife has deceived her, changing one night to a beast, killing her and her love before fleeing the storm and before colliding with electricity, a professor of a dominatrix university conducting a series of inadequate experiments <br /> <br /> First of all, Jacinto Molina, Paul Naschi, whatever you want to call him, is a good thing, and he cares about his actor and his work. Although he always relied on him for a good performance Although the rest of the rash looks good enough, it's hard to say when the noise is heard over all its lines. And that was really the biggest problem for me ... most of the voicemails we used were just terrible, terrible, terrible. When I screamed in the movie, they conveyed their plot (they always refer to the hero like Waldeman). <br /> <br /> The director of Jose Maria Zabalza seems to be a hit-and-miss, but unfortunately, subtitles of Naschy films can not be found. some scenes have some great visuals, others are badly structured and poorly structured, especially on the last scene. The reason was that Zabalza was often drunk in his time. He allowed his fourteen-year-old nephew to re-write Molina's dialogue, used the appendix without permission, and photographed several of Molina's previous films. <br /> <br /> This film has lost the chance to become one of Molina's best works and it's no surprise that both of them are not working together again. <br /> <br /> But this is not all bad news. there are good ideas here. Some aspects of the story line create an interesting psychological drama with a victim, such as metaphor for jealousy and rage. The idea of ​​a "worm-bastard" is a return to Molina's next job. Some pretty awesome and surreal things fall into the fortress, and there is more than half a memorable sequence with Daninsky's home away from home, a murderous or harassing film - one scene is intense but really Molina's first film, "La Marca del Hombre-lobo "straight along with a few other shots. In fact, I found the movie to be very fun, though there are some problems with the Front Row Entertainment version, although there are so many clear cuts (though some may simply be deprived of the director's durability). The gods know what's going on there - maybe in the future, at one stage, I'll try to pull my hand into the unlucky version. <br /> <br /> This is usually part of the vineyard Nashi's experience with fans, but it would have been better and would not have brought a great deal of input.
