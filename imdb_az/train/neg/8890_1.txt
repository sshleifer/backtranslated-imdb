I can not believe what happened to these people for a perfect game for Shakespeare's first taste on the stage. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this is a very good thing. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the rest of the actors have to draw together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are you still dead, Romeo? The actor could not read his lines with any gusto, even though it was completely wooden and fatal. He was completely out of focus, even in the face of the Julian, and he did not have any grace with his lines. Whoever deserves to be punished for throwing him. Juliet is almost unpleasant, but it does not give a character to her character and does not touch the game completely. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely his character was entirely characteristic. Benvolio abducted with lines in a sensitive and compassionate manner. <br /> <br /> I had to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and the Cubans. The player was stilted and the suits were not curved. I saw the kindergarten puppet shows showing them more effort. I can only give this movie a zero rating.
