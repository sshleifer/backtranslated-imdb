Yes, I'm "bought" from Pasolini and her surroundings, but at the same time, his "Decameron" is largely overrated and a little uncomfortable. His "realism" (elephants, crowds, complexity, etc.), which he alleged, causes the behavior of the heroes to be absurd and obviously distorted. Behind Realism, Pasolini has used many non-actors, but their deer headlines are striking, and a painless irregular line usually gives you every kind of unusual and impartial feeling. And obviously - it is painful to look at people with many toothless, flawless characteristics. <br /> <br /> And Pasolini's "Decameron" is worried about (and at least) because of the occasional homosexual content. I recommend it because it's prudish or homophobic (I'm not), but Pasolini is emphasizing that it puts homoerotic pictures and situations, because it's contrary to neo-realism in other accessories, it's inappropriate and mandatory. I can almost hear him say, "Ooh - I need a cute, bare guy stick on this stage"! Sometimes, Pasolini is playing homosexual care for critics in the nose head, and sometimes appears to be looking at him in this aspect, regardless of whether the viewer can dominate. <br /> <br /> The meaning of 9 or 10 different stories in Decolleton's Decolleton was not part of Neoligism, but as a storyteller hit me like Pasolini's failure. Each story looks boring and therefore sincerely and with little savings. Even some of Pasolini's pityi ("Why is it so sweet to create an artwork when you are dreaming about it?") The last line of the film he sees finds me wondering why Pasolini is surprised. In my opinion, a well-prepared movie (and more homosexual) Fellini's "Satyricon". It is also packed with strange people and absurd situations, but although decameron is unsuccessful by those elements, it is a success due to pacing, direction and strong storytelling.
