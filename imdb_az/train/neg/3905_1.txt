Do not forget Plan 9, this is a basic fiasco, costume drama, inaccurate orientation, scripted, moving, and so on. This film is based on a much better novel of Isabel Allende. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (non-Spanish films) and other players, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are working hard to get this horrible scenario. How many mistakes (for example, when in Xmas in Chile?) And very brutal, because it is called "magic realism", it remains the worst movie of all time. Completely sucks!
