This is the worst and most romantic comedy I've ever seen. Each scene is worthy and two leading actors - Corey and Danny are very bored. Corey is very dumb and naive, and she should never listen to Danny's lies. <br /> <br /> The killer from Neve Campbell and Urban Legend is a recurring feature of this poor attempt of the film. Danny (Dean Paras) looks at a late-thirty-year-old girl and a girl trying to go to bed - Corey seems to be in college. <br /> <br /> In Australia, this film is called "To Smooth"; There's nothing straight about this movie. 1/10 Avoid it
