I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but it's not so bad. It's not fun, and it's more fun, with the fun of the fat guys, having no real story, having bad actors. Would you like to see this movie? I dont know! <br /> <br /> I think the creators of the film are trying to be original and creative, but this is something that is not completely kinematics by a 12-year-old boy. The so-called funny parts are funny as people cats and winds. <br /> <br /> Do not lose money in this movie! Please note that this movie is pleasant to you.
