"Raising Victor Vargas", at the same time, N.Y. Times is one of the family films that you can watch and shoot in the space puzzle. If you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and corona, you should not "Pause" on the DVD. Just quit, because you will not miss anything really important. There is no shortage, no turning or tension. This is, in fact, a film about a poor, struggling immigrant family that is not an ethnic film, but Latino. It could have been any ethnic group. Very little difference. I've seen millions of times before. Only a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family, or an Irish family. The accents and names were just different. The Vargas family was called Bush or Clinton, and if the Presbyterians were, the film would have been a general snooze. <br /> <br /> Here, critics were not able to do so locally. Some said that the Spanish is Harlem. Bronx, some of them are Brooklyn. As a lifetime New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East. It seemed that the family did not meet anyone except the other Latinos. They lived in an insulated / isolated small encoder. Some non-Latin relationships may have created some excitement, interest, or tension. <br /> <br /> Remember the event on the West. <br /> <br /> Now for criticized cinematography. I do not know if there is a TV or not, but all the closed photos looked me very ORANGE. Apt, furniture and faces were all ORANGE. What did this mean? And that's it. looked very intense on me. Here one of the oldest apt / tenements said that one of the big rooms. Yes, maybe 50 years ago. Which landowners can do something like 2 or 3 smaller ones and squeeze many immigrants. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing .... I've seen this week and criticized the second family movie, showing a teenage boy "crushing off". Is it necessary to watch our special sex work? Please protect me! What are these directors? <br /> <br /> Thus, "Victor Vargas" is a nice movie. There was a change in the ability of young Latino actors to see their talents and give them a break. But writers have left them blank and fuzzy to make them work. Enjoy your show but keep your fingers close to the "fast forward" button.
