This adaptation strengthens a classic for sensitivity. Timothy Dalton has no idea about the different nuances of Rochester's character. Even I have read a lot of books, I feel a part of it in very tight columns, and it's a characteristic summary that says "Acute, dark, dark past". Rochester is miraculously transformed into a barrel, as it is not a character or a real person, but as it is on the upper bush that smile will never fall. There is no chemistry. This excitement of my excitement was merely a sympathy and sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who was definitely returning to his grave. BOOK AND BOOK. ROCHESTER WAS AWARE. OR YEARS: YOU ARE NOT LIKE YOUR SUCCESSFUL LOVE SATISFACTION.
