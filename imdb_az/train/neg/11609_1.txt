I am not from America and I know what the "Swap Swap" is. After leaving a show on this name, I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sex moments in the program. But what happened to me? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is a show that reflects the current American / Western family state, overweight slavish nations, contaminated teenagers, and their succeeded family pictures. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more precisely) have been selected to live in one another's homes and, in the new rule, to rearrange family regularity. Sometimes it turns out to be good or even worse. In the latter section, each mother is brought along with her husband and every family is trying to finish their work in the past. The savings portion of the program was for each bidders struggling for their rights. I had to see all of these things before I saw a little cool adult sex. I would like to tell you who will fulfill this program, more than just saying "Wife Swap"; better to be called 'Home Swap'. All this stops to change the real wife breaks all the great things! <br /> <br /> Woman changes wife = Average suck Reality Show.
