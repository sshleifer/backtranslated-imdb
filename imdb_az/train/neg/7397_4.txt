I've seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals and has always impressed me that I've seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> It was a very well-prepared and directed for a school movie, but the story ... something else needed to be a bigger and more interesting movie. The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie very much ... <br /> <br /> Parabens! (congratulations!)
