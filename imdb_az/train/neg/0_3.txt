The story of a person with unnatural feelings against pigs. It starts with the opening scene, which is a great example of absurd comedy. The audience of the official orchestra has turned into a terrible, fierce band with its bewitching singers. Unfortunately, it is completely flawless, in general, without any worldwide artistic work, which ultimately makes it difficult to put it down. Even those who are in the era should be extinguished. Cryptic dialogue is easy for Shakespeare's third-grader. At the technical level you can think with a good cinematography by the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederick Forrest can be seen shortly.
