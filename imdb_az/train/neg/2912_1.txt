"Folding Machine" has become one of the most complicated, terrifying and exaggerated fantastic fantasy films I have ever encountered. This is good for a bloody, sleazy and humorous context, with a bad story and a story approaching one another. Violence is not particularly terrible and does not irritate you, but it's free bloodless and naked. Works by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are not the work of Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has everything, it's bad for the bone! A must see for every b-movie freak! ... Simply: a taste and a rare stone.
