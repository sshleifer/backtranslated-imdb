I hear the upcoming "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Blu-ray Disc". During the past 25 years, it will be interesting to see if it is possible to revive the franchise while continuing from glass to CGI. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Betamax VCR" was a brilliant event in entertainment history. I only help remove the bad taste of my mouth with all Manavion demonstration fiasco. "After demonstrating Leonard Nimoy Compact Trumpet" and luxury "Leonard Nimoy" has featured 8-Track Bant waiting for such a celebrity cinema? Now I think, I'm crying.
