If you want to make a movie like this, the danger needs to be real. Do not cover patsy with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The area is elegant and incredible. Acting is even worse. I thought that when I saw the main character, watching Artur Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history. Well, at one point he has to deal with music and fight barefoot. Do not care about me. Are you All these long scenes are in this strange office (furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People speak and smoke, and do not do anything. Most of the activity takes place in a five-minute sequence. It's over now. Please do not worry.
