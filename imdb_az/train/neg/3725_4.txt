This is an interesting treat of a very controversial topic (read other comments about this movie only). As you can see, you love it or hate it, and most people are different, as they are described in the film, because they are confronted with the difficulties and the end. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film - and its sequels - were developed for about $ 1.30. The production values ​​are the same as the "Plan 9 out of the Space" and the actor "Glen or Glenda" (I do not apologize for Ed Wood). Putting aside the religious message, the story is something that is scary. <br /> <br /> Did not try to bring this movie and its subsequent works. For this reason, the causes of difficulties. "Behind the Left" and "Omega Code" tried to bring everything to "Thief" and began to explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East. The Net Effect, Thief, has also done a better job in the film's fears while trying to explain what happened in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> Forget your policy and watch the movie and its followers - horror stories. Because they can be terrible stories, they are even more frightened by God. If you think about the topic, you will not even believe it.
