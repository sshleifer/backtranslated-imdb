If I write a review about a movie, it will probably be with me ... but generally I've seen it two weeks since I will not be forgotten. Why are you worried? Because I am still watching a low-cost movie that is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It was great, but at least it was not tolerated ... errors are not always a comedy but it's rattling me up. It was just a sweet bouquet ... and if you can not take it, stay in the dressing room boy. <br /> <br /> I agree with the defenders of this movie, because I am sure that he has requested his targeted demographics and will not be a single adult. <br /> <br /> Here and there are some good giggles, but nary is a side splitter. Of course, this is foolish and just gentle fun, but at least do not ask (many said that). Maybe they are afraid of the vulnerable sides of these nations? <br /> <br /> I was forced to rate the earphone ear, so 4.5 or 6 is really a good rating in my book. This means 4 parts of the transmitter, and this will increase the rating at the time of writing. By giving 1 or 10 as many as possible, rating numbers are meaningless. I do not believe how or why someone feels this unforgettable feather (or I'm worried about writing about it). Have I lost anything? <br /> <br /> In any case, Emma Roberts performs his role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often fails when his character is caused by his writing the b * ch roles. <br /> <br /> If you are adults, you can miss this mission. But if you have a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared to hate it (even if you can do it).
