A movie that features future trends in English popular music, most likely, is ridiculous. Tommy quick? Cats? The movie DOES has a song by Spencer Davis, two animals, and a live version of Beatles's Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But all this is an unusual show of British music in 1964. Oh and Hermits Hermits.
