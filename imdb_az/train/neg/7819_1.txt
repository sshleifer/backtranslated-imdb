... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe connected with Boogeyman. Terrible, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations and did not respond to them! Honestly, I will not think of anything good. so there are the worst dots ... <br /> 1. OPERATION 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOG and finally .... 6 PLOT Did you know that many questionable questions were filmed for 2:32 hours, then Lex Luthor and Superman were not on the stage and that they had to solve the problem for 3 minutes, or did they really think that nobody was aware? <br /> <br /> <p> Kevin Spacey spent half the budget to satisfy this job? <br /> <br/> When Superman arrives at the hospital, why doctors say, "What do you want, what do you want?" Even though they ask him, he's a wildlife F! We do not know about anatomy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lastly, <br /> <br /> In general, I think for you guys wondering how the Superman will lift the whole continent ... <br /> <br /> As long as you do not see the green thing in the rocks until it is affected by the kryptonite from the milkman, so the continent is not just suppressed by its shiny green rock. <br /> It did not seem that this or the writers did not think it was a fairly obvious error.
