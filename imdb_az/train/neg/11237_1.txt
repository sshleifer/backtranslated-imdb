I went to see this movie with little expectations, but I hope to be charming by seeing my home town. Unfortunately, this is about my existence. The story covers a familiar area (secondary school merger), but the plot is a rough and unnatural element adds to this well-obsolete subject. The player's quality was good, but the content of the movie was terrible. Sexuality of the film was clear - whether women are not married, if they do not, or not both (although this is post-feminist choice). Even worse, racism - a Jewish mother, was still worse than a black man living in the house and a severe oppression. If this symbol is meant to represent the inhabitants of Kalamazu, we should be embarrassed to bring such wide and brutal stereotypes to the screen.
