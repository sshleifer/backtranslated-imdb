Wow, I love and respect David Lynch. But this is something that attempts to make the first movie a fake art video. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Lynch is usually a filmmaker, but it has little visual content (empty walls, "). David Lynch is usually proud of the sound, but he also hears the video camera's consciousness. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is difficult to swallow the idea that it is related to this movie. ... <br /> <br /> This is a joke on the side of David to find supporters only for hours (by hours) by calling his website. I hope at least this is funny.
