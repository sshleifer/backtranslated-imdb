This little show is obviously a spin off of a series of unreliable little prequel / original series. <br /> <br /> This show is totally shocking compared with the live action series. The live action was poems and story lines. <br /> <br /> Sabrina has several goals. uses magic to correct it. The main idea is every episode. The most strange episode was when using magic to become Gem and Gem to be Sabrina Sabri. Thus, Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes the orange to become his slave. It then led to a strange, but very interesting scene: "Gem says that I'm now" and Harvey kisses his feet and kisses his hands and knees and kisses like a god. However, this stupid spin-off does not need time or effort.
