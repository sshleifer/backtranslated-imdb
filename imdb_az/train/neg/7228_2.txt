Well: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good Dresses. Production of top notch sets. <br /> <br /> As you know, the fifth element of the horrific blend of actors with all CGI structures blends with Final Fantasy. CGI players look worse than video games a few years ago. Defective logic. A gigantic pyramid emerges and nobody investigates it, does anyone really have questions? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <strong> Ugly: Terrible post. A very unnecessary subpoppy with very thoughtfulness is not entirely implemented. The dialogue almost laugh at some points. Unsolicited characters and events. Dull symbols. Jill should have been a mystery, but apparently it was a mystery to the writer. Nothing to him. He is not interested and is bored to watch. There is no substance, no seeds. His character has no irrepressible qualities. In fact, the whole film has no purpose, no purpose (except for Horus's obviously), there is no motive. They are thought poor and bad. There is no share - opens for writing. Horus will not be immortal, but a great thing is a bad man. No one knows whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is a problem: devoting half of the film to each character is never a challenge, despite the full character of the writer. They cut out cartons that explore parts of a beautiful set that travels around and chatting and does not do quite a lot. Pacing for the first time director. Slow, slow, slow. I'm watching the movie while writing it. He did not care about it because it was boring. Everything is straight. <br /> <br /> <strong> Threadbare story, sub-par character development , does not maintain a beautiful set of dark CGI.
