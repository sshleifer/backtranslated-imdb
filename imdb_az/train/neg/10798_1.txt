Yes, Kazaam is one of the worst films in the world, not just about children's films but everything that is wrong with humanity. Well, Shag is a charming soul - the RAPPING jeans - everything puts everything together, does everything to make unhappy clothes, ends up in a Christ, and creates a lot of light like it. So, yes, really wait for the cheese bats, the first wish is a forgotten meal from the sky (and, unfortunately, the two main characters, not to beat the child). What awaits a child and a movie with Shaquille O'Neill will be incredibly shmaltzy! The main square of the film covers these children, which is a very typical and annoying-child fashion with Frank Capra's grandson (here the child screams her dialogue in a furious way), trapped in a bum-box. <br /> <br /> In some cases, she has betrayed Shaq-keen twice after several years. <br /> <br /> For a million other films (that is, from the father to the son, "two luck in life"), there would be a really hilarious, brave boy and father story that would be bad. But there are both Shaquille O'Neill to watch the movie. Capra is not planning to get more treatment, to rap within the dialogue, and to start his flourishing record career. Moreover, he throws himself into the donkey and names the main bad guys who want to return to the boom box. Does the movie have a camping factor? Up to a point, however, this does not even work with the rest of the material, all the feelings and breaths of "heart feelings". If the filmmakers, obviously, were in a fun or convincing place, Michael Jordan may ask a comrade who is interested in doing the job of the BASKETBALL player who wants to go. I hope they also know that they are paying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I hope you feel at least a little guilty of feeding the Shaq-car. <br /> So you're more entertaining, pointing smart. Hell can be interesting for a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel. But if you are thinking of taking several brain cells, stay away from many candidates in 1996 for the worst fist and the worst of the 90s.
