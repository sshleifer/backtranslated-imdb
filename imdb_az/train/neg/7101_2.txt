I would give this movie a zero to one, but I'll give it a double. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan is not really a cause in the film. The last point is that Rani is seen in this movie and is discreet with Kamal. I love Rani and respect him as a great actress. Despite being kissed by Kemal in this movie, I did not love him, but it's not a big deal. Anyway, the scenes of the bedroom that differentiate this movie are enough to talk really about this movie. Good or bad, so I think it's a completely trash film that burns me. If you were a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ views by clicking on my name and I have a great taste. The film is not fun, and if it is thinking about being hit hard, there's no moral in this movie. His biased film is not a real story and is wrong. Kemal's kissing these actresses makes me sick, Man can not kiss properly anyway.
