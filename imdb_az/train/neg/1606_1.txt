Each one has about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything. They are General Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, the general inspector general of Chavez's traditional backers. Still now, despite his announcement, he is the Ministry of the Interior y Justicia. After returning to Chavez, he took over the responsibility of Ministro del Defensa (alongside Defense Secretary in the United States). <br /> <br /> He did not give any information about Chavez's orders about the shooting against the concentration of the Pacific people in the elections. <br /> <br /> Chavez did not say anything about the people in this concentration that killed his supporters (or civilian and military officials). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you .... This movie is just a lie or a big lie.
