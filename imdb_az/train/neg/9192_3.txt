I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. The most zombie movies are in place, so it becomes clear. 28 days after Romero's "Dead" trilogy. <br /> <br /> It's really possible to see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> This is actually a music video that goes faster and more and more heroism. People here are no horrors. Sometimes it's just a few scenes, sometimes scene scenes, the last one, because the last one ... and the last one ... and the last one ... and soon you dropped the DVD player in 3 minutes by mistake, which actually did the movie. Unfortunately. I think that everyone in the film industry can use it for $ 7 million better than this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! ROYALLY is a combination of images from annoying arcade games. I played the game. This sucks. Why did they put him here? True, this is not a music video, it is poor. 3/10 <br /> Rated Rated: Violence / gore and blasphemy
