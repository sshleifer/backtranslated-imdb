Can you say a mile off of a Lew Grade production? English style; concept epic; surrounded by stars from all over the world; is usually built in exotic environments. Grade and its ITC company are the formula that results in the names of the Eagle Lead, the Firefighter and the Titanic lifting in the early 80's in the early 80's! The Mart Or Die, produced in 1977, produced an extremely old Legion adventure that modeled all of the above-mentioned features. Generally managed by trusted Dick Richards? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> In a short time, after the First World War. Their task is to protect an archaeological side facing special Francois Marneau (Max Von Sydow). Archaeologists are engaged in excavations in the ancient city of Erfud, but they are afraid of the Arab tribes' attacks after the disintegration of the archaeological group. Foster is not happy with the assignment? does not care about historical works deserving the people who endanger their lives. This ensures a sustained tension between itself and Marneau because legionnaires must sacrifice their lives to make excavations possible. Problems are rising when Simone Picard (Catherine Deneuve) draws a beautiful woman with legionnaires. She hopes to learn what happened to her father, a historian kidnapped by the Arabs after his first archeologist collapse. His involvement creates desires among legionaries, sex thieves Marco Segrain (Terence Hill) is more than a seductive and brave rabid who has been negligent to legionnaire colleagues, but gradually grows in size. <br /> <br /> What started with a great war in Erfud claimed that they were trying to defend against legionaries who were pushing their armies with the armies of the united Arab tribes. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman and Terence Hill's star duo appear to be incompatible with Hackman, a weighty Oscar-winning actor from numerous budget spaghetti western, sensitive, but limited to the Italian heartbreak. Hackman expects the other side to get off the screen. But surprisingly, Hill is a Hackman who gives a poor and positive performance, even surprisingly raising the game at a high level. The film is attractive in the desert, but the pacing is quite slow and does not take into account a few of the characters. Maurice Jarre's music is rare? The man who gave us Lawrence Of Arabia was very disappointed. It is nervous that everybody tested an ancient adventure of this species in the 1970s (peaked in the 1930s, and all this was forgotten over decades). Unfortunately, gambling does not really pay? For Legionnaire this respect is more than just a walk.
