Do not waste your time with this movie. It is a common horror in terms of acting, directing, sounds, and sounds ... It's a loss of performance of some very good players. The film does not justify Paresh Rawal, perhaps one of Bollywood's most talented actors. Akshay Kumar, an emerging star, also made a very poor job. John the Baptist, what happened to him? What is your name? Perhaps, if there is such a prize in Bollywood, he must thank God for not paying Razzie awards in India. <br /> <br /> The Boeing Boeing Boogie's 1965 Boogie's Scenario was a very bad frame. Above all, people in Bollywood can not just make something original. Moreover, they did not know what to copy. The jokes in the movie were too late, and it was painful to sit on them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he is not eligible to make a good Indian movie. The sound is incredibly unhappy. <br /> <br /> Bollywood should be ashamed of taking such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that somebody loves this movie. What have you been living? This is the reason Bollywood is. Did you know that Bollywood has taken more than Hollywood, but most of the films did not hear it because of these films? I'm Indian and I'm ashamed of Bollywood to make this piece. The films, such as Chah Hai and Lagan, were just terrible. They are world-class films that are timeless among the best of decades. Garam Masala, perhaps one of the worst of the century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it to one of the 10's.
