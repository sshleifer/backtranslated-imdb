I carried out this movie from the library (it was hard to find a good reason) is completely out of curiosity. I'm a great fan of Plath and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The scenario does not go beyond the original novel text, but it is horrible, not because it is out of focus or intent. The scenes are inaccurate and can not be watched anywhere in the audience. What are the hockey voices on Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has nothing to do with Greenwood's condition; Plato poetry has been completely abused. Marilyn Hassett was totally unbelievable as soon as she was filming (she was at the age of 32 at Plath at that time) and sometimes because of her inability to act, like Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old in this regard). Hassett is not all feeling, no craftsmanship, skill. Direction is mediocre; The director just covers the ones there, not so much. The only reason I gave the movie 1 is 0. Sorry, Sylvia should wait for someone else to suit your good work.
