I walked through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. Remembering that she loved her as a child, I decided to check it out. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie that should pass. <br /> <br /> It is not worth seeing alone. It is very boring and uninteresting. I think it would be such a way for younger children. There is no magic in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible, but you can only look at yourself for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments in a strange situation. Witch's character is not very good. It is not a big thing for the family to have these things happen. I know that this is a children's movie, so it's a bigger audience that we do not need to look at many things, but the whole movie is written and produced from people who have never had any experience in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The DVD I started to jump in at the last minute of the movie and just trying to fix it, I just turned it off and back to Netflix. Indeed, I did not pay attention to how it ended. Skip this movie and read its book.
