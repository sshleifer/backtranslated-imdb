The first episode was set at a very high level. William Hurt played as a hit man who contracted to kill a wedding founder. We are told very little about his character or he pays to kill him, and the episode is really a sign of no dialogue. His modernist penthouse is packed with toy soldiers returning, giving him a smile, but he is dismissed and continues to work. But hell is a night, soldiers survive and fight, jeep, machine guns and bazooka firing, and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for a television show, and sometimes it is very intense when circling around the apartment using their views to protect from the upper and the other. I do not want to end it, but it is enough to say that a clever little twist. This gave me hope for the rest of the array, but it was a disappointment, and all other episodes were trash, and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixed bag and they are no exception
