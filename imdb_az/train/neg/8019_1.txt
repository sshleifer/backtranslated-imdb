I read more than half a dozen other user comments in this squad and their thoughts differ greatly. I have to agree with those who find this movie horribly. It writes to me that I hope this could be a great thing, or I will not worry about seeing this day. Now I love to support the film, especially if it's gay-themed, but this film is too few to endure. When I thought about it in about three minutes, the men I had left were probably not compelled to bomb the $ 11.00, or that they would not just go anywhere and would not get better. <br /> <br /> In some cases, he has been out of work for several years. That's a kleuth. She is gay. I agree with that. The problem is that the main character in a movie is boring, and the film does not mean it's boring! As a child's burden, you just do everything you learned on the first scene, rebuild the second scene, and so on. And so on. There are very scenes in this child who puts around ... No one goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything remotely deep or funny or exciting. Probably not the least empathy for Logan, the most horrible. It is also a great success. As he grew up, he did not change or did not learn (there was nobody to teach him), he did not do anything and neither the movie! <br /> <br /> The scene is not a movie after the same thing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title does not give any meaning. 1/10.
