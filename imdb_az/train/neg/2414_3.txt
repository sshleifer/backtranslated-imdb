I put this flick on the stamp under the "new releases" and found it to be a hip-hop zombie flick idea. Here's how it's billed on the box, and I'm telling myself, "What a beautiful idea!" I thought. There is also a sign "Welcome to Oakland" on the cover. How can I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only continued until the launch. Hip-hop music and hip-hop culture did not play much in the film. I live in Oakland, and I know there are many aspirant hip hop artists, so the low budget of this crack is no pretext to have a soundtrack not fit. Fighters missed any chance to contribute to this flick. <br /> <br /> After the film's filming, it was a totally typical zombie movie with a cast that was completely black and Latino. You might think that the film is an unusual fun ... but it did not do it. In any case, the Quiroz Brothers "City Culture" vision falls into the drive and shoots F-Bombs on each line in the film. The use of the word "reptile" is probably the most distinctive feature of this film; There was a line of three to four times, and no line was at least once. I do not run out of writing in a movie, but the feeling here is that the writers (including the Quiros brothers) have no idea, and the scenario was generally very weak. br /> <br /> The film was generally a disappointment. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the zombie climax of "urban culture", but the "Living Dead Hood" does not count this number. The characters in the film could easily be white or old-fashioned or something else. There was no difference in the film. Not only is it a bad budget fraud, with only bad movements, angry writing, amateur orientation, gentle cinematography, cheap soundtrack and nothing else.
