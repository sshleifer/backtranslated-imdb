When I hear Hazzard Dukes actors and a restored script, "Well, I'll give you a chance, it will not be better than the first, but I'll see what happens." What I saw. I've seen the 80's of a classic 70's humiliated by Hollywood. It is sad to see that Hollywood writers can not deal with something original today. They are forced to take a great show with a big target audience, and we need to do the classic show "REMAK". Hollywood head ... DOES NOT WORK! Anyway, more about the show. I think they have left a better player than Sean William Scott to play with Bo (American Pie Stiffler). I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed about how his character is described and used. Also, like Luke Duke, get the truth for Johnny Knoxville. How can you go down? A malevolent jakas actress who plays Lovely Luke. It bothered me. Also, I'm going to give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but that's something she's been doing. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a smart, sexy, strong, intelligent, and a good IL girl. She grew up in the role model of every little girl! (I've had a puppet and jeep - thank you very much!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a clever donkey like Daisy Duke, a 2-bit whore. Daisy was never a blonde. Why Should You Throw It? Jessica Alba played great Daisy Duke. He could speak with a great southern accent, and he was beautiful and did a great job. Anyway, I want to say that this movie created something fierce. I cost $ 8.50 for tickets, and I have to return my money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series) do not see this movie. Only you will be upset. CMT (country's music television) plays Duke's repertoire at night. So, identify TIVO and go on with something real, not in imitation of Hollywood on the big screen.
