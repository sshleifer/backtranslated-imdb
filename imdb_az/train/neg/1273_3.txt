There are two good things to say about this movie: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (given that he works in dialogue and direction). However, he said that they saw that this film was very tiring. It would be more entertaining to watch the paint dry. It looked more than 97 minutes. Paul Reiser is talking about each other and repeating everything that is said to him on the phone, starting with the opening sequence, the movie is annoying. The film is packed with clich√©s and barbells, not to mention the endless events from the Falk's rhinoceros. Also, the director has difficulty thinking about laughing or tears. There are some sequences to be touched, but all are played for laughter. If you appeal to schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" you will love it. But if you're hoping for something more, look at a different movie.
