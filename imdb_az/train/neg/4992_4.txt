This movie is another average squirting, but it would be much better. When the guns came out they really needed some choreographic aid. Someone like Andy McNabb would have been making a shocking move like Heat when carrying the street from the robbery - making dull activities a special thing. The rest of the film was good - predictable, but waiting - better than this one. Then came the moment when we were waiting for the last scene, but in the 80s something like the A-team was watching. They hit the wild, there is nothing, and around a house trying to kill each other - both the same old and the same old.
