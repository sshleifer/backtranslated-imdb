Although this film is very narrow scenery, cinematography and wildlife, such a rave review is difficult to train the company's weak points. Nevertheless, these things do not have enough satisfactory space, and its execution is so hopeless. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my children, and none of us was affected by the end. Yes, the pictures are great, there is a magnificent view of the forest and the mountains, but what was the foreground? A very boring story of an insipid girl's fool, who easily learns a very basic lesson about friendship with a very light spouse and easily tracks something. Of course not a new story, in fact there is nothing new to the way, and we have all seen it before and really more charming by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing taken from this film is how to work with these beautiful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
