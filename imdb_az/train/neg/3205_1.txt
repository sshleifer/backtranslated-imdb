I would like to state that most of the people who debate this film have justified their comments on MST3K. It's fair enough (ie, after the most extensive exposure), but I would like to share a few ideas and comments that resemble the genuine genuine "Original Justice". <br /> <br /> First of all, The MST3K should be considered as one of the most appropriate, because first of all, Rossano has a meaningful scene between Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I use the names of characters instead of the actors instead of "Venantino Venantini"), Venantine's refugee character immediately Let me explain Malta will not be able to leave. (This is not a very cautious spot, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) I did not know it was because this time was cut off or did not feed too many reefs. Another plot point missing in the Orbilie: Venantino Venantini's betrayal of Joe Don Baker, as seen, is an unprecedented situation in the version of MST3K, which is explained by a very unpleasant scene from Venantini's shower . However, if there is reason to oppose it, all the scenarios are true ... icky. <br /> <br /> Some of the MST's worthy moments (sheriff's "son son" and "deja vu" continuous cuts) <br /> <br /> One scene I want to turn into MST3K: Before that, Joe Don asks Malta's police officer to stay abroad because "they look at uniforms, they will not cooperate." However, Joe Don has been completed with his brilliant cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, shiny badge! <br /> <br /> One final observation of the original, uncut version of "The Last Justice": Why, oh why? Do you think Venantino Venantini's naked butt should be on the screen?
