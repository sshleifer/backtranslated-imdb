The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) was sexually humiliated by his classmates and was then exposed by a lab explosion (also by them) that his face was exposed to acne. Years later all the flowers are invited to secondary school (because they are closed) for reunion. What they do not know is that Marty invites them to kill them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The scandals in Scuddamore are much worse than the oppressor (he was robbed, put his head in a toilet, and burned) and worried about watching. It is not possible to see Scuddamore committing suicide shortly after being released. Also, this film goes its way to nudity. Scuddamore has a full frontal (surprising for any movie), but a girl has decided to buy only a hammock ... Then they know that a killer goes around them later! And then there is a pair of sexually explicit. This is the type of movie that the killer knows where everyone is and can teleport itself. It slipped in to me and my eyes twisted, and then there was another twist on me that wanted to shoot something heavily on TV! Leader, wealthy - not good but strange. Caroline Munro is also on this subject. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ RTI> Otherwise, the mill is flowing and unforgettable. Scuddamor's tragic suicide has paid more attention than it deserves.
