<br /> <br /> At least the brutality and the deaths of life are a story, but these scenarios are simply incomprehensible and simply foolish. <br /> <br /> Life has gone anywhere, there is no story that is unreadable. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <<I can not get it, the mask in prison an unmanifested masked murderer, a scene of the prison aggression, is an event that allegedly inflicted an ugly deformed serial killer and killed him and nothing else? no explanation, no penalty, a really weak basic police character, the loss of an actor like Pare, did not try to torture a boy, a woman, and a dog, and sent them to you <br /> <br /> For some reasons, For this reason, police are in the dark at night in their own house, with an officer written in the dark (separate), and a police officer listens to one another in darkness and does not go for any reason until each one is killed. <br /> <br /> Spouse and relatives differ from each other. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. Otherwise, Boll is just about to throw away the animal fantasies. No matter what. <br /> <br /> Then, if Pare had killed her, she believed in a psychological word for the family to go ... a more stubborn, dreamy policeman you saw in a movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not trying to hate all of his works. I try to find a reason to explain the art of a scary writer, but these things ... a disaster. <br /> <br /> What is Boll? <br /> <br /> If you want to see Bolli, then you know many more people who can not afford to get the budget. <br /> <br /> Best of all, it was really good at the Mail Control.
