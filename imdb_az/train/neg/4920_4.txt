In the Dracula story (although with traditional silver), it is a very dark, modern (terribly ridiculous) thing, if not the darkest prince. For the first time I tried to follow, I could only pass through half of my interest. Still, it turns out to be a good start (especially with scenes with thieves and encounters with Dracula), but then less attracted to my attention when it comes to paying attention to the daughter of New Orleans Van Helsing. It's a great place to set up, but never (Dracula did not use any of the clandestine paradise that she could blossom). Designed by Wes Carven (and therefore called it), but written by Patrick Lussier. Sincerely, these moments have been spent with several imaginary visuals, but some kinetic edits and cheap tears do not help. Horrible script is very kind. Lussier is a polished polished job by placing a lot of blood (obtained according to makeup) and many "Virgin" ads. No, I do not mean girls, music company, as with numerous shooting, Helsing's daughter works there as well. Significant sowing was not. Soundtrack is a rock-color soundtrack. Now, the performances are on the whole store, but there are still some people who are familiar (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler, like Dracula, just did not come. It was just brilliant by the night's fleshy ladies; Like Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan Dracula's brides. Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell's love are respected. Christopher Plummer gives an entertaining turn for Van Helsing and Omar Epps.
