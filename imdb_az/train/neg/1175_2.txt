Much has been done to fill the background with the use of digital technology to suppress the background. Sometimes it works well, and Grace and his servant are particularly distracted by the coming visit to the King. At other times, the movie resembles a home video, giving a strange amateur look. However, the great failure, the inactivity of the mise scene, creates an alienating effect on the audience. We know that what we see is not real, so how can we feel for the character? To be frank, I did not pay attention to what happened with Ms or Duke. <br /> <br /> Another great failure, I regret, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. He is on almost every scene and based on the success of the movie or otherwise. OK speaks a foreign language, but real emotion can not be expressed. He caused some embarrassing laughter in the audience, seeing the head of an emotionally-directed scene on the scene, which he recalled to his friend Mme de Meyer (debutant Helena Dubieel's excellent performance). Also, watch your hands while expressing your feelings! <br /> <br /> All this, especially in a film that is very disappointing, given the positive comments on this site.
