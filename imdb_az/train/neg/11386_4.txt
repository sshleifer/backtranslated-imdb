One of these thanks is I-Don't-live documentary. <br /> <br /> In Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, Medellin has two warring groups in the surrounding nations. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and deaths are rapidly spreading. Children not over 22 years old, those who are not in the war, are in prison. Girls ?? are women, girls? Always in the same way, when one of them is killed, he shouts with tears. Shake your head. what have they waited, really? I do not know what's more disturbing: night shooting and civil unrest or everyone else just passively takes everything. Or does he see the boy drinking his first beer, all of which are all 10? <br /> <br /> If you did not get any of these young people's situations and would have given them more opportunities, how long would you choose to stay? <br /> <br /> This documentary, I'm all scared.
