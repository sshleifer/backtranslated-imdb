This film was not afraid, but it was not very good. I'm a great fan Tony Collette I think it's a very nice and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, a writer and a book from a 14-year-old boy. The book is large and does not believe a child has written it. Tony Collette plays the children's guardians if you do not know if this child really is or she does all this. <br /> <br /> I do not believe the film will be destroyed, but I will say that the movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The player is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance is both awesome and Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> For the film, I would expect the DVD to come.
