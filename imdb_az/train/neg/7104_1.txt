Filmmakers are offering to pay for funeral expenses for anyone who is afraid of watching this movie. They should offer intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really uses this stinker. A young couple came out of the house and lived in a woman who seemed to be a woman of a couple. Extremely boring and highly anticipated. In the end, I started not to care for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not spoil everything.
