In my opinion, this was a shocking bad movie, which was full of misery for a total of 102 minutes. It's pretty bad at all levels; <br /> <br /> B's plan does not have charm. <br /> <br /> B's plan does not have charm. <br /> <br /> Plan B does not have any charm. <br /> <br /> This genre has the size of transmission, and I have found myself in the physical hell at various points that make up the wrong-to-do meanderings anywhere in the comedy comedy region. <br /> <br /> Good film of a movie covered with sweet saucer.
