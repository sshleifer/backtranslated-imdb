This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main character does not have chemistry and the player is terrible. Paul Rudd is not the only one thing that has any talent. I have never watched the Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is in this show but she was terrifying in this movie. He does not know anything about the player. All his character is whine along the film and he can shoot a b **** and still be entertaining. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And another girl, Lake Bell , displays less emotions and looks like cards as you read. <br /> As far as the story is concerned, the cookie is so cut off. A little surprise goes from point A to B. It could have been used more as a soul with Kate. <br /> <br /> </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
