<br /> <br /> The beginning of this film is perfect with a great sound and a beautiful humor, but soon after its becoming an animation, it loses its strength quickly. <br /> <br /> At least for some of those reasons, in most animations, colors are very silent with very little contrast. The best VHS does not look good. It turns out in a while and looks great, but often, too, the characters come too soon and go. For example, I've seen more of Moby Dick. When the film starts dragging, it re-creates at the entrance of the dragon, and then finishes the film strongly. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was not quite memorable or could not compete with the major animated films of the last decade.
