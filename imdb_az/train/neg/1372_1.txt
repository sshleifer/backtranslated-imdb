I've seen it on TV. I'm glad to go to the cinema to see it or to rent the money. The film can be completely predicted - from the owner of the corruption and from the planner to the swinging power cords. The area is really weak and unbelievable - an avalanche expert crashes a 20-meter bone fracture wave (using actual footage), and it ceases all work and lowers itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some effects of the avalanche of direct avalanches are effective and its destructive power. But the deal between the real avalanche and the scene makes this movie even sensitive to it. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing, even T.V.
