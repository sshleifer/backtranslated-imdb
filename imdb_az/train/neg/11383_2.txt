This is really a terrible "B" movie. It's foolish and often embarrassing. There is almost no place on the pitch to turn into a major "show business". In fact, the film is just an excuse to highlight some of the famous musical groups in 1942, just to overturn the war effort and including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group receives information about the standard three minutes, and the exception is the Mills Brothers, for which reason it guarantees two numbers. Ann Miller does not dance to the film for the past few minutes, and he will not do very little, but to close his belongings in a devastating part of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the film, in my opinion, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The group plays on a train that is on an unusual position. (Deep in the South, the group was separated on railroad cars while traveling on the road). Johnny Hodges appears next to the Duke and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the final moments of the film, the trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance flew to the camera in the hallway and angered his eyes like "Uncle Tom" and starring Willy Best in many films. For modern audiences, especially for jazz fans, this reverence for discrimination is truly sad. Some movies look good.
