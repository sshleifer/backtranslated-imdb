A good cast (with a great deal of excitement) pushes the way through the intelligent luminous line of Epstein. Mansfield is not a better or even more strange one, but he has paired with Walston, a veteran who has been appointed to become a congressman to quit this battle. He and his friends, including the Successor Grant, went to San Francisco to start the city's calm party and call for their services to escape through industry visits. The only thing about this non-sophisticated film is the performance of Suzy Parker as a note of interest that attracts most of the time of the film and slows down the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; It is like showing love to every soldier (of course, for a war effort), but he is a married man who loves his wife. The film will soon steal the movie (when it is fun to play in the first part of the movie, with non-actor partners).
