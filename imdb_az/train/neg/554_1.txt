This movie is terrible. The scenario is bad, the scenario is mediocre, and sex scenes are also worthless. The original film's excitement and intrigue are completely incomplete. This movie was filmed in a dark, shaded and monochromatic style (a "War of the Worlds") which was very disappointing after the original movie's beauty. Greg Morris' s dark character is a face throughout the film. The curves and queues of the original area are not perfect here; a few things are simply anti-eclectic. Sharon Stone's only point of view as Catherine Tramell continued to be true later, but it was not enough for other shortcomings. The only thing that needs to be done is the creation of "Home Instinct 3" if Michael Douglas agrees to the player.
