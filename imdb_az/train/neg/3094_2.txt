**** MENIC USERS *** As a bad filmmaker, I have to be able to watch hundreds of bad movies and still have the "Hobboblins" unique to all others. Classic baddies such as "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are straightforward from start to finish. On the other hand, "Hobboblins" begin with evil and are gradually deteriorating. At first glance at the scene of envy against me, I thought myself to be a really bad movie. I'm not happy to see the best of this movie. The most massive film of the film is a permanent symbol of another consistent joke during the "Club Scum" series of painful attacks on celluloid. Only this film proves that he has the right to celebrate as one of the worst directors of all time, such as Rick Sloane, Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane. How bad can a bad movie be? Explain "Hobgoblins" and do not be surprised anymore.
