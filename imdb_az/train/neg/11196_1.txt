After 15 minutes, I went out with my friends and we were not the first ones. Then we tried to get the money back. Film directorate did not allow it, but he agreed to see another movie. The only time we worked for was to see Dickie Robertsy: The Old Child's Star. As you know, this is not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. It should be the second to see the internal anxiety and the double head of Heist. Ultimately, for humanity, do not see the Order.
