I saw all kinds of the state. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branag's most ambitious, Mel Gibson's, was fast and at the point of Laurence Olivier's best hands. But now we come to Maximilian Schell to meet Bard. <br /> <br /> For someone, this is a dubbing version of a German TV producer, William Shakespeare's esteemed chestnut. But somewhere slower, more slippery, more lethargic, and even worse scenes, it should move at school level. <br /> <br /> When you see MST3K, Mike and robots play strangely good gates in an old child, play black and white TV, Shakespeare's and German's wisdom (?), and act like an Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are MST riffs. The best lines? "I will open Big Dane", "I Do not Think", "Breater", "Beatles Meet", "Hey, Dad will help with my scientific project" and I love it personally, on the one hand, "Garrison Keillor leaves Germany" (YAAAY!). <br /> <br /> But Shekly plays the biggest character of Shakespeare. Certainly, he is a great actor, but here comes as Paul Newman's "The Silver Chalice." Look at her? See this double draft of GOTTA! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is just an example of how you're better off reading books. At least the book is not named by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> Only one star for this Hamlet; <br /> Naturally ten stars for MST3K version <br /> <br /> Good night, very sweet princess.
