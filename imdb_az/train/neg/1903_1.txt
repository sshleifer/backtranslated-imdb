This film should show an example of what should be done to film the students. In fact, a few big tire chests began, and this terrible disaster broke the cardinal rules of Bruckheimer's films: we all know what sucks, but it's a great move. This movie has no action. BORING this movie. Where are the cars? Where are the injuries? Where is the tension? Where is the tension? Where are the injuries? Where? !! It's really a movie, not a movie. 50 cars within 24 hours? This is a mistake. There are 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. What's so bad? Actors' actions are tough, wooden and compulsory. Traitor, police, and the other ... kind. They say senseless lines, they serve a pointless plot. The music teacher says: "Do not worry we'll make a lot of flicking around, and no one will see the worst of the movie" or "We'll make a loud noise" music The "scripts" is not really a command, but a cliches there is a list: ------- Warning - possible spoiler ------ 5 ------ 4 ----- 3 ----- 2 ----- 1 ---- - All the greatest crime Vinnie Jones, man ... this is the baddest, quality mofo since Jules in Pulse Fiction, and what they do! They are silent to anyone in the movie! How could they be so dumb? How? How? Why? The original film is very entertaining with a cool toy at the end of the drive, a genuine 40-minute discovery! Find the original, or if you want to move on some real car, rent yourself RONIN Ronin's co The valuables raised the bar where all the other cars were to be judged.Well, Bruckheimer and Cage had all these resources, all their resources and all their experiences, and did they fit into a cinema sold for $ 250,000 25 years ago? How can it be? When you see this movie, you feel like you've been dumped. Once I was thrilled to see Coyote Ugly, remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor, and now I say: God helps us all. <br /> <br />
