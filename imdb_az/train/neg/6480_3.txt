It was nice to see all the familiar characters, but the story disturbed me. We loved Ariel in the first movie. Why is the second girl centered around her daughter? The new characters were disappointing, and I did not like it. The worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back like Eric's voice! Disney, stop rebuilding classic movies with these verbal imitations.
