In a word ... terrible. I give a star for hippie sex scenes and candy ladies, but do not forget it. Corman's most effort, there is no bar. Ben Vereen should keep his name permanently. Now on this DVD (on 2/15/05) will be "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. This morning I woke up in my bed cold, decided to watch a movie to watch some of the movies, scanned digital channels ... B-movie discovery seemed quite interesting for me as I looked at hippie culture and rebel teen flicks. I met somebody in the game and when I was playing with Ben Vereen ... Why not? <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of my day ... was a negative beginning of the day. <br /> <br /> Only after seeing this, I now know why dating has entered into the vacuum of my new brain. I remembered the future of this movie, when I was 14, and I returned to Sombrero at the local theater theater ... the whole theater was hysterically and even heard how bad it was. Operation: Terrible, Story: Terrible, Cinematography: Almost, Music: Terrible, Sound: Terrible, Guided: Jokes. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect name for the Gass-sss movie ... You feel the "gas" then You need to take this dirty movie - or perhaps your "gas" camera away from your brain. I've seen this movie in the Super 8 movies that shamelessly. There is definitely a new addition to my best TOP WORST movies of all time ... There are "Tentacles" (there, below). <br /> <br /> Ted, Gilbert, AZ
