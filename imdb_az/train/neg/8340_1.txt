One of the worst films I've ever seen. To watch the news, I downloaded it from half to bottom. When I opened it again, I slept. The film begins with a dream, continues with sleep and ends with sleep. There are a few more sleeps among them. Come on, what's the thing that interests me? There is a reason for the film to be interesting. The accuracy you think the film is just a dream is the time when everyone who shoots a sensitive film. Did anyone accuse anyone of telling them their dreams and what they want to say? <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
