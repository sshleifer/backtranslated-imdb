This movie is a good thing that combines comedy and drama with action and horror that makes more sense than the typical fear film of the crowd. Unfortunately, this film has caused me disappointment and is not "the biggest monster movie ever". <br /> <br /> Start with good things: comedy, action and special effects. Get-go, this movie starts off fast paced and offensive. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - longs for the classical "ecological" catastrophes that many monsters give birth to. Pacing is quick, other monster flicks are long and often pointlessly dramatic, allowing for a pleasant break in the opening scene and jump right to the movie. In the 10-minute period, you see the animal 'why', 'where' and 'how' it is and ready to act. <br /> <br /> Following the shooting of another short and good shot, the characters are presented: the lazy son and his little girl, his darling father and his talented brother (Aunt) and, of course, the monster. The heroes cling to each other and their conflicts become clear immediately so that monsters can make the audience feel themselves when they appear suddenly to change the air in the river where they live and work. <br /> <br /> These monsters look great: probably they are still familiar - they resemble a dog like a dog and fish of a fish. The creature's effect is second to none, and although it's strange, it's incredible and you see it's strings at any point in the movie. The monster's movement, even as an increasingly exciting rottweiler in the linoleum, monster barrels were scattered inside the mass, scattered and eaten on the road. When the path of the monster crosses with the family and causes the tragedy, it is a painful moment and you may feel the need for revenge, but the film's appeal begins to emerge. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of the dynamics, the film loses focus and durability. Fields are presented, then abandoned, symbols change their position without any apparent reason, and the comedy layout becomes dramatic dramatic scenes, with obstacles appearing and accidentally disappearing. <br /> <br /> When it comes to comedy, I say: I am ready to admit that I have a lot of humor. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, maybe your translation. But I'm thinking of having a great Asian study at college and a better life in Asian humor than a middle-aged man (who's still here) in Japan for the last 5 years. Most of the film I realized was funny, but not for me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: a family mourning ceremony after the first attack on a young girl missing; everyone is mourning. A new character is presented - a brother - and two brothers are opposed to each other when it becomes clear that the tension is growing. Both of them begin to grieve for their loss, and are more competing with each other. This competition is mostly funny: two brothers who do not like each other compete in a funeral - this shows the barbaric nature of the love of the family spreading in Asian comedy. This delicate rifle bare comedy with family and ritualizing fun was supposed to be funny, but it really did get out of the context of a missing girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> Then comes the plot holes. There are many points in this movie that are not explained or explained worse, explicitly explained and ultimately fretted to prove only in a duplicate and meaningless way. Finding an obstacle can not be a good barrier for a barrier, but you can expect some explanation for this nature. Instead, the audience is facing only the challenges of 'not being there', and there is no information showing that anyone is starting a problem. So I'm asking: How much do you even bring it first? <br /> <br /> This was a problem with the movie because problems created new problems and suddenly the world of film was full of opposing forces. Of course, the use of new and more problems is a time-tested story telling about the tradition, but if a new broadcasting application makes it difficult to shrink another, at least the new summer will have full explanation. Not in this movie. <br /> <br /> Along with that, just as you have had several stories, only 20% of each one explains and, as a result, did not merge to complete all of the shares. many of these can be "cultural". Perhaps the story of Korea - a tradition of putting a comedy inside a tragedy. Perhaps, stories are normal on every page as a child with color off-line, but never ends. Maybe if you have a problem to develop the site, just remove this problem with a random solution or a crash. Or maybe they are all features of a naked job and a bad story writing a movie that is better at right than it is right.
