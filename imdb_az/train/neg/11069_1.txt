After seeing this picture, I was really deceived. I felt that I was watching this movie for 101 minutes. When they do this, I do not understand what they think. Jeffrey Dahmer complicates the assassination and never ends. For the continuation of the film, I felt as though they were leaving this movie. It was like watching a television episode of Soprano. You know it will end up suddenly and will have an episode next week. I just felt like I was watching only one section in two. There are many opportunities for mistakes here; they were lazy, escaped from the money, did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to do Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie, they all sound very clearly. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer through the woods. I play this music all at once, then writes, and Dahmer tells how he was sentenced to two years and was killed and killed by age 34. Wow, that's the tree for the death in prison. How to show you how. How can Darmen be tempted? How to provide more information. I can not explain what happens in this movie because it jumped to the ground. In fact, I said to myself, "Is this the last one?" I still want to review this by saying that a good Dahmer movie is not yet prepared. I want to tell cinematographers that if I do, do it right.
