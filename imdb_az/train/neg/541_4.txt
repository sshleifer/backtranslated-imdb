I found something strange about this movie. It's hard to love this movie since I went too far, and now I can explain it quite a bit after thinking a little. Jean-Marc Barr, I love her bitches (though I think Zentropa is one of the best films) is pretty bad here and I can not think it would be better for my life, but I'm sure someone can take her place quite easily and can do. Everything else is fine, except for the weak comedy (strangles of a Meet The Parents Joke, not kinematics), and I really want Richard E. Grant as the British Major. Only one thing is suffering ... Jean-Marc.
