DEAD HUSBANDS is a comic comedy about many women who come together to knock on each other's husbands. I'm not as shy as some comedies, but I can say that her potential is never fufils. <br /> <br /> How much better would this be if Farrelly brothers, who led Ben Stiller with Carter Elso's role? It is only interesting because the attractive word about Dr. Elson's show "looks at each other and continues to talk"
