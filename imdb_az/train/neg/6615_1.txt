For some time in the Indian cinema, like Sholay, a movie comes from a movie that changes the way a viewer accepts a good movie. And only once (hopefully) a RGV breaks all the standards and has its own Aag Aag. That's a low standard, never broken. Ram Gopal takes a melting pot of your talent and looks like a smell from a distance. It is not completely forgiven to do something classic and assassinate as Sholay, and I do not think he almost called the film RGV Sholay. There were many folklore elements in the show, although the film was built to describe simply that characters lived in so different ways forever. Aag receives these symbols and needs a race to ward them too badly. The Realism element is totally incomplete, and after the film is completed, a group of "actors" come together and paradise through a series of invisible events. One star for this movie is a ridiculous loss of voting. RGV corresponds to the reality of its failure and creates another "different" area that can be classified under movies.
