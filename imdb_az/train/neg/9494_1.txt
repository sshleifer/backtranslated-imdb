The only thing that surprises me more than the number of fans of this movie is that it is directed by Clint Eastwood, who is very impressed. Potential was no chemistry. In a moment, I believe there is something deeper than lust. The story has not just come true. Add to this stylted conversation, a tone of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow structure that basically does not bring you anywhere and you have a stinker. Kay Lenz's naked scenes can be valuable to those looking for some quiet ways, but this is a great time. As I watched the film, my thoughts could have been a better title.
