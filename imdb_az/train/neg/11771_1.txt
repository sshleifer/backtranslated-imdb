This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although it was best left off. It is about the fact that many Thai actors and their crew are the first Thai film to be directed by the western. It was not boring to be honest because it was boring, boring, and boring. Why do you point to something, why are you covered in a mystery? Why not take a bad voice, how terrible sounds, shots and upward scenes you can take home? Time and time are not as re-imagined as the director. Spurrier comes out of the unusual clich√©s unusually. There is no sign, there is no guess, there is everything on the screen, there is no need to use our dreams. Do you wonder when the 'scare' comes from? You do not have to live because noise is more intimidating and rising to hell. Hell, I am writing words to describe how bad it is. Do you wonder if the divorced devil is real or imaginary? Why give it to yourself - it's really a year, and yes, it really squeezes her mouth and bleeds everywhere. For a number of reasons, it's a strange, worry-free movie. It's likely to be a terrible movie, but not scary - the shots were reduced and it became clear. There may be an annoying attack on Thai voters, but the filmmaker has a dark, lubricant style when it comes to displaying only minors. Maybe my dubious self beat him like a slender sister, who built the seeds of doubt. Or maybe everything was just pants. Non-recurring, bizarre, recurring, hackneyed - all candidates for the best illustration, but dull looks the most appropriate and honest. Previously, it was rarely seen with a better, often thought-out, less imaginative or torch. Sorry. Decreases each number. Really hero.
