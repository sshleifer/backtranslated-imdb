13 more steps on Friday! There's a worse movie than a hateful series. I won this movie at a college competition, and it was a loss of money even if it was free. Jack Jones is a truly terrifying singer trying to find some killer or something. At least on the fourteenth Friday I was not compressed. I took more of my eyebrows than ever.
