Rhine is less visible on the middle ground in the place where it was followed. Someone loves a loved one, welcomes his sincerity, acts liberally and beautifully, or delights in open propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard heroes, and generally tendency. In the latter category, I dropped a lot of films and games - about the European refugees' activities in Washington during the war, which is particularly valuable for actors, and even in intermittent times. It's irrelevant that the author, Lillian Hellman, is on the side of the angels. His works are written for people who share his thoughts and rarely studied ideas that have not yet been passed by the writer and the audience, unless "natemir" wants to show how dangerous the other party is. Even when he agrees with one hundred percent, he still says that he can not go on that way, as in Rhein. His symbols are inaccurate and the ears of a dialogue show a certain object because people speak, although there is no real glow and originality. He did not really have anything new to say. Several years ago, I was thoroughly grateful for the delay of Hellman's late Mary McCarthy. For those who think of the theater's death for dead or extreme and good old days, I take a look at Rhine Watch, but it's bad in America as angels, it's just a foot of the theater, sixty years ago in the grave.
