This was one of the worst fils I've ever seen and I've seen a few. Slow, boring, amateur - even when it's read in sequence, is not consistent. Actors do not move. It is not possible to blame them. They have been given such a unique scenario that they can do with pain in their eyes, which has nothing to do with the bad ways in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <br> Nicholas Cage's character is so bad that he does not feel the sense of compassion for her because of all her troubles. I do not doubt that I saw a crushing man there, but Nicholas Cage knew he was in the worst movie of his whole career.
