Lois Weber writes, directs, directs and releases other films on controversial issues through film, but this may be the first time to browse through the TCM. The film claims to abort it, but she cleverly confuses the issue by bringing eugenics and birth control, explaining that they are equally in abortion. Writing ability and other kinematic skills are well illustrated here, but may be forgiven for less didactic use. You wonder why Tyrone Power, Jr.'s "famous father," has a chance here. 1916 fashion and car are also shown to add to the interests of this museum piece. It is a pleasure despite the propagation of the propaganda.
