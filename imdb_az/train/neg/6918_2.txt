I went for this movie, which believes it has a good rating. First, they are ridiculous to leave a film released in India in 2001, seven years later in 2008. Everything in the movie seems to be dated. For 2001, such a movie looks like a shoe design budget. There is a scene that allows a person to clarify how much budget is to be earned to a person. Anthony Hopkins does not know what's going on in the movie. It ends by giving a long monologue to the end. If there were bright sparks during this scene, I left myself when I was lying in bed. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt is like a devil. She puts bad fitting clothes and scowls on casual children. Alec Baldwin should not be allowed to go to Webster for a first time. How much money is lost! Anthony Hopkins rightly says, "Return home and write better!"
