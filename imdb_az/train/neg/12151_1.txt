This is the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie. and how much it is with casting. The leading lady in this film has a kind of nasal dysfunction, and it is almost impossible to look for any length without fixing it on the nose. you can go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find the 50 most capable ladies. This movie made a mistake in renting this movie because there was a "cool" DVD in this movie. This film is just one class project for a group of multimedia students at the local technical team. I spend an hour or more watching this movie watching television on public television ... at least the special effects are good and the ones that are there are more attractive than anyone you see in this movie
