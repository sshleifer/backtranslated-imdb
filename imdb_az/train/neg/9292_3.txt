First, I was expecting another Hero - a fantastic work of art in the genre. I just saw the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can only imagine that it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The main elements of the hero are in the HoFD: Great views, cinematography and sincere activity (I do not mean that they do not understand what they say, without subtitles, but still pay attention - good toy) <br / > <br /> What's wrong with this? What starts out from the political revolution is transformed into a love story. Finally, this is a triangle of love like soap opera. As you know, there are three characters that fall in love with each other. After escaping from prison, this film is mostly divorced (I spent about forty minutes). Almost at this point they have changed the writers. The rest of the film is related to the fact that one character is "like a wind." Ick. And, indeed, it is necessary to extend the suspicion to believe in certain parts of the movement. It is not unique to this genre, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then the battle was not really good. It takes you from the beginning, but this movie just goes out of the gas.
