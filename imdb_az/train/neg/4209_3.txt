"I am not a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" what does it mean? This area can not be as bad as a child who is very brave at the end of the film because it has become a library that fears everything. The only purpose of this loss of celluloid was to encourage the reading of American children, which could have been a cheaper and more effective advertising! Even Macaulay Culkin's (his son's) talents, Christopher Lloyd (a "reminder" librarian), could have rescued this senseless film from the boring area. Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart (even) Leonard Nimoy, or Frank Welker, the voices of God's Hollywood voices, also does not hold him as a cartoon character. We can only describe it in the 1990s as an adaptation of the Water Babies even in 1967, because the soft animation film is worse because it does not improve the unhappy field!
