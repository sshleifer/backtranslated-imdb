I just saw this movie once and it was enough for me. If there is any structure in the film, there is very little, and it seems that there is nothing more than the constant scenes of psycho-sadist violence and nothing else. I wanted to see this movie because he played the role of Zoe Trilling, the second "The Demons Night". and I wanted to see one of them playing normally. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script does not start or go as Robert Englund prefers to the movie and reverses the scene and plot. Zoe, now I know what's going on; Hide from this movie!
