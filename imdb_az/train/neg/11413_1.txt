Seriously - avoid this movie in any movie. I just saw this in my first "hidden preview" and paid for it for about 15 minutes, even though I paid for it. There is now a 2-minute discussion to split up with my friends. Once I went out of a movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> "Some of the movies are based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes, though some of them fall apart." ("What do we do when we reach the battlefield?") (it is very fun to read how the movie was delivered here) (a person eats some "cosmic cookies", really cleverly and misses his wedding, or laughs - all bad writing and moving), women in the army ("Why buy only the trumpets? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> In addition, I have seen that you have been doing better in your soft porn movies on TV at night and in the daytime, so that the middle-aged, rapidly developing dingy, dubbed and edited because it was dingy jokes (badly surrendered), it did not work, at least it is not at all levels used as a measure for movies. <br /> <br /> I would have been so brave that this flicker proves that very few funny zanzee Germans can be. And this, if you want stereotypes, says something. <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this movie, I think we should do something useful. Learn how to tackle the ropes, paint your dark colors in a really irritating color, remove your bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand the theories of Einstein, and try to convert a different religion back and forth - by the "Last Christmas" Wham! repeatedly repeating. Not everything, but watch out for this terrible flick.
