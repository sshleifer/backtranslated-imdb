Brokedown Palace is not the type of movie I want to see. I also did not like the movie after some Aussie man kidnapped drugs in Thailand, and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug trafficking. Whatever happens after seeing this movie, I will not go to that country. Actually, this movie is wrong. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is a tolerant country. Instead, I will remain loyal to the United States. After watching some of the movies in the theater showing false charges about drug smuggling, I left the theater and returned my money because I can not stand it. Do not forget if you're going to Thailand to meet someone who can be a drug addict!
