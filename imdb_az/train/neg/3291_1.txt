At first, I'm not a Duke fan, but after this movie, the series seemed like Law and Order. The worst thing was Roscoe and Boss Hogg's casting. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg and even worse M.C. Roscoe is like Gainey, Roscoe hard ass police if they watched no show. <br /> <br /> Barney Fife was more than her role in this movie. <br /> <br /> The usual mistakes in the film, the torn car, and it's going to happen. The worst example of this comes from the General, Billy Prickett, and the General has slowly escaped to a dirt hole until it's close, but continues to win the race.
