This is the worst movie ever I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen really bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store and seemed to be a worthwhile horror movie cover. I knew it would be the best part of the small movie. What to start? The shooting of the film was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene where no one talks, a car that goes on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just went silent. The whole movie is annoying, annoying, incredible, and basically no plot to talk. If you rent this movie, watch with some friends and create a good comedy. Otherwise, run when you see this movie.
