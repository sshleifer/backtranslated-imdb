The film is appealing to the public because of Stiller's confusion and J. Aniston's popularity. Of course, here's a recipe for a successful title, but there's nothing successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Polly is very well skeptical of Aniston. This is a character that is perfectly compatible. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same troublemaker as the "Compatriots", but the comic scenes in this film are fewer than the one mentioned above. There was nothing special at all. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> These two good employees together things would be better . But what can you do if you have such a bad story and script? <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4.
