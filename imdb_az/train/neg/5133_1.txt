I did not have any real expectations for this movie, and I'm glad. <br /> <br /> What can you do? First, I think that 15% of the film consisted of the preparation of stationary fears in a dark jungle. I'm getting it. There are fences. I think the name "Coward" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no mention of fears and paranormal events. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film accepts itself seriously. Composers, bad guys, screaming women, and simple psychopaths or an ancient curse. But these films are B-films and even know that they are flaunt like Dead Snow (Scandinavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead. But this movie seems to forget her crapdomini. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. That's what I said. If you shoot a drowning movie, be killed. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip "heroes", and plan to have a hot and a semi-girl. and just wait for yourself. Thank you.
