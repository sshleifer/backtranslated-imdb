Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's get it right: It's an ugly piece of rotten cats with a cow glass. Just a horrible movie. The 80s is a poor story of a dark nerd from the middle school drama and some of the city's werewolf movies that are doing the worst. What is bad is that poor Kane Hodder plays gigantic wolves. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to ensure that Jason Voorhees is the height of his movie career ... <br /> In any case, the former Playmate Jaime Bergman is in the movie and eventually becomes a werewolf. This is a police drama similar to the world's worst-case werewolf. There are, however, moments of nudity that have not spread recently. But that's all. Want more info? Okay, my ward is usually an ugly black spot around the screen. And while we're pretty privileged to see a transformation sequence, we're just like the full motion video from the video game made at the early stages of PlayStation. First Playstation. CG animation is really primitive. It is only good for hardcore hardcore fanatics who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by sad visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
