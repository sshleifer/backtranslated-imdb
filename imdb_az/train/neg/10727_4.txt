You need to watch the movie only after half an hour. She starts with funny conversations at a bar and waits for a good, funny story. I know it will not come. Within a few minutes, you will not doubt that you are witnessing a film that violates your patience and a testimony to actors. <br /> <br /> I've heard in the interview that the director wanted to express a sense of identity in this film, he said, that most of the people living in this globalizing world live. I was surprised to hear this. How do I live in the same world? OK, many people walk in the same garment in the same garment, listen to and listen to the same music, but it does not feel like I'm losing my identity. According to Xrjanosvki, we are not much more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? <br /> <br /> My voice: the good start of the movie is from 1, the good 4 is my result.
