When there is some improvement in Being in Rome. I found it to be very predictable, patient and slow, and I still think it as bad as the Olsen twins. But it's not a good thing, though it's not a terrifying movie in Rome. If I had to sum it up in a word, I would say it is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Good for adolescents, but I think adults will not find much to go. <br /> <br /> There are good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are really pretty decent actresses, of course, very nice. When I am 10, I will admit, I love them very much and generally I like it. I'm very pleased with my films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Go back to the destination, both girls do not do this bad thing, in fact they are very attractive. Of course, their outfits are to die for and the Roman decoration is absolutely breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Just like the place to shoot and the script. Scenarios are mainly clich√©s and have deja vu instructions. The plot, like most of Maryam Kate and Ashley's films, is predictable and everyone who gets acquainted with the Olsen twins will find some indefinite elements. Most cartoons are thinner than cardboard and you do not know much about them, and sometimes the tempo is uneven. <br /> <br /> Of course, the breathtaking scenery has been violated by the fast-paced camera case. <br /> <br /> Generally, it has good points and, of course, it is possible to wait. However, for my taste, this is a harmless and predictable young tissue. 4/10 Bethany Cox
