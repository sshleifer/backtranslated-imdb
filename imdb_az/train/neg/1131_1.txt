Desplechin, a talented filmmaker, is deprived of a substance to deliver a shameless, very short and accurate plot that will not be worthy of a decent performance by a strange talented actor, Phoenix, Esther Kahn. In an attempt to fulfill a concentrated circle of an actor, performance and presentation are very controversial and poorly executed to attract any compassion from the audience. In an extremely long time, the effectiveness of Esther's struggle is melodramatic to be effective and transforms the story line into a poor disaster. As the content of Phoenix's struggle to fulfill Deshelch's instructions, Ester is inconvenient and unmanageable, as he does in the same way. Without a convincing victory over Esther's pains, we will not experience any triumph in Phoenix's ability.
