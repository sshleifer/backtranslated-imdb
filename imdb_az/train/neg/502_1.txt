This film is not a very bad film, but terrifying actors - probable actors - a boring direction and a stunning story, as well as the excellent "giallio" "Torso" run by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago), Italian cinemas one of the most famous psychohistocrats and one of the world's cult films. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director repeats the bed scene between a naked tom and black girl and white girl watching through a window in the bedroom. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and humorous and attractive in the Martino film. It's the best way to prove to Rizzo that there is no idea, originality, taste, and nothing else about another black girl, another white girl and another person who repapes the scene. I think that such things are a crime against the audience.
