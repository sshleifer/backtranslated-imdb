I saw this movie at a movie festival. The old alcoholic, a migrant worker who works only in a major depression and an office of employment (INEM), is the romance of an unemployed man. By transforming the movie 'social' into a romantic comedy, I found the story very simple and full of clips. The main actor did a good job, he seemed to be an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not as incredible as a working classmate, he speaks as an appearance, action, and a very high-level woman. I want to say that Ana Belen is playing for himself. Anyway, it's done in every movie. The entire mise-en-scene of the film was very weak. Photography is ugly, does not make good use of all panoramic aspects. The majority of the dialogue era is scriptwriting and irresistible. Comedy situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not ridiculous and poorly solved. In my opinion, this is not worth watching. Only if you love Pereira's previous movies, you can enjoy it a bit. Anyway, I left the theater because I was frustrating my time. The man who shot the film was on the door. I do not know if she feels like a director when she sees one of her favorite films.
