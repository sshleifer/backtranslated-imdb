<br /> <br /> This is a romantic version of the 1948 Doris Day classic, the High Sea. <br /> <br /> The story line, though less, is up-to-date. Govinda plays a sharp, clever friend who substitutes his wife. Rani, his wife, who is in the same favor while playing college friend. <br /> <br /> Govinda makes a mistake while lovering Sanjiv's wife and spies with another girlfriend with her friend. <br /> <br /> Lever plays the dual role of father and son of both attorneys specializing in the divorce process. <br /> <br /> This is a poor attempt to copy the original classics, and the songs are terrifying. The comedy is a rifle and will not laugh too much.
