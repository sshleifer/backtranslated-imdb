This is a very sad movie. Indeed. There is nothing in this movie. The scenario is bad! I think that they have copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Manufacturers are planning to create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now, in the third week, he works only in Antwerp and Brussels at 22:45 or somewhere. In the past, we had really good films in Belgium as Daens. Shadows are the loss of your time. Maybe you can hide in the theater after seeing a real movie. You saw the 10-minute Shadiya, you saw them all. Local radio and television were declared dead. I hope the shadows will soon disappear.
