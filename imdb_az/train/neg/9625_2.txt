This film does not offer any idea in its premiere or its execution, but these are two things that come to mind when you watch this comedy, which has no energy to talk. Story is a choice of analyst insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), who has been cheated with a scuba teacher (Hank Azaria) only a day after his new wife, Lisa (Debra Messing). After returning home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) went to one side and went to school several years ago named Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Polly is unforgettable and careless, and carries a carefree life, They start to experiment with new things and eat spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to marry Reuben, but she really does not want to, but Polly decides to leave because she does not believe in starting a marriage. <br /> Although this film is the second directorial effort of John Hamburg, who has written two unsustainable scenarios called "Zoolander" and "Getting to Know Parents," these two movies are classically related to this old drive. It's easy to say that something is not funny, but why it's easier to understand this movie. This scenario can be completely and completely predictable from start to finish in every scenario that appears to be due to the ridiculous scenario. In the scenario, Hamburg seems to have written it without thinking to try something different, and sometimes she tried to create the same energy as "there is something about Mary", but the events seem incredibly difficult. Did he really think that blind lumber was funny? If you do, it's easy! During the film characters, they have several emotional conversations that are clearly meant to sum up everything, but all that is clear is clear. Styles are working hard, but maybe less work and wait for better scripts, because this movie does not work as a comedy or romance.
