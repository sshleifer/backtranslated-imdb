A funny movie like any movie "The Bagman" should automatically attract any lover's lover's attention, but the plot is very different from what you can expect after watching the coverage of the DVD. Undoubtedly, Shahman is not a good movie. A home video camera falls into a category of movie-like movies (and, probably). The player is strange. I have never seen or seen such a board since Trol 2. There are many scenes of nakedness and sex, but they are explicitly thrown too fast. Heroes are moron and completely unforgettable. The latter (I will not replace it) can be easily waited after watching the first scene. According to the joyous nature of the film, nothing is terribly scary (terrible attempts in real life, a sliding place where the car is stationary, etc.). Only bad movies are recommended for aficionados.
