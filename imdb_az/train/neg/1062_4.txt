Ouch! It was a bit painful to sit. It has a cute and fun room, but it all goes to hell. Matthew Modine is almost always infantry and annoying, and this is not a failure. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville performed striking performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played in a row over others. I know that these parts are written down and it is difficult for players to blame when the script and the director make such shocks. If you plan to have lots of character, this is good, but you have a good material to get started. It was not here. If possible, continue shouting from this movie.
