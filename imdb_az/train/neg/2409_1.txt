It's a painful experience, the whole story is, but I'm not going to do it, but the player's horror is the beginning of this section when the actor is going to work, and he really thought of working with biofuels, working in a white coat at home, and transferring sterilized clothes in a controlled environment the laboratory itself resembles a school lab. This monitor is on a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the entire scene. a technician, and a scientist who actually has a breakfast in his laboratory and a jar with a jar of bio and his boss travels with it and does not say anything about it ... it can not get worse than watching my advice and worse than the dead I thought it would not be anything. Uwi Boll's films appeared to be classic Shakespeare!
