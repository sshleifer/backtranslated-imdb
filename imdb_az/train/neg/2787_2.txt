With the story of Kid (Prince), a singer, numbers on the way to becoming a star. Then she loves Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). <br /> <br /> I saw it in a theater in 1984. I'm not a great fan of the Prince, but I liked three great songs from this movie - Purple Rain, Get Crazy and Doves Cry. This film is full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, it is a very small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is striking with a shout and several times - and better. Subplots, beautifully laid, are badly damaged. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia, and Morris Day was awaited and tired because it was really insulting to me. The spouse is needed for the story of a father, but scenes do not believe me (in the motion and direction) is very bad. The scenario is terrible - bad dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And there are a few tons of misogyny there - the mother of the child is beaten; The Kid hits Appolonia and goes for the topless (not for any reason) to swim in the Appolonia ribbons and a dirty river. And Williams and Prince's characters are definitely a terrible treatment for women. <br /> <br /> This is a place where movie is really failing. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And the prince (easily) is the worst I've ever seen. His empty face and the conversion of the wooden dialogue did not believe me. This movie comes only during concert scenes, but there are really many. "Dramatic" scenes were very bad, and they produced a film to sit in. They should only do this with a concert movie. I give it a 2 - only for music.
