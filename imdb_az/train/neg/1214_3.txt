A friend once asked me to read a script that was selected by a movie studio. It would be a brave idea to say that it is one of the most luxurious and unfounded scripts I've read. Nevertheless, I never told him. Why? Because it can be a green light in a world in which movies are "If It Was" and that Kim Basinger would not sell a Oscar-winning star, it's a warranty that does not sell a character, content or health affiliation. br> <br /> Many other reviewers have noted that while the "O Out", a married writer who abused Basinger, married a woman with four unusual lipstick on the Miley Front, KadÄ±n-in-Peril movie. Every complexity is law-abiding by weak dialogue and logic spellbacks, but Basinger does not promise such an interesting actress and premise. There are a few things that hurt me: <br /> <br /> 1) If I do not want to think how much of my husband is in my life, there are toys in the house. 2) Racially different gangs are rarely unique to Hollywood, where they are usually only racist balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Make sure the movie is foolish. But this is the countless "excitement" I've been sitting in where women are crying and described as a victim of sadistic sadness. <br /> <br /> 4) I'm my son's last! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
