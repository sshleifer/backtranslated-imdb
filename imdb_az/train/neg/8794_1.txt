<br /> <br /> I have not even liked this movie, especially by many critics. <br /> <br /> There is one key word describing these words - the basis of the film is irritating. <br /> <br /> The easiest way to do this is to use the director or to exploit it more precisely. In the first half, a really boring reggae melody is played almost three times (once more often). But in the second half, the Mommas and Papas "California Dreamin" are usually played at the highest levels, at least seven times. Ancient people, even before or after the song, are extremely ill. Some people claim that they see this movie four or five times. <br /> <br /> <strong> means the United States has heard about 28 or 35 times in the Gulf of California. <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper repetition (nothing to contribute to the story) is likely to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> and still plays invincible with Asian champions and sunnies. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the decent high reputation of this film will be willing to go and see a lot of poorer emotions. <br /> <br /> I only warn you - if you never saw HK movie, do not start before. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to follow, avoid any situations you see in the movie theater. Fast forward and silent keys are the ultimate tool for living here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
