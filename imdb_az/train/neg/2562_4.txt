Let me begin by telling the first thing at the beginning of this film: The exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who are you? George: New George to me. Brendan Fraser is a very cheap studio to pay. Orange: How did you get the party? George: New George was just lucky, I think. <br /> <br /> In some movies, this is the only funny part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's still fun ... But still fun! <br/> <br /> I'm not saying that you've seen the worst movie I've ever seen (this topic goes to a pretty comic Disaster Film) the movie falls in # 15 on my 15th line ... <br /> <br /> If you have a small child with ease, you will use this movie. Well, if you're watching a movie that wants a funny movie, you're about to put yourself out of this half.
