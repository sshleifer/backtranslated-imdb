<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This was Billy Zane's worst movie I've ever seen. I understood that this film was mainly to show newcomers, which are pretty good for beginners, but the whole movie was incredible. You would think it would interfere with the police with all the gunfire. The coin on the Seal was a fool. <br /> <br /> Sean suddenly performs coin, is wrong, not realistic. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie quickly collided. Poor work. Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The last thing he did not hear. It took a long time to fight. I do not know, Billy is going to blow up Sean every time. I believe once, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was unbreakable. When Sean put it to an end, he was very foolish. It was like a comedy. It's bad! It's bad! It's bad!
