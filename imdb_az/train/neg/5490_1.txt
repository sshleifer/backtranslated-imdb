When I was a kid, we could always be infants and we always used the movie to rent a movie or use a movie to see. This is one of the movies we watch. This is one of the stupid films I've ever seen, and I even think it might be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A martian falls on the ground, turns into a person, becomes a friend of a man and tries to do everything possible to return home. But it is remarkable by the miracles of the earth. In the future, Christopher Lloyd, Martian, Martin Uncle, Dumb and Dumber's Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley, Brace Channing, and Lizzie as Daryl Hannah. But except that there is a full twist. Weak!
