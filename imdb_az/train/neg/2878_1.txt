Do not watch this movie. Bad act of acting and stupid protection. Full loss of time. I hope to see a lot of cool killings and hot chicks, but instead, the director was dependent on the animal slaughter video to scare you. It's disgusting. Murders are quite bare, mostly strangulated. There are worms in the mouth of a woman, someone puts a hamburger on her face and drowns her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king "killer" new sandwich .... ha ha. This film has long stood on true facts. I mean, he did not move around a bunch of real BHK killer rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh yeah ... there is also a cow's head cut off. Go to the number.
