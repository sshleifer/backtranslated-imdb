The first "Only in the House" was one of the most funny films of the 90s. The latter was the same as casting and jokes! Now comes the "Home Only 3". I was interested in how Kevin could continue with the same story considering that he would be from 1997 to 17. Can he take care of himself? So what does the director decide to do? She is bored and sick as a child. Is the child similar to the age of 6 and leaves her mother alone at home? Which team of spiders are these ignorant people? If you want to see this movie in a sad way, I really do not want to get any details. But I ask you to stay away from it. This is not worth your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, perform tasks, balance a pen in your nose or take a cushion! <br /> <br /> 1/10. Better to watch "Only 3 at Home"!
