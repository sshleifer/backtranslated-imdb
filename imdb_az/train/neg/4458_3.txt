Most French films I have seen and enjoyed have talked more about activity, but it's good. I found them with interesting, good pictures and interesting actors. <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting visions and has a good opening. But then talk, talk, and more talk ... is not for a drama, a good murder secret. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie was more like a game with almost all the scenes played in a room. So, if you love the songs, you have to love it ... but we want a bit more for a murder story.
