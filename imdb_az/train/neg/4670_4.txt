This adaptation is based on the novel The Heiress *, Henry James of 1949. * Heiress, who plays Olivia de Havilland's lead role, is better than this new remake of James's original title, though less than James's personal story. A story about an unusual, but loving daughter (Leigh) dedicated to her father (Finney) after her mother's death. The arrogant father keeps his daughter in despair, and has made her and all women simpleminded. If a good family and a young retired young man (Chaplin) come, the father is naturally suspicious, but he feels sure that his daughter will not show any interest in anybody, and that young man is a hunter hunter, and he forbids him to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress? Do I love it or hate it most? and it has a modest and long-lasting style, as it works through fresh teeth. Is not it so bad and does it play relatively deftly? it only plays a troublesome role for any actress, the audience wants to keep the character on its shoulders and shake it until it reaches its senses. The character looks very sympathetic, though it is particularly unpleasant. Ben Chaplin (who previously had a look about the Cats and Dogs) was very nice and extremely interested in playing with the exact exact amount needed to estimate the audience's fate. Maggie Smith, one of the best actresses, is alive and well-meaning, the level of the film she describes her aunt. Finney is, of course, as frightening as a father who insults her daughter for insulting her disobedience, but her daughter is ready to be risky for her beloved. But does he still want his hot suit without his wealth? This is an example of how different from the Washington Square * * The Heiress *. Another example is his ability to stay with him. It's a tedious movie that's like a dripping tap that offers very few stories in the long run.
