Welcome to our city, welcome to your city? As we have been introduced to the American city population in 1901, these three activities are opened in front of you with the aid of a visual narrator, with the help of "Stage Manager". After the initial presentations are made to the homes of two private families; Webb and Gibb. <br /> <br /> It is most certainly Central America since the mid-century, and it may seem a bit biased in the dream that America is a successful lifestyle of the dream and the savior. city Here we see the daily lives of Grover Corners, a population of 2642, part of the city of New Hampshire. Also, immigrant Polish workers who add up to 500 are countless, but they can never be seen. <Br / <br /> After the daily life of this family is applied; Three years after the second actor, young George (young and unrecognized William Holden, then 22 years old) and Emily fell in love and I am going to marry. The lovebirds, reaching the stars and reaching a turning point in their lives, reached the anxiety and distress of the young adults who lived and now, with excitement. The third act is a little bit more intoxicated and in the foreground, the intentions of the films are clarified, and not life here, not a holiday, we do not die, and when it comes to the difficulty, the dead are returning and coming together. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> This is the last three years, as in the last third part, to remind us of the past life of the past, reminding us not to waste and not waste any life and every valuable breath every last minute. The film's own political position is also evident, but I feel a natural propaganda stance on spiritual debates, how it manages the Middle East and its home, and how to do it. This is not just our "city", it is the spiritual madness of our "souls" and the American people (except Poland, Ireland, native Americans and free ethnic minorities) and minorities, in general, and Americans supporting it, are still fair in this story. not a part), like middle classs, lives up to America's honest, decent life expectancy. <br /> <br /> <strong> Ambassadors to the United States are only invited by special invitation. <br /> <br /> I was a little enjoyed by this movie, but nevertheless, it was a novelty, a mildly functioning, musical honey or not as good as it was. It was an exception to the other groups and, in the future of the US developing country, was also a bit biased in its position, including the love of Webb and Gibb, a good film. <br /> <br /> This Pulitzer Prize-winning game and six Academy Awards nominated by the US-born Thornton Wilder (1897 - 1975) feature film, life-long action, and three main features; Life, love and death, and transliteration of celluloid, come to the right wing of some public consciousness. Our city begins with the fact that nothing in the other cities seems to be invisible, and nothing in this city is surprising, if nothing else, there are only "right people" in this city, yet we can see the rear doors of these two families, their spiritual and social position is more important than their own. As long as you come from the right part of the city, our city can be "Any city".
