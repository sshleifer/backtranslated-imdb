Joe Don Baker is an actor who plays a small role here here ... She was good at Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villa at Living Daylights and appeared on various films. One thing he can not do is carry a film in Malta, which is a very evil revenge. Joe Done's murderer killed his murderous brother and escorted his assassin to Italy, but some children put the plane in Malta and the killer escaped. The rest of the film sees Joe Don's assassination here and there, and Joe Don is being detained at different times, Joe Don is tortured and interrupted in a bartender, and so on. The film is pretty bad and you will not find yourself drawn to the character of Joe Done. The hero of Joe Don once proved that he had come out with a blow and how inexperienced he was. The chic part of the movie comes from Joe Don's killer in a priestly outfit along with a killer in Malta, and then enters the ships and follows them in Malta. This film also has one of the worst clamp lines to finish any movie.
