This idea is good. It's great to have a large number of stars in a movie. But .... lots of stories, very short and really does not have any meaning. No connection between scenes. There were three or four bright stories ... but these were only 18. The frame reminded me of a movie that I loved very much "All Invisible Children". Compared to that, there is no interesting story about the development of Paris Je T'Aime - it starts and ends. And there is no topic that combines all these - children. I have not found enough topics to connect 18 short sketches to Paris. Perhaps it is interesting for people who know Paris. Otherwise, I do not recommend it ...
