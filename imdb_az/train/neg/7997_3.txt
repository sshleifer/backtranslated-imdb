According to a tired movie model of humanity, which dominated such a dominant nature in the 1970s, even though the ants are even slightly effective (though they enjoy the reasons they did not intend to). Very striking. Apparently, these ants, which are bulldozers near a house, eat poisonous waste for decades, and now spread poisonous bites - it is consistent with hundreds of lethal strokes. It is not so good to watch the actors of some conscious negativity among the little black spots, and it is very painful to suffer. When Suzanne Sommers sits on the bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathe through the piece of wallpaper, Bernie Casey holds a foot, and several scenes are just ridiculous: the boy goes on trying to fall into a bucket while a boy is attacking. The danger is different from that of the ants that creep toward the black lines of ants on either side of the walls. The shape of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors believe that it is material. Poor Myrna Loy should sit in a wheelchair with this fear. I hope he has made good use of money because he denied that a courageous woman was in this nonsense. Although this is a pretty bad movie, it will be done once for me, and many of these seventy films have poor film quality - the actors in the beginning have embarrassed themselves, feel for television, and terrifying creatures of strange nature. This time it is necessary to mix human beings into an ant that can be affected. It's really terrible.
