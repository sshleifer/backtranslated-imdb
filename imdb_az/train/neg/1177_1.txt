This movie is fully twisted! This expenditure of celluloid is avoided, bent, and incompatible with all costs. I'm proud of the depths of more than 70 sleaz movies over everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I love shocking, but need a story compatible. But watch the horses' comrades, this movie is for you. The ugly part was a naked werewolf costume with a functional boot. I want to say that it's hard to sit straight, but I say the player is awful and the dumbness of the call is dubbed. I know that the lid is interesting (a woman looks like a gorilla hands to a naked donkey), but do not waste your time or money as you do not come back.
