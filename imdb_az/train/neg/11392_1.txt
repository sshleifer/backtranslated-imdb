For many years I remember reading about a show called "Tracy's Concern" on the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday at 6 o'clock! <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ font> and I wanted to say that this is "Tracy's Trouble" about all was. Is there a beautiful girl in the lead role? Is there nudity? Is there any tension? Was there a comedy? It would be nice if there were some campaigns in the show. At least I knew I was missing. However, NO! CTV affiliates set up a transmitter in CKCO, Wiarton, Ontario and drove the bonkers to me until the CFTO at the same time publishing "Tracy with Trouble" .... On Saturday morning at 6 pm! One morning I got up and opened the TV at 5:59 and never saw what Tracy and Trouble were. <br /> <br /> The talented Canadian actor Steve Weston has lived for several years, but later claimed that he was dead for the first time on this show. It was the first time I saw it on a cold Saturday morning, and I felt desperate in my bed, and some died.
