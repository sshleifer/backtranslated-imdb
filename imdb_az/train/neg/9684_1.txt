Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, visually surprised ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Indeed, boring, too many men are nudity (including the son-in-a-nervousness), and just a sort of indecision. However, I will admit that some of the passages in the dialogues that have been adopted in their dialogues have a frustrating, frightening quality.
