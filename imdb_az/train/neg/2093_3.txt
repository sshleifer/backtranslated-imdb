If you like a syphi soap opera, this show is for you, as I'm concerned, it does not work for me and after watching the 3 episodes I can not watch it anymore. Rich and slow, and people are watching 100,000-year-old brand LCD TVs as street and people are driving down like 100,000-year-old Chevy cars if you are based on Battlestar galactica's timeline to reach your place for a show 100,000 years ago. And the rest of the gang goes the same way, I think that despite the fact that most of the things on the show are on the agenda, it could have done a better job to solve these issues, and yes battlestar galactica was some of the same issues, but not nearly as bad. As part of the show, the BSG is not nearly as good as it is, and it's poorly predestined.
