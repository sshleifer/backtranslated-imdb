I know it's a Power-Rangers gimmick and catered for 7-year-olds, but are they really taking seriously with this movie? If they are planning to write a pencil with a pencil, there is good at least to be foolish. If you follow that, it's strange. There is a typical family full of sticky characters (a war veteran who lost her father's spouse and accused LOLOL) of trying to make a cool stereotype of a pupil, but not a funny horrible sidekick movie that failed with a terrifying player and served no purpose, to fill the camera. Attention! <br /> <br /> However, when trying to fight the war with his father and the evil immoral sword, a great moment in real life is approaching, but then no one (probably because there is no place in the budget for choreographers) they will work with the American Gladiator board. <br /> <br /> Because the 1/10 rating is trying to act like that.
