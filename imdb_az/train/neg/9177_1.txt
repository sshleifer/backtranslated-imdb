The House of the Dead was the worst movie I've ever seen, a miserable "matrix" 360 camera angle atamps, and a cheese move that I fell asleep. I think the director and the established manager can decide whether or not they are raining because there will be rain on one side of the ship and on the other side there will be no rain. I appreciate this movie from 1 to 10 (the 10 best, the worst one). They are also delighted to be able to skip the scene and really get ready to lose the time. I beg to anyone who reads this, BUT IT. This is not worth the time.
