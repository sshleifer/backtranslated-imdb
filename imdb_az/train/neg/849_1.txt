One Star. All this documentary is deserving. <br /> <br /> I'm a great fan of the "Walking With ..." series, and it's also a movie that includes Nigel. For Marvin spin-offs, still informative information for all their entertaining entertainments. Although the subject of prehistoric man is not interested in me as nearly as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still unique and interesting to repeat. <br /> <br /> After seeing all the other documents in the series, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places, I thought it was necessary to see it. </ Strong> this docun ... What do you think? lol <br /> <br /> Although the information they are able to obtain is interesting, the presentation failed in every possible way. There was a terrible stream, it was incredibly staggering (inflated and sometimes out of the way), horrible effects (including CGI's few minutes and, in particular, makeup effects) camera effects. <br /> <br /> When talking about make-up effects, a reviewer here showed how funny the scene was when the cavemen faced this giant monkey and how it looked like a 70's suit amber movie. . Here, only those who describe the ape men were ridiculous and ridiculous. This does not help any of the terrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of everything is not shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or appears to be far from reality. It does not even seem to be serious. The sequence of the series was that there was no emotional punch. Remember the Episode of "Walking with Dinosaurs" about Ornithochirus's (Sp?) Fate? This episode is still on the edge of tears whenever I watch. There is such a relationship with the most vulnerable topic. <br /> <br /> If you are more involved in this subject and your own story, even something speculative, you are more careful about the facts surrounding it. <br /> <br /> This production is just a good story (at least I saw the BBC version) and music. Otherwise, do not rent this job (often I do, but usually eyes rolled) unless you want to make a good laugh. <strong> CAUTION </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Other people in the series? Hmmm ...
