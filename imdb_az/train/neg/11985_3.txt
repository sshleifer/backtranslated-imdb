Worms did not want to eat? Here's a 'documentary' to show you! Yes ... The worms of the child eat! This is the most interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> This film has been dazzled by previous reviewers. I totally agree here. The film does not go anywhere until it's just landed! <br /> <br /> Now technically: This boy should have given his hair. He wanted to look like anyway ... Bozo, Clown. It was almost funny ... I was expecting it to be almost a shadowy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it was a very dirty passage despite the child's pain! <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie forced me to sleep. <br /> <br /> My children could take about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the decor is very impressive. <br /> <br /> Kids seemed safe enough to watch: the moon scenes and the oddball's eyes were too weak. <br /> <br /> Some children were scared and a short "dingy dip" did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave it a very generous one.
