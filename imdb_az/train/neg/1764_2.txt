In many cases, I agree with comments from other reviewers. I see that plot and idea are very good. Most of the assistant actors were very good. The deadly problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am not sure that I have seen a lesser "actor". I can not imagine how this person will be in a movie or on television. I think it would be better at Wal-Mart. Ask him to look at a low-rank person who is involved in paying a rank ...... "Who knows"? I would like to see this movie again with some talents. I do not blame the writer for his lack of time to watch this movie.
