Is there a positive interview for this movie? Critics who do not learn anything from video games can correct game errors. <br /> <br /> Well, I could have missed something, but it was Super Mario Bros. Could it be a game that never played before 3? Well, I do not want anything ... How was Fred Savage's character, and even the girl already knew a lot about the game? <br /> <br /> Apart from genuine and gaming errors, the overall quality of the movie is also low. Nothing here is very honest, very memorable. The child was not so good when playing video games. Many of those children who had returned in those days were more experienced. Moving on it and stories are mediocre in the strongest points. Symbols are mild and completely uninterested, 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry baby cluster of a small child who almost never speaks for trauma. <br /> <br /> It is said that it is not a reality that it should be thrown into the film that it will actually start a trick for even more than 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, here is a nostalgic nature. If I was good with this movie, I would not. It was about playing video games, and when you saw it, you probably had a NES affair. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <STRONG> .
