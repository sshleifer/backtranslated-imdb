Recently, I saw the joy of Broadway at Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson, "Blithe Spirit". It is a magnificent production and shows how good gamers can do with a game that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake to check the movie version of Rex Harrison's play. The film does not have the energy or laughter of a good scene production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of the works that works better with a live cast. come to laugh. Actors can give touches and nuances to deliver their performances and lines, and attract viewers to a personal level where you can not get at a movie house or with a DVD show that separates the audience. The story "Fourth Duv". Story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives in a house in the English village of Constance Cummings, with his wife, Ruth. Charles, Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, repeats the role of the original 1941 London production), is a local moral tool, looking for information for a book dealing with a supernatural book. Charles is something of alcohol, but hopes to get "the tips of the trade." But then Madame Arcati brings back Charles's first wife, Elvira (Kaye Hammond), who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops spitting competition with Charles and Ruth (depends only on Charles Elvira's appearance or hearing). <br /> <br /> Actors on stage, situation. But on the screen, actors of "Blithe Spirit" knock out lines as they do not know everyone's listening. They were intended to laugh at the scene. Performance by Harrison, Cummings, and even Kaye Hammond is straight and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to protect her spark and humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> Oscar-winning visual effects are not just the standards of today, but the 1946 standards! <br /> <br /> Kaye Hammond is photographed in a special lighting to make fluorescent green clothes and makeup appear like a ghost ghost. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer deserves a credit for creative lighting. But compare the elegant visual effects of Blithe Spirit, and the Disney's "Song of Paradise" essentially groundbreaking effect - is worthy of the same year. The "people in the south" and the animation symbols display the screen directly within minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can only encourage the Broadway restoration of this game with Angela Lansbury, but first of all, Blitz Spirit, for Oscari's special effects, is closer to South. When it comes to Rex Harrison's movie, skip it.
