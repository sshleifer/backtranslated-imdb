Luck is that you can still get a physical illness, but the movie is very boring ..... You do not believe in psychic, re-incarnation, and other hocus-pokus that encourages you great time. They say, "The cycle of spirits." Puh-Leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been repeatedly repeated with "The Hell Can Be Waiting". There have been many good deeds. Very bad Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, and Mary Stuart Masterson were forced to push their talents. <br /> <br /> At least this is a pretty good movie, language is smart. About the only maturity of this movie.
