<br /> <br /> <strong> Carlyle imagined the imagination of real Hitler, a master of propaganda and speech because he described it in this film. </ Strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> No one will ever follow him, even hopelessly, <br /> <br /> This is just part of the Hollywood cardboard propaganda, hidden. <br /> <br /> I am sorry for everyone who really believed in this show. Carlyle and the producers did not get anything. <br /> <br /> If such a sausage had been, why could Hitler bring many people to the whole region for his ideas? Why did people watch him die? They make their films completely incredible, describing him as a loser. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV city myths about one of the most important people of the past century. Imagine a film about Churchill that the director is only showing him as a drunk in just 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film is a disgrace and I'm surprised to see how Carlyle could talk to an actor for this disaster.
