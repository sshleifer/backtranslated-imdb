I've seen many good Korean movies, including films and films that are thrilling with dark overtones, but that's something. The director appears to be a sadistic person who just makes a person thrown a little. The film does not have any entertainment and is not even a tension. I do not believe anyone really liked such a movie. <br /> <br /> Although his wife is good, the line of story and the sense of outrage is terrible. <br /> <br /> I am sure that I will not see the director's films. There is no sense of filmmaking or excitement in the moments of excitement. All this shows scenes with psychopaths that are more blood and violence-thinking, wasting and thrilling reels with badly-struck scenes. Very disappointing film and I strongly recommend the release of such films.
