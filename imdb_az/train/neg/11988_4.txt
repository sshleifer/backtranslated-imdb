I was away from this movie, it would be so good. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton). <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is preparing to see his father by plane. His mother offers him a strange choice as a gift in the near future (what's wrong with the Rubik's Cube?). Once in the air, the pilot of the aircraft (blink-and-you'll-miss himun by Ned Beatty) carries a deadly heart attack and leaves Brian desperate because the plane crashes into a lake. <br /> <br /> Brian should find shelter, food, and survival. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film is here. With the nature of Brian's loneliness, Jared has very few lines to talk, and therefore the film should be compensated by removing the strain of each stage. Instead, he just walks around with a minimal sense of danger, sit around, and so on. Displayed. As a result, parents are often overwhelmed by the source of tension. These scenes only go out, and in particular the story does not add much. Even worse, sometimes Jared? his face is covered with mud - a primal scream or two leads to the failed parallels of Predator. <br /> <br /> Pamela Sue Martin is dissatisfied with the role of Pamela Sue Martin. She also has little influence on the film. For example, we can not react to Briana's disappearance, how we can organize rescue attempts, and so on. Brian is just one source of tension that filmmakers are looking for instead of spending too much time in the pre-departure events.
