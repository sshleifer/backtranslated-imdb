It was a heartwarming film for me. It came to me through a set of boxes called "Classic Film Noyer", a gift from a person who knows how to enjoy the films I usually enjoy in this style (I'm not a style but a genre). I do not think there is any nuclear film. From 1947 to 1955, there is a tendency to label and sell every black and white B movie in no time and the tag is not always appropriate. There is a tyrannical male hero Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb) and most of the film goes inside. These are the only rare elements I have ever seen. There is no extensive paranoid, or any real reason why Ed Cullen should be met with sincerity. Jane Wyatt was femme fatale, as overdressed and unconvincing. I do not want to break this movie for potential audience. However, it would be interesting to hear what other famous artists of the film would say about it.
