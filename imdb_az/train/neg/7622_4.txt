Just because Robert Oclo presents him on cable television, he has to express his satisfaction with the most attractive films in the TCM library, as he explains that he will honor the "benevolence" of this "attractive" film. <br /> <br /> If it looked like any old movie on the IDDB, it would have been classic for many fawning's amateur reviewers, and I thought this movie was a serious need for a more honest review. <br /> <br /> This is your father's 'Shop in the corner'. Performs it as a remake in every way you can imagine for all quibbles with "My Mail". <br /> <br /> I remember that I could remember a purpose consistency (a sad slapstick initiative in "humor"), and it would only be clearer for those who see the original. The movie remains inaccurate, and in fact, no step back. This "music" is only one of the fewest of the time. There is a breakthrough in the musical numbers that are immediately forgotten, and then Judy will say, "Do not Keep Me," as if they were a handkerchief. The Christmas song you read at the store is likely to be one of the better numbers here. Miss Garland was beautiful in a number of musical films, but here she looks terrible. The roles were first filled up by June Allyson and Judy Margaret Sullavan did not know enough to fill his old shoe. Van Johnson's second degree, Jimmy Stewart, is a pretty soft performance. These reasons do not reach Stewart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan's chemistry. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that has some notes but music. Actually, it does not really matter if you feel that you need to add something else that is actually created and even possible for Van Johnson's character. Replacing the original subtle of the original is a hackneyed plot app that deals with a priceless violin. Almost once, DeLorean and Flux capacitors are difficult to watch and feel as they are raised from one episode of three companies. This is really an excuse for Keaton pratfall. The tremendous decisive scene between romantic potential is also wrong. After seeing both films, you will understand why they call it "Lubitsch Touch" and "Robert Z Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid doing this, or you're not an iconoclast that tells us about the original movie or the previous movies of Judy Garland, who sees once a great star falling to the ground.
