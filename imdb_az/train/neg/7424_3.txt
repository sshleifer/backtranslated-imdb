Stella Stevens, a very strange movie came from a man who was disguised in Old Nevada, Vegas, to earn money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas (who did not know who that was). Stevens manages the three girls' gangs and learns they need to move faster than expected. Las Vegas lays a big dull egg, despite some of the cleanest images of the 1970s in Las Vegas, with the most common and reliable players and potentially a line line. To extend the life of a movie, there is something that is eternal, and when it does not, there are waves in it and it's not really fast. I regretted this movie a bit. Of course, I did not expect anything big, but at least this could have been one of the tricks of the 70s or something. Not even close. No one dies. Helter Skelter has a naked gunfire between Coraky Stuart Whitman and the practitioner George DiCenzo a year before his great performance as a prosecutor Bugliosa. There is an excitement to watch a waterfall in a gunfight. A blow with a corner tool and a head. Other than that, it does not move. And I do not expect too much for girls there. Stella and her daughters (both very mediocre but too many talents, sauna and hamam). What do you see? There is nothing other than an open side profile. Stella wears these beautiful outdoor costumes, emphasizing her real talents, but I would like to write something that might recommend the film. But it was a lack of this movie, and it's hard to say the least. This is not a terrifying movie in any way. there is nothing for him either. YAWN.
