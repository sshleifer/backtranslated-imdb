Some of these viewer comments are simply ridiculous. Is it painful to others? I apologized to my friend. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and very strange. Both Redgraves and Vanessa and Natasha did not meet this goal, especially Vanessa, making this remarkable fragile America's emphasis. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes looks like each other, as is my life, my wife. Still did not push himself in any way. Find a new way to look like a girl crying! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is the only paid part of this movie, it's on the five-minute screen and I swear to God that he has come out of the screen and did not wake me up. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, I see her better every time. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were both great on stage. <br /> <br /> So it was a good movie, it was very nice, the settings seemed fascinous, and it was a comfort to my intense boredom. <br /> <br /> I do not know, a movie with a film of "The Time's Biggest Actresses" is very sweet. Make sure there are several different editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a great shaking. I'm glad he died. But this is because I am bad for Lilanda, Ann's friend, because these two ladies were a better player and felt a little empathy for me. <br /> Goodbye. Bad job, movie tonight. You were not entertaining, you did not even think. I'm sure the book is better, so people do not spend more time. 3/10
