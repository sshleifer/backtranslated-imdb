I was very sorry about this movie, I had to warn others. This movie has no stories, goals, or signs. The film begins after the standard of "access to film", which has already become a habit of the audience. So, we should not see the beginning completely. We soon become acquainted with the main actress, and in this regard, it only clarifies everything you earn and is better than watching static. (If you do not see any white noise - EEK) Operation is OTHER and they should return to their pantomime from where they came from. Even the best actors in the world have said they will fight to watch this movie remotely. Their bad acts simply help disaster. Unprecedented violence and I only think that a word written from an "independent" writer who thinks of himself as an artist has caused a film that will endure your patience. Before I came back, I said, "We watch it for 45 minutes," and I realized that this movie was just as delicate and tasteless as a cup of tea without tea. Obviously, something was missing and, unfortunately, it was not the audience. Instead of telling you what's missing, let me know what's happening: Dumb Blonde (Surprise surprise), Victim, Wicked Man-Man thing, about 2 minutes long, day, week, month storyline ... and loans. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, look forward to wanting to blaze a little lush in the blonde girl looking at the scenes, but to see her face for the rest of the movie!
