The film is long and unfortunately different from Romance. If you want to see the movie, I will not read it as a shocking one. However, if cinematography is good and you are a fan of adventure genres that explores Africa, then go for it. The spectator's actions are enough, but many important events in the novel have not been deleted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother in search of his father. Gagool was cunning and killed in the cave, though he was shown as a good man who preferred to stay here with a new king.
