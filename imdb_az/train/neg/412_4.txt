Two special topics within the science fiction field were consistently curious, studied in cinematic literature in the past and then re-runed at the same time with different success rates at the same time by the directors and writers. The first theme is for fans of the time travel movie, as well as H.G. Wells has created a lasting impression of the screen with another version of the classic "The Time Machine". At the same time, the second topic that governs the critics is the invisible invisible imagination with endless and numerous opportunities. And this theme has become another HG Wells classic based on the film "The Invisible Man", under the direction of Paul Verhoevé "Hollow Man" and Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and her colleagues have been experimenting with the US government for a while, examining the inexperience and practicality of the primates they have tested their methods. In fact, they moved towards the point that ensured the invisibility; their only problem is to return the subject to its 'visual' state. However, there is a problem that Caine has been working hard and has been solving or thinking in the laboratory many hours later. When he succeeds in applying his theory to a lively topic, he decides to present his findings to the board of directors for the purpose of protecting the financial resources needed to continue the project. <br /> <br /> Last minute, Caine Demurs is afraid that project management will go ahead with the next level - before a human subject is tested. And he said he had been approved by the team to take care of this issue and to assist the research team. But something goes wrong and Caine is trapped in the invisible rod; and while he and his team are struggling to solve its great argument without delay, all this happens in Caine's mind. And suddenly, the fear of losing control of finance and control is a threat that loses much more. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven has created an exciting, even thought-provoking film at the outset; it builds at a good pace and uses it to use the F / X's superiority, though it lets the charm of the character attractive. Anyone who is familiar with "The Invisible Man", or anyone who, in fact, follows the story's progress, will know that Caine has not been happier once. Still, he has a story style that draws attention to Verhooge and draws viewers. But he resembles the drift to the loudspeaker and leaves any part of the nuance that has made his film so successful and refuses to enter into a final sequence that is a flawless bloodthirsty Festus, his audience and everything he has done in the movie betrayed Instead of looking for a clever resolution of Caine's suffering and making use of some ingenuity and imagination to achieve an inevitable conclusion to the filmmaking, Verhoeven is down the road, and though it can succeed completely at a viceral level, solved as a lot of noise in the wind, is something that can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Verxeven has a higher level than what is offered in this genre, and does not allow it to fall a little. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon is doing a good job of creating a loyal character just on the surface if he looks good at Verhoevé's moments. The description of the bacon is very small, but the director's agenda is much more than his ability. Verhoeven simply does not have time to develop Caine to no degree for Bacon; character is a boat, in which Verhoven can build his own story, and works for that purpose. The film would have been better, but Verhoeven and Bacon had a closer co-operation with at least Caine to develop a link between audience and some audiences that would have a bit of a hit with them <br /> <br /> Elisabeth Shue, Linda McKay, a poor assistant to the universe, plays a good role. though it is a selfless sacrifice, it is part of a blessing that Shue is less likely to challenge a caliber actor. The same can be said of Kim Dickens (in 2001, "The Miracle of the Sun"). His character, Sarah Kennedy, does less than supporting action and F / X. Both players are able to do more and deserve more than what they give here. <br /> <br /> Among the works are Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Even though it's fun to some point and succeeds at a certain level, Hollow Man is one of those movies that make you think about what you can do. As a one-year fireworks display, this will give you a bit of excitement, but you will soon be confronted with something special to distinguish between all the others you've seen. And it is very bad because it could have been more, given the talent and abilities of the participants. I appreciate it 4/10. <br /> <br />
