Seriously. <br /> <br /> I dropped Demonick's first look and did not succeed. <br /> <br /> I'm going to see the name of Charles Band in a movie and remember that he will be moving in my heart. He was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. It was a hope for the little man. <br /> <br /> The man who came to the video store instead of the multiplex, but we still had a harder end than the fashion dump that had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... that's it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hurry to clear the California Calouste Trail A double and abandoned train tunnel for the "Alps" had to be an "old cave". I would like to say that they did not even try to film in a way that would have to be decorated with moss or something other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy worship gladiator, we take care of the most recent wearer in the Wal-Mart Halloween dress, since it covers the cover. Sometimes, there is a very beautiful body that comes with an excitement to slide your finger, but does not learn to stand up to the last five minutes. Why could not he be a villain? Instead, there is a frat-length Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles bant ... should be ashamed that your name is related to such a visit. I love very bad movies, they are good. Hell, I sometimes get a flick, very bad, just bad taste. However, this is just indescribable. A perfect example to give a coin instead of making a quality movie.
