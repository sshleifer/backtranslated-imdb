Have not I ever seen or heard this betrayal before? My Alley is an irresistible 80-i cheese atmosphere, which is a bloody teenage, funny cunning and hanging around. For some reason, nobody really cares about it, the elite Catholic university staff and students are killed by an unknown psychopath. An experienced teacher Julie Parker, all the people in contact, are either dead or strange. This movie is hilarious! In fact, there is no logic or relationship, and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl and her body were killed in a container. Then, for some reason, the story goes on for three weeks as soon as possible, and the murdered girl has never been remembered or even let go. Not even by his lover! Acting is miserable and there is little nudity to enjoy. It is very funny to download the murderer, because makers have really convinced you to be an original twist ... This is not the kids! "Splatter's University" is one of the worst horrible caterpillars.
