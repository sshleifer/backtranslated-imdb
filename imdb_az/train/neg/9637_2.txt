Boy, this was a bad movie! Although I have not seen all of Burton / Taylor's collaborations, I can say that is worse. This rich but patient woman (Taylor, of course) has this beautiful island in Mediterranean, and is suddenly dominated by the crowds when suddenly it is visited by the traveling poet, who is an elder. In fact, the whole film is just a talk show. In 1968, such an ambitious nonsense could not make a head or tail and it was clear that it would take time. Without good cinematography and decoration, it deserves a negative rating. The only thing that is good for this movie is the unexpected laugh at the expense of the stars.
