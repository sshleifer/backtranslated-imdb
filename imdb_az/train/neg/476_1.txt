It's a good idea to keep a book's designated tone or transposed concepts instead of completely ignoring the author's transformation into a movie. Although the author recommends that Elinore Stewart's children be consulted, it is a reminder that children are completely misguided to increase their experience in improving, enriching, and strengthening their land. . The book reflects the lives of houses adjacent to itself and their spouse on the extensive Vyoming border; Although he lived a few miles away with them, he wrote daily adventures with his numerous friends and acquaintances. But the film is a standard stance for a time when it describes the woman's experience as harsh, brutal, and nearly meaningless. Perhaps the director has brought his Vietnam War experience to this movie (as some movie aficionados says), but it seems like an excuse to draw all the joy and beauty of the book, and it irritates it, and it protects your friends or your hopes. Do not waste your time with this movie; Read the book instead.
