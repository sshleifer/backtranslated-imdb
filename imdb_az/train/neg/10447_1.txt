I chose to see this movie, because here's a good IMDb account. <br /> <br /> Many people either really have a poor taste or make someone's account. <br /> <br /> In either case, this was really a disappointment. The title of the film was exactly stupid and far removed. Indeed, there is no reason to summarize the plot, but it goes here: it was as if someone thought: "It would be okay to shoot a movie when it was snake on a plane, why would it not go wrong and it bite?"? And that's about it! The area is gentle and incomplete. Snakes are bad CGI (but it's meaningful to cut corners in a film that will not advise anybody in their right). <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen - stay away!
