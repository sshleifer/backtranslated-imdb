At this point, the first film has spoilers - so if you do not want a movie and want spoiler, please read this review! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is a weak copy of the film's first cruel intent that it should be about Christian and Kathryn's meeting for the first time. Actors of Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are really bad substitutes. What can not attract the smarmy, snooty rich child attitude of the original actors. Of course, part of this dialogue - not between Christine and Kathryn, but if you listen enough, you will recognize it. There are discrepancies in the field - if this really happened to Christian and Kathryn first, then why did a girl fall in love with a girl at the end of a Christian film? <br /> <br /> For the first time, he was supposed to be the first love story of Reese Witherspoo'. <br /> <br /> Also, with the photography / "model you can" model was completely naked and did not add anything. In general, this movie was a waste of time. I do not believe they made cruel intentions 3.
