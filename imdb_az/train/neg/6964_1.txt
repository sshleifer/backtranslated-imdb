I usually watch a MTV movie award, watching a wondrous, entertaining show giving a unique premium show (Chewbacca, earning a lifetime achievement prize sample). That is not different this year. I'm not an admirer of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny for me - it's a trick to deceive me. I laughed at American Pie films in Stiffler's, and I even loved where I was in my friend. But the MTV movie awards were just awful. Nothing was coherrent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake needs to sing and dance; <br /> <br /> <strong> Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance last year were quite funny (The Rings Parody Legend) is worth watching the whole show but this year was quite different. Timberlake's Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're looking at a movie, but they've never met ... Here they are ...")? Where was the joke? Kate and Luca never went to their in-depth dialogue with Timberlake to connect with the "joke". And Seann was completely abandoned as a talent, and even did not smile, but he only laughed. What was Harrison Ford's liner? Has anyone given a real sense of humor? Perhaps MTV writers thought that young viewers would only know the old Fordu as president of Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the Air Force Union. I was shocked. And will someone ever talk to Adrian Brody? How old is this man and how old he is? <br /> <br /> This man is trying to move a little more than 19, looking at 30, so giving up, showing a class (like the best actor award ceremony) and keep track of your age! <br /> <br /> simply because of Gollam's speech for the best 4 Visual Performance. It was very creative, extremely good and the only smile of the whole night.
