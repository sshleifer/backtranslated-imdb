The black man is a rich white boy, and the rich white man is surrounded by the hip-hop culture and the most "funny" moments of this film come out of this game. <br /> <br /> My problem is not working and it almost never works. <br /> <br /> Okay, so you can not expect Lans to look like something like that and start working like Charles Wellington. It would be great to ask this question. I will give it to you. But at the same time, it extends beyond the other direction. I am reading a rich white boy playing rap as a hip-hop culture, and I'm thinking of being totally stuck and people accept it? And what about Sontee, who is in love with him as a wealthy white man, though despite his money or power? <br /> <br /> So far, I have added a star for a few days so it has made me laugh a few times and even complicated it. But I have not seen in any movie that I have not seen a good job in the movie I have seen, that did not make anything of the whole "white man's hip-hop". This is no exception.
