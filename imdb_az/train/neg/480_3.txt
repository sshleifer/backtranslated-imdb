2 stars for Kay Francis - it's beautiful! And the Warner Bros does not deserve this terrific tripe that threw its way! <br /> <br /> The two principal aspects of this film are extremely ridiculous and unbelievable. Kay is a small town wife and mother who wants something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a great actor comes to town and invites you to talk to Kay, Kay says he will go to the movie. The baby's mother puts a mistake on his wife's ears because she is not right and is waiting for her grief. He finds the actor in the hotel (talking only), and he kills and dies in a lying onshore (lake). Here are two incredible buildings, which are the rest of the film: <br /> <br /> 1) The Judge says to the jury that if they die before the head of the man dies, they must first find murderers guilty of murder. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think an insane guy slugging is the most murderous or the murder is not the 2nd highest crime! Give me a break! However, his assassination was found guilty <br /> < 2) The relative's lawyer, convicted and convicted, declares that Kayya has all his sins. In her opinion, if she did not go to the actor's room, her husband had to follow her and killed the boy. He expresses his condescension, not guilty, but of a guilty consent. Yes. Articles Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film tries to earn fame and money to mislead Bay from being released from prison and killing his predecessor. <br /> <br / Even I can not keep up with this review. The film was just too painful. Four years ago, in the previous code days, Kay never played such a nudity! Although true Kay Francis was fashionable, she did her best to believe that she was a convincing character. I give a lot of credit to this reputable role because I try to breathe life and reliability. <br /> <br /> This character was a pre-coded roar of Kay and roar of real life, Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> This is a way to open! There are so many better ways to Kai Francis! (Personal experience, I can recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel robust too, as well as Monica and One Way Passage I'm sure there are other great Kay flicks, but I can only see and recommend.)
