Never sit through a movie and then "wtf!?" As a great one. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> It is possible to forget that another direct video action is watching or looking better at the moment of feeding. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are frequently going to the action for the fastest renters who move to action because this story is pretty darn bad, and what is the motion flick watch if there are movement sucks and action blasts? Particularly, Robert Patrick is hitting a moving school bus while hitting a machine gun and hitting a machine gun. Co-stars environment is Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Hylands (TV Night Heat glory).
