This film describes Ruth as a femininity, drunkenness, gambling, and a little baseball bet. Babe Ruth's early life was incredibly interesting, and it was filmed for all intentions and purposes. Also, Lou Gehrig was hardly covered, and it was a well-known, well-grounded or indifferent thing that should not have been covered in a better way. His life was worse than bad. She was an American hero, and after many baseball chess, she became angry with her life. I feel that I'm fair in the eyes of a great baseball player, but this movie has completely ignored it. Embarrass the makers of this film to donate its magnificence, not its flaws.
