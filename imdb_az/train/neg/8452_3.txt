It's the first time I've commented on a movie that I felt right to read and do something about it. Over the past few months ABC Family has begun to switch to a new movie format. I've seen the last three and liked them. They were busy and deceived. My wife loves these movies. I was looking forward to seeing "Jane History". Trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is a film that has long been written before the writer and the efforts of musicians in this project. Year 2003, the source (all bad), was considered as a lift lift in a store. It was interrupted and did not add any emotional content to the movie. He tried it. I work in film and television. I love fun. I think this can be a bit worse. There is another decade in the script, and you know that these women can act, but you do not know this movie. The last thing me to shake my head to add to the overall experience. An advice to Disney, ABC, ABC Family, and managers of manufacturers: In any case, do not use a composer or music teacher to make one of your future movies. They lost their touch and understood what "modern", "modern" and "current" words were when explaining a romantic comedy. There is a world passing through you. All the Von Zerneck-Sertner and the ABC Family's nation is a great disappointment.
