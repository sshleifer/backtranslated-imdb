The performance of Fishrey (appearing in a strange laughable form) and Ed Harris (in short notice) draws attention from Connery, who does not sense the role and does not end in a portable behavior of a 80-year-old man. In fact, the scenario is not logical; Imagine for 60 minutes. A happy ending plot and a sudden kind of addiction without the need for any controversial structure against the heroes. Scenarios have more accidents and may be good for screenshots in schools. This impression is further reinforced by more details. Although it is a starting point, it does not matter here that death penalty is a matter; without further comment. The subject and the environment would be good.
