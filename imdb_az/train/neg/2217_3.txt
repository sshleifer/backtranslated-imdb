Faki-Russian scientist says in the film two-thirds of the film "I came for science". This is a complete empirical research as part of a half human hammer shark, which completely ends my reason for watching this movie, as an impartial scientist. Otherwise, as we have said, my girlfriend's brother is away from me and the rest is history. Saying special effects is bad, can damage the area of ​​special effects. It is not difficult to draw the shape of a car since 2005 with a plucked bluescreen background.
