When I really saw this movie at the age of 6 to 7, I was challenged and could not do anything because I was a great fan of Robin Williams. Until that. This full trash destroyed Robin for a long time. I only recently restored it with his funny, but serious part on the day of the Father, but then went on to make another mistake, called the Bicenntinial Man, but that is the point. Robin should start doing better now and now returns to the realization of the "classic" bone.
