Only a fraction of this movie was the price I did not pay. At least I lost about $ 3.00 and it was time to sit down with a bomb. The crew members who were responsible for the sustainability escaped the boat. While the woman and the FBI son went to the alleged killers, the FBI gave women a revolver. When the alleged killer exits the door, the revolver magically turned automatically. An FBP agent will seize a weapon for a citizen. I do not think so. Ms. Xavier looks like a very attractive woman. It's too bad that most R ratings do not allow it to appear. A movie editor cuts off one of the best parts of the film.
