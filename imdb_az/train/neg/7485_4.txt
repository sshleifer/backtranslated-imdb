Of course, it looks like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in the comedy Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Follow the movie and you will find it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin is not the lead. He is not a big slide on films like The Jerk, but rather a non-working one-to-one character. Hawn, who does not go into any game, is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Clich√© is just a partially funny member. I can not say how much he can change, but the characters appear to be unreasonable. They are making mistakes through New York, doing nothing, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. <br /> <br /> Many people in the United States say they are not a recurring topic in the film. <br /> <br /> Hire the original Odd Couple to see this.
