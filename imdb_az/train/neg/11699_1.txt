The Thinner area is completely polite. And overall. A fat lawyer runs a gypsy woman, and the Gypsy croak loses her and loses weight ... to the bone. Okay, Gypsy curses should be fun, but lost weight? Nope. Stephen King thinks so. And the other horror writer and the scenario writer of this terrific film, Michael McDowell, do the same. The lawyer is not only responsible for the crime, it's also fat, haha! Thinner resembles a purple scent that does not resemble a person who has hurt the way he does not see anything abominable in obesity. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
