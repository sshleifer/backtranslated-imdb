This movie seemed to be better than being over. The cinematography is good, there is something moving around, the dialogue is very tough ... but there is a doctor who knows about a doctor in this nearly twenty minute long scene, indeed a patient acting as a doctor - and <br /> also belong to the silliest-looking hell from Demon Demon's curse, Godzilla-looking. <br /> <br /> Later, cinematography could not save this movie. <div style = "text-align: justify" Although some of the actors have been extensively staged, the story is just no place, and I think Hellbored would be a better title.
