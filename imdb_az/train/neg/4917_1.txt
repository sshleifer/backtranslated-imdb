**** SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, one of the most funny comedies ever created for the screen. It is absolutely impossible to get any of them seriously. It would have been a great novel to celebrate all the comedy routines. During the celebrated days of the program, Carol Burnett and the company that frequently shot films, skewered in ways that are hard to imagine. Carol Jenny played, was suddenly ill with a slightly cough, and immediately came out of the treasure music and curiously looked around at the arrival of everyone. Harvey Korman played Oliver with the flowing locks and delighted Ryan O'Neal. <br /> <br /> In the end there is a scene of death. Jenny looks like she's really dead ... she dies to get her makeup artist and give her some color. And, of course, we all know that hospitals encourage the bed to stay in the last minute of the disease. The scene ends with Ryan O'Neal, sitting on a snowy bench, thinking of the future of the movie, and it's classic. It was very uncomfortable. It has never been saved.
