What was the purpose of this film? I think that many actors and their producers and directors do a great deal to avoid doing nothing. Even my favorite actor Bruce Dern could not keep my interest in this dull movie. A braindead falls with an ex-pugilist strange woman and her relatives. She begins as a corrective person for a woman and creates winds by striking a person and being captured in the abduction scheme. It was very strange that I could not even write correctly. You see, I am cute, and after scaring, be sure to go to bed.
