I love movies about morally degraded characters, but it was a lot. The actor was not good, but there was no real problem. The problem was a sting in the abdomen within about 20 minutes. These characters were empty. They did not have any depth, and how little was their brutality with each other in a friendly manner. It may be interesting to explore the darkness of some of the characters, but you have to give those characters to actual persons or simply cut them into a cardboard. These symbols were cardboard and their picture was ugly.
