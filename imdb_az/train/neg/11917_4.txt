Cengis Kon is a very light-touching English movie about a German police commissar who was dreaming of a Jewish comedy in the late 1950s and killed 15 years before serving under Hitler at the SS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the killing of the Caucasus, he said, "Kiss Kiss" in Judea. The police did not talk to the Jews, but they asked the surroundings until he found the meaning. <br /> <br /> "My kissing kiss" has created such an impression that everyone is involved in this killing, and the comedian's name has been learned by Chingiz Johun and recalled. <br /> <br /> There is a group of people killed in the jurisdiction of the police commander and there is no useful tip. Men are killed by a knife set of local butcher missing. The butcher tells the commissar that he has lost his knife when he is at the store to buy a liver and onion sandwich, so the commissioner is suspicious. The first person is happily killed for the butcher's wife, but the butcher is suspicious. But if the butcher had killed every single person with his wife, it would be very busy. <br /> <br /> I think, like myself, if I am killed, may be less angry than Chinghong's imagination. He behaves very well as he is in a subtle car crash. We can only guess that he is the only English film and that he is a very polite person. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie four films because it was just something. I thought it was a bit more serious. The film comes out to be a criminal offense (what was it?) And Chingin had to be more helpful. The film gave me a little overview on Jewish culture, but it was deep. Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Are they called "shtoop" and "meshuganah" in their daily vocabulary? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley, CA, and was the only person in the room I did not have. full gray or white. (I have no white or white hair). There were 18 people, and after the movie they were about 20 minutes to discuss the film. There were two major concerns here: 1. The film was very light, and future generations could not understand the weight of what happened and 2. As the Holocaust survivors died, future generations do not know what to expect. I thought the second worry was ridiculous and I said that I thought there was no need to worry about there, there were tons of literature and people who would like to watch movies like me will always be there. The killing of 6,000,000 people by a very bad man will never be forgotten. This is the last thing I wrote because they told me to talk about my experience today.
