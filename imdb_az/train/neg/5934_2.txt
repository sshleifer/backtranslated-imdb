I do not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's greatest supporters. But in my literary / musical genre, she acts as an important poet / musician. The most valuable element in this documentary is that Leonard reflects on his life and career. Warm and modest. Unfortunately, most musicians did not reflect the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary style. <br /> <br /> In this documentary, the filmmaker, especially the failed filmmaker, was able to see the viewer's ability to see. Leonard Cohen and how these musicians join him. From this point of view, many things are said, but the viewer does not go to the person of Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly explained by negotiations with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special symbol, but they can not translate Leonard Cohen's exact values. Cooperation with U2 is Persian. All live recordings appear to be a missed job. Just like in the whole film, Leonard Cohen remains a part of himself and can talk about his own part. <br /> <br /> All assembly and scenarios are a high school project. The use of effects like echo, slow motion or panic is very poor. Some of the camera work is heartwarming. Part of the account remembers my expectations. Sometimes the filmmaker added psychological elements to the film. Perhaps he is referring to using LSD once. <br /> <br /> Some unusual humor ... at one point explains how Leonard influences the genre of music. At first he could not remember the name of the genre, at last he said punk, punksters really got up to his music. The next scene in the movie is a live cover in the form of "I can not forget" ... <br /> <br /> "I will not forget, I can not forget Who I am"
