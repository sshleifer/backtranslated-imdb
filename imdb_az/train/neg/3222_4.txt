I was very disappointed in the 1970's by Bernard Malamud's story. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to fight the drug and the critical patient companion. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife, Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will be restored. The problem is that Morris refuses to live and believes that only Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> If he believes in him, Fanny is recovering, but in the end there is doubt and Fanny suffers. <br /> <br /> When talking to Fanny Morris who was killing, it would be great if there was an English translation on the last scene. <br /> <br /> In 1966, Miss Kaminska, the successful Oscar-winning director, starred Jan Kadar at The Main Street Shop, which was shot down in the movie, mainly due to bed scenes and the kindness that he had in his speech, He is calling for Ruthie, her daughter who does not obey them by getting married to Jewish religion, for most of the film she does not understand the appearance of the angel in the apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confusing, and Angel's girlfriend's encounter with Belafonte's apartment is memorable, short. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> This movie is a depression and desperation.
