Looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 popular video nasties banned in the UK. <br /> <br /> Some college children were banned and re-released in 2001, when preparing a home for the Christmas holidays. There are some creepy faces hidden along with four kids. Which of them are slasher? The real killings are not so strange, so this video is nastie really bad. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, a few years ago, maybe I've seen so many of them. The last bending was clever; I have to give credit to the writers for the end of the originality.
