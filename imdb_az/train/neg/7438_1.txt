<br /> <br /> This film is a waste of time, a terrible organization, a terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> Acting is complete, but there is no plot or script for the actors to work. Photography and some special effects are also good but still not interested in watching this movie. There is no logical progress for the story, the storyline is completely illogical. Not even scary. To be afraid of a movie, it must be a small element of conviction. <br /> <br /> The film has only three characters. Every character is irrelevant and no personality. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> See a completely scary movie interesting.
