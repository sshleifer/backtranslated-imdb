Naked, naked, naked! A 90-minute festival, 89 minutes long. Although it is an atmosphere (an abandoned barrier) and the possibility of being stuck in the graveyard, a story full of foolish dialogue is strangled by a stinker and is a difficult situation for you to be hip. In most cases, embarrassing and freezing attempts are flat (one example of this film's dialogue: after demonstrating artillery, the speed dolly is drawn to Barbau's vigilante character: "Any questions?", "Hyuck hyuck hyuck"). When it comes to bad acting, strange, homophobic jokes and the effects of living things, it resembles that director often follows The Evil Dead. <br /> <br /> I owe a lot of time with my friends to follow Turkey's ninety-nine leases that I can not rent and bring back to Turkey. What's up?
