I wanted to go with the original _Cruel intentions. She went along with this plot, and one of my favorite stories remained loyal to her characters. However, this film, in my opinion, was actually a minor rehash with the choice of the same storyline and a clear character. I did not tolerate any of them. The strongest part of the original story (not CI, Les Lesions) is not the event itself, but the characters and their interaction. When I read the IMDB, I had to be a comrade after reading the idea that this movie was supposed to be a beginning, especially since I had a series of "2" headlines. For all this, it should be said that this film is for me at least as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
