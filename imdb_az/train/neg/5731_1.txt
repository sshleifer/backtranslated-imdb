I watched the Unmodified version of this movie and spent about 30 minutes, so I did not get my time back. Hoping for a dialogue to improve, I thought the art of the period would finally be real, and the special FX looked really special. I'm wrong. I love the hero, I am a full belly. I'm like one of eighties among the best in the film world. However, if this film appeared in the eighties or early eighties, it could have been forgiven for its poor appearance. So there is no protection. The dialogue was horrible with the worst lines I wrote more than torturing the torture. I did not enjoy the hospitality, at least I thought it deserved to be, I fell on the Prophet and did not feel anything for the heroes, but it was like a sign for greatness beside the garbage. She gives you a twist that will never see the back of the lid for a live lunch, but I'm still waiting for the promise I'm talking about.
