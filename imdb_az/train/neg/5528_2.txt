In this film, I decided to break the zombies' rebellion on the DVD for just about 61 minutes and nothing to do with the TV. I was very surprised when the time came. This boot account (what - no brooding music?) And then quite slow moving start sequence started with incredibly beautiful quality. Gosh, I figured a movie about the zombie - even some of the 1930s (Bela Lugosi and White Zombie, of course) stayed some, but that was not. Zero. It was even dramatic (except for a couple of minutes with the overlapped eyes in the film to show someone's copy). Like the dreaded king of the zombies, this movie may also be of interest to you, but more.
