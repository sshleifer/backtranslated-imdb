[*** DOWNLOADING USES ***] The fame of this movie was predefined so I was waiting for the TCM to watch it in the mail box. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> Alcoholism, family divisions, For a film dealing with loyalty, gambling, and sexual repression, the film is unmatched straight, prosaic, lifeless and cliche-ridden. An example is the example of Frank Hirsch's disobedience: demanding his wife to "go upstairs and relax a bit" with his secretary's expectation of the expectation of his headache, and further predicting his evening connection with his secretary ("Hey Nancy, there's blues tonight, let's go "), all due to a well-worn formula. We do not feel that these are real people, but the cardboard cuts in the marionette game are cut off. Also, the source of friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never been really investigated or disclosed. Dave's repeated cheating with Gwen is unclear because of his fatigue failure to win or win. His future marriage was characterized by the character of Shirley Maclaine / Ginny, from the moment he was presented to this spectator, of course he was unlucky and clear - could be solved only by someone who was killed by conventional soap operas. The moment my jealous darling started to flee around the gun, I was betrayed myself - Dave or Ginny - was killed. All this was fake with the capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But in general I find that the film is part of a period of Hollywood history.
