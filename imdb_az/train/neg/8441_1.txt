This film was long and boring. Though they are surprised to be selected for Cannes, they behave as ambitious. Point, Kerkhof and Kruishoop are contrary to other Dutch stars, so Guernsey feels totally empty. That's why there is no kinematic quality. Long boot stroke does not mean kinematic depth, but a long drilling shot. The story was not interesting and there were problems I could not describe in any way. Actors did not shine in his direction and sometimes seemed missing. Leopold tried, but it's not your talent you're hoping to be. Where is Kerkhof and Kruishoop? Indeed, some Dutch waves created the film. Leopold made another attempt.
