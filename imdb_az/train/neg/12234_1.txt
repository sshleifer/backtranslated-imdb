I think it's pointless to take the second part of a movie like "My Daughter." "My daughter" was very good, but one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin Thomas J.) was ridiculing the second part of the film. The story is over after the first movie. Why did someone try to find a way to do something? It was meaningless!
