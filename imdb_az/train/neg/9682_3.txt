In order to eliminate the death of his wife, the old man is doing what he / she does at least (at least one in Peter Greenaway): he and his son fill his house with eight and a half feet (without one leg) and start a sexist odysseason. It's a Greenaway movie, there's plenty of ambitious and uninterrupted blabbering, and of course there's unnecessary male nakedness. In fact, his father and son share a teddy bear. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old man in full frontal? For homosexuals, one of the women wants to defile horses. There is no story - just a random collection of random scenes.
