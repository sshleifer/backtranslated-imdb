<br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a talent film that has been shot in the long line of no budget, no effort, and a comfortable cover is provided to hire a non-suspicious video store. <br /> <br /> Take a movie about watching this movie, taking a video camera and some red dining shots, and spending your night and night exploring and attacking people who are walking around the neighborhood. Congratulations, it just made the "Living Dead Hood"! <br /> <br /> We've seen some budget, movie shooters and actors showing little or no budgetary budgetary videos, but what is this? . If you are not a real masochist or are afraid of badly-scared fear movies, do not hesitate.
