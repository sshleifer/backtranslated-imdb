When watching this movie you have to ask yourself "What was it?" <br /> <br /> This film is nothing but an hour or a mess that you can say is that it's not a character, and it's not a symbol. <br /> <br /> What made me laugh about this movie was the story of the "Victorian story," which was actually a piece of the story. The entire Victorian division did not see any dialogue, and it consisted of pictures of a boy looking at the girl and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Even during the story, some part of the movie is recorded as a camera while staying at a train station. He does not come out once from a man sitting at the chair once. Oh, who would you want? This newspaper is coming home and almost invites you to tell this story about the dead girls. Thus, the story begins in the Victorian era. and the scene here (Guy and the girl are in the same area) (she starts playing pretty) (girl looks at the girl) <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is a very luxurious dialogue about a bunch of models who want to buy a flat. So, if this real estate agent showed them, and it was almost a dancer while saying that the dialogue was meaningless, it would go during the Macarena. None of the characters in this movie are like that. The models are incredibly annoying, Victoria does not speak to the people, and the storyteller has the identity of a strawberry onion. Finally, all the girls are killed. and when killed, I mean drug extraction. ooh ONE showed death? What does it mean to hold your face in death, putting it on the bloodstream? <br /> <br /> This guy even knows this story. He says he does it. but how? there was no boy in this apartment! As the door could not be closed by any means, the windows joined a very rotten fire escape to work, how HELL saw all this? Land plots. we love you. The film, first of all, pleaded for the interview, although "I think that's what it's all about, but this movie was foolish, meaningless and did not mean anything with many holes in the field. Sometimes it's a tough thing to do, something like a fish, "The Need for Hell" is indispensable with more than 2 dumb models.
