It was a predictable story and a stupid movie that was terrifying! Willy Nelson was tough like his braids. The film just seemed like a long advertising for Jessica Simpson's shining bright red lipstick - especially because of the many overlapping faces. Stage is not negative and as I said - soooooooo can be predicted. It was a shameful waste of how much money was spent on filming. Any other questions for other old Marilyn Monroe films did not increase the appearance of Blonde Ambitions. It was also incredible - Jessica Simpson could not become executive secretary in a hat-hit - it laughed!
