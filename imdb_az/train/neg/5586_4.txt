Man To Man is working hard to be a good film: it has the right place in the right place, wants to be epic, and undoubtedly has a message that everyone will appreciate. However, this picture also has some problems. This makes a lot of effort to be good and sometimes the viewer feels uncertain about the message. So it is enough to simplify the pictures used in this picture - "Man To Man" does not decide what the viewer is thinking about, but he draws the message in his head. Joseph Fiennes illustrated this role: his repertoire offers a single facial expression that he can really relocate and does his best to look at all other emotions. It loses speed because the movie is overlapped and easily results in the fact that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend: There are amusing, some humorous scenes and show-theft, by Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare him with humanistic masterpieces such as Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will be delighted with the theater. It tries to occupy your heart (even if it thinks your brain is too open) and it fulfills most of the time.
