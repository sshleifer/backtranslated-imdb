This film is a tool for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charity is not enough to raise the film above the poor script level. <br /> <br /> <strong> Matthew Bryza's additions to the Arnie movement are rare. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite miserable as a beggar who is a beggar. It made me feel uncomfortable with the fact that following D'Artagnan's move was a better player. <br /> <br /> The story has gaps and unexplained relationships; <br /> <br /> The upper part of this bill is Vladin's informant, which is called as a woman in the United States, but works for the context of a Russian government. <br /> <br /> The story is communist, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vladin is allowed to extinguish the entire car as a police vehicle. <br /> <br /> The same scene is weak, and therefore has no dynamics. <br /> <br /> Do not see the movie ...
