This is the worst movie I can ever remember. Everything was incredibly stupid and delayed. The player was also terrible. Camera work is not bad, but it still can not get it back. If the writer / director believes that this movie will help his career, he should avoid low syndrome. I wanted to take half an hour of my life back. I've been watching a video that's longer than ever. IMDb I believe in writing 10 lines to send me, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I have to warn others about it. As I came to this movie, my girlfriend asked for a local library, thinking that it was a Kris Christoferson movie called "Lost". I did not know who was responsible for this trash in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. As a result, I know the director / writer of this film on the street.
