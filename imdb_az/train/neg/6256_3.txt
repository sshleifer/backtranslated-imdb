Hmm ?? "I agree with the reviewer who said," Strange people with generous tastes are watching this movie. " I thought the film was interesting enough to watch. I think it's primarily Marsden and Speedman. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film is tantalized in a gentle psychological sense and deeply homophobic on the other. Override the past and triple thumb. <br /> <br /> I am not convinced that the film aims to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the actor was mediocre. Actually there was a 90 degree conversation. I wanted to bring some meaning from the field, but in the end it was only talking to a crazy man (Speedman). I feel compassion for her (Speedman), because of her loss, not really. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is bigger and, of course, less than the losses caused by more significant causes all over the world. <br /> <br /> Does the film reveal HIV / AIDS naivet√©? Yes: The intended audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious, evil killer? What a sacrifice? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor casualties are against God because of LUPUS, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, CANCER, or other victims. Because a disease is infectious, it does not admit or neglect - or it is bad - it is only IS. Is it exposed to ignorance or foolish danger? - NO. Are all people safe sex? - YES. Safe sex will save the world? - NO. Is there a safe sex realism in all situations of love and lust between a matte and emotional person? ?? NO ONE EVERYTHING. What will happen if everyone follows the rules, when no one is at risk, and if sex is never spontaneous or passionate? Do not you think the film is dealing with a gay workshop? ?? YES. HIV is spread through transfusions of blood or body fluids among infected and non-infected individuals. <br /> <br /> <p> <strong> <strong> </ strong> <div style = "text-align: justify; in fact, the film describes Tom's violent kidnapping, captivity, and the absurdity of Dan's intentions <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR < <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Impact: men who have sex with men may get AIDS Effect: HIV = AIDS Where is Tom's livelihood in sex movement? "Why did you dump her before you hit her?" What are we saying here? Is one of the parties silent? "Maybe he did not want to hear the truth" You greet me "He remained in heaven and knew me, how incredible is it? "Does Dane have any HIV in the event of HIV? B. the whole world is so ???? homophobic gay men with HIV, they reason, they will not give the rest of the world, and we all die? you are joking??? People are really crazy enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem? Are we thinking about tuberculosis victims in this way? malaria? I can see Tom's injury to Tom because of his wife's death and blame AIDS, but seriously? Who's guilty of this here? Victim or virus? Are the patients really responsible for the disease? <br /> <br /> Of course, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but not driving, flight, home, non-living. We really want to blame the victims for the disease? The safe sex between Tom and Dan did not stop Tom's spouse's death? Probably Dan is not just a responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is naked. <br /> <br /> Well-known Dan says, "Maybe you're right?" COMING! <br /> <br /> 24 days: Violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Do I have an excessive effect? Perhaps. But this film is based on homosexual men's finger for homosexuals, whether sexually or homogeneous, with a safe sex, and a fearful and hateful intent on "flat world." We all are in agreement with HIV / AIDS, and we must face it seriously. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of Straight Africans each year.
