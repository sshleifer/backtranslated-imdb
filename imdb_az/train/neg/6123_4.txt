When I was a young man who first saw this movie, I thought it was one of the best films ever. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and his various dressing situations. But since I'm old, I can say that this movie is terrible. Think about you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and make sure that he and husband-director John Derek are plentiful. But when you take this aspect of the film, it is a great boring ride. And Tarzan, of course, should be like all the muscles, but when he first sees Jane (of course), he will not be able to think. And Bo, wearing a green jacket in the Bosphorus, showed his chest. Tarzan could be the only element in the planet to solve this problem. If you are looking for a movie to glide over a beautiful naked body, you can fill it with this ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and valuable movie, go elsewhere ... Almost everywhere!
