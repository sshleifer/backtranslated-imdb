The movie was terrible! It's the worst movie i've ever seen in the last few years. One of these films is that I'm the worst movie I've ever seen in the next three years. "What is the worst movie I've ever seen?" Thank you for answering the question. Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message, and was thrilled to see the movie, but then they viewed the audience as a bribe. There is no story and story that is very magical and accidentally crippled. Nine prophecies are too bad to write, and they simply do not touch an entertaining story to pursue. They never used character development and did not care about the death of any character. It was ashamed to be one of the few people trapped around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is very boring, but when you read a book, I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen in everyday life. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I recommend not to see it if you want to keep the words close to your heart. Do not watch this movie. Trust me.
