A great opportunity to shoot an exciting film on the stardom edge of a rock musician and director of Indy. John Livian's traumatic past and his mind could have been an admirable film. Instead, John Lennon's life is a funny attempt to determine John Livian's life. John Livian's mother, John Lennon, was the hero of her mother's death, and she wished Lennon was as powerful and productive as she was. Instead of allowing John Lennon to show his brilliance and to learn something about others, he showed that instead of Lennon's heritage, he had a mixed, narcotic substance, which he regarded as God. human I'm a great fan of John Lennon and this film reminded Lennon, another crazy man who was cautious with Mark David Chapman, the murderer of Lennon. Lennon was a man who had been brutally murdered by a man who had a personality crisis with Lennon. Should We Remember It? John Lennon gave a lot of music and honesty to the world, and as a main character in this movie, I was forced to see another dissatisfied person, Lennon's discretion, and did not make a great contribution to the world. Yoko Ono remembers John Lennon's memory and remembers Johan, giving the chance to pay his respects to the Central Park. Instead, the director of this film chose to use this site to attempt suicide. I found it very uncomfortable and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died of a terrible, meaningless death, and in the vicinity of this site, such violence seemed to be a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. The film was completely destroyed for me. It could have been a good movie, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not to be reminded of this irresponsible movie.
