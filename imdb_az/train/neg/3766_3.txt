I went watching this movie without knowing it would be great. but what I was witnessing was terrible for words. I do not mean to be tough, his only film was terrible. Generally, it was bad, I mean the AWFUL special effects, the player is not too bad, but it was good and self was sasquatch .... well, sasquatch. In my opinion, the best sasquatch movie Harry and Henderons. it's not violence or horror, but sasquatch has the best description. at least its a suit and half-ass cgi off-off. Whether you're just helpless in this movie or really thank everyone in the movie. or boondock saints, it is better to watch.
