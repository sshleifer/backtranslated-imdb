This movie was like a bad train crash, and it was terribly hard to watch. My husband and I rented him and spent two hours of the day. Now do not get me wrong, acting is good. Only one movie was just angered by both of us. There was nothing positive or good in this scenario. After this movie, I have to rent something that's a bit lighter. Jennifer Tilly is usually a very dramatic actress. His character looks manic and all. Darryl Hannah, despite the situation he is playing, is doing a great job playing the situation he is in. Several times I'm trying to put myself on television or call for violence. Generally, a very fierce film is not a weakness.
