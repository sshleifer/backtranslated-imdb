Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. Although the actors have a pretty good job, especially Smith, there is no cure for poor scripts in production. The film really had a "sequel" of feelings that performed partial events of the first film. In a word ... the story was bad, it was good. <br /> <br /> There was a kind of "elite" force in the first scenario of the MDD. You had several special agents and had a "secret" part. Subsequently there is JROTC Summer Camp vibe in the MIB Organization. <br /> <br /> The film is not something terrible or anything. Only the "coolness" of the first (to avoid a better expression) film. Many of the same old humor has been rejected for the second time and really did not add any originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> Episode 1 would be one of the first 3 films in a perfect analogy. Was it good? Yes. Deserves to be given his name? Not really.
