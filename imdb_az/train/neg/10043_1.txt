I would like to write about the story, but nothing was missing. You would like to quote a few challenging dialogs from the movie, but "hinglish" is funny only for 5 minutes. I was forced to slip through the 'stop fraud', but it could have been predicted as a massacre, a Yash Raj movie (?). I would like to talk about movements on the ground, but I did not like cartoon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Sado-masochists" - This movie is more effective than the barbed wire of the Silas guy who is in the Da Vinci code. 3. People who explore alternative ways to spread terrorism - drinking at the audience, were in mood to kill someone. 4. Film Pirater: More power than them. That's what if any movie is worth the money to watch the audience. 5. Most species of plantains, plankton and green moss - Because almost every other creature needs an IQ factor depending on what the film offers. Later, the director of the film is obvious. <br /> <br /> This is something that can create a better movie: 1. A story 2. Choreographer 3. A Scenario author 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (I already said?) 6. Guide - preferably Anil Kapoor <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons I love the 2nd movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English sub titles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" - "My heart is in a gap", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" "I become a flirt, my darling, a vagabond" .. extreme. /> <br /> In short, Tashan is like a Rubric cube - Cub is supposed to increase players' IQ level, and Tasan promises to lower IQ, and it's just 2.5 hours !! Woot! <br /> <br /> * Hageri * .. But only to me. You may be wrong, but you may have warned.
