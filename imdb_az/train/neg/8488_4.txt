Ada Byron Lovelace, illustrated by Tilda Swinton, who has a virtual reality, computer background, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to express your identity in the community, and this movie should be great. If you think of the potential, that is terrible, terrible! Player - Tilda Swinton and Karen Black. The construction of the site is not difficult to say at least: a modern day programmer is a single registered character, but half of the film spends its character, and then the Ada finally appears to avoid the story of her life, an interesting story (Swinton says, removes). <br /> <br /> Digital effects such as digital dogs and birds are loyal and noteworthy, given that you recognize it as a real person. 1997, 1985. Finally, the script is only bad. The bad, often ambitious dialogue - especially the battles between the programmer and her lover - cried out to me - a zero attempt to create cold and distant heroes and miracles. The programmer successfully connects a person to the past! Amazing! But she will not be surprised at anybody and her lover says, "Be careful." <br /> <br /> Although it's about computer and Ada Lovelace and math love, it's clear that no one involved with the scenario gets any information about math or computer - The references come as a full-fledged jumbo that prevents any suspicion from ceasing to exist. <br /> <br /> One scene movie is pretty good, a monologue that expresses grief in life's jealousy, but sadness in the joy of life by Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in this movie because it's an opportunity for an exciting little cult movie. If you see something interesting on the subject, you can lease it, but it should be pre-recorded. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < she asks if she is not in her memories (I thought I was the best scene in the film). But then on the contemporary day, the programmer seems to be reminded of the fact that the reminder is to be transferred to his little girl (hence the name of the film). Do not the programmer violate the Ada's wishes? Or do you think I'm wrong about it?
