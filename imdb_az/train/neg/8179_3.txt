"A treasure hunter is looking for a hidden treasure in West India, the golden charm that causes the tension to rise as the place of the treasure touches, and the deep sea divers find the hope of watching gold, which leads to envy and hatred," according to a DVD leaflet. "Manfish" is not a name for their boat but a monster. Half of the skeletal treasure map providing muscular Captain John Bromfield (like Brannigan) is very good. Old salt Victor Jory (like a professor) presents the other half of the map. His first companion, Lon Chaney Jr. (Like Switzerland) plays mute and sexy Tessa Prendergast (like Alita) (very well, obviously). <br /> <br /> Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
