For DVDs, I hired and watched this movie without any reviews. So, after waiting 15 minutes, I realized that something was wrong with this movie; this is horror! That is, the tracks looked horrible and serious! I think that Eli Roth (film director) would have been funny if all the characters in this movie were foolish ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? YALAN!) He, You should look and learn from the worst fears and comedies, such as "The Night of Fear", "The Lost Boys" and "The Death of the Dead"! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> When it comes to watching the movie for the second time, write a note for my "partial" review to show how stupid the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (comedy) I can watch and still love it many times! <br /> <br /> How bad is a script and a director? It's a bad thing, there are horrific scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> Looking at early scenes, Henry, the dog hanging from his mouth and dead does not know that she is a lying dog on the floor with a glassy look. <br /> <br /> In one of several films, a few days ago, the forests?) is not "nothing." In scenarios, the bearded man is only aware of the trees for "shouting". <br /> <br /> Then, Bert, the "most intelligent" of the 5 packages, gives us an example of starting a forest fire. Now he begged for help and here he wants to break the record using the film "F-word". Bert begins to become angry because Henry is a very bad disease. Bert: Do not give me your shot! <br /> <br /> Bert returns to the booth, but what does he say about it? She meets Marcy and Jeff, sexually explicit, but now decide to go one by one! Bert, Bert, started in the previous era (yes, the moment of clarity for a change) Bert is not a word about Henry because he thinks he's killing him with Bb's weapon. <br /> <br /> Then, when the five Estupidos sit around their fire, they show another strange dog. (Maybe what is the warning about the trees? It is full of strangers ... and their dogs!) They just sat down because it was a great bag full of mystery. <br /> <br /> Dear Henry, in his office, (suddenly) NOTE: Each time it stretches a few meters from its booths!) Even worse looks like zombie! He says he needs a doctor. But Young Einstein refuses to help the poor absorption. It certainly comes into the recruiting truck, which has the ignition key. Henry seems fairly smart to get away from hell, but pours blood on all the panels, seats and windows. Fantastic Five, a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* Huh? Tried to play basketball in the middle of the woods), a poker and one (insecticide?) Spray unit, ready to fight an unarmed and terrible person . (intelligent writing!) Bert controls the car's killing with a single shot of BMW Elie, which is only possible by the idea of ​​director Eli Rooth. "What else should I do?" Bert defends. Jeff and Paul are trying to hit Henry with bat and poker, but instead of losing the windows of the truck and crashing. Henry "It's right for us!" He goes to dumb girls. (Thank you for the information, dear masters, we can see it!) But Marcy does not want to hurt you! Marries, Sprays in your eyes to make Henry jelpin! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's weapon in a fire inside a cabin and touches a burning entrance below the fire! The next day, Bert and Jeff headed, "Where is this wisdom?" "For a mechanic," Marcy decides to "help her" in the woods just like Karen is behind. Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul, because Jeff and Bert were already going to "help!" <br /> <br /> I suddenly heard how Marcy was at a CANOE rowing on a large and winding river but at the same time he goes to the riverbank and finds a very large and exhausted cabin and, as in the most frightening films, he says, "Hello? Suddenly Bert left behind a furniture and scared him (and me first). And Jeff comes. How did they come? Did they swim on the river? <br /> <br /> He does not notice the blood on his truck. It's about 35 minutes away and I decided not to torture myself and went to DVD. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, give yourself a blessing and "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" or "Return of Living Dead". Then you'll find that it's more fun than anything else. It is even more strange than "Cabin Fever" at the Toxic Avenger part 2, which is a bad film.
