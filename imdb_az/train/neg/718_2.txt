People are still "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." Peter Sellers's second billed role. But it's a mistake to watch this movie to see Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> Sellers are playing Amphibulos, a former British prime minister, a defective rebel prime minister of the poor island nation. Drillers during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both British and Soviet interests to win easily, "everything is very efficient and all our cards are at the bottom of the table." <br /> <br /> Terri-Tomas is a typical character, a brutal British diplomat who wants to show the UK's Gaillardia, the UK does not forget them, but vice versa. </ P> <p> is considered moderate because the comedy is simple. "The cause of Carlton-Browne is moderate, because there is no comedy. <br /> <br /> After a good opening, describing the only two powers of the film, The sympathetic circle of Terri-Tomas and John Addison's full score is slowly falling slowly into burns and mild miscommunication tricks, with Carlton-Browne's director and Gaillardia (no one can ever find on the map) <br /> <br /> Therefore, when we reach the island (expecting a lot of bright jokes), expectations are fairly low. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. or the island itself, which appears in the Mediterranean, protects honorary guards at the airport and the research stand is split into the middle of the parade. <br /> <br /> The army's appearance is still in the horse "The army uses a lot of horse in the war." <br /> <br /> The buyers are re-born on her character island, Lor Loris, who inherited the Gaillardia throne after the assassination of her father by Ian Bannen. Bannen is confused and feels like she writes. Normally it was a likely target for theft by Sellers, but with a strong emphasis and trapped behind the fatty mustache, Seller is a threat to those who remember her in a happier way than in two other films since that year. "<br /> <br /> This film was produced by Boulting Brothers as Jack, where Roy Boulting was also a co-director along with Jeffrey Dell: Boulting movies generally combine the bad public line with something - comedy goes, but there's a lot of felts in here. Amphibulos, Carlton-Browne works with a mixed English vibe for all its values ​​("This man, as you say, the Chinese bull's bull"), while pretending to be more than worth it. <br /> <br /> The film's weakest and most remote element is romantic with young Lorisin Ilyana. <br /> <br /> Luciana Paluzzi a point to be played on the shelf. <br /> <br /> The film is shaken by a speedy revolution that will not surprise any surprise decision. , and Carlton-Browne's latest move. As you can see, he lives to see another day, but the same movie is DOA.
