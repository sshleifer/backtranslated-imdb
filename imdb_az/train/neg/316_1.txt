This movie is the worst movie ever made. Lars has to create a movie that is more lucrative than the curse of a film that plays Lars. Before I can watch a movie trailer for this POS, I have to say that Space 6 times I can watch Leprechaun Space. After this disgrace, Adam Sandler should be restricted from any film. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and enthusiastically put your dick in a blender. Everyone who has half of a brain cell will realize that this film is not worth a single dime. If I had an extra dollar and spent, I would give Lorraine Bobbitt support before buying this movie.
