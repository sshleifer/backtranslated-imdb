Oh, my God. I thought this movie was a tension, a joke for me. Apart from the point in which he was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> Films, films, films, films, movies, movies, movies, movies, but this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in 2008. I believe that this film is not known and I think it's a movie like it, which joke about the genre of tension for similar films. /> <br /> I'm a fan of thriller films and even anyone who has movies just to get away from this movie.
