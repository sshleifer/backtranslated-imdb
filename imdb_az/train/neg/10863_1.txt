LAGE RAHO MUNNABHA is a really disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but it really succeeds ........................... <br / > <br /> This movie will not really waste your time and money. On the first day of my release, I went to this movie with my comrade and enjoyed the cinema .......................... <br /> <br /> CIRCUIT ' The role of this movie is very small. I think SANJAY-DUTT ARSHAD VARSHI has reduced its role ........ <br /> <br /> The character of the movie was not as well defined as it was in the past .The result of OVER-CONFIDENCE was shown in this movie ...... ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​COUGH is also unclear and not mixed ..... ............. <br /> <br /> Indeed, a very big assault
