This is actually an insult to the victims and the families of the ICTK killer. The events in this film are not even close to reality. Why can not real-world movies make it so much more interesting that real events will be more interesting? Do not even waste your time watching for free. Embarrassing portrayal of events that do not have to budget or similar joke, what really is this movie. They would have allowed me to give this movie a -10. He did not imagine it, and from the 80s he was taken to an old VHS video camera. Save time and money without watching this movie.
