This movie begins with a certain promise; but in my opinion, when the hero steals the good Samaritan to help when his car is broken, he begins to lose. This is just as insignificant as a stranger's good start to his car when he is away, but he is one of a few people who can help rebuild his family's life. <br /> <br /> I found the best of this movie the best. Cinematography in the direction of art would be as good as possible. The player was good and Eva van der Gucht was reading.
