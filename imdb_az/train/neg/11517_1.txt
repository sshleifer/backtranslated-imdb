I really like this movie because the critics did not betray these words (at least to say) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. <br /> <br /> I want to look at this movie as watching a car crash, but do not fall in love. /> <br /> Because she wants to see how dirty it is. Yes, the car collapsed and there is no loss. Moreover, cinematography was nice, I just wanted to go to the festival to clean myself of myself <br /> <br />
