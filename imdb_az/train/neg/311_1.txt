I'm just going to ship. I have to say that we have to send every single copy of this film to Iraq and watch them. I even tried to try to follow the snowy women and closed it for about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for writing, for example, those responsible must be forced to watch this movie forever in hell! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget of this film was $ 10,000 and was on their way. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this subject? Each store has a large large building of this crap sitting on the spot. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use a DVD as a coaster or trade with a friend, but they can no longer be your friend!
