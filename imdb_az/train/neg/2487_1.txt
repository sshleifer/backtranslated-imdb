Some Rambo collects "Miami Vice", about 80% share the budget, and some ten-year-old boys have a huge expensive garden and many entrances. For "Penthouse". Cop and former commando McBain (employed by Busey and McBain, you know it's strange as they come) are hired to buy a stolen and hiding American sipperkoma in Mexico. Tank Sgt. Great O'Rourke (Jones) and the old love of McBain Devon (Fluegel), the emir of the Emirate for orders and hardworking terrorists / spies / narcotics, do not have any foolishness, evidence, blah, blah. For a motion film that is sexually immoral, there is very little gender and one action. The famous joke is always shot and killed by McBain and keeps bullets as souvenirs. Undoubtedly, the writers did not think about "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man has come face to face with us") or McBain. Even for a budgetary worker, production values ​​are weak during dialogue and with very little motion pictures. The main propeller, tank, is quite intelligent for Ed Wood production. Flüegel could have been a blonde Julia Roberts (who played a very big role in Julia's "Murder Story"), dropping off the warning of a moment again and again. Jones shoots quite a bit in the incredible series of films. Both he and Busey were probably just about some easy money and a few laughs. Search for a stereotypical, dangerous part of the talented, future actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico"). Even a guilty pleasure is very boring, "Bulletproof" still insists that it is not so noisy to play while leaving your home, but to think that someone is at home.
