I was very pleased to spend this movie early and thought that it would be a pleasure and I wondered how Tom Hanks's role in maintaining the Bachelor Party version in 1984 could have improved. I'm right ... I honestly thought that would be a good thing ... Be sure there were some funny moments but they did not see the brand with me ... The player was good and the story was very good, but it would be great I think ... This film is for teens and young people; women's bodies, alcohol and sex ... Another typical discovery of a recurring and revolving mill party movie. This sound for me 4/10.
