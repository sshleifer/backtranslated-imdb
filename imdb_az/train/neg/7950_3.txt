Cafe Lumiere is a beautiful painting. I did not get to know the director's work, and I met the director who was blessing Ozu Yasujiro. Even though it did not reach Ozu greatly, Hou did not feel the depth of Ozu and nothing in concentrated sense in a closed space. One of the things he missed was to pay attention to Ozu's character - we were not even presented with Hou's lead character ("a perfect blank page"). His people do not have medium or close shots. One of the DVD adds to the actors and does not specify us. Hou - they look good on their faces. <br /> <br /> Bardem had a great Spanish movie named Nunca Pasa Nada. To something like "There is nothing". It will be a better topic than a meaningless exercise. In one of our movies, we've given some clues about a Taiwanese composer. But clues are nothing more than anything else. If you do not have a coach, there is nothing that this movie recommends.
