There is a bad review for this movie, though there were quite a lot of hopes for this movie. I was extremely tolerant and watched the whole movie. I felt extremely ill. <br /> <br /> Although I was sensitive to the least disgraceful or even tasteless movie - both of Woody Allen's' I enjoyed everything I wanted to know about sex. and Michael Hanneke's "Funny Games" - I have found the obedience of directors who want to completely scare the milk of the eighteen-year-old women. When I filmed all of the film, inside my mother's milk, and in an "orgy" of a loved woman after the movie, I was screaming for hatefulness and hate for the sentiment pope. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I enjoy the independent films, so this flick made me very happy. Do not waste your time on this movie, it should be postponed to the Anniversary of History as a lesson in a bad cinema.
