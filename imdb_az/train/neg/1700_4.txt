In the film, I think it should be more than your art. I think, more than that, there should be a way to tell a story on the screen. This is a short story from David Lynch, but not many. It was funny to be a comedy, but I felt so strange. I do a good movie, but there is really nothing else. As I said before, I'm a big David Lynch fan, but in fact I'm annoyed that I have not seen some of the needs. This is the least favorite thing I have ever done, but I know that there is still a ton of talent and I am thrilled to see what has been earned for us in the future. If Lynch wants it, check it out, but do not be surprised when you do not like it.
