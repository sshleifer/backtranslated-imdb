This is not a good movie. Section and story line was a very good sub-par. 3D was okay, but not superb. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are 3 young flies who want to have the adventure. Heroes are lacking, I really do not care about these characters, and I feel that there is nothing to keep the maturity of interest. <br /> <br /> This is not Pixar. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more specific 3D effects. Also, I would like to see more strange jokes than I am saying, "Lord of absolutes." Pretty sexually active, showing women as married women and frustrated.
