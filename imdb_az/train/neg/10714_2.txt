The movie was horrible for two of the most funny comedians. He quickly conveyed it and found nothing better! Loss of time and money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought it would be so beautiful in comedy. The preview was very large, but they just showed the best part of the movie. My husband even sucked, thinking that to shake a chick. What is this? The film was very boring. At this point, I will not recommend to anyone. I would like to return my money! Arizona here for us. Thanks, but thank you. Such things are foolish to think that you are pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, I had my own children and helped others to give birth. It could have been more with truth lines.
