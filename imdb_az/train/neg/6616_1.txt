I promise you that I have no power in Bollywood films and have seen only one handful. But do not start with it if you do not see it! I'm very pleased with what I've seen so far, but I still did not. And I did not tell you that I will not finish this movie - it was annoying. Why was he so annoying? <br /> <br /> The film has a 'Rambha' symbol. It is more sensitive than Jar Jar Binks - I would never believe that it would be possible. That's it! He spoke with a falsetto voice and I thought it was a comic relief. Instead, she just grated my nerves and wanted to die her ... slowly! Her voice, her behavior, and her immorality - she was the judge of every scene she had bound and she had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes have been able to easily shoot the AK-47 bullets. I do not like you - there were a number of unarmed children carrying a small rifle with these attack rifles! And repeatedly, beat the ruffians taking a bullet! It was secular in the eyes of Stallone's "Rambo II"! <br /> <br /> The film is on your face and in a tense way, so my brain is bleeding! The film was made by people with the meth effect! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and move, move, move ... This movie is designed exactly for someone who can not shoot a movie with the plot and want to move about 100%. <br /> <br /> The two main characters and their actions and motivation have zero sense ... nothing happened! <br /> <br /> Perhaps you can join this movie if you are a fan of Bollywood, and you can see what's happening in the IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is bad and dingy!
