With such a theme, this movie is just and out of my understanding as it did not appeal to me. Of course, there are a few pieces of illusions and a few eyes, but the film is shot and the general story struck me just as a tough and lazy attempt against the negative "shock" tactics ... the one who harassed and killed a closed woman on the roadside. He and his brothers are arrested so long as they do not encourage their brother to come out and see his girlfriend in the woods. He forced him into a house where he was stabbed, and then showed him a collection of children kidnapped in the basement. The captives captured by heavy drugs form an elderly lover, a "dark" neighbor and a sex polish manager. He explains what he wants to kill. He kills HIM and then directs men (or pigs) to torture and murder ... The vast majority of violence and humiliation are associated with eating and genital mutilation - all of these are far from disturbing and unfounded. The best scene is sometimes a graphic broom that is exposed to the aggression of a painful person ... Of course, "I spit on you", "Throw your grave", "Spit in your grave" was an unofficial outcome - based on the title - is a reference to the main character - suggested that his mother is Camille Keaton. Personally, I think this is a brutal blasphemy! This film is trying to blow, but unsuccessfully unsuccessful, an amateur confusion ...
