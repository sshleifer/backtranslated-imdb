As seen in the longest running 1 hour 35, Al Pacino provides the right performance to make sure. Its not a typical font, it was nice. But his character was simply tough. Someone who was abducted by forgetting his appointment as we understood that Hollywood had saved her from the energy of her life. But in this film we needed someone we love. For some reason, every character in the picture conveyed to Al Pacino's betrayer, saying, "I love Eli," and I could not even approach him. <br /> <br /> Other actors also played their usual style. Tea Leoni, Richard Shif and Bill Nunn did not do anything to change their identity on television or in previous films. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, Kim Basinger was able to deliver all the performance of such a table in the movie. Most scenes do not propagate the story, but then collect faktoids on characters that play an anti-climactic end. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz, "Once you have Hollywood, you will not get out." Yes right! And so many people have been shot in Hollywood.
