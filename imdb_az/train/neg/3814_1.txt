I can see little girls enjoying this show, but this one family's show is ridiculous. I'm surprised how all these years are remembered. This is not an extremely indifferent and stupid show about the three-widow father coming from his wife's brother and his stupid-friendly school and about what happened next. All of the site lines are generally genuine. In the middle of each episode, someone is strange and each episode they make is ending with an illogical joke. As for actors, I did not like them either. Father Saget was painless as father. Dave Coulier is a cartoon sounds and a recording of a year ago that moves like a child takes 30 jokes and she is strangely. John Stamos was the most tolerant, but he was very cliché, and it was hard to follow. The oldest girl, DJ, was a really bad actress on the show and did not show any emotion. The average girl Stephanie was very clichéd as her very nervous little sister. The youngest girl Michelle Olsen showed what kind of actress the twins are. You can always say when you extinguish them. The plot of many story lines was so unusual that they were fools. This is a "family" show where they try to replace any good stuff with love and affection, and even though they are needed for a family show, they are so overdided by so many things. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrific show. TVG 30 minutes.
