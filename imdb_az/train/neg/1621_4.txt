"The Fox and the Child" - French director Luc Jacquet's new film brought us the Oscars award-winning documentary "Penguins Marti". <br /> <br /> This is a young girl around the world (beautifully played by Bertille NoÃ«l-Bruneau) and her fox pays attention to the flourishing friendship. <br /> <br /> Here are some really admirable moments; a lynx to chase a fox with a forest involved in badgers; Especially when a fox explodes with a wolf land, one area is quite intense and sometimes frightening. <br /> <br /> <strong> Cinematography is beautiful. The film's unique look is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but very few dialogues have been dubbed poorly. The score is too fluffy or at least I liked it; <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful morals of the film and Noel-Bruneau's silent performance, the scenario is scarcely split into two of a sophisticated scenario, a pretty, realistic star fox. These charming moments, which focus only on our furry little friend. However, it is not nearly enough. <br /> <br /> - Visit www.mybluray for the latest news, news, discussions, and more in the movie. com.au
