I was not sure what to expect from a Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi genre, but I thought it would give me a spin if it took into account the actors involved. The sound of the movie goes through patches of all genres but has never been balanced so I did not give up, and because I looked at each character I thought that I was concentrating on cinematography and individual speeches. the nature of the story (nothing to do here) had very little depth. I have to say that he feels a lot longer than his 96-minute working time and is not in a good shape. Finally, we were looking for closure, some satisfaction, but it could not have been a clever or mighty piece I hoped would be. I was mistaken at what Tony was doing at the end of the movie ... but the previous 95 minutes was a tragic mistake to try and verify with an unexplained result. As a result I feel deceived. The IMO would be better off standing just like a piece of art ... without ending ... just. Or ... I might have completely missed :)
