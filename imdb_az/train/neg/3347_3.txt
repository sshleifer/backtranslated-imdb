I'm not sure I loved Dolph Lundgren. When I see him on the screen, everyone who works hard will feel that it depends on talent. This is a good feeling for everyone who is not talented. Some of the other investigations point to how mockery is, but there are many indifference to mark the positives. <br /> <br /> Any film that has been killed by at least one teasing teenager can not be all bad. Why should one of the younger filmmakers always be included in the stereotypical teenagers? Are there other types of teenagers? Are each group of teens an angry black boy? What a genius nobody likes? A slutty girl who is very friendly and pregnant (in this movie)? Everyone is happy with the social networking talent (but what is talent?) Against one of the home-made blocks. And a retarded black boy, which is compatible with the universe and the very cool that all other neurotic children rely on. Then add a couple of adolescents to any color world-wide. They do not speak much, but they are shot at some point. <br /> <br /> If the bad guys were detained for bombing the school, the arrest would be better. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the trick is worse. When bad guys (and girls) finally catch a van full of drugs, they sit inside the valve. They want to re-paint the van at the school's paint store and take the van to school, but the minibus will not pull it again. By the way, it would be much easier to put all the drugs in another car, or two cars, or another truck or truck, and take the Police Van without re-covering. They also cause the drug to be transported or not sold, or else they do nothing else. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, children and teachers (Dolph Lundgren) have decided to kill, although they are not aware of the fact that schoolchildren are in school after school. The aching at school has nothing to do with painting, so why not go after them? <br /> <br /> As a result, the best part of this film is armed with numerous machine guns and continues to find teenagers (including a boy on a wheelchair) and they run hundreds of bullets in teens and generally misses. There are some bloodshed towards the end of the film. Everyone should have at least three hundred bullets lost when he was shot. The hairs are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I'm reading one of the evaluations that says this movie is a $ 10 million budget, and I'm surprised. When he saw the film, Lundgren saw it as a kind of charity work for a movie school where he was a teacher. Maybe the film was the end of this year's exam. It was a trial to watch, but I did.
