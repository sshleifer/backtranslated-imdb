Spike Lee has been experiencing a decline since his early successes and there was nothing to help this confusion. My film often hopes the movie ends or gets to the point. <br /> <br /> Lenin's first black-and-white film is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? Italians resemble laughter sex, but not with women? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to Scorsese. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the many Lee movies, in particular the name "Make the right things." This movie is a waste of time.
