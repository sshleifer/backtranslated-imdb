This movie started well, I felt like I was watching a mature version of Seinfeld. Very soon I started questioning the characters and actions of the main heroes and did not see what they were doing. The whole actor was perfect, but only a few scenes were really funny moments. Dan Cortese was amazing. I liked her in this role. His agent must show this movie to casting agents. Look at the first few scenes and then find something better, or you're completely lost in this confusion. I found this in a video store at one thousand. It cost me two dollars and I feel like a good price because of the perception of this movie.
