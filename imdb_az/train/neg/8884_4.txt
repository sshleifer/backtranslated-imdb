The phrase "Dominique", "slow-as-pekmez," is one of the movies to be invented. Too many infinite and recurring sequences (do we see slowly going down the stairs as Robertson heard someone playing a piano?). Unfortunately, a second twist, which results in a bad taste in our mouths, is taken back from a stunning twist. It's not a very nice movie.
