I need to add some ideas here. Different ratings have been read by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao-hsien when compared to this movie. that is one of the admirable flavors of orange snacks that have come to our feet in recent years. Unfortunately, this is not very clear. The film does not seem like masters are trying to imitate these masters. There are all the numbers - a beautiful background, an unusual minimalist dialogue, slow-moving cameras, and especially a fair amount of time for women to be invisible. It sounds good, but unfortunately, nothing is par. Dialog is established. Acting is generally not possible to remove the above-mentioned characters; married couples and younger brothers are particularly poor and insulting. Unfortunately, if the mediocre player combines with a classic "Chekhovan" (ie very predictable) area, the results are best tedious and worst. I could not help but look at the Blue Tuna tea scene, for example, on the genre parody (although the "spring" on the river provided a little black humor ...) this film was taken by Mark Li Ping photography based. If the setting is elegant and the swaying camera tries to reflect the mood of the "Shanghai flowers", the movie is not in the same league. In an hour after the fact that an hour's film was about to be destroyed or destroyed, I suddenly recalled that I remembered the last movie that I had the chance to meet and leave in my dinner with my hospice.) Although the latter left a positive meal, I talk about the reviews, but I could not draw my attention. If I want to see something along a line similar to genuine talent, both are shot with the film, for example, "Mood for Love" or "Shanghai Flower" talented Mr. Ping (with old Chris Doyle) and both of them are skillfully enough movies for inspiration. Often Mr Hoberman has guided me and I would probably like to hear him, but do not say that he was not warned. <br /> <br />
