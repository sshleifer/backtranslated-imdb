I've seen this movie for 2 reasons - I love Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor people were forced to make a dumb film. I thought Dracula was indeed a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because everything looked down upon him for the Christians, but there were many camps where this idea was not so great. I really like this movie and I see it as a way to meet the talented Gerard Butler before the legendary Christopher Plummer (5 men and I see this movie) to give the public a way to remind. I liked the DVD specifications more than the movie itself.
