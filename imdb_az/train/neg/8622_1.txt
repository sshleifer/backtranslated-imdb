After coming to Crouching Tiger's Hidden Dragon, there are many words about the revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe this. People who make films in HK now give a new meaning to the word. Implementing time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name, but most of the film is only a mistake and turns it into a coin. It turns it over and over again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a cop that follows the coin-catching beautiful guy. But again: Who knows? There are quite a few actresses who work for a number of companies and have to pay for women's ransom or something, but it's just like being in a spa or shopping center rather than a camera. It does not matter. No action. No sex. No comedy. There is a whole name: Ekin Cheng. And what do you know? Whose mouth?
