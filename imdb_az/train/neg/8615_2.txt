This movie was extremely bad, outdated and stupid. I saw this Rodney boy, Natural Born Killers, and I thought it was funny as hell, but this movie shook. The "jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing was too far from laughing. Do not waste your time! Only positive things were beautiful women about it :) and Molly Shannon, I'm sure, was the best, but the script was terrible. So I gave the name "2" instead of "1", but this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
