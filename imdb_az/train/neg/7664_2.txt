Spoiler in the future, but is it really important? Have you ever read a movie review of a question? Is that possible? What an ancient civilization has pushed the artifacts all over the world? Why was this question not answered? Why did the opening text go unmatched? Why did one nun (she seemed sure!) Gives 20 orphans a madman? Do you always have gold mining in Vancouver? Why do some of the gold mine go to the orphanage's front yard? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear in the apartment for Christian Slater's sex? (Or did I just answer my question?) Why did not an archaeologist open a golden box even with a sledgehammer? Why modern computers will still show grid images in the Tron era of green objects still completed by small "bleeps"? And should the whole movie be the explosive timers digital screens? Why does not THERE make any sense in this movie?
