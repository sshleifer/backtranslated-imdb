Recently, the GEORGE 2 part of the TV was captured, but I could not watch it until the end. Just horrible! I can not even remember the area. I know George and Ursula did not have George and Ursula in the first movie, it was bad enough. There are many things around, but the direction and adjustment were very flawless and trivial. Ape, the original voice of Ape, was not enough to heat me up. GEORGE 2 is probably the last result I've ever seen and says something. Jeez, IMDb's 10 lines, I have to keep writing when there's nothing else to say about the continuation of this crapulastic-in-TV. Disney, shame your head off.
