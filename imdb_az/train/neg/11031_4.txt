It is interesting to see what the director is trying to do with this movie. But the problem is not very good. <br /> <br /> There was really nothing original in the film, and when the plot was well presented, the main character was a little calm and you did not bother with any of these. <br /> <br /> Instead, the moderate (sometimes obviously bad) photos leave a little bit, but you do not expect much from people who shoot a similar budget. It's unfair to review the movie and compare it with other high budget films. But, unfortunately, it needs to be done. He is not very good either. And it is still not very good compared to others. But that's not the best dots! I liked the plot. It is very well built and is well integrated in the end. Sometimes it was a creepy feeling in real dark scenes. <br /> <br /> But in the end, the film remains ineffective. Heroes are incredibly non-existent, and we do not care about any of them. Each of them can die, but it is possible to watch the last "savior" very early.
