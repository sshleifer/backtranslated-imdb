Not surprisingly, not all of them looked like this movie - it was a trick. Unlike them, I was optimistic and this was a mistake. After seeing how close the camera is to the face, we knew we were in the hands of a very amateur film - it's always a clear sign that they are a consistent and effective camera, about two inches away from the actors. Each of the actors in the film had only one face testimony. <br /> <br /> If the nearby camera is not enough, the lack of light in the movie killed him. The film was completely dark. Now we know that the cinematographer is also amateur amateur. "Ooh ooh, we will illuminate with support light! That's all that looks intim!" No, it has made all this invisible. <br /> <br /> There was no story beyond the thinnest point of a thought that did not develop at the beginning of serious technical shortcomings, and there was nothing new about such relationships. <br /> <br /> This film does not show the quality of the fact that several film festivals have won. (This is a new movie for Germany, but do not forget about Los Angeles. I can assure you that this film can not win anything at the festival I have seen. In fact, the film was finally duplicated two times, and the people went out to leave (this was one of the side effects of the "general dark" method of the cinematography). But when the movie was shaken, there were breaths from the audience. And when the movie finally ended up DID, it turned out that it was really not important whether it was finished in either of the previous two points. Earlier end viewers would save more monotone scenes from marriage (folding sheets, vegetable cuts, honey in bread). <br /> <br /> In some cases, she loves her very much. <br /> <br /> Behold, those who are complicated are filmmakers.
