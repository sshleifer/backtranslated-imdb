Some wonder why there is no more Murphy films after this movie. Because this film is completely bone exploded. Disney was not the right studio to shoot this movie. MAYB Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but it will be even bigger). Film is a lot of children's work, not a book series. Casting is incorrect for all characters. Heroes do not do what they do in books. Why did Tucker become a boy? She's a girl in cold books! Was it done to appeal to the movie guys? Sheesh. Where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest symbols from the book is that it's too dirty. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but she did not allow Disney to offend her work. Perhaps, an animated film from Don Blut's artworks will fit the Murphy movie. In general, I would give it a 2 because at least Disney drew a film from a very valuable book series. But I wish them good deeds. In either case, I have to entertain my books.
