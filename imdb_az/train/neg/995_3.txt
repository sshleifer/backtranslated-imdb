Rosario Dawson is staring at history as a girl who raped history, and then begins a dignified manner as given a chance to revenge. Dawson's role is to show his suits and give a small independent, resolute Hollywood film, although Dawson appears to be out of the way. Forgive me, I just could not find it. Not wrong, I did not know how it felt, where it was. Yes, I know that he is on the screen, though he spent more than two hours looking at me, he did not give me any impression. I blame the screenplay since I ended up, many heck on the screen did not seem to be real. People seemed to be more than real, and the events did not coincide. It is uncertain in this film, but nothing in this movie (I would like to talk about it, but it would not be able to do so) has remained with me like Rosario Dawson as something else. What can I say, maybe this may be with you, maybe for me I will not be able to go back. Only for Rosario Dawson fans, there are several real reasons why this is why NC17 is notified. (And Rosario- please, a better actress, choose a better script)
