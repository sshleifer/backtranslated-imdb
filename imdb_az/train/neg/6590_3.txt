The reviews I read for this film were pretty decent, and I decided to control it. Psychic Thoughts! This is another movie about a ghost to get revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, part of the prom Night mix with the Rings, It was a spell I know what's going on in the last Summer and add a little white stick - now mix up completely ridiculous. There was nothing new in this area, and so much of the favorite clich√©s did not enjoy it again this time. This movie passes through the past and once I felt it was still not very meaningful. The characters move from seconds to psychoseconds when the eye blinks. Speaking of the heroes, they are your stereotypical favorites - an ignorant egoist lawyer, an egocentric actress, an incidental baseball star, a video curler, a bitter girl, a strange quiet chick, a "beautiful nicer" beautiful girl, a strange black cat ... and caring for one of them did not. Perhaps a better writer could do a movie job, but there was a bit of a decent scene, but in general this film was a mess. I should mention a certain 'video tape' that I can not shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie offers the worst Asian horror, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy pictures in the dark, or just laugh out loud in one of the top-level players, or just say 'don'! If you want to have a movie on screen or other Asian horror, ask someone what you see when asked, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Looking for a good plot looking elsewhere.
