I'm not sure who is Sue Kramer, director of this film, but I'm sure that A is a lesbian and that B is bringing together to prove that everyone involved in this project is not homophobic. <br /> <br /> Everyone thinks: "God, it's not horrific, it's not funny, it's on foot! It's completely naked." But in order to scare their mouths, they are labeled as anti-gay or they do not "buy" gay life. (Kramer did not invite gay men to play gay guys too). Anyway, it is not even worth considering. Actors are directed at playing all the scenes from top to bottom, so there is no sincerity and conviction in something. <br /> <br /> It's a very unpleasant movie for me. <br /> <br /> I hate it and I do not want to say that. It does not mean that the rough person who gave money to Kramer to make a bomb is very bad.
