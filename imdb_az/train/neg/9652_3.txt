The film was written 10 years ago and had a different director with SRK and Aamir in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The film is finally filmed by Vipul Shah and the film starring Ajay and Salman ten years later, DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999). The film features more than 90 quizzes and worst points because of a short time falls. The film tries to gather a large number of commercial items, and we also have gaps like how to escape from the airport of London and that it has no place for itself? even though it is not convincing to start his band. The second half is better with the twist of the Ajay story, which destroys Salman, but unfortunately, the summit falls short and the movie ends with a bad note. <br /> <br /> Vipulun's management Shah is a common thing on the average Music is the worst spot, most songs are shared <br /> <br /> It's not as convincing as the dance singer, though Ajay gives the best shot, Talking with the punjabi and talking nonsense is just a great thing when he just gets the drug and Asin's just a show piece of Ranvijay MTV Om Puri should stay
