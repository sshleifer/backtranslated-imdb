I do not know why you're doing it myself! I claimed that I had protected my Dutch and Belgian films and had more credit and luck ... and then put it around your head with such garbage! Intensive care is a terrible product and, perhaps, the worst thing in the Dutch. This is the Dutch attempt to create our franchise franchise based on the main slide classics of the United States, like the 13th and Friday Halloween. Manufacturers and writers preferred this to the truth, but they really fell. Intensive Care was a shameless thing to anyone involved, and therefore a real church shook. It is almost impossible to hunt the original backup and only in special cases like "Night of the Night". For exactly 5 minutes, intensive care attempts to explain a story and even create a plotline ... then it becomes a bare and low bearded bearded film with terrible - yet very cheerful and inexpensive. All shooting moves, though a few respected titles, are disgusting. The role of a trusted person is played by Koen Wauters ... This man can also be Belgium's most famous and beloved artist. She is a beloved singer, television show and many young girls' idols. She has never said anything that has played a role in anything. As in the Netherlands, trying to convince itself, intensive care has never taken place.
