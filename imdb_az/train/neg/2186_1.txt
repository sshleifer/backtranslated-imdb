... but first of all, it will surprise us if there is any! This movie looks like one of today's terrible horrors. A man goes around semi-dressed women, deciding to kill, giving his daughter a new corpse. One scene involves a squirrel and a swinging person over the whole set of three minutes to cover everything that needs to be best on ten gallons of blood. The film also tries to understand what a person is doing to her daughter and what is wrong with nature, but it's not possible to create a sense of shock or violence for the viewer. Perfectly dark and unimpressually filthy, this movie can not even get straight to its name - start up loans say "Brain of the Dead", but the last credit shows it as "Head to die".
