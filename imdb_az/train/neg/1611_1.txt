I think this is a horrible production and directorship movie. Benicio Del Toro should not work on film production, he should give his player an emphasis, and that is what it is. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the revolution, about all the ideals and the most important subject of Che Guevara's life. The camera is horrible, it's shooting like someone with two days of work experience, music ... I do not know ... Is there a music in the movie? I do not recommend this piece to anyone. Only about 4 hours in front of the television or no matter what .... The man does not understand how this movie can score more than 3 stars. Disaster .... disaster .... disaster .... do not follow disaster. Get rid of this suffering of "film".
