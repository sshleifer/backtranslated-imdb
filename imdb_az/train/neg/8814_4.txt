This movie is not interesting for the first ten minutes. Driving and straightening is a perfect introduction to a better ensemble piece than Gosford Park. When it ends with the love affair between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve), it slows down, keeps it in focus, and is just like a traditional French movie. <br /> <br /> LIFE OF EVENTS: The relationship between Anna and Cécile is a major event. Despite being reconstructed and built in Morocco, he had been loyal to him after many years ago. As a builder, he is now rebuilding himself and taking off the Cécile marriage mask. By doing so, he is buried in the ground and in a coma after a strange accident (in its full sense). It burns the old picture as if they were reconciled with the past and united their lives together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many stories here because the director wants to see us is still unclear: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, radio frequently There are old Iraqi Regimes of overthrow of the regime. Cécile's child is bisexual and bites with dogs when she meets her boyfriend, she looks like a living girl (?). Her sister is a traditional Islam and comes into contact with Cécile's husband. Although the whole building has a strange colonial vision that glorifies the past, Morocco is unnecessarily reversed. Islam, on the contrary, generally describes Islam as extremist and irrevocable, which is sometimes not true. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are very good. Because they are familiar with this material, they are able to add something to each scene: they raise their eyebrows, their body language, their pride, and they are unhappy. The film itself also creates disappointment today, confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world. Certainly, with some remarkable exceptions.
