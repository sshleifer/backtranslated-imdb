When it comes to rubbish, remember how all the newspapers Barbra Streisand had been filming for years. Well, it did not take many years; only opened in 1975, eight years ago. In this great movie, he shot a Broadway star, Troy Feldshuh, likely to be filmed, but NOOOOO ... GREAT STAR BARBRA EVER. DO NOT KNOW! This film is a general disaster from beginning to end. In short, when Barbra prepared her FORTY YEAR, she looked every minute. Everyone could not sip him like a young girl who wanted to learn Tora. And then she gets campy when she dresses like a boy. Because Streisand played with makeup, I could not be attractive. She is better than she is. And, as it is not bad enough, she also does not always see the director of her poor schoolgirl Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, his best-time shot at his bare back end) and his fianc√©e (whose routine sleepwalker routine, Amy Irving, and if he does not know what he is doing). Yentl goes so far as to marry her; <br /> <br /> That's why there's music. In general, all of the unforgettable songs have been sounded (probably as a look inside the mind), and each one sounds like nails on a writing board and sounds like an irritant. <br /> <br /> I do not say that Streisand will not act as the director here; Some of the visuals are beautiful (especially on the back of Patinkin) and have a good look for balance. The problem with this film is that it does not go its way. I do not believe him as a starter for a moment; He had never added songs, and all the confusion continued between two and fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Sad, horrible, terrible.
