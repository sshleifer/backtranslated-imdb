I can begin by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented player, and I respect his work. I want him to be in a movie that shows his talent. That said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad film. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I say that almost all of my sins are poorly scrutinized. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley's perfect performance in American beauty, Melissa Sagemiller has done a good job, and Eliza Dushku is currently a girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors are scripts and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the genre of horror is a high level. These folds were and you turned your expectations, but they did not just bring it together ... except for more confusion. <br /> <br /> I do not want to be able to give this movie. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie. a good review, but I can not. In all honesty, the only thing you can think of about this movie is that you paid for it.
