"The Crush" is a friendly 40-romantic chick flicker friendly enough, for the first three or two, as it tries to become a Brit "Sex and City". <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the turn of the young hunk in the cup, much fleshed out of character (imagine that we all have to see more than all her flesh or Kenny Doughty). <br /> <br /> I am sure they are more likely than the Sabrina version or Douglas / Zeta to be too young men / -Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. Now, when Andie MacDowell becomes an environment, Brit is famed for trams and comedies, such as Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The curves toward the latter direction are very crazy driven cars. But at the end of the loans, I did not really understand that it could be wrong. As with the writer / director's "Sex and the City", it was probably the first timer to be here for Scot John McKay, and he really wanted to make a scrapbook about three gay men, probably about those of their beloved and a better and more exciting movie would be the case (the symbol is a school principal, a police officer and a doctor). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The title of the movie was "Hot F * Cker Club", which, in parallel with the gay homosexual "Broken Hearts Club"
