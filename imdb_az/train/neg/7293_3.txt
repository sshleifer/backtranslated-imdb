Aaron Spelling has prepared for a dramatic television movie for this seventy-three-minute film. <br /> <br /> Voice Clint Walker begins to spend time to kill one of the great American refugees, Marshall Dave Harmon, a native of Yuma, Arizona. <br /> <br /> Walker leads his other brother to prison. Walker also meets a "beloved" homeless Mexican boy who lies in prison. One night, Andr√®s delayed the death of a man and the other brother of the Army in the street when he went to the street and killed, killing him. The first twenty-four hours in your business is not good. Walker visits the local Army castle and lists the commander's chains. His brother heard about the death of his brothers and, as time went by, to retrieve his chains, he returned to the city. The local indigenous population, shortly changing in the commodity by the army, is also ranked in chains. All these chains are ranked, Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The son of the Army involved in the murder was a buyer who was a cattle buyer that killed a cattle buyer, implicated by domestic breeders, indians were very hesitant and brought a difficult showdown that must prove to the failed Walker city. <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> The Caucasian series has been purchased. Instead, the movie ends, and I was waiting for scenes from the next episode next week. <br /> <br /> <strong> Due to the decline due to illegal commercial breaks, pacing is bound to all this and the story is adapted. Walker is beautiful, solid and has a deeper sound than a well. The rest of the rash is full of television actors you see in other television movies. Most of the action is quite bare and violence is unattractive. The first brother killed, takes a shotgun shot midtorso and falls without any trouble. I did not wait for "Reservoir Dogs", but this is a wrong movie to use to teach children about the weapon! When talking about children, a Mexican child goes from "sweet" to "aneurysm anxiety" very often. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the West you will not love Yuma. If you love western space, you still do not love Yuma. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
