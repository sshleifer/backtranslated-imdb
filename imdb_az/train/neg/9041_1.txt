Despite the speed of the film, I liked it very much. I did not appreciate ANAS, the description of Canada sent to the Montana north. Undoubtedly Montana Montana will never be. Why Americans are proud of the rest of the world, and that is why. Stop thinking about having children in the United States of America. Such a central worldview is not one of the greatest nations of the world. Life is so. I will never appeal to the United States as "Alberta South". Walt will never miss us, so why start? In addition, the film has gained much better success.
