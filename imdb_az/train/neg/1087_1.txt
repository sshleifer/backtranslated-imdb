This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite good actors, the movie is not up to expectations. One of the most dramatic things about this film is the music covering a lot of movies: compensation for a bad and confused story with popular and good players, loud and dramatic music. In fact, this is a very boring film to watch. She earned 1 point.
