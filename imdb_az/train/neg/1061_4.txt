In the description of a magical Milanese sub-box, this movie was probably evident on his day. Nevertheless, neorealism did not really handle De Sica's bag because he decided to try and to centralize a number of modern trees around a boy who was found in an old cabbage patch in the country. After spending most of his childhood in a children's home, Toto lives with a blackmail in Milan. Residents encourage public activity and scream at their faces with a continual smile and keep their spirits and test them on their time tables. Nobody tells him that his time tables are not mine, because these people have something more important to think of as Potter Noodle's future. In any case, De Sica then uses a delicate dramatic device to draw attention to the fact that these weaker fogs are rare. Of course, everything is down to capitalism, and the foolish people are trying to find a sample of oil in their soil. Brilliant! Although this time he refused to take a serious film, and the capitalists seem to have heavy cartoons, all fur coats and cigars. They want the land, but our mathematical hero will not support such a nonsense. With a stunning chance of luck, his old, dying old man, from the patch of days, appears in heaven and gives him a magic pigeon. She uses cigars to present gifts to her husband, who is as strange as men. I think this movie is a missed opportunity. To solve the problem of poverty, many filmmakers have not done anything so far, and then they seem to me a little like a fairy tale. Why do 'big' directors look like children, but what we see here? Hans Kristian Anderson probably thought that the poor people were flying over Milano Duomo and thinking of having a higher position on a broomstick. However, De Sika is declared to be a genius. <br /> <br /> These people are very poor, their faith is inviolable, and miracles will never happen to them. <br /> <br />
