There were great hopes for Troy and I was very disappointed with it. The film was headed for the worst direction, and my stomach was painful. <br /> <br /> Apart from a beautiful battlefield between the Prophet (saas) and Hajj (pbuh), the pacing was very slow, the dialogue was laughable, and the film was very good. <br /> <br /> Why oh why Hollywood always needs to rewrite the stories of 'consumer satisfaction'. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted for 10 years and was killed by Axilles Paris with an arrow on the toes of Troy! <br /> <br /> It hurts me because this classic story has turned into a soap. <br /> And do not start with 'lack of' between chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was a woman fighting for war, and neither of them looked at each other very much. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole, is not enough to defend films, but this is not enough to defame this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can I tell anyone where the 200 million budget is going? Perhaps they used for funeral pyres in all the trees - where did they get these trees? <br /> <br /> I am very sorry.
