Becky Harris is in error to be in the in-store store and to provide the only reason for remote control of one purpose to be in this movie. Miss Harris appears to be my fifth or older when it comes to the stage for the first time. The red-haired thief understands that this is not the queen of AARP. If this is not the best asset ever mentioned in celluloid, then someone can come in. In my opinion it was breathtaking and I would wear a complete copy of my VHS with her charm. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is not worth mentioning. I hope to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I'm disappointed at both ends. God Blake Becky Harris!
