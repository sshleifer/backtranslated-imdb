The Sunshine Boys, the only solemn moment of the acclaimed comedy director Neil Simon, has no drop in the sun. Simon, who adapts the script from the game (goes uncredited), ages his old age with ridiculous behavior - and brings it even worse, calm, smiling, consistent inspirational irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is unlucky when he played an old andudeville player for a television interview with an old comedian partner, George Burns (43 years in which they responded to the team?) The Oscillary supporting Burns survives the dissatisfaction of the movie about thirty minutes, after which The film's noisy, less tolerable and watched movie director, Matthau, is now just a matter of being tolerated and watched.John Herbert Ross has worked hard only after joining one of Neil Simon's scenarios, where Ross fights in a war plane (for example, a television maker like Matthau, the ghosts of a floating amateur appearing in the garage of a chosen car for the trade) At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he compensated by suddenly flattering and hollering, Ross and Simon, "The Sunshine Boys "was meant to lower the character to renew his character to give some circumcision, yet Walter continues to project as we all are profitable. The picture looks horrible and creeps at a soulless pace; one of them loses early hope. * From 1/2
