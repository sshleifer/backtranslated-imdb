So last night I decided to follow Tales from Hollywood hills: Natika Jackson. Or in the Netherlands called Force, Attitude, Crime. When I took the film, I felt Michelle Pfeiffer played a leading role and I had to say something about quality. Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot is really mixed. There are two stories that run simultaneously in the film. They just do not have anything in common. Throughout the film, these two story lines come together. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < He said the movie covered two different stories and was the shortest part of Natica Jackson. <br /> <br /> One title for this movie could not be a mistake. <br /> <br /> I advise you to shut down my story and to see nobody on the shelf of the store. By doing so, you will not miss a 90 minute time like me.
