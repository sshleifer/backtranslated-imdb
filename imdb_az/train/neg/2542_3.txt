Not every Disney movie is trash. <br /> <br /> Well, for the first time, I saw the legend of Boggy Creek and I really liked the movie. When I heard I had 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. Finally I found a copy of it and watched one night. I do not see how a fear movie can continue G-rating. A movie / documentary about the original Fauke Monster and anyone can scare you. "Rotate" is for children and should not be watched by anyone. I do not remember a very good thing, it's been a while since I looked at it, and I will not ever see it again ... There are those hunters who come to this city and those who want to kill Bigfoot. Get out of the house to stop three little kids. A great monsoon comes. Hunters are harmed by the children. Then all are hiding in a boat with a big piece of tarp and trying to keep the storm in place. Then all of a sudden, Bigfoot comes up and makes something really sick. I do not want to destroy any lifetime, but it is not scary. Well ...
