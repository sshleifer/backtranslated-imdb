That should be one of the worst films I've ever seen! There were people leaving the theater, others were asleep (well, it was a late night show) ... This is not a movie, it's a man who does not want to see you again. I would like to watch out for this film because I'm interested in the minds of the authors of such trash. Do they laugh when creating all these ridiculous things, or do they think they are doing something really exciting? I wonder ... The soundtrack scares the previous Bjork album apart from some instrumental materials that remind you. Whether you're an admirer of Bjork music, stay home. That's the best thing to do. Small, small, beautiful music tracks do you have to go out and present yourself with torture. God!
