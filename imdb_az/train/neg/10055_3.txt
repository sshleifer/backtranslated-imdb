I grew up in the "Superman II" theater version ("S2T") and like a child, more than just Superman and three Superman-type darkness, I liked it more than the explosion. ? Clark Kent, the best in superman conversion and rescue scenes. The children were no longer forced to wait for Superman to appear on the screen just as partly. Now, as an adult, I can see how the power of the S2T falls (see: my view), explains how the original director, Richard Donner, was dismissed from time to time and how it was unfounded. (It was also rare to shoot two films simultaneously, and now it's common: "Back to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 and 3). Unfortunately, Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD"), I still do not recommend doing exactly that. In the opening of S2T, as I had a beautiful definition of the part, the great Superman was a scene of change, all Paris was a rescue. In fact, all of them wrote: "Previously Superman?" At S2RD. Specific impacts are not great in I or S2T, but S2RD, they basically laughed? Like Lois, who falls from the daily Planet window. I will admit that some new scenes have been used and some have come out, for example, in any "honeymoon suite". In general, if I grew up as I grew up in S2T and loved it as a child? You should see the S2RD not as nitpicking as minors, because it has almost a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes at the end: a strange amnesia kissing from S2T is also 'I.' It's not just a lazy, unusual copout, it does not mean that Clark will be returning to this night unless these events really happen. And will it continue to "repay its time" for each confrontation?
