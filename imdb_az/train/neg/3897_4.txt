Honored comedy agent Tony Randall examines the family of eccentric family in Maryland, which never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of a tomboy farmer who squeezes an unwelcome tax man. During this period, Debbie made a share of low-level theater cites - and that is not better or worse than the rest. The picture begins with brightness, but in the unfinished place the flags are fugitive and foolish. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the car itself defeats the chemistry. H.E. based on the novel "Ming Darling Buds". Bates causes all actors with a silent blend to sound like a noise camera. ** from ****
