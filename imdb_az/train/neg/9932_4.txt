Dan Duryea, a well-regarded B-film actor in the 1940s, Dan Duryea, can not do much with this: the young man is charged with killing an unpleasant married singer; When sentenced to death, her husband decides to solve the problem with her husband's death. After a gorgeous opening shot, Flick is quickly placed in B-film form. This certainly looks good, but the twist ends colorless exhaust and cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a bit tougher. Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel, it goes for a single review. <br /> <br /> From ****
