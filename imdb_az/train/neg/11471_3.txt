What is the coincidence that Orcan was founded two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly off "Jaws off", but Jaws is obviously trying to succeed. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> First Orca was in my opinion a bad movie, terrible, but not necessarily good , the best average <br /> <br /> <br /> Arsane wants a vengeful whale (orca) revenge killed by a fisherman. He was not invited to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> The film's direction is weak and compared to Jaws, director, producer, and writer seem almost unlucky. <br /> <br /> As for the player, it was very moderate and convincing, not least likable. It was a victim, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music sounded very sounds, and it sounded very sounds, drowning sound effects, and sometimes irritated. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is bad and poor in my opinion. Because of the above mentioned reasons. <br /> <br /> Some people are more likely to appreciate this film than the concept of vengeance among animals and humans, so that I will not be overwhelmed by this movie, and some people will understand why they can love it. <br /> <br /> 10 (but for her concept 5/10)
