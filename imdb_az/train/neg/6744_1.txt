As you know, JIGSAW did not allow Blackbuster to be a member of Full Moon's staff as Devin Hamilton. Devin sells all video chains. He has released a BLEED movie that he sold to Blackbuster with JIGSAW a while ago. He turned the Blackbuster receiver into two sets of JIGSAW and BLEED. As a result, JIGSAW resembles a flop and BLEED looks like a hit. The biggest problem with this is that BLEED is one of the worst films and as we all know, JIGSAW is good, gold. I ask everyone to go to the BLEED website on the web and play the film and all the skills that hurt JIGSAW. Likewise, you must log in to the JIGSAW website and you must earn a lot of votes for it (if any). We'll get JIGSAW at least 8 or 8.5 and have around 2 BLEED (thus putting the worst movie list of 100 on the internet). <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
