<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who will decide which category to enter into a movie, but this movie is not a scary movie. As for the story, it was pretty interesting, but it was too slow. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> the first detective or is the police? She knows exactly what's going on at this point, and there's a video tape as evidence. Instead, he runs there and returns to the nuts, and "I know everything, I have proof, you did not expect proof?" Then she is surprised when she is stopped and goes to hurt her. Good DUH! Of course, you will be foolish, but you have proven that you know everything and disclose everything. What is silent?
