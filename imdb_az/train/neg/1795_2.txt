As a test audience member I gained the ability to look at the pre-emptiness and something that I kept in my way was a chance to fill out a post-screening survey. The film's biggest problem was that I did not have a master plan. Instead, it consisted of many subfields that competed for the screen. As a result, there is not enough single character to create an extra form for the audience. The director and the manufacturer did not know what we could do to care for the symbols. In fact, any sub-plot and its associated characters could have been completely deleted without serious damage to the movie. (The remaining plot would allow the development of sub-fields and characters much more). Simply, the Hungre Bachelors Club plate is packed with side dishes and desires when an entree is desired.
