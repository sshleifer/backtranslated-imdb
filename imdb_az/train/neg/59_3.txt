The protocol is just an awesome movie, along with a good gem of players supporting the Goldie Hawn stars. The story takes place around a waitress, a tiger cocktail, after an unusual breakdown in the lives of the Arab Army. The story disappears as much as half of the movie, and Goldie's charm does not just keep this movie. Do not go out to see this movie unless you're a Goldie Hawn fan.
