<br /> <br /> Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what is different from strange aliens that are different from other films? </ Strong> </ strong> The worst movie on IMDb - everyone really watched it. The conspiracy is far from, and in a few (too many) cases, it does not mean anything in its entirety. Here's why the real miracle was the next one in this world that was created for such a failed and horrendous (but still better) movie. <br /> <br /> I love to watch the horrible movie for the best movie, I would highly recommend this movie to laugh.
