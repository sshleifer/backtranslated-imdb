Undoubtedly, this film has an effective form, but, unfortunately, this does not help the film's fall. I do not understand why the presidents did not want actors / actresses to use their conscience for not being able to convince themselves, but for everyone. Fiennes can not just make Ireland and Fitzgerald is not better in Russia. When the voice is wrong, it will not be so convincing to follow the character. Was there a plot for the biggest problem ....? Perhaps there were a number of themes, but I would not wait for the movie to end, so full of holes ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
