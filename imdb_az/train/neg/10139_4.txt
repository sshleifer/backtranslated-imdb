You have to give it to Steven Seagal: Whatever its other shortcomings, there is a good taste in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, your chances will be one or more beautiful women. And usually, they just do not function as candy candies; "Fury Flight" offers Ciera Payton (a very sexy face with Angelina Jolie's adaptation) and Katie Jones, fighting with it, hitting the guns, killing them with a knife, and so on. a catfight and a little lesbian fondling but also finds time to deal with them! And if it looks like I'll spend a bit more time talking about it, the rest of the film says it is difficult to find something else, though it is useless. Almost the weakest aspect is Seagal himself, probably not worried about trying to care. A military-type actress struggles very little and does not fit into his role (of course, a secret warship pilot, of course, the "world's best"). Attack is appropriate. (* 1/2)
