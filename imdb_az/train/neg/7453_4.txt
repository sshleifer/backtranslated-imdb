Beautiful actors. <br /> <br /> Leyli is a comedy or a very big direction. My main problem was simply not to miss any of these people. Not murder victims. Settings were pretty heavy. Dennis Qaid's character was so poorly written that he did not even care about the end. He took your son back. Great job! I wanted my money back.
