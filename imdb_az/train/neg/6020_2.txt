I love my films lately. I love B-movies. <br /> <br /> I hope that I want this movie. <br /> <br /> I can ignore the pessimistic effects, frequent lying music, and bumpy lines. I have not seen unexplained incidents, and the fact that the film is constantly referring to ex machina. I can be sure that people who are struggling with hunger and trying to achieve world peace are bad guys. None of them kill the movie. It's just a straightforward and simple dull thing that kills this movie. In fact there is nothing; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to direct the morale of the creators of the film to the audience, have a true story or any decline. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the funny B-movie, look elsewhere. This film is just boring.
