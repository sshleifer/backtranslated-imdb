it is thought of how this film is built. I watched when I was working at home-writing and answering the phone - just watching for the "revenge" part. Needless to say, revenge and forced consecutive twists are not worth the email they are watching. Actually, I'm not sure what's happening in the end. the player was as bad as reactive scenarios at the FBI Files show - the worst reaction (indeed, only "Arrest and Trial" can be bad when you really get it again). Although I was appearing on the IMDb, I did not know that the Third Eye of the leading man was in Cindy, but for some reason, he did not film any. Hopefully a good singer.
