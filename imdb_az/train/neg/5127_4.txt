This movie did not have a great star, but before it became a great star, it won a very good victory, with full support from actors and Gen Tierney. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia, and Cederic Hardwicke, you could expect more from the movie than really delivered. <br /> <br /> The film's director, Henri Hathaway, was an authorized and good man. I suspect it's the second part of the second film. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in East Africa during the Second World War, before the Americans entered the war. The Brits are trying to control the colonies of Africa and they are trying to create anxiety among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a dual dealer working to destroy the British empire! American filmmakers have long been in the Empire and seen in the 1930s in the 40s. The abundance of pro-imperial films. Nowadays, with changing sensitivities, Queen's and the country's happy black-earth vision of the dead look ridiculous - and it would be challenging to root for both sides! Still, today, this propaganda part was instrumental in supporting the English-speaking people - though today, the film suffers from a fierce and fierce cast. A brilliant moment in the film is the latest meeting between George Sanders and the enemy agent. After such a strong scene, very bad movies just seemed to speak and talk - lose some of his fist.
