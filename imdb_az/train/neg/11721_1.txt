This movie was terrible. The script is actually written to be real to the real world, but the editing and lighting effects are worse than the first ones in the movie school. <br /> <br /> I know this movie for everyone A) about the police or secret operations. B) knows any details about filming or rating. <br /> <br /> I come to the middle or low level minds of this movie. If you really need to watch this movie well, it's a total loss of production value.
