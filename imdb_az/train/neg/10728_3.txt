The worst movie I have ever seen. Interestingly, the first half night is a consistent dialogue between suspicious characters at the bar. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> show it and show kindness to me prevent me from disrespecting me. It is still very valuable (as the director described in his presentation) and I'm really scared of the time I got out of the second half of this year. <br /> <br /> Maintaining three main characters in the first half, the film is especially a woman's bay.
