There are some bad movies there. Most of them are very entertaining. "Insane Insane 1" was one of those flips. It is not so bad that it was pleasant and reassessed it. "Murderer Insane 2" should be one of the worst films and one of the worst films ever to come from me, I'm saying a lot, because I am not the kind of person who says that something is worse. But trust me, it's absolutely terrible and it's only 1 hour longer than an hour. <br /> <br /> There is a very flawless story in the film, but when you want to see it, the story is in vain. She is a woman who is trying to kill a woman who is not fed. Yes, in this movie, you do not see it, except for the first flashback followers. <br /> <br /> The Ethelin half was sent home and the murder of everyone there was really laughable, but nothing would happen until the last 20 minutes of the movie, and you have already slept. <br /> <br /> In this film, camera work is very strange. This is a reminder of what I came back with when I was 15 years old. The sound quality is something else you do not understand a word of the majority of characters. Enter the New York Metro to give you an example of how bad it is and try to figure out what the speakers are talking about, so it's what's been called. <br /> <br /> Now I know that this is the worst movie there is, it's pretty tough, but there can be words. I describe how bad this film is. If you do not believe me, look for yourself. 1/10
