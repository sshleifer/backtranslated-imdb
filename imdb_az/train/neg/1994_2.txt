This film, which was released in 1940 before Christmas, was thought long. A very weak image has been resold and turned into a CD. Do not buy! The film is unspeakably terrible. <br /> <br /> Roland Young is reading and dancing in the song. And this also draws attention. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie was deliberately killed.
