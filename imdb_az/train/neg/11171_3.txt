A very often a movie - very long sequences with no dialog, bad flashbacks and pretty completely men's casting. <br /> <br /> Two women are seen as 10 lines and only available to men as romantic profits. <br /> <br /> OToole is whipped every time you talk; Unfortunately, it often takes time to shrubs. Alastair Sims is always happy to see, but he also uses it. <br /> <br /> There is one more positive aspect in the film that many people today are not aware of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the occasional Mossi graffiti view). Most of today's films paint the Allies all the goodness and the Axis as bad as it is, and when it is based on history, people are even more complicated! <br /> <br /> Then why would it be a good movie? you get rid of the flu and are put on the throne and can not swallow a very complicated thing. If you just need time to stabilize electrolytes, this is a movie for you.
