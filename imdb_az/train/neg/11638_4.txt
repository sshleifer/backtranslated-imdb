"The Hero Blood, The Blood of the Blood" is a series of adventure games about Gabriel Knight's third installment, a roguish writer / paranormal detective Gabriel Knight. Jabriel and his wife, Grace, were asked by the Prince of Albany to explore a number of mysterious attacks called "night visitors." When the son of Prince James was abducted, Gabriel watched night visitors with Rennes le Chateau, where he began to place a mystery to the Holy King. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game is not vampires. Vampires has a token look in the game, but it's never in the middle of the stage, like the voodoo horn in the "Father's Quarrel" or the "Beast Within". Gabriel and Grace do not try to uncover the true nature of the vampires, or to research vampires. <br /> <br /> Vampires are casual in the game, despite the killing of three people, and have nothing to do with the key field. <br /> <br /> The majority of the first two Gabriel Knight's attraction were the installments in the relationships of Cebrail's cunning. Thanks to these relationships, the player could not help, but he was sincerely deceived, and that is why his soul turned into more and more human beings. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gabriel and Garib are the only controversial argument in the blood of Cain in "The Hell in Hell", the mutual inactivity with the Jew. It's pretty useless in this mystery. Gabriel spent the rest of his time in the hotel as a treasure hunter, but he had more than a red beard. Grace explores the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, but all of her research has been carried out with the presence of a striking ally for centuries. <br /> <br /> These striking actions are allied and against the pole - the leader of the vampire --- will not be disabled. The resistance gives tips on a wide daylight saving time for the Rennes le Chateau, and they are waiting for Grace (not the other group of treasure hunters). However, instead of risking an additional 48 hours of kidnapping, the kidnapper could have been secretly gracious on the 1st day. <br /> <br /> Vampire leader does not achieve planning goals for centuries, because he decides to avoid moving two days later. kidnapping The only reason for his decision to delay the move is to make his victory glad. <br /> <br /> It would have been better if he directed him to the Holy King entirely. Abductions and vampires were to be replaced by a race against the Vatican to unravel the secret of Rennes le Chateau. <br /> <br /> Because Gabriel was once described as unwittingly Catholic, this conflict would create many opportunities for the character development. <br /> <br /> In general, the game is a refined interface and Tim Curry's return as Gabriel Knight's voice.
