Charlotte's fatal beauty and fatal strokes make the movie cooler than anything else. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character is dying of such a foolishness. You are surprised that this is the end of the movie. I wish you could say that someone had an alternative ending, but I'm not scared. When it comes to the rest of the CST, I say good, they just did not move well; Though the guilty one is poorly scrubbed, this movie reminds Rush Hour 2 that Zhang Ziyi is the only person he has stolen in the whole movie and dies unknowingly. I could give this movie 2/5
