Her mother, Dale Midkiff, her mother, Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10 years old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and nearly 3 years old Gage (Miko Hughes), is home to this beautiful home in Maine - every 90 seconds down the road in front of their homes! neighbors (beautiful Fred Gwynne) feels at home ... and shows a home cemetery where their children bury pets. <br /> <br /> PRIVATIZED USERS ** The novel of Stephen King was good - it is a sacred place that allows the dead to be resurrected For a long time, he has developed characters and situations that care for the occurrence of this phenomenon. This film prevents ALL character development and plays only dark and violent. Life kills animals in the camera (I know it is wrong but still obedient), a small boy half hit and opened his funeral (in a totally ill way) funeral, life and attacks v killing people, including his mother (I do not know how I was 3 years old), a jogger who sought to help the family without asking for a reason ... The film works only at the sight of every horrific death or violence. It just goes out of its way to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> Acting is no help. Midkiff's father is very scary - he's a nice and buff, but completely empty. Crosby is not very good. Two kids just frustrating. Only Gwynne keeps these pictures one by one with good gaming. <br /> <br /> This picture shows the respect of the audience, who made big leaps in logic and the characters are quite foolish (especially at the end of Midkiff). This movie (undisclosed) was a big cashier in 1989, which led to even worse results in 1992. I saw it in a theater and I was just scared of what the spectators were watching for, and I was just scared. A patient's frustrating horror movie. A 1 whole way. <br /> <br /> If you think you can not go all over and worse when you read a song song from Ramones !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Indeed, beyond belief.
