I would mark this movie in the horror movie genre. Because I am not aware of a genre called terrible. Since the horror of the genre is terrible, I decided to put it in that category. The player was amateur. You know who your spouse will be on the first stage. Hero is as dirty as film. Filmmakers should take this film as an example of what should be done in the film. This is bad. It is to understand that human speech is bad. His friends kidnapped the ocean liner and asked for $ 10 million. They want money to be delivered on a Gul island in the middle of the transit. After receiving the money, the ducks were sitting. There is no plan of escape. How are they being silenced? Women's Cruise Manager is an old cop, seal seal, kung fu I'm scared. Strangely causing bombs when the part. He knows what he is doing and takes all the wires one by one. He puts everything in his pocket and movie, which he has in place. Is that crazy? The RIDICULOUS follow us as crazy. If you like M-i-L. Rent this movie and claim to love it. I am sure that your spouse will get such a bad taste and that your son / family is marrying a family below the family standard.
