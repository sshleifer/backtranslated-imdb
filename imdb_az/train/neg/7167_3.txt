For this, I saw a trader in another video and decided to rent it when leaving. Boy, I'm disappointed! This story is extremely boring, and the player is worse than Christopher Walken, and I was less careful about the heroes, despite the fact that Nora wanted to see her husband's confusion. Christopher Walken's role is not such a shot, nor a tease!
