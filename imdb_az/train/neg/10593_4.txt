Frustrated Ed Wood "classic" Plan 9 calls out human race from the outer space, "... stupid! Stupid, stupid fool!" <br /> <br /> Let's talk about some films that A movie in this movie will be a ridiculously foolish fantasy film. <br /> <br /> The falling star Jean Claude Van Damme is back to her role as a hit actor from the original film. Now, Luke is the former Universal Soldier, who is preparing really good universal soldiers. Although Van Damme was too big to reflect the role of the first two segments, it was too small to do more than before the fourth film in the Universal Soldier series. Perhaps he is cursed by all the way in his breath, laughs at the beating and thunderstorm, and the shooting of karate. You will find a lot of honest violence, but when you start watching, I advise you to check the coat for your brain at the door. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> all other universal forces soldiers into bad, flawless killings. Of course, these are programmed, but in this case they are not "enemies", they kill their creators, so there is a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the horrible logic of this movie. Logic that would create a body that looks like a supercomputer is as shameless as it is in this movie like Michael Jai White. The creator of the line is a logic that tells the old lady that the steam is a cyber-stereotype of a blue hair with a more regular clich√©. <br /> <br /> The logic of climatic karate fights with the two symbols that hit each other in three minutes of the three-minute screen. <br /> <br /> The film also has a character, a wrestler, Bill Goldberg, as a wrestler hiding as a Universal soldier and romanticized, and it was a really good thing I thought the writers were like romantics. And this movie ends when it's over. In the giant strong final round, the credit is a minute after the explosion. No epilogue, no place now, last kiss, just blast, hug. Even creators want to do this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although the United States does not have 9 plans, it's a bit strange that a fun action movie on drunken parties is fun. Van Damme fans, who bring their heroes to the very depths. Serious stomach can not be seen.
