F * @ # was this what I just watched? STEVEN STOP! Please! This film is impatient and illogical. In a strange way of action and adventure, Mr. Seagal now (obviously) desires that the vampire is like "super-human beings". OK? Oh, and they burn their eyes unknowingly? Amazing! Wow! However, in this film, He is even more powerful to cook Seagals-i-son-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a-$ ego. But all the average people start to crush around him. Come on, I can understand the great neighborhood or drug dealer, but these people are super-human beings. Oh and this is because he and his cohorts think he is Wolverine because Seagal passes a short choking on personality issues! Oh My GO ... And worse than that! Yes, it's worse than that. While looking at his face, he sounds a variable voice in the middle sentence. Certainly, something similar to it sounds and can be one of the other actors of the film. It was a mad madness. I do not want to close it, though I'm always watching a movie. It's down to all the time, even for direct video footage from Steven. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Two finger down! Redemeption qualities? Yes, that's why I'm going to be fair in that direction. At least the special effects were good and I love the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. Women were all very attractive IMO. Still, and I say STILL, this obviously can not prepare for the X-Men, Underworld, (put your favorite zombie, vampire here)! The film director must be filmmaker, writer, producer, EVERY movie workman, and deported. In my opinion, most people think about Blood Rayne (and about other Uwe Boll pictures). All in this film is $ 1.00. Look at your courage.
