This movie is horizontal, predictable, ambitious, and empty. It is loyal to the era of setup, but it is manifested in their enlargement by prolonged exposure. Staying on the works stops the movements and gaps as almost empty dialogue. Tom Hanks appears to be going to sleep as Bruce Willis did in Hart's war. Tom, you can not give a depth of character by putting your face blank! The content did not guarantee the sensitivity that Paul Newman did. It is a plate that is wrapped around an atom bomb.
