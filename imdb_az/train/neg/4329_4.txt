I will never forget ORIGINAL Vacation movie and great comedy! The lines, pacing, and timing of the events in the movie are perfect! But this Europe's Vacation continued a great drop. <br /> <br /> This subsequently earns a European strike at a game of Griswalds. The problem is that many jokes in the movie are less than soft, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a flight attendant asks Clark, "Do you want to smell your smell?" Clark answers back: "No, I'm here." <br /> <br /> The humor of the European Vacation is aggravated. Since the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to reconsider a script that had been made earlier, and after the picture had ended, they were based on the sequence of scenes followed by a laugh. /> <br /> Worse, Cousin Quaid, like Cousin Eddie and natural comic standouts and original children playing the first film, Rusty and Audrey, are nowhere to be found. Their price is not funny, it can not move and just looks like the past of the time. <br /> <br /> Griswald had to stay in Wally World. The place where they make legends! Do not join this terrible adventure of Europe. Viewers must review the original Vacation movie here! You'll be glad you did.
