This "documentary" is a testimony used for the purpose of talent. The fact that the Venezuelan government financed is a lack of legitimacy to investigate the real truths of these terrible days in Venezuela in April 2002, even though Venezuelans are unaware of it. /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the director of these goods lied to negligence and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complicated and easily understood by the outside world. For example, CONGRATULATED ADMINISTRATORS * They showed off demonstrators who opened fire on an empty street (why did hell did they do it?), But did not worry about showing what they saw. The opposition demonstrators (and journalist) who died or were injured on the other side of the "empty" ). The politician's helicopter is the only country that flies to Caracas that day, allowing nothing to do with snipers on rooftops of buildings near the presidential palace. Security measures should be taken to protect the president. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military commander in the National Army (Congress) asked why they did not act against snipers and "because they did not move there" <br /> <br /> Chavez resigned and said he was "lied" two days later. , "this is politics" <br /> <br /> Today, the Interior Minister of the Chavez administration. <br /> <br /> The image of Hugo Chavez, a good old man who does not want him in any way for the poor and the poor opposition, will bring me thousands to explain all the lies described in this "documentary", it is true that people 60-70 percent rejects the government and this percentage covers the poor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Nazi propaganda has returned !!
