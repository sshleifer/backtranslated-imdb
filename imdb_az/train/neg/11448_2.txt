This film is not as bad as the "Perfect Stranger" in any way, but it's not just ridiculous. It could not have been a comedy type - jumping from SNL to Adam Sandler-esquire into comic, laughter, slapstick, 'Loser' (movie). Although some pretty laughing slapstick moments (hill down), no one was so laughable and superior in no way. "Schindler's List" was funnier (and felt shorter). Andy Samberg did not know anything about whether Sister Spacek was in high school, leaving college or losing his home with his mother, Sissy Spacek, did not choose his worst role. And the poor Ian McShane bends to read the camera if the serious actor does not want to give a single name. Strikes the story and is entirely up to the end (unless Adam Spammer's mother wants to see it, no spoiler here). You will not spend any money to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will point out and start producing quality movies (Yes, Wayne World and Tommy Boy).
