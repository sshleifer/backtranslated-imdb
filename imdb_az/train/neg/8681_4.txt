A 30-minute cartoon show featuring a 2 15-minute episode featured at Lil Blank Comedy Center. It occurs around fictional, cartoonist D.C. and satirical, childhood representations of George Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Other politicians act in the same way as rows and small symbols. <br /> <br /> The Little Bush pilot proved that the expectation of the commentator was very simple, unusual and esoteric. existing word: a satirical view of the current president administration. The main purpose of the show is to postpone the episode after the end of its term, although it is difficult to imagine a show that is almost completely suspended by a political identity <br /> <br /> <br /> Lil Bush, technically a "satire" Lil Bush, who can be classified as such, does not want to pay attention to himself. a realistic use of a special comedy tool to eliminate their targets with very vulgar (but especially original, entertaining or funny) techniques. The show's consistently poor text often consists of less than just a note of another name, and notes Bush / Cheney jokes placed on a 30-minute television block. Most of the jokes offered by writers were some untrammeled stereotypes over 6 years in public circulation. The Vice President's comparison with Darth Vader is, for example, the first 300 times daily Show / Colbert Report / Letterman / Conan O'Brien / Leno monologue / late night talk show. Not everything is here but laughing here. <br /> <br /> In the protection of pupils, the areas of consciousness appear to exist as a tool to develop the same old, exhausting Bush jokes, where writers turn into a program center. When the writers really dare to write with the original joke (it rarely comes) often becomes a little humorous. If the show expanded its depth and put the symbols in new situations, exotic situations, it would not be the same as the old errors and the quagmiers that were conducted by the Bush administration, so the same old Bush jokes and still can be renewed. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is difficult to identify which Lil Bush has been causing the most damage; its originality and weak text quality, or its lack of narrow-minded passion. It is desirable to expect that the lilac bush can hold a small base of the left wing fans, that is, to survive very poor writing; The program continues to provide a comprehensive lamp for the Bush administration. Nevertheless, most viewers are soon planning to search for what is the truth, in a weak and meaningless fashion, and seek more intellectual stimulus; The price is probably right.
