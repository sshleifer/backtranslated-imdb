<br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And, as it is French, it tries to deepen. Nothing really gives meaning to anything. <br /> <br /> Léo is homosexual and only hates her family that HIV is positive. The youngest brother, Marcel, has not yet started a breakfast, and his family can decide, first of all, that he is too young to be 12 years old. Maybe four or five, twelve? The first is totally incredible - how much does family know if their family does not ask where and how the virus is? nothing is asked. They are worried about finding Marcelin. This is a close-knit family, but Marcelin Leo decides that she does not know the fact that HIV is positive or that her status is gay, but the rest of her family accepts this news with no question or reaction. How many families do you know that at least one of the members of the family / sisters is not gay? There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Léo needs to go to Paris to see her former lover. And all the people decide to go on a trip with Marcel. Do you know anyone who will bring his younger brother to see a lover? Still, it is completely unbelievable, especially when Marcel does not mention his medical problems or homosexuality. <br /> <br /> Léo's lover is going to find Aymeric in his work at the Paris Bar. The proprietor says that Aymeric will not be until the early evening. Why does Léo want to see it on the job? Why do they have to call and somewhere to be more specific in places where they can really speak? Why do not you go home and not see him? However, Léo shows on the next day (along with Marcel), and Aymeric is surprised to do everything to go with him for only 5 minutes. Aymer says he does not exist anymore, Léo, who abandons him, and Léoun does not answer any of his letters. Léo says, "But I love you" and then misses it. But if he likes Aymeric at least, he has not warned him of the status of HIV and warns him not to try and possibly take medication? Is that possible? but take a look. It does not warn or even warn Aymeric of contracting with the AIDS virus. Is this completely irresponsible? and filmmakers; Was this movie a look for a French television series for young people? is a great way to show how children are responsible. Yes, not here? What are the things that I say "Every man for himself" is still the French way? Another feature of the movie, which was incredibly incredible, was "touching". Everyone is always alike, loves some, or kisses someone. Family and family outside. I have never seen this physical person in France, and do not wait for the whole family. A 17-year-old brother who lives in the morning has a dark stomach on his lap in his lap and his brother stands up to sit around to discuss everything. But how many of those who are physically close friends know? On another scene, in the same 17-year-old Marcelin's room, "What, do not you sleep?" When she asked, she took her clothes and went completely naked and went to bed with her brother and almost missed her. They were lovers. This and similar scene between Léo and Marcel made a bit of a shock to the movie. <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, I do not believe that this film is a regular behavior among young people. </ P> <p> Especially in Marcel's main role. But was it really not enough? HIV and AIDS are very serious to be presented in such uncertain and irresponsible light. At the end of the film, the family went to the cemetery to bury Léo, but Marcel was again released. she was left with a cousin care (I think). Nevertheless, he takes the funeral away from him. Is this what a close-knit family can do? It is absolutely impossible that he will not enter his brother's funeral. It was the final scene of the film and it was the last straw for the audience.
