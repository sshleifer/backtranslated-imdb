Alright, I would die to see this movie. In the film on the horror of the film, I thought, "Who is it?" .... well, my friend took it to the hire, brought it and we started watching it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I think to be a comedy. In fact, in fact, there are films that are absolutely not close to anything and they are incredible (I already have). While watching this movie, similarities to a low budget release movie called "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" (ie STEALING) could not help, but I read a review about it (this movie left BTW). <br /> <br /> This movie ... really did it. This was the "star power", the stolen area (which allowed the film to shoot behind the scenes of a movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, it thinks more) was really laughable. Many, many jokes fall flat. What's good about the player. <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <strong> WHAT IS BLACK?
