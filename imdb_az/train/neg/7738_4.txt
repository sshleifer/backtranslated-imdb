The movie was "ok". Well, not good, just OK. If anything else in the theater was so far away. Unfortunately, Fast and Anger 2 stunk, but I see it better than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison ford or other young punk, this will be a "favorite" movie for you. Personally I would like to wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
