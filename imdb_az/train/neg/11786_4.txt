Show big episodes, this is not one of them. Not a terrible episode, it is difficult to follow the "Man of Death," "All at Home," and "Buy this cat, it's real." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a pair of Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first 5 minutes Charles only married Peggy. Both carry their own chicks, and their car breaks through a land and looks for a shelter from an old home. Charles soon finds the secret of Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you have to watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes of the first season.
