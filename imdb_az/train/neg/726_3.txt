I am surprised by the magnificent sum of this commentary made by other commentators. For me, it was a disappointment that would not work with, in particular, the combination of historical facts, fantasy, and the internal confusion of the main character (Vonnegut's book Mezbahali Five and even George Roy Hill's adaptation to the screen). Reliability is often lengthened. Many questions remain open. Did not I miss some central points? Or did I see lines that are related to dots? <br /> <br /> A boy named Campbell is growing up in New York. At home he has many technical trade documents and a book. There are photos of dead body bodies in it. The boy writes his book, his father does not do that. What does it mean? The family runs from New York to Berlin. BANG. It was a married man in Berlin in 1938 and a theater writer. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is that successful? Her husband is an actress and looks glamorous. Parents returned to the United States and invited their son to the same job. It is not. Why? Could Germany grow up in Germany? Because he's successful? Does he have a wife? Because he loves his life there? For the Nazi love? Was he just lazy and did not like to change? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As American agent, there is no evidence of his love for his wife in the movie The Nazis hate propaganda as a speaker to send encrypted messages to American officials reading to American listeners The most important view of a Berlin car park is short, indefinite, and anti-climactic, the decision to play is easily accessible without any explanation, has not risen to the publisher, and appears faster than ever before. <br /> <br /> So, now we have Campbell, Jr. The secret message transmission scheme is quite realistic and exciting - though, Campbell, Jr. really and honestly coughs, hiccups, and so on. Anyway, when the Nazis lost, his wife dies (for the German soldiers in the Crimea, I did not really hear them on the WW II German frontline), Campbell, Jr., goes to the Russian front, but says he will not go, tells a dragged dancer in Auschwitz , is captured by an American soldier who knows his trophy (how come?), then released and moved to New York City with the help of Crucial Agent. /> <br /> AND THIS PROPHET DOES STARTED <br /> BANG. It is then a short story by Paul Auster. In 1961, Campbell, Jr., lives in New York as a living place and loses his wife's loss. Nobody really asks - or are they? Yes, they do something that neighbors offer some kind of entertainment. Auschwitz rescued. Artist. Some American supremaciologists want to "discover" him and want him to be his head, even seeing his dead child as his or her husband? Finally, at the end, Campbell, Jr., calls the Israeli consulate and <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> </ span> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; it's a matter of guilty and missing, but I've been impressed that the main character is always indifferent to everything and can not love everyone, and most of our reviewers , Because he plays his last Free American game, focusing on his condition as a potential war hero, and that's his courage.In fact, th e is a win-win situation, no matter who is winning the campaign, politically safe <br /> <br /> The whole story is a fantasy like a dream, and no one's history can be found in the first part of the story. xi should not be bothered with accuracy or rational development, but the story that tells everything, but even then does not give a point, in the first place, I doubt, because the love affair in the two countries is completely flat. Unfortunately, especially if you think his wife, Sheryl Lee, is playing talented, versatile and sensitive actress. It has very little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. In some cases, there are different types of texts (confession, broadcasting, and secret messages), but it is basically inaccessible. Maybe he should give the book a chance.
