I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about this subject. it is very boring and stupid. everyone's nat and alex said he was a hero in the world of wolff's music and would do a great deal of it. WHAT IS ANY? WHAT IS? nat and alex, ends like hobos, or Jane Hudson's "Baby Jane no matter what?" will end. I could only last about 30 seconds from a 20-minute show and managed the half-hour "Group Battle". How can we support these guys in the Kid's Award Ceremony, there's no clue. Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.), a few days before the film's premiere, appeared in children who were brainwashed by the influx of young actresses, exciting nat and alex wolff. First of all, they did not deceive me, and nat and alex, probably, fabricated them or paid money with money, but I am sure everyone will enjoy this show / movie. music just scares. he dies as a patient reads nat. alex is the worst movie / TV show ever EVER. she is not laughable, she is annoying, she is really weird and she thinks she's hot and knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he does not do anything. you know that this show is fake when you know that some of these characters (in real life) are not even present! Character Jesse really played Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (they should have been a budget problem). Their father was married to Polly Draper, but he does not appear in the show, so Wolff's mother is small. Not Rosalina. His name is Allie DiMeco. We can say that Naked Brothers will be deeply involved in their "admirers" when revealing all things. 0/10
