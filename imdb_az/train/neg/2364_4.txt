"Freddy's Dying" made the most sensible thing that he could do after the fifth film disappointment. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" movie is wrong at the time, but at least is genuine. Some of the visuals are even a little breath-taking. <br /> <br /> Freddi's son (Lisa Zane) resembles his bad father after returning to the city. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not another cartoon to buy a child in the theater. There is a good actor (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane), who are mostly dumb and seem to be ready for the slaughter. <br /> <br /> This is a one-sided, magical game, and in the end, it's not just childhood fun. <br /> <br />
