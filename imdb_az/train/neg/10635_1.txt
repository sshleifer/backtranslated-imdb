There is a word that one of the heroes calls a Russian "drunk kohr", which is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> The media are also "worse than the Nazis", "Jews, Gypsies, and so on." The KGB was looking for "Zionist" agents of imperialist agents (the KGB believed). Like the Nazis, as a whole nation, the Jews are totally different from targeting. Gypsies have never been punished. The KGB was a political tool and used politically, but from an international point of view. Communists did not really separate the nations. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seems to be wrong as a fake. The main hero does not speak Russia, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, and the KGB general seems completely fake. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> Instead of "Good Shepherd" go.
