Guy Richie's third film (called "God-fearing") is a complex movement of gambling, gangster and chess. The admirer of Richie's previous efforts is likely to hate the Revolver with my curling and turns. Richie Stalwart plays Jason Statham's ridiculous name, Dorothy Macha (Superior OTT Ray Liotta), a new release ex-con Jake, but instead has thrown a lot of red nudity along with a few other cons movies and thrown him into the audience, it would be tiresome. The high point of the film's tide is a bit of a restaurant where the dialogue takes place. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is a slow shot, a very nice shot, favored, Revolver is not really sad, not Richie's best, yet Lock, Stock. the school would give the homework assignment to be precious 'should work harder!'
