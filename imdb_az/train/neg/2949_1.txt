Wow ... What would you do with $ 33 million? Give me a choice; or make a film based on Whoopi Goldberg's premiere-like hardwood futurist cop that collaborates with a rubber dinosaur using expressions like "I did not make a trumpet" or a) It rarity is that it's funny. <br /> <br /> You would choose the option that would benefit more from the toilet. <br /> <br /> You have to believe it. I can not find the words to describe how bad this movie is. Even "very bad" - "good" does not fit. <br /> <br /> Given that Yuras Park is a few years old, how do people in the world think that a person dressed in a rubber suit can endure? The WG simply went away and it must be damaged. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I am implode.
