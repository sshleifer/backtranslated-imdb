He has been releasing a train chain band near Yuma and leads a retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (also a heat-resistant goldener with a screenwriter). An attempt to bring the western genre with violence and cruelty in the 1970s is not the same as the new fangled west of the late 60's. Women's symbols are just as simple and squared as just stapling bags and as a victim of possible aggression. Returning to the old sheriff's commanding officer, Charlton Heston gives at least some inspirational performance (he has a good moment, tries to read a letter, and slams his glasses). Coburn, like a half-skinny half-car, is a lot of auto pilots, but Coburn has the chance to turn even the most terrible dialogue and situations into something deep and sad. This is all the show. * From 1/2
