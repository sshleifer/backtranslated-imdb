Doc Savage: The Bureau's Mana is a horrible film. Poorly written, very handy and just silly. Well ... at one level is actually a nice movie. This film will be watched in a group with a large group of cheap beer. It's almost as bad as one of the movies like "Santa Claus Conquering the Martians" or "Yor, The Hunter of the Future". If you have the right human team, this is a blast to watch. Campaign. Entertaining. There is a topic by Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, look somewhere else. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW has heard some studios say they are investigating the possibility of remake ...
