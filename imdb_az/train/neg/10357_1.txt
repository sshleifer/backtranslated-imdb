I really did not like this movie because I did not really introduce the L'Engle messages and ideas in the novel. We read a novel in the English class and I absolutely loved it, and I'm afraid that we're not the same for the movie. There were serious differences between the novel and the adapted version, and Madeleine L'Engle had no credit for the creative genius! That's why I gave that bad rating. Do not miss this movie if you are a great fan of L'Engle's texts, because you will be disappointed too. However, if you watch the movie for entertaining purposes (or my education is in my situation), it's a good movie!
