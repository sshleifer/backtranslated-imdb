this is checked for a dollar for a DVD, which can be easily smiled as a scary movie. Every time you think you can not get a bad thing, it's inevitable. Acting is absolutely horrible. The plot does not make any sense. In the US DVD version, the name "cold revenge" has nothing to do with the script. Event scenes are taken open for the first time. There are very few mistakes during conversations, which at least does not intend to do anything else to try to make the film flawed. I can not remember remembering a worse movie, and sometimes I get bad ones - well, except with Wesley Snipes. No, I strongly call it a bad one, and Unstoppable deserves the best picture prizes in the Oscars.
