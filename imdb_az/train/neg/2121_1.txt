It seemed to be very sincere enough for seven hours of boredom. What is this? Will Smith not be able to just stand alone? In my opinion, it looks very daring to be just attractive and get Oscars. I understand how it works, but I will not see anyone winning it until it comes to a new act of acting. He is a great name and, therefore, generally mixed with being talented and different actors. He is not alone. I give him credit for trying hard and we can cry in the hat. <br /> <br /> The seventh pound was a kind of sponge for me from the start. The suicide 911 did not force me in any way. Why he did not have to know why he committed suicide. There was absolutely no surprise. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson deserve chemistry on the screen. But I do not know his name, but a Spanish woman has done a great job with her role as a frightened and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson was often shown on the screen, but he always said he was stealing demonstrations. <br /> <br /> In general, the mill is insufficiently structured. Because I took care of any of these people, I could not help asking myself the whole way. He never apologized for 'Tim / Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was he just saved in an 8-person accident? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
