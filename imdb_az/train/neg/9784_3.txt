My mind, my friends, and I've seen a film based on the movie's headline. Sweet, though it is clear in its area and direction - you know that the film will go in the first five minutes. My main controversy with the field remains consistently tolerant, and the characters never reveal a lot of things behind. An alcoholic father, a mother who is a very active mother, a jealous sister ... is a bad family, but there is no other solution than the siblings. I was involved in the stage with glasses ... it seemed very casual. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... Children are not bad actors, but their writers should be asked to leave a lot. Unfortunately, a cute niche film, pushed for a special, special effect, bare comedy and an open field.
