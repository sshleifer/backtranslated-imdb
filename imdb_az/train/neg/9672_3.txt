While the majority of the film is very enthusiastic, the Kosher Massacre scene is played, but not true. The Kosher Law states that an animal should be conscious when the blade touches the skin. The scene of the Kosher slaughter is as accurate as everyone knows, or the Peta film showing the Kosher massacre in which the throat of the animals was cut, and still seeing the cut of the esophageal, conscious, and clearly apparently suffering. We must remember that history was written by the winners. <br /> <br /> Even once, is it permitted to think that the Nazis are right? <br /> <br /> Do the Nazis forbid this terrible religious massacre and the Jews still say something they have been doing so far?
