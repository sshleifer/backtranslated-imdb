Spoiler: A group of passive aggressive people who bring together their family. What is said in the script and people are doing things that will never do, at least everyone is broken by a filth. The hero falls on a woman who sees her soul as a companion at a bookstore on a merger day. She does not know that her mate will not appear like her brother's girlfriend. He tries to postpone his brother's claim, but he clearly understands our heroine, wearing her dresses and behaving like a stripper, hugs her brutally, exposing her on her brother, and envelops her with an excuse. At one point, it actually transforms itself into a shower. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart is broken. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> -align: justify; "<br /> <br /> The film really creates. The spectators were avoiding the long lifetime. The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. We almost went out, but I would definitely think something would happen, but there is nothing. All the unpleasant comments are written by paying wives, to burn poor men like me, as if they did not have a similar deal. Compare with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers, and theaters to let them into the screen to let this bad thing happen!
