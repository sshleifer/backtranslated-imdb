Well, now I know that there are millions of people who believe in Rapture: All reborn in Christ will meet God, and the rest of mankind will be destroyed on earth and burned in fire. and the heart failure of the psoriasis, such as the antichrist, fights with Jesus (in an indestructible war mode). And I know books are the best sellers. . Anyway, those who believe. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that they filled this film with a sack and beat it with Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are better. Indeed. <br /> <br /> The target does not need any pressure. If you watch this movie you will read a book. Perhaps this could be one of the only people watching for a really bad experience, and I was not disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little "Growing Pains" from the age of this show have found Christ, and SHOW SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but you can now be happy to even spread the word of God in the movie, and even do not go to the freedom of the theater. Yes, this is not really true: so the only film that went to DVD was prepared with a plug-in for a free movie when it was released shortly in movie studios! I still have chips! How many people do you think you're coming to? I do not know you, but I did not come to my city. Of course, we live in NYS, where godless liberals sit in the Bible to tear our pages and use them for play. So you will go. <br /> <br /> I'm going to bet about 3 million people on Manhattan island, no one will fall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> these films. . CAST and CREW should all be the same religious mind. They do not go right and they say it, but they listen closely to what the filmmakers say. People like a Pod movie came together to make a Pod movie. How is that creepazoid? I'm honest, these things have just turned out, are not they? Unless you subscribe to all the apocalypse thing waiting for it, swipe your forehead and "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I get better saved PRONTO!" Can you imagine that? Anyway, I bang. I have to get to know the rest of this Christian fiasco movie, especially Gary Busey. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> br> <strong> What are the shadows of the poor, innocent dogs that all their shots are drifting away because they are called to heaven? What is this? Should we feel bad for dogs? And if we do, what do we want from God? There is no place in heaven for the best friend of humans, is not IRK people? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is a reason I'm agnostic. Good night and good luck.
