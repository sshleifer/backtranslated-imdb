Kurt Russell (like Steven Post) struggles with post UBC (ie United Broadcasting Corporation) post; Lincoln, a physician and dog, delivers ridiculous projects to the studio leaders, as director of programming, Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr Russell's suggestions, but never chooses a hit television show. Russell's secretary, Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), has a chimpanzee on Russell's edge while watching television, watching all the popular shows and choosing hits easily ... Russell finds the talent of chimpanzee and his career for example, Russell and iron for HAIRY! <br /> <br /> The chimpanzees (working by Frank Lamping) work well, and Raffles are boring during a few scenarios where chimpanzees think they are interested and / or does not seem to be embarrassed; they could have been made with the repurchase or correction. Light has a satirical edge - a monkey picking television shows you can imagine! And, a monkey who has a BEER during advertisements (drinking a Disney movie)! A look at the cast will try to get acquainted with the fun of the entertaining television actors and put them on the ground. Raffles can guess actors for the honor they have played in beer, and you can play a drink before. Here is a start - Hey, is not "Dr. Bellows" from "Jeannie's Dream"? Down the hill! Barefoot Executor (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
