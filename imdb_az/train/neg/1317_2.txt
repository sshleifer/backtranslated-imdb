People in Movie Video decided to get the first installment with ONE TOO MANY (1916), when they collected the collection of "Slapstick Encyclopedia", which had many cassette choices for silent comedies. very young Oliver Hardy. As a composer, this decision was a failure, ONE TOO MANY is a very bad film that keeps track of many viewers. Like any typical Persian, it is a longing for cheating and plans, increasingly aggravating to the point of panic and nonsense, but unlike those who are good, many are dissatisfied, dissatisfied and clearly dissatisfied. At this point, it is difficult to say that the desperate confusion is a result of sketchy images or undecided film shootings, but at least halfway to the most exciting audience and not know what's happening and what's happening. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For years, "Babe" met with Hardy. Stan Laurel is still full of young energy. While awakening in a scratch on the opening scene, Babe comes out with a high athletic backbone on his bed. Make me funny as it is in this movie. If you read this movie before seeing the first tape of the Slapstick Encyclopedia, I suggest that you put this job forward and go to the good things.
