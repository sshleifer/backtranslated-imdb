This is one of the worst 5 films I've ever seen. It's not a frightening or excessive description. This movie was agonizingly slow and almost boring for almost 98 minutes. Although the player is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is writing, not written, slow, and no realistic sliding. Sometimes an exciting mood will only be broken by some useless line or event. I was not surprised that all the shooting was sick and thrown between the shooting, and they all did it after trying a terrible scenario. As a great admirer of horror movies, I'm always worried that something bad would happen. You will not be able to recover yourself for 98 minutes.
