<br /> <br /> It does not matter to video shooting, timing, or random effort. <br /> <br /> Makeup that a child can do. * The actor is over ... poor management. * Correction was very difficult ... many things did not make any sense or just seemed to be free. * Sound was dubbed bad. * Music was not very relevant. * Casting was extremely low ... should be cracked. Just talking zombies ... drive, dance, work ... just pisses me. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! He was the best-looking zombie, just as he was in a terrible state. <br /> <br /> Cover art was good, but very cheating ... as the main menu of the DVD ... great art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T!
