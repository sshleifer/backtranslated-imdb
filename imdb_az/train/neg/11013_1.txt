I'm in bad movies, but there's nothing to it. Despite the morals you have seen above, it is not funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but it is horrible that Director / Writer should not be banned from doing anything, but do not go to the local cable again! Love for movies and comedy is to offend this movie. I have never understood how flawless it is and how it works. If you love this movie, there's a pothead as well as sober here. ZERO! If you want to compare underground movies, watch "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The movie starts with identifying the satir and I'm disrespecting everyone to show me a satire. This is the rule for the comedy ... If you say FUNNY or you can say ANYTHING, but if you're not a comic you are not sad, you're just sad, and this movie is not just funny. ZERO!
