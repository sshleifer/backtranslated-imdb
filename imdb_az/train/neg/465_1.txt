When I was in the movie theater another day, I had a Blonde and Blonder, but it could be something that might have been a favorite movie. Who knows? I would like to say that when Romy and Michelle saw him, they buried many, Saris and Blender could have been just another hidden treasure. But when I started watching: Producer Pamela Anderson, Wow, I knew I was scary. Pam Anderson and Denise Richards did not hurt them, they were not well aging, and they played more roles than women. They were supposed to be 20 years old, not 40 years old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn do not have a clue when you come across stupid stereotypic blonders, sad But when girls are directly mistaken for murderers, the police are on their fairy tales and in fact call on girls to say "ignorance happiness". They are set up to hit a boy and they only go to "show him a good time", but the true conspiracy is corrected and wants to work and kill the girls. > Denise and Pam seem to be very difficult on the screen and read almost the same day as the previous script. I know it was a foolish comedy, but it was more than a fool, it turned into a fever and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend it? After a million years, girls are just at this point to keep their "sex babies" - a sign of more hopelessness and Blonde and Blond are big blonde BOMBshelles. <br /> <br /> 1/10
