<br /> <br /> This movie can be one of the biggest kinematic belt bombs on history (not a movie - a cheap low-corder note). Caution: packaging introduces a fever like an erotic intelligence of sexual addiction. The film is a discovery of something and is not erotic than looking at its warts. The scenario is senseless and it's like moving through all the plot elements that serve as segways between sex scenes. But even sexual scenes are also a foolish lump. Except for the first, they are close to three seconds (later, my version is reversed) and cunning. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie, you do not want it. If you are looking for a whispered whisper, you do not want it. Regardless of the goals, desires, and prospects of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. How Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Beglyi were surprised to be in action in this sad bomb.
