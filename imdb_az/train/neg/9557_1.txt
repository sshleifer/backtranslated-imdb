I really did not have high expectations and I was not disappointed. This film is so terrible that I felt I had to register an account here on the IMDb. The storyline is terrifying and you continue to ask yourself during the movie "can it be worse?" YES, may be! in a way able to make the worst every minute and "I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!"
