Two choices on the front: I think that Joe Don Baker really can be good or even good with the right material and right director ("Little Fear" remake, "Goldeneye" a small role, "Walking Tall"). I also liked Baker at Mitchell because he was playing an anti-hero who was allegedly not different. Yes, the scope of MST3K was cheerful, but cheap bikes at Baker - it was not worth it - to keep everything alive and entertaining - it suits the level and tone of the movie and it was the best part. <br /> <br /> justice "appears to be more apparent, but it is weaker than Mitchell, despite the exotic places and" cowboy border justice. " . And the main reason is the character Baker wrote. As the film embodies Baker's old style border victory, he calls his opponents to the old-style mano-a-manicopter competitions. <br /> <br /> Because it's tough and dirty, it's always loose, wounded, and overwhelming in many cases. <br /> This is condemning the movie "B" for Gary Cooper. However, Baker is stupid and obsessive because the three of the worst guys are facing a demonstration in a public market, encounters with civilians across the globe. He simply shaded them to the headquarters of the evil man (which was why he was pursuing them first) and would never have been different. Otherwise, he would have to take the enemy and force them to surrender and take him to the headquarters to get one of the armed units. No, she should be a bush league hot dog and a ma√ßo blokhead, and she gets a kid taken from the next shootout hostage! <br /> <br /> Is this a man we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole film is basically the same. Most of the supporting actors are OK (on the one hand), a good place (two well-known European actors with the worst man and father - they only act, but they need to be corrected and even hold them all). <br /> <br /> <strong> Baker's character produces erroneous, unhealthy stunts and mistakes, at least two innocent people, and more than a few bad men who fall into the right hands without using a deadly force. <br /> On the plus side, 90% of the film is set up in Malta or the Mediterranean, with very beautiful scenery and exceptionally beautiful and exotic looks. And indeed, Baker himself can be a bit dyspeptic and a little dyspeptic, but he's not bad ... critics of these films (Mike and Bots are also in their sad surroundings) In short, this movie is for the video wallpaper it is good, but the audience should not pay attention to it.
