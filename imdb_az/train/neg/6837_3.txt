Normally, I do not like revenge films .... TERM. But the double effect is slightly more than your typical vengeance areas. As you can see, DI has the power of action, precision, exotic places (eg Hong Kong), awesome gunfire battles and enough martial arts to fulfill their desires for an effective unarmed struggle. Like all the retribution, you would want to throw a tile in a 40-story building on the top floor! <br /> <br /> Along with this, Double Impact does not have one of the sensational shitters that captivate the eye and the desire to "Death of the Dream 2" and strangle the elitist, racist, and poisonous social stereotypes. The field department is as transparent as Double Impact. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a gang of money-related family members, or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of what the boys are talking about in the French accent is very bad. It's not a juicy film that makes the movie worse, but the use of clich√© lines and other films (from Princess Bride from Lethal Weapon) really worsened. Nevertheless, Double Impact is still awesome. But why would you hate it with the flaws of your existence (such as the greedy English boy who kills the Chad and Alex's parents and kills the delicious golden red naked ones)?
