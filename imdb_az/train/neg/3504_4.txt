I gave this show (only seven episodes of watch) four stars because most of its jokes seem unsuccessful. Some are not excited, but some are entertaining - a type of 12-year-old child. He recalls the New York artist who painted a canvas, called it art, and sold many coins. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> As the whole enterprise is prepared potatoes, a good comedy should also succeed.
