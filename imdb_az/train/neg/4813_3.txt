I tried to figure out which version you were watching. At the end, copyright is 1983. Though it's not the most important part of the protest, the Aquarius Age (long-haired hippy chicks and ugly station wagons) is unthinking in the synth soundtrack of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Here's my main protest against BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVER OF FILMMAKERS. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> All very nice and exciting, I want to warn the film industry. Pamela Franklin retired from work, but if he decided to shoot a movie, and if some of the director's explosions attempted to kill him, I would say that he would NOT ignore him. <br /> <br /> HAS NO ONE PERSONNEL FRANKLIN AND USED FOR PAMEL. I am very happy. <br /> <br /> B-movie supporters are looking for a crapfest, which can make it even worse. Moreover, this is not something, but something, not something. This movie is a sophisticated satirical film. <br /> <br /> Demonstrations on the wall, baphomets, hallucinations, ridiculous rats - what else do you ask? <br /> <br /> These excellent things are not limited to filmmaking in the 1980s, and this is something that is not compatible with the film. The soundtrack reminded you of something you heard on the Equalizer. <br /> <br /> Also, Pamela Franklin's English accent was attractive, which was pretty rude, although Human Rights in the Documentation Declaration. I say that we have the right to speak with Pamela Franklin's voice. Who's with me? I can forgive everything about this movie if they do not exploit Pamela Franklin. <br /> <br /> PAMELA WILL MEET WITH FRANKLIN. <br /> <br /> With the FICIOUS CONTRACT. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
