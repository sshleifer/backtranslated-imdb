One of the movies I've seen, The Rage, is still one of the worst. Movement, Logic, Sustainability, plot-script, and dialogue have made me sad. "How can any of them come up with such a terrible thing?" Gary Busey knows for "B" movies, but this is "W". (W = waste). <br /> <br /> For example: Nearly two FBI and local law officers cover a trailer home with a jeep carriage. There is "confusion" in the Jeep and the causes of all the cops. In just a few seconds, a great gunfire occurs, and MA is killed plainly. The police have blasted the ship with a bomb exploded in the boat and in a blast. The cops are like drivers driving around Gary like dominoes and jeeps and do not fall into a bullet / peleton. MA was killed and gary seemed to have not seen this man as difficult. It's a miracle, after actually catching 300 bullets from six rifles.
