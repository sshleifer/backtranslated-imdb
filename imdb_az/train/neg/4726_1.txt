<br /> <br /> You need to think about another film about the nature of the infamous, arrogant, arrogant, sensitive, hateful and self-defeating lead. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, all wall-hungry wall-shaped characters have a strong self-destructive character. I do not object to this, there is very little background for this guy. Why did this man hate himself and his world? Despite the fact that the scenario was used more often, they were able to achieve a little bit of sincerity. <br /> <br /> After making a big pillage to make this boy as bare and anti-social as possible and to make his fate dark, it just comes as an unpleasant hate. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
