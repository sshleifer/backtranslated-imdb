This is not a bad movie. The area (looks like a new house built from the gate next door) is not bad, the mood is quite creepy and the player is complete. It's a big problem for me to get acquainted with Lara Flynn Boyle (Twin Peaks and other demonstrations), which differs from her appearance with her new big lips. I continued to look at them. They look at her like this! <br /> <br /> Mark Paul Paul Gosselaar is doing a wonderful job by stealing who is who and who is carrying his soul and spirit into his house. And next to Lara (like Col) is also very good as the owner of the house (but lips!). His wife Walker (Colin Ferguson) fitted wooden. The various characters in the house were also beautiful. In particular, Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and his wife Buddy (Stephen Amell), liked the first people to go home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for some reason, attempts to involve a general neighborhood vibe system are unfortunate due to the fact that the director can not make the "angry" home particularly unsuccessful. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, the legend of the Hellfire) manage to achieve this frightening feeling, but here it does not just happen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Police are the closest to anyone when they have a description of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that has not been worked for me is an argument with the architect Kim. <br /> <br /> For the first time, he seemed to be a victim of the house (it was saved from inspiration), but later he joined forces with evil. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not bad If the movie throws those big lips to your horror fans!
