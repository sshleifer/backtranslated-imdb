If you come to Tina Fey, then you can do better. From the beginning of the film I knew how it would cost. Certainly, it was sometimes funny. Even laugh out loud. But there is not enough laugh to save the movie. I do not recommend buying it. I advise you to hire the most. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have created a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite films. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have done very well and are doing well in doing so. But that's not good. Baby Mama made a great support. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin are great. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy movie has reached the world of cinema. The Big Knocked Up and Juno looks very mediocre when compared to Baby Mama. Knocked Up and Juno are cheerful, hearty and ending with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> I recommend it, but I do not expect it to be funny. We look forward to a medium comedy that does not think of a great emotional end. Baby baby ..... <br /> 4/10
