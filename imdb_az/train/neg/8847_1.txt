The USS soap opera "Knots Landing" has all the fun value of staying in a lift. Each episode has areas such as aggression, crime, kidnapping and drug smuggling, which are not characterized by other dramatic demonstrations of the time. When it came to shedding, I saw better players in the grain box. From the mid-90's to the end of the "knots", the English Gold was stopped as a mildewing nappies mountain. I'm sorry to announce that my mother is a big fan of the show and that I have not suffered so much because of looking at religion. Very few and far from those who have been working since then (though this is the case). The only positive thing that could be called "Knots" was the captivating saxophone signature, then used as the title music of "I.T.V sitcom", "The Upper Hand". Great heritage, eh?
