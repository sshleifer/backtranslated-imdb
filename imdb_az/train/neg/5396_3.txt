If you're looking for something to explore the Shakespearian dialogue, I've read the comments you should not watch. Unfortunately, this is surprising, because all this fascinating dialogue has this beautiful game, cut and replaced by songs. I've been reading this game and I'm fortunate enough to see this one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this movie does everything I love about it. Although the prince had no doubts about what she was directed to, she did not have any critics, and all the girls were impressed by the foolishness of the characters - they were influenced by clever cuts, but they were interpreted from the context - it was a bit uncomfortable to hear the pronouncement; "We are smart girls to ridicule our beloved in such a way!", It did not happen during the harvest. The news along the film also broke the flow and took very beautiful curtains as they showed up on the stage after themselves and were in contemporary figures. Ultimately, this is a great game that has been destroyed by a strange concept and has been brutally cut. Kenneth, I love you so much. What did you think?
