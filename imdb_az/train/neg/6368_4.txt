Last time I rent a video without controlling the IMDB review. Limey was driven by Steven Soderbergh and wrote that, together with Ewan Macgregor, he managed to manage such garbage that he had written really awful Nightwatch and interviewed with anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a wonderful player and it's a shame that he has taken on a bad movie. There is often an embarrassing arrangement that seems like a last minute decision to skip a story or story, shoot a movie, and get a straightforward thought. This movie is wrong with everything. What did they think?
