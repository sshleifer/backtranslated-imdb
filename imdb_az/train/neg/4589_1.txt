Do you remember chained channels that were exposed in 60 minutes a few years ago? This is due to it. Many films have checked this movie without checking fairy tales. Manufacturers have successfully used promotional "mouth-words" promotions without explaining the financial and philosophical basis of this article for marketing purposes. If you believe in sewerage, reincarnation, new age and daytime balloon, this movie is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or the reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to be convinced that Ramthan is not vacko, and he needs to give him money. If you do not advise Ramtha to quit in a cursory webpage, you might think that this infomercial is spending the money you earn for this madness. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
