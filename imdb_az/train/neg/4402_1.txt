I usually love the Lesbian movies as well. I'm biased, maybe! <br /> <br /> But this is just a hole. Yes, the decor and buildings are beautiful and short but beautiful erotic interlude, but in another case this movie just takes full time. Annamarie sulking and alternates between high / stoned / shifting passes between any medication or booze, and Ella is surprised by this legendary behavior through the entire film. <br /> <br /> At best, at least if there were at least one kind of closing (was it potential romance?) We have never given such an idea or an idea of ​​Annamarie so depressive and retreated? even know!), could have been some sort of satisfaction. Annamarie at some point Ella said, "Why do you love me?" Even if they asked him. Ella does not accept this. <br /> <br /> Even the relationship between these women and the indigenous people is even one (bad behavior) on a busy road to a woman. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> The film has a good joke, but I'm sure it was inadequate. Women travel in mid-size two-seater Ford Coupe. But when they camp, they have great tents, cots, bedding, and even a desk, chair and writing machine! Moreover, when they are on a ferryboat, we probably are seeing their luggage packages with the small Ford's body! <br /> <br /> And we do not see anywhere that the whole film will have a place to buy any gas station or petrol. Most of them are traveling through the endless miles in the desert. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ em> <br /> <strong> Put it suddenly.
