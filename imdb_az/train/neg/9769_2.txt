I read the Thornton Wilder game last year in the eighth grade. I was forced to sit on the screen with this poor translation. I said that this is not a great game, it is easily overcome, but the man deserves a better shot. The decoration and honesty for God, as the player really is missing, seemed to be preparing a cardboard by a three-year-old band. The sound quality is so bad as the night does not deteriorate ... when it comes to an actor, it's a foolish "buzz" ... I could not help, but the chemistry between George and Emily is good, exhaustive. All actors are very concerned about being there. No music. He was black-and-white, but it would be good, but it was more of a jealousy. Anyway, I think that if you give me a point to seeing this movie, I really do not advise, then do not put your hopes on a high level. Better, as you do your legs.
