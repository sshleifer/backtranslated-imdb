I love the previous "Ittenbach" movie I've seen, "Burning Moon". But if this film is terribly awful and bad, Premutos is playing for more laughs. How it is that Ittenbach likes to have this movie in his spare time (and DVD movie is worthwhile to see it), I'm struggling to move on to the next stage. Of course, look at it and if you want it, go ahead and enjoy it. But be aware: there are many comedy and exhausting story expositions. Many compare it with Peter Jackson's films, especially Braindead movies. But Jackson sees what he has done in a budget similar to Bad Taste, something that is missing from Ittenbach Jackson's talent. 3/10 (for good and bad adverse effects and for the limited use of limited resources - but I did not pay for it)
