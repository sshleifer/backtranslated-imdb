Kirsten Dunst is extremely overrated as an actress. You can always say that it is only "acting". I love Izzard. The land is very boring. The viewer has nothing to do with the characters, and he will not be able to really care for them and even care for them. Slow, boring movie with some laughs, but not too little and not too funny. The soil does not have the least attendance or suspension. You can see one mile away from each sky. What's this movie? Comedy? Drama? Whose mouth? You will not be until the end of this movie.
