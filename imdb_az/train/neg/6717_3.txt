This was God's fear. The story was on the ground and more often I was involved in the terrible correction. I did not sympathize with anyone because their symbols were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people without dimensions. Peacock, porous stereotypes, subplots that have not gone anywhere. The Stripper Chicken was a distraction, even though it seemed worthy. I do not know what it's trying to do, but how shocked I was when they saw this debris in Sundance? I canceled my subscription almost. You would think that such a channel would show better quality movies. There are many, better gay and lesbian themed movies. "Celluloid Closet" is a perfect document. I listened to Wigstock: The Movie. I'm sure there are others who have my opinion right now, but what I mean is that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that, even if you are closely acquainted with television since then, do not worry. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Maybe, there were three or four really good looking shots (sorry I count them on the one hand) or the movie is pretty bad. The lighting set out in many places. I think that some of the effects had nothing to do with it and were used to add. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (of course without blonde hair). Too bad his player did nothing for me. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
