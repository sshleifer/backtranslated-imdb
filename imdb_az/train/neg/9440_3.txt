Unhinged was the selection of Video Nasty Censorship in the United Kingdom in the 80s. Do you know how to get rid of children? Many of those who are wondering that confusion are all about it. <br /> <br /> Three girls go to a jazz concert ... and you know immediately that the body will be at a very low level. They are lost in the woods, so they laugh because they have fallen into a fraudulent car. They are taken by some nearby residents who live in forests in a creepy house. One of the girls is seriously injured and should be left up. Then he speaks. I'm talking about how the girls are here and who they are in time to eat because of the mother's dislikes when it's late. And more conversations. Yachity yak. A naked man walks around and harasses his daughters, some of whom look like Hitchcock's Psycho, passing through the holes in the beautiful girls' walls. Because you believe that murders will begin, there is a lot in this movie. In fact, one of the girls escaped from his mind that he would just go from the city to the woods. Smart move. He probably knew a single family going alone, but he did not just care. <br /> <br /> Therefore, wait for us to talk more closely, wait and wait for the next girl to be killed or unexpected. <br /> <br /> And then there's a bending end. For some viewers, "expected" is unexpected, while others are real. Perhaps someone may be the reason he really wants to watch it. I'm twisted, nothing in this movie is worth anything to the dreadful time I've been watching. Even with the slightest effect of the end, the director did not have the need to deliver only a really good story. <br /> <br /> If you really want to get it for whatever reason, maybe it would be a good 30 minute - 1 hour TV episode to say that each slasher is watching. movie, give yourself a favor and prepare the button fast forward. Since the film has very little significance, you just have to grow them and never "WOW, this is all this time," this time. Oh and half of the movie has a shower scene with 2 girls showing boo-bees. Horse for Boo-bees. Yes, these beautiful bee honey bees.
