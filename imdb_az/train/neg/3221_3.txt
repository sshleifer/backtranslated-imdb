This evening I watched the course on the tube. First of all, the presence of the actor drew my attention. The first scenes were striking. Some funny, some sad. Good character development. I felt the third part of the movie was different. If it were not for an early movie, I would follow. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, for a few years, I did not like the extension of some of the character's Jewish (?) Spokesman. Other shoes? No, I do not think. Other reviewers (60s), for the most part, did not pay much attention. The latter completely closed me.
