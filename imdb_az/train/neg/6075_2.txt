One of the worst films ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is an untrained cliche in slasher flickks. The film is trying to tilt or bend the genre by a disruptive plot of a bewitching fanatic of a psychologically-directed admirer - the film does nothing. (Spoilers) Do we believe in a deadly baseball player who plays with a knife without witnesses, security or cameras and we kill? The film is a nonsense that baseball is about to pull through our hoop, mockingly complicated and cunning. What all the actors think they are on this razzie? This is a big dude as they come. Stay away if you choose the idea in your movie
