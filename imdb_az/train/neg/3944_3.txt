My film, Modesty, Modesty, stands around an episode that features about one page in the Blaise novel, the 10th modesty called Morningstar Night. It describes an event in which young humility (film, 17th, twenty-first) is leading a war on a casino. As the original Blaise adventures are predicted, Willian Garvin is not in the movie. Relationships between Blaise and Garvin, of course, were always one of the interesting aspects of novels and long-haired comic strips. The other problem is that the film is simply incredibly dull, because it's a small episode that really exploded in a scenario. Casting is okay, but Alexandra Staden is not really too old as a hero for the role of playing young humility. I get the impression that this movie is a quick and dirty solution, not to lose the Blaise franchise rights.
