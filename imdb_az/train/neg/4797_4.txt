Mob boss Vic Moretti (Deceased Major Anthony Franciosa), after killing his deceased wife, Derek, is accused of being a bad person, Derek finds himself in jail, a corrupt supervisor, a prisoner of Vicin in prison, an ignorant CIA agent ( a great genre based and for the first time directed by John Saxson), various misconceptions are made to convert various prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great actor and this is a great player in Saxon as a director. It would be somewhat clarified to say that this film (so far only Yon's only director's trip) was a visual defect. But the film is completely unreliable. Dialogue, though strange, is sometimes bad enough to be humorous. Unfortunately, this is not enough to just reach the coast of this movie, and it goes on forever for the movie to begin with (even though it's getting late in the movie). So, most movies can be recommended when you're a fan of Saxon (which is really me), worth the price of an hour, it's better to go along with low expectations. <br /> <br /> Sea Lis Mason and Tane McClure are topless <br /> <br /> My Degree: D +
