Do the Bebe Boomer family really need more garbage? Technically, I'm not Boomer, even though the "idealist youth" of the '60s, reading Marx, burned their protective cards and extended a war that killed tens of thousands of people in general; It was still at school level. <br /> <br /> I also recalled that ten out of 9 were just moronically clever. It believed in everything during the devastating time. <br /> <br /> This is really the self-preservation of children who never existed.
