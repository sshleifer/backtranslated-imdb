I've seen this movie yesterday. I've rented the DVD from Blockbuster. Actually, I know one of the actresses of the movie. I will not say who it is .. But I have to admit that it was not as good as I thought .. Tom Savini? This guy's a hat ... But it's a shame that he's not in the movie for a long time .. The film's lack of ideas, script, sound etc ... It might sound like a good movie. <br /> <br /> Here's my dear 3 DVD has paid Â£ 10 for renting Blockbuster. I chose this one ... and I was disappointed. Anyway, down the head for me ..! My cup of tea is not! 10 to 10!
