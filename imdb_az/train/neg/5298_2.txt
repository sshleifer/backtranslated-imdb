I leased this movie because I was watching movies for films that nobody was hearing or could be a stone. I saw it and got it because I was a fan of violence and body. EM has a rating: Very Mature. I think that this rare and high rating is completely for violence and for everything. Box Warning: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge and Thickness. "Extreme violence" hit my imagination. The film resulted in a pretty good slasher scribble. There was one or two heroic scenes, but I saw worse than a PG-13 movie. Of course, is it a mixed amount in a movie, or is it? You also landed. Well, the plot was boring and nothing really special about it. Do not allow. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine what a person wants to say: "I'll rent it again". But there are moments that I hold you, but I'll still see this movie.
