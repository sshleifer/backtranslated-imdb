You think this is one of those films: Hulk is the same as Hogan's "Real American"? Undoubtedly, I do not think so and he would be right. I am Italy, for many reasons, I can not be proud of my country, but because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche, I returned to another team (for example, French). The heroine next to a British girl at the end of the movie, but with her friend does not fall in love, so what is Yale's rowing? According to the player, all players are doing very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the "Dead Poets Society." In fact, there is another movie I hate.
