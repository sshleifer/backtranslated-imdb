Incredible! <br /> <br /> This movie comes from 7 to 10. This should be one of the worst films I've ever seen. you should not just behave incredibly badly, as the story line (if you can say it) would be bad. Everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. It is not a bad thing if you can attract the audience while on the road. But it is not. There are no action, no tension, or even a spark, between the two leading actors. Unfortunately, my loss of time and, of course, the loss of my money. <br /> <br /> I'm just working
