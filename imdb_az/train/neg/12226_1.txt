I know, I know that "Out of Space 9 Plan" is the worst movie or maybe "Manos, Fate Hands". But it is not possible to work on these sock-monkey films. Of course * they are bad. How can they be? But if you are talking about respectable production and talented films, the Indian Rex should be "Yentl". Barbra Streisand, all the rattling noise caused by the stain of everything since 1964, deprives all self-sufficiency, reaching its final point in this film. In the gloomy top, "Yentl" returns as "A Star Is Beat" and "The Mirror Has Two Faces". There is nothing like it. Streizand I do not want to shoot this movie and I will not be able to imagine what the audience is playing, even though there are already ten chances that are not already there. /> <br /> The Nobel Prize laureate and the sacred guardian of the Jewish Literature, Isaac Bassvic Singer, was angry when Striken was associated with a similar incident. It respects a disrespectful conscience because Streisand continues to create more horrible movies than just committing suicide.
