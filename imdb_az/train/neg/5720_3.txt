Some of my beloved friends advised me of "Live Eating" and, in fact, I can not really complain because the film has, of course, conveyed a huge amount of rough and sleazed buckets, but of course not a good movie. Ryan Nicholson, in the latest trends in horror cinema, earns more money than the open currents called torture Porn, in this sub-genre (and including the "Hostel" and "Saw" role models) and wrapped makeup effects and naked co- eds suffer from harsh shots and plead their lives. There is no reason to describe it. Five people are totally clever, traveling to Asia with twenty friends. One of them has Asian roots, but besides these, I do not know why they want to travel, not to Cancun. Some continents are not interested in their culture, and they even cause a vital field when they witness the local sweets of a cute puppy dog ​​in the market. This quintet later dives into the nightlife, and one of them is insulted by the leader of an angry clan. It is not enough to ask for a simple apology, because the gangster directs them to the adult theater and gradually exposes them to brutal torture. A girl has a toxic snake down her throat, even with her breasts and other weak wench; yikes The "Live Fodder" is surprisingly boring, despite all the bloody hurricanes, and it's hard to look at amateur production values, even if you use it to watch independent fan-rich trash movies. The oil block, depicted on the eastern S & M lid of the lid, is certainly quite cool, and at least it closes its mouth all the time because it is the most talented of the whole gang. I do not recommend this pile of piles exactly, but hey, if you love loud and terrifying metal music, if you are disappointed by torture and damaged losers, go right and see!
