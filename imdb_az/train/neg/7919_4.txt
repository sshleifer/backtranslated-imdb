At least I found myself in this movie at the very beginning, and any credit I gave to this movie, Lacey Chabert, was spectacular! But this is the end of it. I really look good at determining who the killer is, and when I'm totally in a movie, I love it, but they're lying, they take you one way and suddenly they <br /> <br /> I really felt this movie, did not deceive a very bad post and planning! <br /> <br /> Because if they did not do so, they did not answer anything, why did Jane burn the professor's house? started as a relatively good movie as I have seen.
