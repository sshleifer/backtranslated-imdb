As a physicist, I've been warned of many mistaken professors and other so-called experts in this area. <br /> <br /> When I continue my research, I learn more about real-life physics and people who do better. <br /> <br /> Then I want to see my friends say this is a "movie movie." <br /> <br /> <strong> I believe that what I do is REAL quantum mechanics; it was not. <br /> <br /> This film may happen if everything that could lead to subatomic particles turns your eyes open. <br /> <br /> Our body consists of 10 ^ 30 subatomic particles in one place. There are billions of billion billion billion particles! Only the two "mysterious" quantum effects of the two particles can be about 50% of the probability that they can completely eliminate each other. When adding more particles in the mixture, it is almost impossible to obtain a large net quantum result. <br /> <br /> It's just not foolish. <br /> <br /> My friend is in physics, and I counted 3 facts during this film. <br /> <br /> After his meeting with his wife, he was buried a few days ago. At least, this movie had its indisputable quality: the dance peptides (or whatever) actually were the scene. It does not destroy the precious evidence attracting the film, but the main character goes to a person who is seen as "managed" by the peptides, and then falls into the dance floor directly into the film. sometimes a full CG scene full of dance and dance peptides that are covered by CG peptides. At this point, the film tried to explain to us that we were "dependent on emotions," so we get treatment with the exact tone of the phrase "We are in love." <br /> <br /> This scene has been withdrawn because anyone who can step on this scene and who still accepts this movie ... you also need to "open your eyes."
