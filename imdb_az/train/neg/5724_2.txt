I admit that the latest film is a horrible act of this movie. Yes, there were many eyes and nudity. But slowly, with a delusional plot and mute, she remained in the shade. This should be filmed anyway: a Canadian china or Hong Kong? The hostel was a better movie and I advise you to see it instead. My technical difficulties with the DVD When you close the Spanish subtitles, after returning from a few scenes, you need to return to the main menu and reopen it. Also, do not waste time deleting scenes because there is no audio and just like tourist pictures.
