One day after work, I sat down for a rest and opened up my movie channels. The movie came on the guide and called me, and I started it before. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but I wanted to stay in the movie and eat in the shortage of movement and lack of mobility in Jamie Foxx. If you have credits for acting in this movie, at least you should go to David Morse, who is trying to make the movie interesting. All this, planning to surprise your friends by choosing as a renter for a movie night.
