Ouch, what a painful BORING Sci-Fi movie! And it is particularly sad because the opening 15 minutes was so full of action and potential! During the presentation, we were accompanied by a group of nervous security guards and men employed by a physician who escaped from a secret laboratory with a bag full of confidential files. He was executed for revealing the terrible and inhumane events that took place in the laboratory. Figures ?? Thereafter, the "movement" moves between the two locations, the aforementioned lab and a corrupted senator (or something) in rural areas, and it soon becomes clear that these experiences are in full contravention. More boring, trivial and uncertain. Scientists have chosen four casual people without relatives, and although a giant machine can read the contents of their minds in any case, it is really important to talk about the truths of truth. They hide all terrible secrets and suffer when found out; but I do not see how these tests can result in a device that is endangering humanity. Maybe I left something, but I doubt. Mutual relationships between patients and doctors are less intimidating, because none of them really possesses personality. Thus, basically, "The Brain Machine" only works on a bunch of people living in a complex decorated room. If the building did not resemble a building, the film would be half an hour away! From the laboratory to the villa, and vice versa, a five-second shooting is shown EVERY TIME. Producers really demanded fullness, or assumed that all Sci-Fi audiences would not be able to notice the displacement by themselves. It's pretty frustrating to look at a tent that has been left in the back of a tent for only a tenth of five minutes, and I'm sure you. James Best's performance on mental matters is deserving, but a person can not do without doing so. Avoid!
