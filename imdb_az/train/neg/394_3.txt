I'm happy for the films that fill the gaps in the world cinema. After watching "Water Nilufer", I was planning to love this movie because I thought it was a rare thing: a film describing the beautiful version of "Beautiful Thing", a young lesbian love. <br /> <br /> The main heroes are 15-year-old French women. Marie is dark, beautiful and beautiful; Floriane goes on, athletic and beautiful; The mother is loyal, dirty, and behavioral. The erotic interaction between Marie and Floriane is always symbolic in this film. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies" is not about tasting love on two teenagers; it's about sex frustration, suffering, ennui, intersection, and at least two things - unhappy, mechanical sex. Screenwriters and filmmakers prove that they proved to be a very manipulative manifestation of their creativity. In addition to DVD's "Lord of the Flight", director Peter Brook links "French cynicism with the attractiveness of sex", that is, French, adolescents and adults with a widespread cynicism. <br /> <br /> Part of filmmaking, filmmaker Celine Ssiamma beat a big dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> What is life? When I watched this movie I asked myself. Yes, the first love can be pain and frustrating, but fresh, life-proving, happy and triumphant erotic. These positive aspects are missing from this movie; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < First, what is the point of showing the naked girl's nakedness? "In Europe's cinema there is a tradition of delightful teenage nudity, as I know," The Slingshot, The Rascals, The Devil, The Little Thief "," The Heart of Murmur "," Beau Pere "and" Europa, Europa " The situation is a small authorization intervention - "Look, audiences, I can only make a movie showing the naked people naked." <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Florian and Mariine dance, or no nakedness or equally distributed The next thing is that Marii is the only Florianian man who is filming Ssiamma, who manipulates his audience with paradise. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Floriane Marie that he wants something "not normal", authenticity and organic honesty Marie understands that "Who is thinking of being normal?" Sciamma audiences and film sensitivity is wrong because the request Florianenin film, a true and sincere question, not the audience who spend time in nature and not related to Marienin fake, derivative and the second question. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there are two things that lie at the audience's nerves: 1) From the time of France - from all - a bathing suit with a bathing suit and turtle? <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "Anne can have a successful career supporting the best players and roles in terms of technology," said Adele Haenel (Floriane), a promising lady or a bombster Pauline Acquart (Marie) has complexity and firmness, which is unclear, and in the future she could play until a meteoric rise rising from an emotional offended librarian, a mysterious attractive charm, a reluctant politician. /> Generally, the "Water Lotts" has been very disappointing: Make an original film about two young women to be an honest movie maker - no - this is not necessarily for the middle aged boy - young girls can watch and identify girls with a quality may be Yes, fill a gap on the subject in world cinema.
