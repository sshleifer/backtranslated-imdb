Camp Blood III is a very good place at Camp Blood II because it sounds mostly in the right places and in a noisy area. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This time they are a bit further away from the car park lure of the other two films that are a good action here, because you no longer need cars that you can not get away from the sliding away <br /> <br /> This time around there is a reality TV show and there are fake clowns to scare the competitors. It's a tough idea, I've seen at least three other horror movies, the real murderer's place, but at least one of the people who had been accidentally stabbed to death with a knife. <Br / <br /> The other two in the series is at least good for a little laugh. <br /> <br /> Firstly, stabbed, stabbed, stabbed, sits back as a rational person. <br /> <br /> Why did you think any third party Camp Blood movie would be better than starting from scratch, but at least it's a try. The half-naked deformed woman was a little bit hard for me, and they tried to keep up with some strange things they wanted to earn as much as $ 5, as in the second film. They are still a machete that is used to not cut stabbing, but oh well, what are you waiting for in this Camp Blood movie? If you talk about crap films, you'll have some fun with it.
