Shirley Jackson's 'The Haunting House of the Hill' is an atmospheric story of terror and transmits nature events in an old mosque. The atmosphere is well-researched and shakes are staged well. <br /> <br /> The 1963 book "The Haunting" is closely acquainted with the book, but adds its details to the plot. Fortunately, it is very small, so the fear and tremor of the book works better on the screen. Black-and-white photography only enhances the film's heartiness. Excellent! <br /> <br /> Then Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, the re-construction of The Haunting hit cinemas - you can call it a remake. <br /> <br /> Rebuilding the film in 1963 is a mystery, but it allows for the moment to look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> Most scary movies begin with an average. The set used for Hill House is a very nice and bizarre mystery, and in just a few minutes the movie seems to be fairly fair. And then, the first fears come from: a blank spatter wire cuts a female face (Dr Marrow Assistant). <br /> <br /> From now on, the film is just spiral down. <br /> <br /> Owen Wilson's character is particularly frustrating, as the film's work is particularly irritating (such a relief, if any). Special effects are practically shameful, because most of them appear incredibly cats and very daytime. They have a lot of examples, so I got them listed. <br /> <br /> So, with hundreds of others, look at the original refrigerator or alternatively, buy a novel by Shirley Jackson. But please keep away from it. And if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (like many channels, not for the original, but for the screen) or rent a cheap, but what should I do? Do not lose your money! <br /> <br /> The result: 4/10
