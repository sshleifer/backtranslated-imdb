I was really surprised at the amount of this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary good rating. Now I respect the person's thoughts and beliefs, and I am not in this position, I believe in the taught Christian doctrine. But anti-Christian propaganda is a bit different. <br /> <br /> This film has reliable points, but it is very small and is represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend doing so. In fact, I think everyone should see it, and if they believe in them, they should decide. And that's more than just giving the director the Christian teachings. Prior to a research on the subject, it appears to be a personal upbringing at a Christian school that affects her childhood. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Christians did not behave as incredibly naive or fundamentalists, nor did they humble themselves. <br /> <br /> He uses Christ's Passion movie scenes without the permission of the master, who presents his former school and almost anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I think the director general is the lowest person and I think his attitude is fully justified. <br /> <br /> I doubt that interviewers would consult with either one after the interview or even talk about the purpose of the interview before giving interviews. <br /> <br /> Along with this, there are new and interesting facts, where many original ideas about Christianity have been found. However, this idea is often attacked, highly professional and deeply impartial.
