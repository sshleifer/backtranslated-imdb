Um ... OK, I've got all the crushing, gorilla-style shooting techniques, but unfortunately, I think a gorilla is making a better movie ... It was a complete mistake to go. Bad fun, bad routine, bad story and terrible cinematography. I do not know how this garbage was released, but, unfortunately, I watched it. It's like a Blair Witch movie, but I believe that Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd) are diving in a cliff from the side of the "Five Eyes on the Side" by the directing group. I'm really embarrassed for these young women, but I am sure that they were promised to the Hollywood stardom, but this chick party ended. Dialogue is ridiculous, and when you listen to it, it really makes you worse. It's another mystery to be ashamed of a horror because there is nothing to fear from it, except for the truth I look at ... Try it for size: put on math and beat your donkey ... "The End". Of course, it's 95 minutes more foolishness (and then) ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
