Debbie Reynolds runs through tokens, tangos, and yes, this ordinary tension, which is a 30th-fiduciary atmosphere. Two lady who came together when her sons murdered, try to start their life with a tap-dance school for toast in Hollywood. Trouble, one of them being drowned by neuroses. Can you imagine this man who ruled Robert Aldrich ten years ago with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford? Nahh did not imagine Bette Joan could actually give the screen time, and I could not imagine Bette Davis in another role - he would dance her heart. This shaded Henry Farrell (a good shock idea is part of a series of adventures written by a group of rabbits to massacre!). In all the stunning package, it is not an obsession with honest entertainment. * From 1/2
