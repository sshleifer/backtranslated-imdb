How can they help Joe Don Baker (first after Bufford Pusser) to Bo Svenson (secondly Bufford Pusser)? Why can they do that? Because Bo Svenon is more like Bufford Pusser <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie on 7. I'll give it 10 to 10 and I'll give it to one of the 10's if the story is not in the life of Bufford Pusser, but that's why I gave it to 10 in 3. <br /> <br /> I doubt that anyone who plans to look at this cheese suggests instead of the first one and will follow.
