After leaving the TV's popular "The Andy Griffith Show," Don Knotts made a strange attempt by a number of movie designers, but by matin√©e-pleasing comedy. Unfortunately, the cheapest "The Reluctant Astronaut", the cheapest (most like "Knotts"), is worse than others. Don is playing a small town snooku that admits to the Astronaut Education Camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as a new guest! Some might say that the weak satire will work on the new fresh fire of the Americans for a new age of technology, but it's really just a pretext to invade children who are crazy, uncomfortable. It's a good start, OK with set up and nostalgia, but it's becoming more and more irony and irony. * from ****
