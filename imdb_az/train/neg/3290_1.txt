This movie sucked! They took something from my childhood and raped a home! This movie was very bad, I wanted to go home and dive my Dukes and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It was not the "Dukes", it driven a car from Stiffler and Jackass. When was Boss Hogg worse? When was Rosco a tough guy? They never did! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was a fool. When did Jesse win? Never did! Now do not get me wrong, I'm liberal, and there's nothing wrong with a little chibi, but there's no place in this movie! A good thing about this movie was trailers and finishing credits before the movie. Money was spent on time and air. Avoid Every Cost !!!!!!!!
