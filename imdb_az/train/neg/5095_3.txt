This evening, I sat in this movie, although I did not know any characters or what happened with myself, I had to stay with myself, because two leading Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan were great movie stars during their era and I see them as "something different" they wanted. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the entire film is an old city in Mexico where almost identical characters live (doctor, of course, a great exception). <br /> <br /> Probably, it is based on a study by Jean-Paul Sartre. I thought that if Sartre's work was like this movie, Camus should be a very mediocre attempt to imitate the "The Plague" novel in North Africa. <br /> <br /> Well-acting but uninteresting movie.
