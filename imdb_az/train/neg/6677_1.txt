After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, this story will not go in one direction, but first of all, they take it after 7 years, and then they do not know what to do (7 years). <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: then?) to release him (why did hell catch him?). Then the girl who moves is the best, she wants to get away from madness, suddenly she does not, then again, and then she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing alien killing all the aliens (and remember, that no human has ever seen these permanent aliens in all these years) and what did they do? <br /> <br /> This is my first look at IMDb, and I'm a very lazy person who does not write too much, so listen to my alert: action is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
