oh my god, I give this movie eighteen stars for the following reasons. the last sequence was once more efficiently captured and totally hilarious. That's why it gets three points. Moreover, this is a torment. it should have been funny, it is very clear, but the dubbing, the voices of the voiced sounds, the dialogue they say are often cheerful. Implemented and / or non-executed actions also lead to very unpleasantness and / or inconvenience on the screen. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> When the whole town was killed and a small group of people stood on a balcony, watch a dining glass or from a locked church "<br /> <br /> <strong> Ancient saying> <br /> <br We will take this little boy and he will go outside, and these corrupted bodies are not strangers alone, in fact no body or <br /> <br /> The hero (up): he is trying to escape, he is foolish, and he is out of the open door, he is a fool, this is a beautiful appearance . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " br /> <br / <strong> Talk about the events in the Caucasus. </ p> <p> So watch the first movie with a few friends, drink a few drinks and make sure you watch it, be completely blinded and jealous of all of them . and in such a shame there was such a blessing.
