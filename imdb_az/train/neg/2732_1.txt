I was happy when My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu, released last season. Scrubs, I thought, made a clever and unique thing in the concept of the clip-show. After one season, almost all sitcoms jealous, escaped to clip show ... and work his experience was similar to that of his child. The shattered head of Dr Cox shows how lazy it is to put editors together, because this will not look like 'My Longer Good' after a few episodes. I do not think it is a great effort to ensure the durability of a well-built sitcom once. Adding a DVD for a very (very) rainy day, is not the Prime Minister's television episode.
