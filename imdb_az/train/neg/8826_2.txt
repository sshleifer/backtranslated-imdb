This (quite) low-budget movie is compared to the classic "Silent Night Fatal Night" for being tagged as Slasher Flick. First of all let me know that even the "Quiet Night Part 2" is better (more than half of the movie is filled with genuine flashback). "Christmas Evil" is going to slow down (slowly) to the main character of people (a strong word), trying to get psychologically. He irritates those who point to the fact that Mila does not have the true meaning and the toys she has worked with, the lack of quality and love. She is dressed as Santa continues as a killing spell continues. It is also a powerful word because only 3 people are killed without the need for special effects. There is no tension, no excitement, no evidence. An exception is this: Jeffrey DeMunn is here. He plays Tom Hanks as one of the guards at the classic "The Green Mile." He must still kick himself to accept his role in these days. He is the only person who can actually act, and his supporting role is better than the main one. (which is not bad, but you're not good if you're shaded by a little supportive character). And what is this strange end? (you must see it, believe it). "Christmas Evil" is instantly boring, nothing is missing and artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. Want to see a real Christmas slasher, look at all the time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
