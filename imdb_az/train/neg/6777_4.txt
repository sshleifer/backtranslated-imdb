When I first looked at OPERATION PETTICOAT, this movie was very similar, but I really did not like it. Both were removed only a few years, starred by Cary Grant and both were World War II. But the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. FOR KISS, it looked like a cheaper movie - poor writing, small energy, and some extensive performances - even as compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least this is the fault of Jayne Mansfield. The combination of mature abilities and limited functionality resembles this A-budget movie when it comes to the 3rd degree studio. There was no chemistry and energy in pairing with Cary Grant - the actor was generally loved for grace and class. It's like pairing with Sir Lawrence Olivier and Marjorie Main.
