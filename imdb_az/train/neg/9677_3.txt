I read somewhere that this movie should have been a comedy. When I saw him, I could say something. This is the meaning of this film. dialogue was superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be the next ideas, and despite all the nudity and intended sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... I had to think of what it was all about! the title was a fun (if it is politically wrong) to be the basis for a comedy. Instead, we treat cheap, amateur, unfinished sketches, and immorality and strangers. If I want, I'll buy a grace copy cd.
