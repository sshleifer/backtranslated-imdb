Ordinary Sci-Fi Channel original picture. It's a bit strange, but not so much. USS underwater nuclear power. Jimmy Carter is a deep mission under heavy ice ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super loaded electric winds. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) is thinking of communicating with monsters, but for uncertain reasons, he can not afford much. Among the crew are David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. If the Eels / Monsters were not very cartoon, this movie would be a bit better.
