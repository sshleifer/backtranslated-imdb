What to start ... If this movie were a dark comedy, I would say FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately, for me, and everyone for free time and spare parts (which I paid for it was from Wal-Mart), this movie meant being a tension. Some THRILL was watching Anne Wilkes' bad behavior from Kirkland's Misery sans snowy forest area. If you want a good laugh, I love this movie on a rainy Friday night with some friends. <br /> <br /> We'll talk about some movies. <br /> <br /> I'll also mention that, But Wow ... I WOW! The little boy played by Vincent Berry was the only man in the entire film. The only reason I could give 3 stars is to give me something.
