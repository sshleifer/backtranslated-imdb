Strangely enough, there is a high degree of tolerance, but obviously films have gone so strangely that it will hurt your brain so far. This is a movie. It is impossible to try to understand, and I think the film is best understood when it comes to medication - it is inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very cute Japanese animation that combines with a cat. But in blue, there are things that are wrapped around and sometimes disturbed - it makes me wonder if I lose something. But even if so, why we are smart, defective, puking, illuminate animals and so on. The pictures of a magic game that had to do with splitting had to be treated. All this was really casual and horrible. Amazing, I do not know, some see it as genius. I just can not get it.
