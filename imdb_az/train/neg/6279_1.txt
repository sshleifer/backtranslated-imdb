I'm not sure what the writer is trying to do to convey it to others, but usually you will get the most questions at the end of the movies, but you asked in the movie: "What happened and took over for 1 hour and 20 minutes!" /> <br /> Spoiler Starts__ <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the film all of which have not been clarified, and you never knew how it happened or why it happened or did not happen, but the main character was not even the main character, and at the end of the film was finally the mother of all the dreams but unfortunately the film will end in 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I took this movie for $ 10 and then threw it in. Do not waste your time. I really hope that something like this happens again. I am.
