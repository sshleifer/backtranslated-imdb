I'm a big curtain of the Spaghetti West genre, and I love most of the usual ones. Philosophy Director Demofilo Fidani is known for its cheapest, most terrible and best, best-selling contribution. Fidan's films were often too weak, and his talent was so limited that he often tried to sell films by adding the names of the famous Spaghetti West, such as "Sartana", "Django". In 1971, in the special case "Giù La Testa ... Hombre", he named Sergio Leono's "Giu La Testa" (aka "Duck You Sucker") and added 'Hombre'. The film is about a variety of themes ("Death Fistful", "Western Story" ...), which I personally have received under the name of "Adios Companeros", this film can be said with another Fidane film. This area is weak is a guy called Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and following him. "The leading activity carried out by Jeff Cameron is not very convincing, states that these two opponent wings Jack Bets is not as good as Butch Cassidy B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell has always been a worthwhile attempt, and although he is probably not a very good actor, I've found Spaghetti West's performances quite comic and original, and there is really a very funny and original thing about Fidan's films ("Giù La Testa ... Hombre" - a great Klaus Kinski plays a priest! I could imagine Kinski in any role, but this film before you see I would never have guessed that no-one threw it as a priest, though Kinski was a little bigger, though it was a bigger scene, it's probably just a good scene. Something more interesting about this film, the legendary director and sleaze made cinematography of King Joe D'Amato. <br /> <br /> "Giù La Testa ... Hombre" is a cheap, dirty film, but still has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti West enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if not, you should never forget this movie or just to see if Kinski plays a priest. 3/10
