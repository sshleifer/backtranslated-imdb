Kirstie Alley looks a bit gentle, but with a bit of a MacGuyver-looking, bleached blonde hair, and everyone is in this confusion. The film focuses on an elderly woman (50!), Who sends her younger son to the writer to write about her age as a writer who can not get her scenario due to discrimination. It is not a good idea, but a very good film, with a bad, moving dialogue, and a ridiculous plot. For Kirstin's character, there is another question about the writer, and the reason is a mystery. The actor, describing Kirstin's brother, was so frightened and terrified that watching the scene was torture. What about this movie? Avoid this.
