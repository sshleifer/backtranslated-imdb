This show destroys dull, bare, and actually different things to make it "original". First: The animation is very dirty ... Johnny's ugly ... and everyone's heartfelt. Gemini looks like teenage desserts from "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny is an almost intelligent man Dee Dee (also called "Dexter Lab."). Secondly: The fields ... are painfully naked and difficult to follow. Gags is fragile and nothing makes me laugh a bit ... especially trying to be funny. I've only seen two episodes, but they just left me. <br /> Thirdly: The theme of the whole theme is Green Day's "American Idiot". I'm not a big fan of that band, and I see that it's really dumb that they'll pull the same opening melody and then change it to make it so sensitive. At this point ... it's a big ugly pit. 1/10
