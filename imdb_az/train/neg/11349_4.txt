In fact, this was a lie, Shrek 3-D really was the first 3D animated movie. I bought the DVD three years ago. Bug's Life did not do it too? I think it was in Disneyworld inside this tree, so I said they used to go and use the logo as it is. Also, Shrek was a motion simulator at 3d Universal Studios. They still have to think of it as a movie because a "theater" also appears and you can get it for a DVD. The movie was cute, at least small flyes. I liked the IQ. I accept the animation, we did a deed from filmmaking alone, with only one exercise and the back adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
