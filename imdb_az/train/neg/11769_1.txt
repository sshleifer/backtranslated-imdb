Someone owes an apology to Ang Li. In fact, many people do this. And I'll start. I did not care about Ang Lee movie Hulk due to bad thoughts that were not in the immediate future. Even premium cable channels rarely showed it. Finally, I decided to look at the US network yesterday and wow ... <br /> <br /> ANG LEADS FOR LEE'S RIGHTS AND MORE! I almost did not do it through Ang Lee Hulk. Eric told me was unusual, Nick Nolte was terrific, Sam Elliott was different (and it's no fun, he's a typical cool character). In fact, I think Eric honestly chose me, because it's easy to imitate a non-descriptive face with computer graphics - and Ang Lee Hulk resembles Bruce Banner in his frustrated case. While fighting Hulk mutant poodle, I was prepared to accept Hulk as the worst super-movie ever. But then something happened. About 3/4 of this awesome movie was not really exciting and courageous - with logically convincing - M1 tanks and Comanche desert helicopters, then launching the F22 Raptoru in the Stratosphere, just beginning from a military base in the military base with Hulk, only on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best action segments developed for a superhero movie. And I want to say that CGI was very good. Hulk was not completely convincing. But non-superhero action films did not require more suspicion than most required. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last thing that Bruce Banner's father was doing was breaking his father was really stupid, but the previous long series of action put Iron Man short of heroes. . And in general, apart from the animated mutant dogs, he actually tried to convince that he really was really in his environment and really looks like CGI at Hulk. Of course, it was better than expected <br /> <br /> Ok, but what do you say about the incredible Hulk? What do you think? It is very boring! There are several performances by Hulk and there is something here - CGI is horrible in this movie. Perhaps in Ang Lee's version, Hulk was sometimes fake and looked at others in cartoons - but there were also convincing moments. The incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. There was a skin tone and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer was created. It was really unhappy. Lighting, environment and facial features did not look older than Ang Lee for over 5 years, looked at the age of 10. And there is no excuse for this. <br /> <br /> The writer and director of this film could not be any director, actor or cinematographer. Ang Lee's "failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. Generally, it is so sensitive that the faux is in a dimly lit dimension. The interest in love is unbelievable (I have to give Liv Tyler credit because it's more emotional than Jennifer Connelly). Tim Blake Nelson, although only a few minutes of film, is almost like Nick Nolte. Hulk is, of course, less than Ang Lee's version of this movie. Incredible Hulk was a little faster paced, but nothing is too much value for what really does not happen. Yes, unhappiness is a fraud that looks like Hulk. It's really more interesting as a man like a monster. <br /> <br /> We can say that Ang Lee's version is better: if I have the opportunity to see Ang Lee's version again, I can sit down to see good activity segments or we'll try to make a little more it is best to move quickly to good parts). However, the incredible Hulk will never be seen again; there is no single scene twice. It really is under superhero movie piles. This animated film CGI is an insult to the viewers - at least in Ang Lee's version, it seems to be trying to be a realist (except, of course, with a great poodle). <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, filmmakers want to wipe out bad feelings about Ang Lee Hulk by doing the same movie. <br /> <br /> Edvard Norton is a loan that appears to be moving away from this movie.
