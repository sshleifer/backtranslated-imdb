Steve Carpenter can not make fear movies. Above all, casting for this movie was very wrong. The only good part was the girl with a hot brown hair from Buffy Vampire Slayer. No part of these films (generally a major part of a horror movie), no action, no action, no tension (basic component). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but it is so sad and sad that it is sad. There were a few sections that thought to be funny (continued with teenage horror / comedy films) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R, I did not pay attention and realized that it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie, if you like, I'll be back in the last year. This is the only one who can find the movie even from afar. Seriously, this is Steve Carpenter for you, do not let horror movies. This movie looks like the Scream Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
