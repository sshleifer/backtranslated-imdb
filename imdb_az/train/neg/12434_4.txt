Was it an exciting and funny comedy written by John Hughes in 1987, directing his directors, trains, and cars? It's the best thing. Ten years later, she re-launches the 'Homework Only' composition, which she does not join other films, but is the second and second to the unequal and sadistic. Four crooks ?? That's right, four! One of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, to present this revolutionary change to the series! ?? The new baby is less attractive than the puppet, with electrochemically wounded metal barrels, with barbells and painted with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha. From the first two films, it would be almost surprising that all the major players would go on to stop fossilising the same old rhythms in Hughes, but that even came just to 'Home Alone 4'.
