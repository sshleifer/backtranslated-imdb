Question: How does the bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration? <br /> <br /> Yes, in the early 1990s, we returned after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the floods of subsequent migrants in the European Union. There is a better way to deal with the topic: an exaggerated middle-class journalist, an alienated high-ranking politician, wealthy spouse away from existence, and so on. immigrants require political asylum in the village of Greece, which is not known in the vicinity of the border. In my opinion, Angelopoulos, while dealing with the current challenges, may be showing some public information. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the reason why some of the officers of the rank-and-file army curses the fate of the officer sent to study in London. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can not be bad Angelopoulos is a master of cinema art? It's wrong. From this perspective, at this point in artificial, artificial way, as a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual recommendations are coming out: blurry windows, fuzzy lights, a strange wedding, walking along the river and people with yellow coats. Also, Mastroianni places a new place for the best performance of the most insomnia. Do not really care. Go for her early movies.
