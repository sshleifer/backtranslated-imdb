I really need to watch a good movie closely, because it looks like every other entry or I'm abusive. But my story tells me I should not lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything that happens to give big green bananas. Never thought I was seeing a movie as if it were a heat. Al Pacino does not work in this movie: it poses. There are many scenes of his character, the driver of a racing car that looks at the camera. He is very terrible. It's as bad as Marte Keller. These two must be in love, and there is simply no chemistry. Sidney Pollack directed this movie? There is no genius behind Tootsie. O Eyes Is the same person who rejoices for the Big Shot? I hardly believe him. Make yourself a horrible movie experience. Run, do not go away from Bobby Deerfield.
