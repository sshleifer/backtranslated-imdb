This movie makes a few mistakes. Several Spanish actors and Spanish speaking Spanish actors in Spain. The 'Spaniards' are good in English, but the way of action is all that makes them boring. dialogue through the entire script is very weak; it can be a Spanish inscription, but the wrong translation, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that they are famous Spanish actors who are forced to speak English, but they are not on the flop. you will understand the film in the first 5 minutes, and it is so miserable. The rest are just bad. time loss, the UN's many required fields. That was one of the Baldwin's.
