The Holy One is afraid of all the might of His power. This movie was very bad, and I thought I was a drug. In a bad way ... The detective character is the poorest thing I've seen for a while. This film was more than G-Strings's leader, IMHO (this is a real movie). The majority of the film was seen on a terrible green screen. My favorite feeling was in shipping and you can say that you do not have a horse. They are escaping alien monsters and going about the same speed as a fast jog. Then, a ridiculous CG horse jumps to a remote shot. And in general, the CG will be sub-par, after the 1992 Mind Eye. So come, really. They felt like a terrible episode of Hercules, only to save his day without Kevin Sorbo. The worst. Movie. Ever.
