There were very few moments in my life, and I was depressed and depressed. <br /> <br /> One of those sitting with Rancid Aluminum was one of them. There was no premiere (even the stars did not want to attend) and there were no comments in the magazines. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was sitting in the movie was hoping to keep some of my dreams. <br /> <br /> Nothing has been explained in the film. The story was meaningless. When it came to the film's head, then when I looked at my growing hopelessness, I was delighted that I was not really moistened with joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film is hanged for this cruelty. <br /> <br /> Some positive trends, mostly flawless humor moments. <br /> <br /> For instance, for some reason, the scene he needed to relax in a toilet seat spoke to his next cabinet to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> Rancid Aluminum: Sadists, for those who want to torture themselves only for the outside and the regressives.
