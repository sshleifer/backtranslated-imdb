I chose "dead creatures" because I thought "28 days" or such a zombie movie ... but not at all. It is not even a fright film. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who are infected by a strange virus to eat human flesh. <br /> <br /> This trick is a series of cannibalism scenes ... <br /> <br /> A very bad movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> - ------------- ---
