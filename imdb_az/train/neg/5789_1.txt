My husband and I really had great hopes for this movie, but that was a big disappointment. This was the native American version of Mr. Magu. A miserable father who fails everything, like fishing, hunting, and wild fantasy of your family. Her "visas" are not only ridiculous, but she often begens her son about various open things. Words can not express how bad this film is. Children and their spouses are very realistic in their film. Do not worry ... they do not want to rely on others, but they make you stupid. I do not know how to get these prizes. Save your dollar is not worth the rent.
