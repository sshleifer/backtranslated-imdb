Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the movie theater to watch this unsuspective film. <br /> <br /> The purpose of the film is based on two things: <br /> 1) Ethnic appearance: As in most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning about 2 or 3 Asian culture. But, unfortunately, this is not enough. Knowing the names of birds and other foods is a way of understanding a culture. For example, shaving is a sign of clean life in Asia, but everyone tries to stop it. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok var) and their cultural forms, beliefs and approaches are quite different from other Arab countries. The main difference between East and West is that we are not ethnocentric. So, we do not judge people after the first question about our life as the father figure, as in the whole film. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is nothing to say about it. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are propagandizing the film in a black humor genre. Follow Dr.Strangelove to understand the meaning of black humor. A black space should reflect the truth and direct viewers to this funny part. Where is the truth? What does the film mean?
