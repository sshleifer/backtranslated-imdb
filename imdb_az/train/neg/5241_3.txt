Indeed, I'm a little surprised to see so many positive reviews, which is the main reason I decided to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie from the boy. <br /> <br /> I'm totally surprised at this movie - it's nudity and all the little children, such as a child's film, without curse and cursing. <br /> <br /> Voting: The story about two children has been sent to the elder brother program. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> They are not a role model, or something else to serve their time for what they do. The story is much anticipated (though expected) and humor is naked. And we've already seen in many other films (like Sasquatch Gang?) Playing the same characters (Mc Lovin '). I think I smile three times and almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> After casting a script, casting was okay. And this kind of game is expected when you watch the movie. And in the direction, what can you expect? This is the same person who brought us Hot Hot American Summer, and this is also a film. <br /> <br /> As long as, in general, no part was felt, but I spent a lot of time. Only naked scenes appear to be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bank: Elizabeth Bank <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <strong> Caucasian>
