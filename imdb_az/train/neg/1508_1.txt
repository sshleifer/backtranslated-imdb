I watched this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what's going on in my seat. Maybe, I expected Gere to get a little bit at the end of the movie, but it did not cost anything to the screen. The story is a foolish excuse to open fire after captivity and torture. The film does not have a character who does something like real life. The salient "style" is probably based on small slides, mini flashbacks and overprints to weight this vapid structure of a group of sadists, probably working for many years, and the victim of the SURPRISE leader is the "victim" of a murdered murderer. I do not see how Buddhist is dealing with Gere, this fierce, sexually debris.
