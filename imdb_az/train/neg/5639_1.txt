I saw this movie after listening to rave reviews on Israel's Haifa Film Festival today, but critics just breasted Willem Defoe and his wife (director) at the festival. It is undoubtedly the slowest movie I've ever seen with numerous, meaningless, long-lasting scenes of nothing. In addition to Defoe, in a decent film, two and a half men went into action, and Dude's wife, Giada, was terrifying in a ridiculous situation (outside of me where a seller dropped a piece of bread). This film is an abstract and quite intriguing with a bare attempt on the edge of the wall. The only scene that hurt all kinds of reaction in the meeting was strange, and it just came from anywhere to add a shock to the space of this movie. We apologize for being so tough, but this is really a waste of time and money. So far, thank you for the good cinema, but the film is not worth the time for this movie.
