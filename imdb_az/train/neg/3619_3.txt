<br /> <br /> Some guys have a small boy (Jake) thinking he is a zombie in his cabinet and that his parents are always fighting. <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... suddenly, Jake <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> Decide when it's time to make a movie, whether it's a tension or a drama! Films like a drama can be watched. Parents divorce and argue as they do in real life. And then we have Jake with the wardrobe that's completely destroyed in the entire movie! <br /> <br /> I was planning to see a similar movie BOOGEYMAN and instead of looking at a drama with a trivial strain of spots. <br /> <br /> Only 10 to 3 for good playing parents and elegant dialogues. As for Jake's shooting, do not just see them.
