This movie was called Need For Speed ​​- The Movie. There are so many hottest cars and beautiful women and almost no space for For Speed ​​because they do not play games. This is the perfect application for Redline. One of the A-level movies was about cars. The actor was like compulsory and scenarios, the best of the place was wrong and it was not dry. I really watched this movie to see how bad it would be and it would have been worse though it was pretty bad. And at least it was fun. Only Eddie Griffin showed Enzo'yu collapsing in the film. Do not pay for all this, do not go out to see it, but if you're on Showtime or HBO and nothing else, this is a good release.
