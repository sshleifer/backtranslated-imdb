You really regard this movie as a fantastic movie, a horror, or a comedy. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the movie (and quite trustworthy) shows clearly what the actors are doing and that the script is done with fire. Obviously, the wardrobe in his closet was added because his wife was not intimidated - it was even nice, and they thought they needed something more effective; <br /> <br /> The film's director clearly shows Joshua's career as a writer and writer; but both of them were really bad. There is also a guy who goes to the actors, supports and supports them. <br /> <br /> The best success of "Brain of the Dead" is its shortest time.
