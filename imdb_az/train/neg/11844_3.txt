Everyone who has jazz, clothes for the 1920s, Charleston and ultra swanky yachts (like all our castes) in the 1920s wants to love this movie. However, it is a sad fact that they all have. The area is similar and clear, the majority are terrific or play on the other side of the Persian, and the impression of the mirrors and the smoke are very small when it is all over. This is a nice filthy movie.
