This movie has been a coaching workpiece for the Coppola family. There is no information on whether the "A" or the "B" is western. I would like to say that the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's salutation. <br /> <br /> <strong> William Boyd </ strong> <br /> <br /> The two-pin pearl-geared hero, the trusty steed ("C'mon Thunder") in the smart hook, all black bearded beard, troubled hero, distressed rancher, cowardly sheriff, bad guys from above, and so on. <br /> <br /> Except for a few cases, the player is exhausted from the Jacobs Canutt Acting School. Like Kris Lybbert (who?) And like Louis Schweibert (who?), 30 people like Proud would have been at home more at Row quickie. <br /> <br /> <strong > Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine mode sequence? Do we believe that the character of the janitor is a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? <br /> <br /> In this film, which has a great lover from every western genre, I have tried to find some talented qualities. The cinematography was very good and the settings seemed very reliable. <br /> <br /> If the producers are preparing to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might have given an idea to describe it as it was written first. <br /> <br /> What else could I say, but my brother, Thunder.
