It's not a good movie, but it's not a stinker. <br /> <br /> My GF and I thought this movie (I think) here is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> br /> Without taking into account the trash, what really happened: a group of schoolmates go to rave a night. Cassie and Sean, all in all, fall into a traffic accident. This is a simple cut version. (True, Sean said I was transported with me) <br /> <br /> After the accident, Cassie slept until the end of the film, after staying between life and death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cassie's mind and soul are the other souls of the accident (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 Weird and Jude) after interconnection, moves along with pictures enriched with the mind (Sean, everything in school and everything around it). The spirits continue to do what they have to say: Annie, a weird strange, 2 strange killer (from the opening of the scene), Father Jude still helps people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After Cassie's death, the long haul showed many pictures (many of them are my GF and still can not be closed), but it's down to all of them . <br /> <br /> In the end Cassie wakes in the hospital after a while dead. He's his family and Sean. This is a repeat reality. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a bit of extra spice to confuse us again by showing a little bit of sleep in the drowned wheelchair. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is really a nightmare, and he's still in a traumatic experience with John. <br /> <br /> Because of space constraints, we did not cover everything, <br /> <br /> If you like, e-mail us. <br /> <br />
