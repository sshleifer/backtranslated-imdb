This is a film that men think they are thinking of love. No woman explains a nightly sexual welcome and announces her a love story. <br /> <br /> Only three of the ten monologues were really in the line of truth. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the movie to be better, and I did a bit, but it was not good enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept and I did not want to be good, but I never succeeded. Maybe they would really work if they liked stories.
