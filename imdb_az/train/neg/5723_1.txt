Everyone who says that he is better than the host speaks in full swing, and I believe that I am not a fan of the Hostel, but it's just ridiculous. It's a film that directly focuses on DVDs, direct DVDs, and your time is frustrating, and I do not believe in many of these films and still do not see a decent thing. 80's video nasties, gore and horror movies have been made with the heart and soul of the director who had no budget, but a great story and new ideas, and most importantly to say the least. Now they only try to deceive people who are waiting for Blockbuster in a single copy, they do not stop people and then believe that these films will continue to appear. There are so many flawed ideas in this movie, but it's not so terrible that the player is totally unconvincing and the noise is convincing to these beggars. It's absolutely nothing to spend as long as you do a research to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. The best / worst part of the film is that when a woman's character is showing someone the gun, and if she is threatened to shoot them if not withdrawn, you can even see that she does not just close the trigger by holding her finger. do not hold. Definitely a joke.
