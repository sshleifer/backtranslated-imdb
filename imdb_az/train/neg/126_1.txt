"I am Strange: Yellow" is a pile of bib and ambitious steam. What is your political outlook because this movie can not be seriously attracted to any level? When it comes to claiming that frontal men's nakedness is an automatic NC-17, this is not true. I saw R-rated movies with men's nakedness. If they offer, they only offer ideas several times, but R-rated films are rarely fed with vulvalar and whipping labia? They are no longer because they are not. It's the same thing for those malicious cable shows: breeze, but not a clitoris in sight, shakes. And Brown's Bunny's ambitious indie movies that Vincent Gallo's poisonous johnson site treats, but is not a pink mark on Chloe Sevigny. In the nonsensical issue, the dual standard (or contradictory) mentality must be considered anatomically distinction between men and women: the actresses do not have sexual organs when it is naked and can not be called the same person. In fact, in general, you will not compare American sexual organs with pornography and obvious eroticism in anything. This alleged double standard is less dual than the ability of women to lose their cultural ability in the body.
