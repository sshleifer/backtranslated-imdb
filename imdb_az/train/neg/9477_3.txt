It was most god had to be one of the terrible wrestlemanias and only survived with 2 games. Heavyweight match between Edge and Mick Foley, also against Shaun Michaels with Vince McMahon. The incident between Cena and Triple H was a complete washout, and I was nearly asleep to be honest, as it was inactive, the tent match was not worth the look of Undertaker, and Boogie Man and Booker T were a joke. If you really are a great admirer of WWE and run away from WWF and Wrestlemania's 17th and 19th, you probably will love it. But I've seen that Wrestlemania finds as much as she wants.
