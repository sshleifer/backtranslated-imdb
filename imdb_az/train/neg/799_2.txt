In some ways, the concept behind the storyline was an incredibly interesting mix of some typical movie types. However, no point in this film was so clear that it was not worthy of drawing away. <br /> <br /> The writer, except for the other films, has cliche just like something that can replace lines. actual characters. Actors did not help the issues. No chemistry. In my opinion, it is necessary to develop such a charm that these are just the main elements of these stories. However, writers did not work hard to develop chemistry. Of course, they seem to be an open question whether they are both attractive and attractive to each other. <br /> <br /> Loyal Turner's character shows that Sabato developed very quickly and was not for any reason. Sabato's character is likely to be an unprecedented doctor who does not meet the rules. Think about the character of Jeff Goldblum on "Independence Day". Generally, such a character must show some kind of talent and glow. Sabata has no character. The magic of eight magic balls is just crazy and Cassandra with prophetic abilities. <br /> <br /> The dead scenes are funny. Each actor has worked hard to show the pain he has given them. Symptoms, like Peter Gabriel since the 80's, seemed to be a bad claymation like this video.
