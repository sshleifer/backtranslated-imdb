I'm a young pastor's wife and a few young people to see this movie. We tried to tell them an hour. They could not get it and I did not like it. It is as ridiculous as laughable, based on a conception of the world's three largest religions (the Bible's Code, the Torah Code, and the Law in the Qur'an). It's not a step for Christians in this art, it's a step for those who believe in our brains.
