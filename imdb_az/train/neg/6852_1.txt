This movie is truly incredible. I've seen very cheap garbage films, especially many 'Full Moon'-Pictures', but 'Dollman' is really hard. Very funny story, always with parody edge actors and special effects! How can you talk to them? It's really a bad movie, but it's also one of the funniest ones. If you are a fan of bad movies to smile, you should see it. And do not miss 'Dollman vs Demonic Toys', it's really funnier and filthy.
