Strangely, almost all reviewers are quite positive about this movie. Since 1975, there are Chamberlain and Curtis in it, and why do you donate too many bad behavior and ways to their offspring? <br /> <br /> Can some people make scenarios because they read this book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think the movie is a problem, the audience does not care to read the book). <br /> Or is it subconsciously angry that English-speaking actors are trying to act as their French counterparts?
