haha! you really need to smile and smile when you create the whole way through this movie. I think I can say something like me. I think the film itself is a psychological test, or I'm thinking of taking you somewhere like a drug. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical work, tractacus (sp?), He said that it was meaningless and useless, but when you read it, he took you to a new level as a ladder and then toss things out and see things with clarity and true understanding. I think this movie is the same. <br /> <br /> As a film, it's undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen so rarely. First of all, this snipes. I liked watching this man's different cinema donkeys. I suffered through a few vulnerable people. But you know, if you know that the film will be shot, you will not doubt that you can be as bad as it is. it's fun. I want to say that these are snipes. you know it might be good, but if it's okay, right? smile <br /> <br /> Thus, at each level, this is a complete dissatisfaction, a clear inaccuracies. but the appeal to the profession is dead and clear, but it is so weak to be funny. This movie does not have at least an interesting character. sounds like sounds like pieces of Bourne's personality-type movies are just wrong, to accomplish all the things. <br /> <br /> True, though it may look close to background music, it's a fantastic way to do it. <br /> <br /> Then, all the scenes in the black field of the entire field, because the heroes are so straightforward that you are not really concerned about what will happen, but whatever happens, if someone is killed, you tell yourself, did not you? another? how scary scenes, rapidly flashing scenes in a frostlight, for a long time. Be sure to throw this shot. When you are tough and your eyes can not handle it, they kill you in dark places where you have never seen them happen. and do not allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> I went in a few times, but I kept all of this movie. and there is something that you can follow if it does not involve your mind at any level, so there is something that you can effectively get into the zone and begins to think about your life; <br /> <br /> This is the true magic of the movie.
