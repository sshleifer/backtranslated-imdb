Marlon Brando did not have to work long after it was released. His performance as "Shawq" is the worst of his career, and this is what he means. He is not content. Instead, she is just a strange fashion and enjoys her embarrassing elegance. The climax on the Brando toilet is the worst, most funny moment in film history. <br /> <br /> Therefore, as we are witnessing to someone else's toilet, it's hard to believe we're watching the same actor in The Streetcar Named Desire, The Waterfront, and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> Why is Marlon doing so in the following years? Was he ill at work? Did he want to have a totally heartbreaking rebellion? I know, we will never know. <br /> <br /> There's an interesting thing about what's bad in this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at veteran Donald Sutherland, who is struggling to convict betrayal lines for agreeing to take part in the note in this travesty.
