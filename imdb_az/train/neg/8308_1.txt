Entertainment Tonight has been on top of the hill for the last few years, but last night (August 17, 2006), they have become somewhat weak. <br /> <br /> Last night, JonBenet's Ramsey's body was placed in the right photo to try to hide his publications ... "Images from what you did not see before". The two photographs were graphic and very uncomfortable. Someone was on the face and on the head and neck, and you see the corpse used to drown his neck and whip his face. That was terrible, I did not believe. How does relationship with Hollywood Entertainment relate to remote ANYTHING? Nothing! They lowered their dignity and values ​​to a new level .... and it shows. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> </ font> </ font>
