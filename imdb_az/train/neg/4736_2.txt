Film is worth 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (I'm sorry to be biased, I think the beautiful girl is the only one) and Azumi is shorter than 0.5. Seated in Azumi 1 and 2 in the 1st year. I'm proud to sit with myself. <br /> <br /> Allows you to talk about the extra points of the movie. Girl. Uetoes the Moon is beautiful. You have to get rid of all the movies. Actually, the main character was male, but I'm sure most people (including me) would not touch the film. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about negative points. First, it is a real draggy with a very fast and repetitive scenes. Nazi and Azumi scenes come back. Shooting looks even more dramatically. Typical Japanese drama flashbacks and this movie is very popular. Secondly, film history is very unrealistic in one space. I do not care for films that are not real. But this movie resembles a poor way of showing creativity by throwing ninjas acting like a bear and a spider knot ... Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting, but it reminds Shinobi. Moreover, what impacts to the description of "i-don't-know", the director is dying with the shades of blood in people's eyes (literally) films ... people who are not doing their heads cut off ... and so on and so on. ... Most of these are the show. Anime effect is strong in this movie. Very low performance. Third, Azumi should be an assassin. She looks more like a man's army for me, she is the only woman. I do not think that the assassins in the army camps were charged. By the end of Azumi 1, I felt that Kiyomasa was "assassinated-loved" when Kato was killed. Only the next movie was delicate in both films. A land plot that has no development and no surprises in any way.
