I'm working as a hotel worker in Washington and take my word, Michael J. Fox- No real thing about the character he's playing # 1, we just do not go with theater tickets and $ 100 papers! # 2 If I used a room for no "tasting taste" to anyone, I would be thrown to the ground! The organization that belongs to me (Les Clefs d'Or) has very strong standards of ethics and behavior. Like the # 3 Doug, taking the gold emblem and taking it to another employee, at the end of the film, it was like a concept - we also get those keys and it's a badge that allows them to wear the honor and information. There is a whole application and verification process to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie is a concierge's unsuccessful perception, nothing to destroy, but only a paran√°f. In short, our organization does not hurt. I welcome any comments.
