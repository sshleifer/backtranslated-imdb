When will the patient stop? I do not want to see another version of Christmas Carols again. The film continues to shoot the same film, falls on each other, and then tries to make the film better, but it's not just a good story. Moral, old, conservative happy thinking. People learn. Many different versions of this movie prove that we are not.
