I love munna bhai MBBS, but the "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life. And have these watermarks been a taste for wat wat movie viewers that really admired me for their high ratings? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> a man in the world comes out? <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2 (2 stars for 15 minutes for a good start)
