I was surprised by the "Meow of the Cat", a few scenes that inspire intelligent dialogue and some beautiful scenery. Eddie Izzard is more effective than expected as Chaplin (thanks to a perfect haircut and makeup job by a number of talented designers in a short time); Joanna Lumley is as stunning as the writer Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst won Marion Davies (although films will never use the real life spots). However, these elements do not add a successful whole. The scenario is similar to that of a particular scene - meetings between Davies and Chaplin have been specially well-designed - but not great in the big picture. You do not need to have a few small characters and do not follow it sequentially. The main complex is full of non-miraculousness (eg Thomas Ince is a good idea to say what Hearste really does not want to hear). And party scenes are recurring and tedious. I would like to think that Hearst's yacht is more fun than a picnic. Davies is characterized as a bubbly Flapper type that is not really accurate, and the views of the scriptwriter Chaplin and his love are incredible. Strangely enough, Bogdanovich, who was associated with the 30s in the "Paper Month", has no similarity to Twenties. The perfect suit designer just insisted on using black and cream, which has a very artificial appearance on party guests and plays most stereotypical songs of the time (eg "Yes, No Bans!"). Hearst everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It appears that actors are in a ten-minute dance class before the scene is over. <br /> <br /> Silent film stars can make exciting films, but I'm sure this is not the time.
