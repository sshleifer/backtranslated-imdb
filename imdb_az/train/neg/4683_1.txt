An old underwater boat was one of the worst underwater films I've ever seen. First and foremost, any accusation in the US Navy, especially in the Nuclear Safety Trident Underwater Camp, can not be considered. These men are the best and are devoted to their mission. Their responsibility is terrible and they carry it very seriously, from Captain to the smallest crew member. I did not share a ship's crew between the Captain and the Executive Officer. The Executive Officer, who acted as Denzel Washington's character, was dismissed from his duties and the Court Martialed, then bent over from the Navy. It's no surprise that the Navy refuses to send a technical consultant to help with this film. Finally, any member of the submarine crew would have been seriously reprimanded by improving the amount of noise in the boat. Submarines learn early in their career to be as calmer as possible to prevent their detection. They do not beat the doors and even quietly talk, and at first they can not wear soft shoes. I was amazed at how quickly the crew demonstrated. High music never collapsed. Actually know the description of the underwater life does not really sell movie tickets, but it's at the top of the point of becoming ridiculous. I do not recommend this movie to everyone.
