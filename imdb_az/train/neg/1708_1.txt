Okay, there's really nothing to talk about in this movie: I have seen more than 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of them are scary movies. When I choose the best I'm having difficulty (I can tell you I'm telling you that George A. Romero's death is DAWN) is the worst horror film ever seen without Todd Sheets's ZOMBIE BLOODBATH absolute. <br /> <br /> Simply, there is nothing positive to say about this movie. Behavior, dialogue, leadership, makeup, music ... Every aspect of this film is below just what can be perceived, and it thinks it's not even left to my mind. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a companion to a horror or zombie movie, do not waste time taking into account my warnings and taking it to a stop. There is no pleasure to watch it. As you can see, you will not smile any loyalty ... Trust me. Please.
