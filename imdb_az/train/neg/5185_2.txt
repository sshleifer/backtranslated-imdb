<br /> <br /> The scenario and dialogue are poorly written, the direction is undeniable, and the boundaries that move on hammy. This film is specifically designed for the Rang De Basanti crowd, but it does not even have an element <br /> <br /> It is associated with a well-functioning, well-directed and powerful public message, but never promoted an event that has not been shown, but demonstrated. <br /> <br /> Like a scene taken by Halla Bol, relative to the nearest kingdom, taking an epileptic when the heroine of the prostitution is riding on the Persian rug and jumping on his mentor to a truck! All of this could have been the case when films falling down in the 80's and filming such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante were pretty hits, but the film was delayed and thoughtful. <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a talented director, and I understand that he wants to give a public message in every movie, but maybe he just can not do it! He tries to listen to the sermons without care, just as he does in the intelligence of the audience to understand what he wants to say. Perhaps he should just focus on entertainment and send his public messages to Rakesh Mehras and Aamir Khan. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with everything I want you to agree, you will agree that Rang De Basanti is much better and Mr. Santoshi has left industrial consciousness Om Shanti Om. Industry bashing? Santoshi portrays the industry as a burial dwelling that is joyfully buried with a star called Sania, where he is returning to the industry, his place of restlessness, and the hero. There are some people who think these parts will show the true face of the industry. <br /> <br /> Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In general, raise your voices against such films and do not waste your money for this bomb. <br /> <br /> * Exit ****.
