I appreciate the need to work for unknown "horror" films, but at least a number of relevant actors should hire them. Sergeant considers his monotone guilty of using any line in the bulldozer. However, let's avoid it, the lines are not really important. There is not a really well-known structure, so most of the writings contain f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and many other bad words that have the correct dialogue. <br /> <br /> Like the Story, in most cases it is a random occurrence and death, with several tornadoes worthy of "surprises". It's not just that, but there are a few crazy holes and severity errors (Why are they going there? Do not have any guns? Did not you die?) So the whole movie is so <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
