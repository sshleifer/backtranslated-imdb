<br /> <br /> I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, and the great doctor Uwe Boll also attended. <br /> <br /> The film is just too bad. And no, the usual Uwe Boll is not so bad, really fun, it's just bad. The conspiracy is linked to a man who has a terrible life (due to past court records), will not be able to find a job and his wife with a 900-pound betrayal. This man is a religious leader with a plan to steal a toy truck that contains a bird flu virus. <br /> <br /> Al-Qaeda also has designs to steal toys, and only two hours below will be completely incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Acting is scary (Dave Foley,), jokes are not above the children in the chest and slowly move people to a poo. <br /> <br /> "Aircraft!" Think, but it was done by the creators of South Park and without any joke.
