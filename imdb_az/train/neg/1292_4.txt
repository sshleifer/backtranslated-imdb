Okay, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and I was very surprised. I know where filmmakers come from and that the two sides do not differ in this fight, the individuals lost in the battle, (well, that's my probability, probably = ^ _ ^ =) in any way. I've watched a lot of really long movies, but it simply could not bring myself to care for any characters just because I was dragged and on and about .. basically. I just thought ... who cares? I also found the role of a dead pistol and the tension in the dialogue. I understand it was the 1800s and it was all, but most of the conversations seemed quite unnatural. <br /> <br /> "Romanticism" in her life says that most of the film has no feeling, saying, "I was a young boy and I was not supported by anything else." you are a girl, but I do not think so romantic and I still feel that I'm in love with these people ... well, I think it's all the same fear of all around us, and I'm one of two good friends <br /> <br /> Well, Daniel Holt is the only one I really liked for, and I'm not sure if he's going to do it for some reason, but it's just frozen. Sue Lee was good ... I did not love Jake, but she was a bit ... meaningless, in my opinion.Jack Bull did not care for me, and just except the poor normal people who mowed down the right and left, I'm pretty sure you almost hate anyone else. * It was pretty graphic, and the whole "war horror" thing was low, but with the same topic yes I saw many other films, it was better seen (Patriot liked, for example, a little emotional manipulative) But, as I have already said, I am kinship. What can I say? :)
