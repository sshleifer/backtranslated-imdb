This movie was so frustrating to me. While on my way, I wanted to surprise the "scientists" and unofficial movie producers. Very, very painful to sit. The worst way is sophomoric and ambitious. Less information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory loses a new horse at sh * t. The worst sinners were Ramtha and Joseph Dippenza's charlatan wagons. Mr. Dispenza clearly states that most people lead a mediocre life and, on the other hand, live at a high level. The ideas and attitudes that I mainly agreed to were presented in such a weighty, fifty, quiet, superlative, ambitious, and benevolent way, and I felt a desire to abandon them. I think that was so frustrating that I actually perceived the deeper aspects of a particular scientific thought and destroyed it with new age traps. Most of them are based on the error of applying quantum theory concepts to the macro world. Marlee Matlin is amateur and clich√© in accordance with dramatic parts. <br /> <br /> I will appeal to Bill Bryson's excellent science research: A Brief History of Everything. There is a great miracle about life and the universe in true science.
