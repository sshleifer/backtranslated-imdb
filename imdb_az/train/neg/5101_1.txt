Something that happens to me after looking at this action, I can never get back to watch it. If you want to stacey keach and Michael Dorn try and win what should be, then stay tuned down on a holiday home. The wooden moving, weak special effects, the comedy feature, our alien hero was in the form of a female and ended up doing this in a 30-minute compulsory b-movie nuclear genre scene. When Nicole Eggbert sits in a bar at a bar in 30 seconds, the opportunity to make a good movie, but the Police, the Military and the Joe community can not jump on a cup of coffee, do not use dosn't cup trophies and jump four times. He must obviously be from another planet. Only where I am in this movie.
