Is something missing here? "unexpected field development"? "twisted flower bending area"? I just watched those watching the same Arquette tool that I follow (in a conscious mind of Sadomasoz) ... I just joined this site so no one would ever rent this stinker. .. This film was a shame to every human ... promptly asked: Did Sir Stevie read the scenario before giving his fingers to Kate C.? If so, then Spilberg should be the same sparkling light that "spider duck" ... do not give me, "this was a hit game" - I guess Mssr. Reddin is not very pleased ... The DVD covers were promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story" ... Story! Story ?? This is something similar to the old Bobby McKee and the Structural bandwidth genius ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? There is a home video of my cats, which is more of a curiosity than the descriptions of Arquette's negative loss ... and talk about Stan eksper machina; Thank goodness, only then he thought Dave called the police! and thank you for keeping the police only the real killer ... what! even though I still expect to become a kind of confrontation with Arquette and her secret millions ... no, Ms Spilberg, you do not get rid of the wound: hell "my father's foot is jackal"? Is this or the "just cause" worse? i dunno ... hey film lovers: why not make a blockbuster night and renovate it along with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then turn sepukka (or seppuka) and E. Dunsky with you ....
