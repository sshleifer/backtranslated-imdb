I just leased Creep and never felt impressed. I did not feel anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was hopelessly disappointed that there was something that would happen in this movie several times from my living room. Have not we seen them in the past? I did not like any of the guy's characters in the sewerage cage. I felt bad for her. But still he was alive and was not killed by Creep. <br /> <br /> Someone recalled that PS2 was referring to Silent Hill, and I likened it to similarities. <br /> <br /> Good movie, not a good thing. judge for yourself.
