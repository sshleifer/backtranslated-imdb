I can not recommend a Christmas movie more than this invaluable piece (trust me, you need double negatives - it's bad). When the screenwriter appeared to be the same person as the writer, this film was bothered by the opening credits. Music numbers are very far away and none is good ("Thanks very much", there's a good melody, but words are foolish). <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this movie (completely unusual in this way) includes Alec Guinness. Like James Marley. Decorated in a smart powdered white suit, Guinness foppishly fransz through its scenes to try to appear as floating like a ghost or to show off its utter for this terrifying movie. Meanwhile, Albert Finney mixes the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create Quasimodo / Scrooge's desperate appearance. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <a href="Finney's Scrooge people are so ugly, it's impossible to believe in its conversion. <br /> <br /> Regardless of any accusation of filming.
