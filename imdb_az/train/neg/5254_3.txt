<br /> <br /> Recently, I enjoyed many Spanish films; and the Spanish cinema as Almodovar, as well as cinematographers such as Del Toro, the "Devil's Thing", set up in the Latin American Civil War Spain, is the most beautiful film of the last decade. This film is not a surprise, but well-prepared, well-behaved, and able to maintain a different Spanish atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there are some problems for the solution of this problem. Generally, we do not have a realistic idea of ​​how it creates a creepy central character to its killing nudity, though despite the fact that many of the story's noises are directly drawn from their narizistic magazine. For a decade of constant unpleasant opening sequence, we have been identified for over a decade in which her daughter is the central character of killing a girlfriend in jealousy and control-freakery anger ("if I can not do you"). Suddenly enough, perhaps one of the best followers in the film, but it has nothing to do with the sudden death killing, which seems completely different in his motivation and performance. What happened to him in prison to cause this change? <br /> <br /> Many brutal "killer killer" or "sex" killer in Britain "is a terrible question .Why did she know or suspect what was happening? The question is, and really, his wife begins to emerge as one of the more interesting characters, but the answer to the question is quite clear: "No, it was not." Even if a dramatic opportunity is presented on a plate, the film is still pushed. Everything we've got is a little sketched, perfectly financed by the end of the event, at least in the Ten Rillington Place, Christie's spouse said, "You know what you want to say to me" to the moment, seal his fate, to the terrible things that can not benefit from unhappy knowledge and horror. but we must believe that the killer himself is a criminal who has been thoroughly engaged by the police, and that he may be able to kill him again before he is arrested and the prisoners in a mental hospital are the shortest of prisons. in the process. How did he do that? At this point, the field is extremely fragile; doing something by deliberately deliberately leaving some clues to the police; <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Silence of lambs can be comic book, but? ? Aside from Lecter? his serial killers are right. They are deeply disturbed, deeply ingrained and incomplete; <br /> </ div> </ div> </ div> </ div> <p> This movie has very little tension and, therefore, may give less space for the creation of the land. There is no useful information about the serial killers in general or in the Spanish cultural background. This is a weak excuse for women to show enduring persecution. And, surprisingly, what makes this violence even more pressing is a certain prisial deficiency of the nerve when presented. Indeed, the soft core of the thing shown really looks like a creaking titillation. A precise kick at the right time would have been a shock to everlasting and could make all the rest absolutely unnecessary. Instead, the endless shooting of only young women appears quite clearly, but they spread out a little on the table at a table. Very, very creepy. I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror movies, and I can endure extreme reverence even for my partner's worries. But anyone who likes this movie is a good or interesting person, I want to get away from myself. The purpose of a scary movie is to scare you; <br /> <br /> This really creates a very bad taste in your mouth. I have to give this movie more than one star, but it's not morally worth it and has never been.
