I saw one night at the cable. At that time, the girl who was presented as "Shannon Wilsey" did not know that she was really a porn star star, but she was really nice when I was sitting in the brain rotating drive (and often naked, thanksgiving). I love them as more lovers than the next man - indeed, more than the next guy - this is a bastard and more treacherous. The really hot film facing hellfire scientist and director, writers and special effects faces complete disadvantage, reducing the film's only grace of unequal nudity. Savannah is really interested in watching, before turning into a plasticized Barbie doll, as the queen of the dish - she blasts on gorgeous, sometimes uncontrolled sparks, looks at the camera and laughs, and generally is a great time for the audience. Although Savannah and his colleagues spend fairy tales on this picture, it is still unable to conceal that this is an incredibly stupid, badly-drawn and boring movie. If you know someone who is in the video, or if it's a cigarette for a few nights, check it out, but do not waste your money.
