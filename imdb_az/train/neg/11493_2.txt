Störtebeker is really one of the worst TV series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The player's durability and the main part of history were very nonsense: Only two examples: Visby's three houses. Instead, it was a great city, it's already the best days. Secondly, Hamburg would never be the city that cared for the bandits in the Baltic Sea. <br /> <br /> Hamburg, which can not go to the Baltic Sea, is then the principal city of Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than that: Director! How can a dictator like this man allow him to manage a movie like this? It is not possible! <br /> <br /> I can not figure out how capable some television channels can be.
