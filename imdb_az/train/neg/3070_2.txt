Oh, dear brother .... They have turned a pretty thoughtful movie into a fun testosterone fest. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this movie was a nice idea about the hero Kowalski. He was a man from Denver to San Francisco to earn a bet. Why was a handful of uppers willing to risk his life for the price? <br /> <br /> There were several flashbacks that gave us the picture of an adrenaline genre, and it was likely that he was trying to turn all his life into a disappearance. The point you see in the distance from the left and right shoulders of the road and the path itself rises. He just lives to be free and there is no sickness. <br /> <br /> After the events in the Caucasus, I saw several times that before the move of another driver, to be arrested and not to live in captivity. <br /> <br /> Kovalski has all the history (including a name). She is trying to go to a hospital where her husband is suffering from complications. pregnancy She is a loyal companion, and she is excited about his expectant father. He decides to take his life after his wife dies, but they leave these words when they think they can jump out of the car before fleeing bulldozers. They even share the "super soul", the blind DJ (brightly by Clevon Little) JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!?!? Give me some time.
