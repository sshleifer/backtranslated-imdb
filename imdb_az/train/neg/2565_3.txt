<br /> <br /> The first twenty minutes of the film could have been only five or maybe squeezed. The general film (with compassion) is shorter, but it could have been prepared to pay a bit more attention to Mean Aslan (did not reference The Wiz?) And his subplot was slightly closer to the main area. In short, the scenario had a good idea of ​​seed, but it had to be re-worked. <br /> Secondly, this could have been done without humor. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the show is a little too self-recognized. It also recognizes a little too. The original film was good enough as it was, but here's the only way, the way too. Brendan Fraser's jokes were a bit above (and why is not called "new Ursula"?). <br /> <br /> Fourth, the CGI work could have been a bit more focused. First, it was difficult to say Shemp was not a real elephant (of course, except for behavior), but here CGI differs like a headache. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the special effects should tell the story that it's just good or bad, and if at least reach this number, it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. Christopher Showerman's performance is just as good as George. Brendan Fraser did not have the charm, but Christopher was just really unsuccessful, even though George was able to give a little personality, which would be a big mistake in Jay Ward's inspired film, but he was not here. Julie Benz, like the new Ursula, surprised me more than Leslie Mann. <br /> <br /> Most other speeches were very good and in my opinion, it's not good or bad.
