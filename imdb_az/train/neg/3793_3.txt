Nutcracker has always been a problematic ballet. <br /> <br /> Based on the true story of ETA Hoffman, it puts its foundation. <br /> <br /> Ballet, Clara (or Maria in this version) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pantomime is a lot of time-consuming, especially dancing (very few), is not memorable. Drosselmeier appears to be profitable at the stage, it just seems to have drawn a silly film for the big screen. Unfortunately, things are not better when we come to the Kingdom of Sweets (stage II version). There are several choreographic points, though most of the choreography is mild and moderate. <br /> <br /> Balanci is considered as an abstract dance master, but I've always felt more successful as a creator of narrative ballets. The Nutcracker's stage production follows this version of the film and just re-approved it.
