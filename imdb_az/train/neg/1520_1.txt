Why did I spend the time with this movie? There was no funny joke or line all along. This collision is not even mild. Did I leave the vacuum processing tube almost? Why is the name of the National Lamp connected to this film? Even the Christmas Break was even better (I really thought the movie was so laughable). <br /> <br /> There will be no PEOPLE!
