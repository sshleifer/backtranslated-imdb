I wanted to have this movie much more than I did. Because I love wonderful foreign comedies - especially those who are totally surprised by you. Nevertheless, this often surprised me, although they were not a pleasant surprise. South Park has recalled that almost every public norm has been violated, and it is very sick to have a chance to talk, just to talk. For example, adultery can include drug use (pot, heroin, coughing), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, and so on. pedophilia My mother repeated a child (12 years old) to sleep with adult men. In fact, at a point in the film, the dentist is given this child instead of paying for a toothpick! Funny? You have to joke. This film is very far away and enters the comedy hero. Should I have fun with the next, cancer or rectum?
