I returned back when I rent the videos. OOPS These are the things that I want to say beyond the summary. 1: Many people were surprised and sick to eat this movie, it was general and unnecessary. 2: For a while in the background of the movie, it looks as if it were all the time, and for a few days after I saw this trash, I felt something in my tracks nervous. Or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. Many times in the film, you can say that the writer and the director do not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about the player.
