The comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted to the nearness and depth of the Umbrellas will be a little shocked to find a piece of music cut and pasted in American style - an inadequate stylistic dialogue with random song and dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was probably poor, replaced by a dubious work of dubbing (remember, dubbing was almost perfect in umbrellas). French translation (for subtitled versions) also leaves nothing to Demy's, though it can not be. In the film LeGrand has a few self-aware moments coming off off a whistle like references to songs for herself. And clothing - a combination of good, tight pants / white boots and freakishly unnatural colors, recalls an Austin Powers movie. . <br /> <br /> But Demi rewards the audience with Umbrellas, aluminum; Let us note that from the suitcase carried by Maxence when departing from Rochefort - from the same suit brought by Guy on Cherbourg. Also in the "Mixed liver" - "Umbrellas" Madeleine and Josette in Young Girls. "<br /> <br /> In general, the deeper questions and complicated endings, as those who are waiting for the natural feelings of the Umbrella (like a floating bike field) or Umbrella's scenario, are likely to pass through this. Those who are looking for the version will be very happy.
