Nick Stahl's name, the young shootout and the attractive cover of the VHS made me to get this flick and watch, expecting to see me a good naked film. What a shock! The scenario of the clich√©s is full of dialogues and performances, terrible, very bad, terrible, horrendous? summarization, full time loss. There is no fear, heroism, embarrassment, full of boring stories. The film is a ridiculously insidious game called "Taboo", as it looks like a group of friends, really three pairs, really seemingly enemies, and each of them has no or no, taboo issues. Here are the previous development of characters, trainees, their motives and their relationships. A year later, there was a handcuff and the same group gathered at the New Year's Eve party, harassing each other very harshly. But the plot and curves are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre, and unbelievable in my eyes that are not worthy of an additional error. Just One Advice: Do not waste time or money for this debris, of course, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> ">
