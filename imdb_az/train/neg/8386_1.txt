Separating this movie is like throwing a barrel in the barrel. Very easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to accept the positive aspects of the Little Man. First, I was impressed by special effects. Marlon Wayan's head looked like a corpse of a small man. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked some of the unexpected gay guys. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and the prices of "Havin 'Baby Baby" and "Movin Up On" were invaluable. By accident, John Witherspoon, who plays Grier's father in Boomerang in 1992, plays "the Coach" of the fungus with a fungal jacket and now plays the father of Vanessa's little man. So was fun. <br /> <br /> Besides, this movie is as convincing as White Chicks. How can it be shaken when you can not say that you are not a 40-year-old man but a baby? Full set of toothpicks! How is it that no one can see that it is not a baby? Little Man is a very bad, Rob Schneider community. And if you're a stupid enough to spend $ 8 on this movie, at least give me some benefit and do not bring your children up. This film is sexually abusive for little children (lots of jokes and sexual contact information, going down, eating, etc.) and embarrassed by parents who are bringing up their children who are forced to endure. If you insist on seeing a bitter movie, do not suffer pain or suffering for your children at least.
