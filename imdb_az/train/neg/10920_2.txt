<br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with another commentator who said that the special impact was good. <br /> <br /> I also would say that it was very important for me. Looking for archeologists "sets". It's not uncomfortable what they mean or define what is specific about it. <br /> <br /> If you are filming a movie on stage on the presentation of the film in Ancient Egypt, do not try. In fact, go to the desert. The beginning - an ancient ceremony - seems to be shot in a studio instead of a scene. <br /> <br /> No rise and collapse, no peak, occurred during the film's movement. The film is short and this is certainly a pro for this movie.
