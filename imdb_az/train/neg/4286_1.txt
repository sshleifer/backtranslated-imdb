This is the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've ever seen. I say good because I have seen Soldier, but he's playing tough ... but not from Jason Scott Lee's movie. Together with this. And if it is the quality of these movies, I will not see anyone else. Lee can be basically a martial artist ... as a lead, he is terrible. The film is fighting for a few minutes with no random names, and maybe the violin writer does not understand that the film can be extended anytime. Criminal personality is a single character, even though it is insulting at the edge, but it does not appear to be a liar. Most of the film, mainly, Lee, is by far the poorest ... or maybe another thing around. I can not say I'm sure ... I'm sure I'll never look again. The effect is not terrible ... but it is close. The title comes from the famous idea to use a time machine to go to Hitler and kill. In any way, the film is fascinating. The field itself is very complicated. Pacing is weak. I can not say anything positive about this movie ... I can not really do it. It's just too formulaist and meaningless. If I had only one car, I would go back and prevent the film from being made. I hope that they are exposed to as little as weak minds. Listen to negative reviews. Avoid this turkey. I do not recommend this to Lee fans and anyone else. If you are looking for a quality movie ... not good, that's not it. Yes, I'm sure. 1/10
