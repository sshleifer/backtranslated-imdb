<br /> <br /> The worst mistake my life is. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey Sandler, I'm laughing a little cheap". I was wrong, it was completely wrong. All three of my friends in the movie were asleep and still suffer. Worst site, worst script, worst movie I've ever seen. I would like to shoot my head against an hour's wall, then stop and you know why? Because damn good. After taking me on a microwave, I was filmed in a damaged movie and watched it burn, and it felt better than anything I did. It took America's Psycho, the Dark Army, and Kill Bill to get this crack. THIS FUTURE HAS COME FROM SENDS TO PREVENT THE FUTURE AND A LIFESTYLE LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
