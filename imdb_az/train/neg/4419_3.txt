I thought it would take a hit like a "past Catholic" of Catholic school for 11 years, but not for massive weddings and funerals for 35 years. I did too. . . For the first two thirds of the movie. There were all standard things - serious paroxial school exercises, repression sexuality, and so on. But then suddenly a film was shot. It really means. Now think about it, I've seen it before the pedophilia scandal. . . <br /> <br /> If I knew about such abominable things (such as Catholicism!) and its cover, perhaps there would not be excessive humiliation in such bad, hateful excavations in the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> I will not rename the video a few years after renting a new perspective. Only a dirty, ugly, ugly taste was left in my mouth. . . I am surprised by the experiences they have with the Church of the Actors because they * really hate or pay money. Attack on everyone who has a glimpse of respect for Catholic education, an incredible anti-Catholic film. I'm doing it because there are no good teachers yet in the '50s. Regardless of these, I was forced to learn to read and write the English language. They remembered us. (How many children today can think of a simple account?) Truth, there is nothing more important to success in America. Can you read it? Can I add / subtract / multiply / divide? Great. You can get any degree you want. The Catholic education discipline will not be as good as you are in teaching, but for the rest of your life, regardless of your Catholic "mythology" that you need to study, it will be in good condition. <BR/> <br /> Such a huge cast, such a bad, rotten script. <br /> <br /> I feel really bad for the writer and director (and not that bad, trust me, the ladies taught me better). <br /> <br /> I had a mixed feeling about the Catholic school. But the participants of this project should have been bad (ie, stupid) children sitting in the room, willingly taking part in the preparation of this film.
