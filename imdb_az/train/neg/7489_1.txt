US War and Nazi films can not be just fine. They are not afraid of being stupid and coming to the agenda. All the Nazis are bad, terrible, very proud, and Americans are still very talented, sensitive and human. Come on, stop this rash. The main character says, "With this test, we must create an aggressive war crime." Is there a peaceful nation with the world of America? # 1 $ 420 billion "defense" budget (China only $ 51 billion)? It's been spent so simple in a way ... ROI? Why does America describe it as a peaceful nation? I did not really love the movies on the agenda - they cast their art into hell and try to convince us to believe in something. Hollywood writer should label companies as "parental advisory" label. Some movies should contain a bullshit advice, "propaganda advice" or "politically correct advice". This is one of them.
