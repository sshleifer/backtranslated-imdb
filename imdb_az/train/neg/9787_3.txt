<br /> <br /> The problem with this production is far from good music. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there will not always be an expectation for intelligent artists such as Sondheim, Bernstein or Porter; yet this piece of music makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look even gentle. It was a tragic thing than a deadly, boring and uninventive (except one or two) and I could not recall one single important melody after looking at it - it's three more than three hundred people. <br /> This is also a strange un-theater. It must feel sorry for an incredibly large stage (those who are at the forefront of breaking their necks to see something that is actually 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and there is absolutely nothing in it. When you need to have a scene at a stage, just what you will get - the rest of the biggest scene is empty. <br /> <br /> California State Governor Klee Porter has received the French Minister of Culture and Tourism. And I was surprised by the popularity of this legendary music.
