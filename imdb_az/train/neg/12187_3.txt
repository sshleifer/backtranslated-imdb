This is the worst Niro Scorsese collaboration that can face the terrible violence. In this film, Scorsese slammed the high-end phone rings and gates completely out of its element by striking gimmicks that were ridiculous and embarrassing from such an artisan. The cast is completely wasted, and the southern accent is very boring and compulsory. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest attorney of the day he believes everyone can defend! De Niron's psychic Bowden is more than a typical 90th movie psychological killer. The early stage with De Niro and Lewis is very exciting and continues to peak, and we all have to get tired of the dead psychological stalker. One of my most horrible movies. The work is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
