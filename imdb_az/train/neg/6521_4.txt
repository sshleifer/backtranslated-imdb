I do not think that's a fair jolt because I can not watch all that. Maybe if I had seen in a theater, I would appreciate it in its original presentation, but it was too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and the details of the site have been lost. <br /> <br /> This is really a four-part movie or a movie in four parts, and I believe it's going to be for four nights in the theater presentation. I found it to be happy enough in the section, but I can do what I can to sit with Part II so far. Tolstoy's philosophy is something. If you have good translations or you can read it in the original, its vivid writing is worse than any problem in the story. <br /> <br /> Along with filming, filming is also very important. <br /> <br /> I have other issues with the parts of the movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm missing something, but I have just called for inclining to look at parts III and IV.
