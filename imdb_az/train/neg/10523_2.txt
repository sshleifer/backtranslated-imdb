Over the first forty minutes, the Empire really shapes itself: looks like a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster flick. Then I did not know why, I thought it was good, but now I am. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this film is simply heartbreaking. I do not care for movies with mental or something, I take Jackie Brown to prove a point - but that's all very frightening, but it's thrown out for fun. You take a knot in your stomach. Another problem is heroism. He is ridiculous, arrogant, but quite mocking - not bad. The drug dealer does not look too dense enough to be a killer. In fact, at the end of the day, this movie is absolutely ambitious. Not only elegant, but clever, just dull and meaningless - it should be spent all sorts of great misery. <br /> <br /> ***** * (1 out of 5)
