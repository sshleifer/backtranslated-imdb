This is the most terrible and funny tension I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Her mother, PA, played by Clay Jessica Alba, was engaged in secretly with Samantha. It happens even when a heartbeat is found in two secret marriage nights, with the same rare blood type. Go and say one that means! <br /> <br /> In some cases, Clay sees that anesthesia is not working and that he can feel everything and hears everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay, the razor sharp skalpel cutting pain <br /> <br /> We simply open his chest, focusing on Samantha's memories. I tell her that she works with an irresistible voice that can not stand. <br /> <br /> If you still do not bankrupt through laughter, you will definitely start seeing surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How can a young billionaire make a heart transplant by a surgeon, a nurse, a physician and a drunken anesthetist? There were more people in the room when I was caught. Do not talk about very serious medical behaviors that should be taken seriously ... the operating room is not even kept sterile ... people can even go in the room and go after the wash. During the operation, watching Clair is announcing, no one is very curious. Oh, but there's everything here ... doctors try to kill her to get her money. Those who believe in being sensitive to him, the oppressors speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well, if there is no interference from anyone in the hospital, four complainers who are working against him are conducting a major cardiac surgery without a court order. Even Clay's mother can check her status. Samantha is exciting just about exciting ... but oh no ... sweet Sam can .... You can quickly find it through the Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Clay, anesthesia it is not important whether or not exposed to consciousness, because in both cases the latter would appear the same way. <br /> <br /> If the Director-General / Writer is trying to have fun with falling victim of anesthesia, perhaps it's funny ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
