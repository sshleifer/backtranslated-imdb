After seeing the low-budget shock version of the Universal Soldier franchise, Van Demme reiterated the role of Luc Devoreaux in the second Unisol film. Yes, this prayer has been answered, but not as I have hoped. Universial Soldier 2 is as busy as poetry in your local library. No, it would be even more interesting. The sequence of the fight is top-notch, Bruce Lee's quality, which is the only substitute for all movies in cinema. This legendary owner of the legend of the old WCW tough guy Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It would be better to place Gaddafi as a sidekick lieutenant. <br /> <br /> It was the film I most betrayed. Some movie students slapped somewhere. What's really big in this movie hole, which is bigger than the Kanye West ego. For example, Luc's daughter, Hillary, appears to be at least 11 to 13 years of age and the first film was shot just seven years ago. How is it possible? Tell me! The part of Lus's supporter who was killed and made into Unisol is just a paradise! At the beginning of the film you wanted to disclose that there is a naked experimental Unisolun in the basement of the research complex. C'mon. As a director, he was able to spend more time with this movie and closed the entire hole. But ooo nooo! <br /> <br /> Talking about the front, IT ROCK! Compared to the first film, Universal Soldier 2's area was dropped low and worthless. Where is the unusual excitement that Unisol comes out, the Desert Storm, or a supermarket gulf that remembers something else? It was the fifties of the Millennium, which would have attracted more audience if it had happened in the form of a dystopia / Orwellian in the future. Corny is a bad face to describe this sad, sad, sad post later. <br /> <br /> What I've seen: double impact, siege 2, Robocop 3 and hell, even the cheapest donkey / no class Terminator knock-off "1999 class" is even more fun!
