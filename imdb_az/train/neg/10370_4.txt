Indeed, I regret every second I lost when watching this movie. Fortunately, it's hard for me to delete a movie once to watch it. Especially when using such a classic or people to call the classic. I think that every movie lover must watch at least once, it's one of those films, so I've looked at it. I did not make a mistake, like Humphrey Bogart and his wife, Lauren Bacall, as my couples and actors, but this movie was a big fraud. There is no really good plot, what a spy bumper, what a romantic love story. Yes, this is not a convincing mix of both genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that Bogey and Bacall did not know that they would stay together in one end or the other. I think that "To be and not to be" was too overrated, and Bogart was in a lot of good films in the 1940s.
