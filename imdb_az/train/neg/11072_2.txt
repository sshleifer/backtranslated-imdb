Last night I saw on television. Yes, you can hear what you say about it. Stereo is classified as one of the typical television soap series. In all fairness, I have a nice twist on the story line, and I can say something like this: "Yes, that's not expected." But it's not so easy to set up a good rescue element as a movie. Casting, moving, camera work, car, suit, setting, scripts, no, nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? Oh, this scene. Do we need it? This is a movie that you can watch and then forgot to watch. What was the title again?
