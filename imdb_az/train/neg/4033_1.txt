It's a painful thing to write this kind of surprising post, but I have not done it, just encouraging these people. First, because a movie is built on a small budget, it automatically creates good and unloved. In fact, in this case, a small budget is likely to be the only achievement of films that hampers the budget with a large amount of money on a horse. Did you see a comedy in the theater? People have heard what they are hearing and what are they thinking? Even these twats did not laugh. The floor cats took her first bath. It's not a movie, these guys .... There are no monkeys who have the feeling of moving to France. I have a clown on my door .............
