If you make a mistake before reading the movie, do not give up on the movie. In May of this year, I received the first copy of any book and finished with the book's 10 numbers. The film is a piece of garbage that is not part of justice. <br /> <br /> Some examples are: Rayford has never acted: "Behind the scenes: the film is only" behind the back (book) Hattie's feelings (when he reported the disappearance); Buck Williams is a blonde-haired, magazine writer, a television reporter; Chloe Stanford and many of the books wondered whether Rayford was "saved"; Buck and Chloe do not meet at New York meeting later on by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never the "book" but rather Rayford's expectations; <br /> <br /> Rayford and Hattie surrounding helicopter and so on. and so on. roads are full of curls after some of the hardships ... <br /> And only from the first movie; they want to release the third. Please give me a chance to book the book even if you do not like the movies.
