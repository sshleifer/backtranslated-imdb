This movie is really bad. Maybe it's tough, but that's it. Indeed. The weak script, every vampire clause in the book is used, and the origin of the main character is unmatched by ... ole Dracula. <br /> <br /> In the past there were some really brilliant Dracula / vampire films, but it does not even make it a "horrible" slot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I really, it will not be able to find a good thing to say about this movie, as if it were not as bad as it was before, so Johnny Lee Miller influenced the English vector ... <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <strong> La La is quite scary though!
