This is not a bad movie ... but this is what your girlfriend follows. The story is not bad ... it only seems an hour and a half long. It's hard for me to throw this movie out because I really like it, but the story was too long and gentle ... very bad. The main character will never change much from the beginning. That is, a "life-changing" thing goes through and can almost smile. I thought the Mac was really good. His strange amazement saved the film from a complete disaster. Maybe I do not know what to buy this movie. If someone could explain it to me, I'd like to inform you.
