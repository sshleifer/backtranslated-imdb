<br /> <br /> This film combines guns, explosives and fool killings to make a "move" movie a flop. <br /> <br /> What happens in the film? <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> What is it about? <br /> <br /> After the past, <br /> <br /> The murder is the only solution. <br /> What are the heroes? <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras to film. <br /> <br /> If you are ever keen on persecution or murder, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you can jump with such low-level "entertainment", "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
