I do not even believe that this movie has been filmed and video rental shops are ready to put it on the shelves. I wanted to get back from literature. Remember that the film does not have any historical truth and is still the worst movie ever found on a video store. B is not good enough to call the movie. Do not waste your time or money in this movie. Only the sound of the sound and the terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be united, blacklisted in the industry, but after watching the majority of this movie, I do not really think that everyone is a professional member.
