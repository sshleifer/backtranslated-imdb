A few days ago, I made a big mistake watching this whole movie. God is still trying to restore it. This movie is not worth the average of 1.4. IMDb should have 0 votes rated for movies that are really worthy of this. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: Justify; All the cheese was terrible movies of the gods only in the 1950s and 1960s, my God is wrong, trusting people, this movie is ONLY ONLY This is not terrible, it's a pitiful thing, it's not a word I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EART, <br /> <br /> SNAKE ISA (the worst movie I have ever seen) seems to have been compared to several Oscar's pitiful effort. <br /> <br /> I seriously considered the creators of this movie a legitimate effort to produce a Hollywood film, which is not a film called the first 25 seconds of the movie, and I thought I was watching some middle class classes who wanted to make a serious movie. still, I am I really thought that night is a real ripoff skit, I mean, it's exactly what it looks like. the whole movie appears to be hit by a 20-year VHS video camera. special effects ....... good lord There were some special effects better than this film wrapped in the daytime. The scene on the door is not ridiculous and beyond the edge. Seriously, I can say that in the collective four years ago, the introduction to the actor class, we all get a better movie. And the worst part of the whole movie, where Arthur is bare in the bathroom. Oh, my God, I have come here. I have a strong stomach, but woe it was terrible. Some of them should never be naked, there is one of them. The plot of this film will not go anywhere. They talk about legal issues we have not heard about again; Tells us we will go for music we did not hear again; Arthur is looking for a job for college and says he's looking for a piece of money and that's what we've seen is a porno shop. <br /> <br /> It really does not have much to do with criticism, but everyone knows, I am not a gay man. I support gay rights and we should all act equally. And, unlike the harsh priest of this film, every single word of this cuss is that in my church every gay friend will support it. WANT TO EVERYWHERE FROM HERE? But I did not want anyone to think that I hated this movie, because it's two gay guys. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <p style = "text-align: justify; I've read that this is a warning for everyone: just watch the movie, and watch this movie if you're just a pitiful movie in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The last thought: There are 7 films in the world, it's listed on the IMDb, there are 7 films that are worse than that!
