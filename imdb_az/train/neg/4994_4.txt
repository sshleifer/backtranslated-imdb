Good movies are original, some leave a message or touches you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in a mood for it. <br /> <br /> When I was watching this, I wanted something simple and did not want a straightforward way of thinking. It started well and was pretty fun, so it's a bad look. Finally, the movie was lost. The storyline was so sweet that the action was not very special, but the overall was good, the move was far enough to satisfy my needs. But all of them were destroyed because they came from above and left me with a bad feeling. He had to make some effort to make everything safer, and "no thought would have reached the level 7". So, if you do, you'll be frustrated because everything is totally illogical: do not follow! on the contrary, I will say ...
