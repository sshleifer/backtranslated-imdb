I have a few problems with this show. A simple list is now enough, and then I'm going deep into the surface: superficial symbols, laughter and awesome humor. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, you just read it and you just read it, so you can feel superior (as you can see nothing in this show), I will summarize myself for a teenager who is often hated by Canada: Friends Sucks, because it is unfunny, for TV shows for the new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.). Friends like television directors accuse the truth of TV, "Two and Half Men" and "King of Queens". It will now be reviewed. <br /> <br /> These heroes do not have any spirit, they are all the same (except gender and hair color). They react in the same way as in dull situations and are completely safe in their bodies. Where is the conflict and the humor with it? Why does Rachel not get stormed over Monica after Monica Rachel's assassination? Why Joey does not think suicide because someone does not seem to be serious? Indeed, he is the cause of calm and is comfortable with it. <br /> <br /> A curse with a purposeful hero: a persistent conflict and (the forbidden god) identity is impossible. <br /> <br /> The laughter is something that dies after birth. Any demonstration is almost comic. How can I make a broad overview? If a demonstration claiming to be a comedy requires ridiculousness, the audience will not laugh without it. Please do not hesitate to quickly get rid of humor. <br /> <br /> This leads to my next point: humor is boring. An excellent character is a little humorous (without a smile trail), there's no way to do more, just coming to recognize our shortcomings in our daily humor. So what happens when Monica is 17? He immediately admits that his work is not true, and he is squeezed out of it. Instantly a solution should be a kind of conflict. Maybe she finds her mother or one of her friends trying to get rid of her and ends up trying to deceive her. It would be good, it would be like a rescue fight! Now I've come up with an argument for my position. Most of my friends love this show because they have not heard of your courage or the development of our prison, and many of my friends hate this show because they have recently left your Desire or Ease Out. <br /> <br /> I was watching very little "Friends" in my life, but in my opinion, we had enough to look at the great drawbacks that created the show that could not be overlooked. If you read so much, thank you and start watching at least some of the shows I mentioned.
