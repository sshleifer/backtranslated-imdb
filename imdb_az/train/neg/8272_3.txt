At the end of "Dragon Heat", why am I worried about everything I thought? <br /> <br /> The premiere of the film is interesting, and she took the first place in the movie, which brought me to Maggie Q. But I'm not disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee can not hold a candle like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most boring aspects I have ever seen. Lee bends her own visual style and I use this word unbelievably freely, fills the film with absolutely unnecessary black and white photographs, ice cream frames, slow motion, fast motion, and other visual nonsense. I think all this has to do with a good story or lack of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Movement scenes are not something special, and they play like hopped-up music videos other than anything else. Do not worry about any characters, including being a professional sniper in two words that can not reach the broad side of a warehouse! <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; predictable fashion - and Lee, first If you do not get it several times, you need to be careful not to recall the back story of the characters, as it's a strange amateur writing and filming, and Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn, and Maggie Q's talents.In order to be frank, Biehn is no good movie directed by James Cameron though I'm solid-pressed. <br /> <br /> If you're in a mood for a really great Hong Kong actress, you're better off with some garbage stickers - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled "1992), Ringo Lam's" Fire City "(1987) - Quentin Tarantino's" Reservoir Dogs "(1992) - or" Blank Blank "(1967) remake for" Full Contact "(1992) "No Close" (2002), extravagant, abusive , check the popcorn flick. <br /> <br /> True, on the contrary, if all of them are somewhat, not overlapping, exciting and even suspenseful. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is quite mediocre. It is horrible that Lee did not make a bad move film, making it a boring one.
