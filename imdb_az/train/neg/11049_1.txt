If Mr. Cranky evaluated it, I would be tempted to paste his copy here. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives 0 to one of these films is that Malcolm McDowall's player is excellent. But this movie can not save the disaster. The director should be very careful when dealing with this issue, because it is a combination of scenes thrown out with very little persistence - reminiscent of the worst 70 films. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> the corporation is using Proxate Corporation, Nigeria, to carry dangerous containers / brought together a group of disadvantaged people. The ship's computer is connected to one of the crew members in a bottle of baby and USB 12 or something. <br /> <br /> The fun of this movie is equivalent to a study of the same name. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I can not find a scene in the context of the film has made any real meaning. I just watched the end of the bird flu, and this movie reminded me that there are people worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is a great actor and every great actor has the right to have a bad movie in his career, and this is something. <br /> So you hire the store or you are both men and doctors do not make prostate exam this week, and if you feel that this is a bad thing, of course, if you give the public opinion a copy to Malcolm and then a drinking coaster use it.
