<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I love Bela Luki, Dr. Lorenz plays a Lugosi medical license for unspecified reasons. But he is making experiments to keep his spouse young and beautiful. He is still 70-80 years old, but Lugosi puts it down. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;" > "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "> Lugosi and some of his assistants steal his body while on the way to the morgue and take him back to the laboratory where he was captured in an animation or catatonic state, and then the stolen brides were forced to return his body to youthfulness and beauty in the body of a needle rammed somewhere, perhaps on his neck and then on the needle. Lugos' spouse screams until he returns to his small state .Lugoshi is just about good about this movie in his lab, something ... a strange old fate and two deformed sons .... one son is great, mixed-looking delayed brothers are forced to delusive bride and other son's little b it is politically correct in today's world ... It is these three types of nightly people to lie down and Lugoshi are in trouble, and they did not give any explanation as to how Lugosi's scared assistants came in. <br /> <br /> In any case, a female reporter is tasked with her skinny, the editor will learn where all the bride kidnapped is a rare orchid in common with all the stolen brides. He asks around and says that he is a world-famous orchid specialist who lives near, only becomes a developing person in this orchid. This expert comes out of being creepy Dr. Lorenz. She quickly tracks her and frustrates her little horror home. I am not sure where he is in all parts of the police, but the reporter has done all his work. <br /> <br /> Lugosi's films were a series of unnecessary baseless lines that all of us have built up perfectly in high heavens. It seems that the world-renowned orchid expert is known to have developed the orchid by sending a bride to the bride kidnapper? D'OH! <br /> <br /> Then, it turns out that young women do not have a job for the procedure, so why does Lugosi continue to miss the bride from the churches protected by their experience? all focus and newspaper headlines? Why not make a sexual prostitution like a normal weird deviation? <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always something, but it's very important for me. well - it is creepy and dirty to at least have enough interest in watching him. The correspondent was just a terrifying actor ... he did not make any impression, he just delivered his lines as a machine gun <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is only for the fans of Bela Luko. Lugosi was always there. the picture was even tightened when it was a dog. He knew that he was doing terrible pictures, but perhaps he also knew that if he had such a strong thing, he would have all the bad spots and the bad things around him <br /> <br /> And he was alive, the fans of fear always love Bela Lugosi will be. He was all in front of the camera as well as every one of his teams. We will give two fakes for trouble.
