A shadowless shadow, I say, is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is a description of Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedy that works on a cruise liner. <br /> <br /> This is it! Nothing in the film is illogical, throwing a pair of shoes in the 't.v' type, rather than a crazy person's breakfast, rather than a ridiculous bare weapon, rather frustrating. Even the general Noriega makes even an appearance, for no reason I do not understand (this, of course, not for humor). Add a mix to Miss Australia, the worst Australian Accenti ever heard, and even if a movie does not fit into the main picture of the movie, you have something to do with the worst movie. I love to see this movie because it raises the status of every movie you see. After watching a bad film, I guarantee that the first thing you say is going to be as bad as at least by ship.
