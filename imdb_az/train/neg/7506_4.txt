Good actors and good speeches will not add anything to your attention in a senseless script, bad dialogue, and behavior patterns. The most interesting feature is David Berkovitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, some difficulties without just a certain reason, teaches us nothing and is not even concerned about entertaining.
