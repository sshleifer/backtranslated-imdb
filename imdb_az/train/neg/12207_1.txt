I remember when I left this movie I liked it. When I was 12, Commodore was 64 and I loved playing Rambo. That's why I'm really excited to get this movie really cheap. I put it on the VCR and started: This movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone speaks the same thing as the three words in the whole movie (in the end, except for these terrifying synthesis speeches) and all the expressions in his face. And in the midst of this foolish love thing, it is just amazingly expected. I simply conveyed all things quickly and went on to exchange the movie with something else.
