Christmas was regarded as a beautiful movie, but it was really disappointing. Even when selling VHS and DVD copies of the film, I think the manufacturers are really proud of this project. Like Beau Bridges, Nick, I have one or two but I've been looking for a great part of my performance as a screen actor. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not have filmed this beautiful film again. This was a shame. <br /> <br /> Since the days of Vallon I have become a fan, but I have not forsaken my future work. <br /> <br /> In the protection of passions, leadership is mechanical, I hope this is not a negative view and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. Since I'm a good cast, I've turned it into a movie and I'm ready to enjoy it. However, I challenged anybody to watch this movie, and I did not want to pay it back, though T.V.
