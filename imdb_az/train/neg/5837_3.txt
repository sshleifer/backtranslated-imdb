I can not say that I like this movie very much. There are some fun moments, but it is not possible to think that there is a comedy or drama. lights and tones are few and far away to be a tram. but also does not mean much. It can happen without any reason, and it's pretty rude. it could have been a better movie if they had taken some time to explain something. The latter was anti-climatic, but the rest of this film would say that it was really built, not just a kind of thing, and it really did not dig up, but I said I would not give it any point.i Winter and weak 3/10
