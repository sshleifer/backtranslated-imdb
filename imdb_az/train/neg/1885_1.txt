If you're looking for a movie, it's a movie for you if you describe the meaningless and boring existence of the middle class life that is on the website of non-communicating and fraudulent ideals. Whatever happens to make the film interesting and interesting, you should probably look elsewhere. There are so many good movies. For example, try some of Bergman's dark movies. The filmmaker must follow one of his followers following a tense and dull event until the film ends at an end to a charming and miserable end to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class. If you value your time, there are better ways to spend two hours, for example, cleaning your home.
