Budget, worthy actors ... those who knew this were important. Do not waste time on this part of the trash. The effect is bent. This is acting. <br /> <br /> Even the far distance quality of this film is also terrible. <br /> <br /> This is just a little cheap T & A, which could lead to tolerance and wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Previously, there was only 7 people on the cursed planet. <br /> <br /> Bigfoot is a good way to flick in the Caucasus, a huge budget and some players who do not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
