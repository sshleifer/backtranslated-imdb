Genuine "Cube" Paranoia is a fantastic B-style film that is rich in fleshy character and exquisite top-notch performance. It's creepy, mysterious and cool. And, like the Cube Zero, the stupid one is no better than the next. This third (!) movie part of the Cube series is retread (most of a boiling trap is simply retracted), part aberration. He takes a courageous step to explain what the cube is - the first thing that has never been discovered - but I want to keep it secret because the explanation is mild. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists on the Cuban axis, but they do not go beyond some of the political and religious totalitarian state instructions. Hence, few public opinion is flat and strange. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The act of purely amateur clock, pacing slow (which consists of two nerds watching how many of the movies are on the screen?) And the persuasive effects of persuasion while in my heart. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a "Cube" fan, a neat and sophomoric clone of a good movie, which is not necessarily a sequel.
