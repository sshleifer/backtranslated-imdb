<br /> <br /> I love these cartoons, but this is an animated film, so everything can happen. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is not a list of flaws, but something else: <br /> <br /> 1) I use the tag line. It shows that this movie has great 3D effects. 2) In this film "cliffs" do not look like a real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? <br /> <br /> 3) Story. Maybe it's written for children aged 6. <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "These are all American files!" Oh, give me a break.
