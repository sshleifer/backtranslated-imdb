(Very light spoiler, maybe.) <br /> A fan of Diane Keaton is usually a fan, so I try to watch this evening. I must close it all before the second hour, because I have found myself to be very kind to my daughter or mother. Both of them seemed to be less noticeable to others, and her daughter added a rude, disrespectful, mixed union. When the daughter dies, the only thing I think is, "At least you can not watch it anymore". Keaton did a great job despite the state of confusion and sorrow, but it was too far away for me. I just did not enjoy it, so watching stopped. <br /> <br /> If you do not care about my protagonist, you have to be careful about my character as soon as possible - if it's about an hour or if I'm not careful, it's not too late. <br /> <br /> Beating was sincere and played well - I felt for them! * - and gay's best friend was nice, but it was not enough to move the film for me.
