I have nothing to do with a fast-moving fear, but this nonsense obtained by Stephen King is very fresh, very bright and up-to-date. An excitement is about a new teenage boy in a small town called "Sleepwalker" - a cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and for a more mysterious, complicated treatment. It is an inadequate colorful look and feel for the triller, a challenging atmosphere. The children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but Alice Krijer is great as a child's mother. From Ghost Story to Krijj, the filler-woman has never come out of the mold and is a great loss that has not been used more. His performance was creepy and intense, and the "Sleepwalkers" could have been a better movie with a distinct focus and intense focus. It is transformed into drama from tension to comedy, with a very high and commercially controlled, unequal tone. Stephen King comes out in a community like real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * From 1/2
