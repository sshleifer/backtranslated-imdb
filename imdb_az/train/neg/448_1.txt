This is how bad the results we hate about the show are. These women have no respect or dignity. The whole plot is that they throw children themselves. Amanda Bynes' talent was completely wasted. He was brilliant in his "All That" and his show. <br /> <br /> Emphasizing their writings and dialogs by Simpsons, Homer says: "Why would he and Jenny write the Gart?", "The old slave" wannabes remain outside of me. "Everybody should ask, Poochie where?" when his cartoon character Poochie is out of the screen. All the talking centers are talking about a boy and then a boy. Sometimes they change and cry instead of the boy. Then they get to each other or they break up at the end. 2 women are either shallow, stupid or sexually dependent. The only word I thought was "sucks".
