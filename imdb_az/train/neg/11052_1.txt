Deadly Wake is the perfect movie for movie students to learn how to film a movie! <br /> <br /> What is the mix with the team in this flick? The worst music mix The worst editing The worst script MAIN ALL TIME DIRECT The Worst Choreography Worst Of The Worst Dangers Worst Cinematography Worst Props The Worst Sets Worst Lights This "movie" would be ultra high contrast black and white and silent ... still terrible. All scenes are dark (lightening people say "black"), often as if musical score drowned the author's dialogues because no one ever spoke of the two penalties for a long time. The "bad" robot was funny ... what was it? Jazz Dance? Oh ... I think you should tactically or walk around something. I am sure that fear has hit the hearts of poor editors. And how much rubbish do you do? It is not possible. The trash is trash, how splice it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> All things (with lotsa breaks) are just to see if there is any good part. NOPE! CONTACTS! <br /> <br /> How to make a flick of a perfect example ... for every serious film student!
