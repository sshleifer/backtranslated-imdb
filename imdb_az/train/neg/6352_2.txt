I've always been a great admirer of Woody Allen, and it's always going to be what's going on in the past, but only one cow lover will not see how boring, meaningless, ambitious, and horrendously it is. Based on controversial mental obstacles. And what a disastrous idea to put in the mouth of Will Farrell's mouth and gestures that Allen will be 30 years older than Farrell's "actor Allen-Clone" is a disastrous idea. And not to talk about dialogue ... What was intended to become philosophical thoughts turned into a forced mockery of intellectual thought, which was not known to be funny.
