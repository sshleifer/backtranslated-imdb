I really am surprised that this film has such a rank! For years, I have not seen such a bad movie. It was a really bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes. If you do not like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), it's 10 times worse. This story recalls RL Stine goosebumps. <br /> <br /> The comedy is so scared that I can not tell the player. Always Klich√©. <br /> <br /> People living in the Caucasus resemble each other. We talk about thousands of crimes, and no one can get news. In fact, these people are just missing. And there is a good man trying to solve the mystery (there is no secret for us because we are aware of the evil man from the beginning) and the ordinary person does not believe in him! what a surprise! In the end, the butcher dresses and killer fight to kill the butcher!
