Here's a surprisingly large number of 8-10 stars starved by people who have never written an IMDb review before. Taking into account the very low average rating given to other people, I can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I would admit it, I thought the concept was attractive, and I was pleased to see actresses playing with Angela and Angela and Harmony, but it's been a long time for this movie to be very unhappy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actor: Potentially mature enough, but everyone? <br /> <br /> People were laughing? Oh, boy. <br /> Eye creams: OK. There were really beautiful women in this movie. Only three main women are not characters, but on the board. Producers have been hoping for the heartfelt protection of the d√©cor from the heart, and they will not feel the terrible of everything. <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasus Muslims Office: Not even close.
