I've always thought a bit kinda about these old Andy Hardy movies. Some of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not very unpleasant, as good, two shoe movies rarely praise. Nevertheless, I can not support this film. It may still be a historic dialogue, but still laugh and cry the story. Shake your head while watching it, ask yourself, 'How stupid is it?' You know what you want to say, that's worse than a cornice. <br /> <br /> This is mainly Mickey Rooney, because he tries to get out of the crowd because he is the last one to some stories related to some d√©butante from New York City. People in the old days were more socially conscious. If you know rich or beautiful people, you have heard the word "social climber" as one of the highest achievements of life. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, from today, we can find an innocent and clean event and series (which was more than half of Andy Hardy's films). Moreover, if you want to hear Judy Garland sing, he is your ticket, he sings a few songs here and leads to Andy's heart. Oh, man, I almost write about it!
