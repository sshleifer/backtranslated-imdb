Second Renaissance, in Part 1, show how cars rebelled against the first humans. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This all starts in a situation that, as the machines claim, they also have the right to live, robot is something they own and therefore they can do anything they want. <br /> <br /> Although it is an interesting premise, the story is really foolish after the riots between robots and humanity (violence!). <br /> <br /> The animatrix stories near the main part of the text (especially Osiris) work for the best. . As for the Second Renaissance Party, I am very fierce and very foolish. 4/10.
