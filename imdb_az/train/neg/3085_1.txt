Description: The root is completely foolish and worthless. It's so cheap and naked, these extraordinary silence people spent two months or so (I guess ...) to spend such a budget, probably not more than $ 700 to make this movie. Mystery Science did not want to watch or watch the Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Do not spare yourself, protect your time, lives and money - I repeat, you will not think of seeing this movie. This film is very fragile and your face should be turned into a purple color of angry boredom. If you have a number IQ, be my guest and watch this absolutely bad movie. Indeed, you can admire her. (As I said earlier, if IQ) <br /> <br /> With just about 12 actors, a few puppets and, of course, cameras and music from the garage sale, I'll make a little more fun home video than this is a shit .
