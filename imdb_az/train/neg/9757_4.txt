<br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst sword I've ever seen. Zorro was embarrassed! <br /> <br /> This film is described as adventure and horror. Do not forget the horror - nothing. Nudity, no blood, no monsters; <br /> <br /> A Robin Hood adventure against the evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be a king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film is the regret of Graciela Nilso, who has shot only four films in two years. What did he escape?
