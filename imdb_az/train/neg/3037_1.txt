This is one of the stereotypical MTV generation dance films, and I do not see all this 'bad' trash. The player is strangely watching the same story with all the other "dance" movies there. This is horror! Do not miss the name of watching. "How does it move?" When can the movie title drop out of grammar? At least a few dance films have half-decent dance scenes that do not even cost one hour. I'll give 1 to 10 because I'm not zero. I'm asking everyone to watch this with a IQ of over 60 and ask them not to lose your money. 1.6 / 10 should say everything. This film was not.
