I hate throwing such lines, but in this case I feel like: THE AMERICAN COLOR OF PROFESSION The worst movie I have ever seen in the last five years. I said there. <br /> <br /> "From my system, why not let me explain?" <br /> <br /> "If anyone dies in a great anger, a curse is born, and those who oppose him will be furious." This is the main purpose of the Almighty and I am interested in accepting it. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not get anything other than this. Those who are "cursed" are really exhausted by their anger, so you all get it. Want more? Very bad. Some critics and fans point out that the sole purpose of the newspaper is to scare you. The problem is that there is no plot to talk, creepy pictures and sounds can only come to date. Director Takashi Shimizu, attempting to create an atmosphere in the first hour by re-creating his original films by pulling out George Sluizer? repeating the same scene repeatedly. There are so many things to do: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> / </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <strong> The first time it was actually creepy. As the film continued, every subsequent use was a laugh. Despite the end of the movie, my friend and I were disappointed by the laughter that this stage would end with a "shout and black smell." <br /> <br /> The film has never been proven by mistake. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a series of vignettes left out of the audience, there is no storyline. I do not have any problems with writing a nonlinear story when it's done correctly. The film is thrown from time to time without any strange or unexpected reason. I have never seen such a movie since the opening of the HIGHLANDER 2 theater version. And this story-writing technique is all the mystery that the movie can be. If you know you are afraid of dying of two symbols of your dreams, how shocking it is when your body is in the attic? Why should we take care when trying to find out what happens to everyone when it comes to mysterious disappearance? <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the American version of RING for the second time lasted $ 15 million for the first weekend. is nothing but a mere imitation that has been concealed as a real movie. The most terrible things about THE GRUDGE are his first weekend reaching $ 40 million, and some people think this is "the most strange movie." WHAT does it mean to get rid of the wrath of anger?
