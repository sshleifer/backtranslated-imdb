You can not imagine how I expected the Ants of the Ants. As a great Gordon fan, I was looking forward to the premiere of Europe with bad expectations. Especially more than Dogaon-Gordo's last achievement. The Ants King was here in my country and Gordon himself was there to present it. Unfortunately, I can not go any further and I congratulate him. King of Ants is the most thirsty and mediocre movie ever. Indeed, the quality level has never exceeded the standard television-triller standards. The background is fairly regular, and typical Gordon-touch, with some exceptions, is never recognized. Moreover, there is already a weaker script than the Swiss bowl cheese! It is a young swallow-hacker who is hired to commit a crime. Of course, he does not pay for himself and, of course, he is falling in love with his victim's wife and, of course, avengeth himself ... The sequences that only one man's madness spiral is a fact that still follows Stuart Gordon's film. Perfect performances are centered on McCenna's heroic horror, like George Peters' Wendt, smell bastard, and good-hearted sexual bomb like Kari Wuhrer. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and when the story is overly irritated, makeup effects are not enough to even provide amateur fans of horror. Since Gordon was finally a thoughtful and competent film, I had read some other comments about the King of the Ants, claiming to be the best. No, if it were in this case, I would be better and thank you very much for giving Re-Animator a look. too much. Well, I think every good author has come out of steam and inspiration. Stuart Gordon was also terrible.
