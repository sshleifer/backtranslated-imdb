For a comedian writer, Woody Allen really lets the viewer pay with this inadequate attempt to develop character. There are some fun things to do, but more than one of them would listen to the dryer tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Ferrell wastes his time in this movie, which does not usually feature comic delivery. Amanda Peet did a good job, but still there was no place to act as a film in this body. The film is very heavy and unmanageable, so it is impossible to carry it, but when it comes, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the movies that go on and on the stage, and to show that their writers can record several lines of regular dialogue.
