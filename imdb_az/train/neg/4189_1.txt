I had the pleasure of returning two of the worst films in 2004: first, the disgusting project known as the Riddick Chronicles, a non-conforming CGI-based gap and then Greendale. One value is multimillions and other value pennies, but they're both bad. Indeed, it is indeed evil. <br /> <br /> I'm not the biggest Neil Young admirer in the world, but he has provided a share of classic tunes: Buffalo Springfield (good writings are Young Works) Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man has really written a great song. Unfortunately, there is no great song for Greendale and those who are less valuable, and the film they create is really indifferent and simple political slogans. Completely unimpressive as poetically impractical and polemic, Greendale is best forgotten. Buy a book when you have to attend a young bank account.
