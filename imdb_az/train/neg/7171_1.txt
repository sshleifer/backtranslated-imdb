This movie seems completely meaningless. What's happening is that a small child with a sore throat writes and says, "How can you swallow it?" There is nothing he thinks of him. What was Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Did they do it for a bet? I can not prove you, I'm absolutely convinced that someone's sincere should be important, but I'm not registered. As Jared and the bird go down to Ireland, down the stairs, as you do. They go to a house with a very boring little girl and meet with Christopher Walken, an old woman kept in a peat. It just makes it possible for you to give it back, for no reason other than to keep up with your life, and you can immediately thank her for fertilizing her. After all this is a bit stupid. I would like a few hours of my life!
