Recently, I was closely acquainted with this sad bomb of a movie on a cable channel and thought how awful it was when I first released in 1980. There are many commentators who cover this movie and are not old enough to remember the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The spectacular popular novel puts on this screen a staggering unusual story on the legions of fans who want to see a romantic "master" director. "Salem Multiple" was destroyed as a television mini-series directed by Tobe Hooper ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre") in the late 1970s, and the great book of the book Chiller Theater "Vampire destroys the whole structure without any real fears. The parties hoped that Kubrickin's success would be succeeded by Hooper's failure. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie looks great and has a great opening sequence, but it's all downhill after a few successes. "Jack Nicholson Jack Nicholson can not do anything, he has always been crazy and does not bring anything to his role, and I think many of the reviewers here are "Johnny in this" clinker, though ... he is only scared in this film. The character of Scatman Crothers, Dick Halloran, is an essential part of the book's structure but Kubrick killed him in one of the most "shock" serial, which never left the film, and I saw that the theater's spectators were running over and over again in the last 45 minutes of this unhappy flirting. The King's books are not really translated well into the film, because most of the stories happen in his characters and often metaphysical. <br /> <br /> Kubrick has prevented the tension between the living and the dead, which tramples the style, and the resulting drawbacks have come to an end from the original material, so we do not care who will ultimately be. <br /> <br /> Stinks and why most of them think that a fearsome masterpiece is beyond me.
