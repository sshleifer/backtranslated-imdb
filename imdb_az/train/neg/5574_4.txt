"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a great example of a great idea that can be overwhelming with terrible issues like lying patriotism. Future travelers try to destroy Japan by replacing the Japanese hero Godzilla with a puppet monster and a three-headed gold dragon, Ancient Gidora. But they failed and eventually fought with Godzilla Ghidorah. The battles between the two behemoths are very cool, but the film is full of rocks and everything is really stupid about "Japan is great". The creators of this film did not even insult the Japanese enemies, and made the big blond children, who were easily overlooked by the clever Japanese. It's a good thing that at the end Godzilla and King Ghidorah have nearly demolished both Japanese and these are really ridiculous enemies in one (really two) battles. But until the battle of Rome, the film was really boring and miserable.
