If you enjoy watching Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel you will enjoy Burt Reynolds in another movie and will never be distributed. I can only confirm the DVD version, maybe the VHS version is much wiser, but the movie night and dark scenes are as bad as everything is red. I first thought it was a mix of DVD players. It was not. If you insist on watching it, I advise you to adjust the colors on your TV as black and white. If you do not, you will never get the movie. If you do, you can recall that a poor filmmaker is trying to change the style of Pulp Fiction.
