My goodness is this movie is bad. My local film was totally wrong with my research because it's a certified garbage. Well, yes, good guys are white, bad guys wear black ... good guys always win. Now go home and embrace your children and feel how well Hollywood feels. Blech! I can not believe that this brainwave was made by Wes Craven. I think that a little money was needed to pay a mortgage, so it made a piece of seed. <br /> <br /> If a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her father, she believes that anyone who sees the film regularly can do good or good from such an experienced director. Make a foolish IL worse or it will hurt your father. But be aware that we are with Mrs. All-American daughter, she will end the day and beat the bad guys. <br /> <br /> There is a refugee camp in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy has 28 days to make a movie, but it's not just a good thing, it's a terrible thing. but at the same time he is a dumb burglary acting as a clever 5'5 "McAdams is thrown by his donkey, because he was a coach ... and a field hockey player. .. and all Tae Bo strips. he must be flexible to hire an international terrorist. <br /> <br /> Since 7-11, I will not trust him to steal a group of residents. <br /> <br /> That is, this film has been seen before before doing a good job. Restore any of Die Hard movies. Though the heroes are more unpleasant and convincing, the ones in danger, the international terrorists, your favorite, the bad guys are more capable and interesting. I just resemble Hollywood, as they have forgotten the necessary models to easily copy them. <br /> <br /> <strong >
