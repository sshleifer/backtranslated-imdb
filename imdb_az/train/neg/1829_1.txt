Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I still do not stop. It is beyond me that this man still allows me to shoot a movie. I can not figure out how I understand how I work in this movie, I will shoot and have a company ..... I would have to throw myself. God! This film was just a straight, steam, POO sparkling hole, if possible, should be fumed. In a statement, something that is forced to say the text on line 10 is meaningless. What's wrong with saying a few things about a movie? Why do not I sometimes understand why a short novel is written when websites sometimes need a brief comment?
