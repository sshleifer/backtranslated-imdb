It's the most boring thing I've ever wasted a whole hour of my life. It was almost an hour that I thank God. More than half of this movie is from the original "Criminalally Insane". At least I could see the classics of rarity. Because in my video store there was only "Criminalally Insane II" (like "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this film is the worst home-video player you've ever seen and a back yard. Why is not my video store original, is it? Why do things like this end in video stores? Why do people rent it and do not burn it after seeing the horrors immediately? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> Do not steal your entire body of candy, or stabbing a few times in the back (do not ask) or brain cell mutilation monologues on giving someone poisonous tea for your spouse, and then we want to see Crazy Fat Ethel, a dancer, or just a dance in a garden with a bloody knife: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: Do not see this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not go through a shelf in a video store with a copy of this movie. You can still get rid of it, but it's too late for me now. . .
