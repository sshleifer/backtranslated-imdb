<br /> <br /> In this film the writing was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> What I've got from this movie is that, like 10 to 1, I thought that Lacy Chabert's performance really played many personalities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! As for the Armenian descent, Armand Assante recalls the role of my doctor, mostly from the hospital series in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> All these things could have happened to me. But the terrible, terrible, terrible ending / solution, psychic role, and even the role of psychic was one of the worst I have ever seen.
