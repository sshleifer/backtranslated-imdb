I often enjoyed this movie, but I felt that I was watching a baby movie. I'm honest, after writing a pg script, someone decided to add some blood, nudity and language while filming. it was a big minority. they believe in the magic of children who are "beautiful" (pigs) or "angels" against the evil dildo. parents believe in their ability to see the soul with their daughter and use this ability to miss the teeth. When I took this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie that was terrifying; In a way, we can shoot a good movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not. they were filming a worse film, and probably lost their money in the same proportion.
