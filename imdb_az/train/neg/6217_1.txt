I'm Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, I love that I signed two people to sign this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but for some time he has remaked or adapted some of his last few films, and for some time he has caught interest in me. He has produced a brilliant "Nightmare Before Christmas", which has been watching several times and filming "Beetlejuice" and "Sleepy Hollow". Bekmambetov drew three of my favorite films: Night Care, Daytime Watch and Want. <br /> <br /> Because it's been in the theater for several days now. I was thrilled as I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This is the first time I have come out of a movie about Tim Burton and said, "I'm almost glad." I felt that I had a heart failure. So, you and Bekmambetov were expecting this movie to be a good time together with the manufacturer. At the moment I still can not decide how it goes down like this movie. I did not hear the original short film before seeing it, but now I can say that this movie has a short film. Hell, Neil Blomkamp, ​​reconstructed a full length called "Alien" in Joburg, 9th District. I really would like to think this movie is awesome. I really did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; I do not know what's going on, I do not talk about it. The whole film is a 6-year-old ADD story, which has a huge, giant clanky monster robot that has destroyed, destroyed, and driven things. This is a hateful thing, but nothing else is wrong in this movie, EVERYTHING IS COMING There are many monster robots, there is no logical explanation behind the majority, and I do not mean that the flying pterodactyl monster does not go beyond anywhere He has no idea when we leave, and Acker expects us to know what he is from. The more sensitive thing was the creature like a snake with hypnotized eyes. and I do not expect him to laugh, all three of whom I spoke about were laughing, he lifted the victim and burned them. I. NOTE. PRIVACY. <br /> <br /> The film, which was released in Act III, is the most delayed part of the whole film. Thus, basically, when he woke up at 9, he found himself out of the room, finding 9 holograms from the scientist, and intended to drive him to the robot life of a great scary machine robot, but then he was intended to use the wicked for the use of the war and the earth, but then the scientist gave his life. And he only said that LIFE LIFE was given in 9. But what about other robots? WHO LOVES THE LIFE? ????????? This is the most beautiful example of a poor run. There is a part of life that the device is available, how are the other 8 given to them? All the heroes can not like it. They endanger their lives for no reason. Only good character is 7. Go back to his 6 "source !!!!!!" ramblings, 1, a strong stupid, 2 we know anything, 5 is his "I'm sure ..." or "I can stay here?" And this is the end? UGH. <br /> <br /> Last I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great WTF moment. <br /> <br /> There's nothing like this wonderful hurricane except its beautiful animation, everything looks real and beautiful, I love the humble and heartfelt look of everything. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is really beautiful, it's beautiful, and it's going to throw out 9. Burton fans are sure to come to the theater to see this movie, in fact, its and Bekmambetov's promotions people will flock to the theater to see this movie, and I know that I can do something bigger, but watching this movie has different characters, a non-existent plot he has realized that I hate movies as a pure style, and this is one of those films.
