Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would shoot their heroes, if they knew, who would come to dinner tonight? Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement by Stanley Kramer's 1967 edition. Destruction today is a joke. The white boy of an extreme stereotype Italian family on Rhode Island brings his American girlfriend's home (here's the GASP) to the funeral of her grandfather. His family members' reactions were certainly ... predicted. This movie was telegraphed painfully from beginning to end, my girlfriend started a fake snoring to cigarettes to me that she really wanted to leave. Give yourself a blessing and buy the original. Make a transition to Wake.
