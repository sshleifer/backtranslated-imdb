I mean all the dark, disappearing, low-budget horror films that are waiting to be discovered on DVDs, Why choose FOREST? I love the ultra low budget for home video or other alternative free horror. I love 80 hackers' horror. I love the smugglers who have spent the night in darkness, murdered by psychopaths, killed and eaten with their fools. I'm a way to make a movie because I want to enter the industry or make a movie for the idea of ​​non-professionals working in a movie movie. I use it to make public places, non-actors, and talent behind the camera and behind the studio. NO PROBLEM! The most appropriate appearance from FOREST is that a few people in the woods are shot in the woods: We see them as small, sensitive creatures into a terrible world that they can not be above the food chain or that people can not stand on the food chain. the most scary predator. Then the film is diving and never restored - we understand as soon as we meet a pair of backpacks. They are separated, they are both conscious, and then we face their heroes. They meet with their spouses and decide to go to the camp. <br /> <br /> This movie is too slow, this movie is too slow, this movie is too slow. very boring and this movie is talking very much. The writers would not have been such a bad thing if the people had never said anything other than the most foolish, miserable and unnecessary things. The most exciting linear characters are the droopy-faced parachute, away from everyone's Cannibal Woods. And when talking about these "trees," they are far behind the cultures, leaving behind civilization as a free space behind the football fields, only large rocks and a flowing stream. The forest has primeval shooting, but there is no real sense of being in the middle of it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> Do not worry about who these pairs are and what will happen to them. Hermit cannibal slasher boy is not indifferent, though, claiming that the boy saw a freshly cooked meat off his feet to serve a split bite for his seeker seeking asylum in his cave. Her irony is an episode of "discreet". Combined with intentional tyranny synthesizer music, a movie theater, which seems to be a suspicious person, has put a camera into a dog and looks at people's movements, lack of eye, nudity, harsh ecstasy and harmful atmosphere, and we have a horror film here. /> PBS is not as strange as the educational TV's indication of how the goals work. <br /> <br /> I do not mean to "eat" the people behind this movie. in addition to nothing, encouraged them to be creative, and ended with another drill film about some of the evil that followed the women in the woods with a knife. There is nothing wrong with this concept, but what is wrong is that when the movie comes to an imprint of 80 minutes, it is an unrealized and completely pedestrian path. The best thing you can say about FOREST is relatively fast, and it is not too easy to order a repeat script - that's why my confusion is that everyone needs DVD freedom. A Prizma Video was as beautiful as the hire anniversary, with a $ 5.99 bucket charge for the DVD this month. There is little or no activity to see the film, unless you consider yourself a ultra-low-budget backwoods hacker to build in a public park, there is no one in it who can not afford to shoot there. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> In another cut and dried movie: The dwarf comes home with a local contractor to find his wife on his bed, to use his girlfriend in a scary movie with a kitchen blade with an appearance designed and put out after the intervention.The boy attacks the quarry from the corners of the corners and goes out of the quarry, with only a bigger, badger gun trail, yet psychological attacks and the boy get away. again, YAŞAYIR and once again the boy goes away, and then again, the fifth time he is psychologically extreme, as he can escape from a sort of shrinkage .How did he continue armed with such large weapons? Is there a number of supernatural elements in the film? In any case, the scene is complicated, or it is staged to form a tension. Its purpose is not yet clear. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The whole film is really a burger that can not be done indefinitely, but it does not need to be surprised by what it is and should not be. <br /> <br /> 3/10 and only enough evidence that you can cast a movie on DVDs.
