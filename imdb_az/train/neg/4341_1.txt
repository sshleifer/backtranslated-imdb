It turned out to be a DVD that was so naked ... probably half. It was so weak, and I could not pay enough attention to convey to you how much I was extending. I would like to believe that young Carlito's image will be somewhat different, but he could not get it. I really do not blame the actors, because I think that may have fallen flat. <br /> <br /> I laugh a few times, but I do not think these lines will be funny. <br /> <br /> I'm just saving grace that I bought it with 2 DVDs and paid for the original that I made for the original. This is one of the ways in which classics can stand alone.
