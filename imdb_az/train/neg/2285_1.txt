90 minutes of my life, I will not go back. This movie looks like the "California Dreams" teenage television show "Almost Famous". The player was strange and the story was inaccurate. Even me, do not start with this story in a real group, look at laughs, and so on. .. They were forced to believe that it was one of the hottest lanes in the country, and there was not enough mockery in that country. Let the world perceive it. <br /> <br /> The guitarist appears to be a heroin user, so I do not blame him if I use old wooden boards with horseback riding horses. <br /> <br /> Music is remotely taken seriously, preventing any kind of problem.
