Would not it be nice if another Teen movie really is a stupid, meaningless ending if I get more sex than big movies? In the perfect world, yes. But this is even worse. This is not humiliating for the stars, it's humiliating for the distributor. All the jokes, mostly college students, reveal what they are not interested in, yet "funny". Devon Sawa was really good at Final Destination, it's just boring in this movie. It surprises you to be wicked for this purpose. Level: F.
