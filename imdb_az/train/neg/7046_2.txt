I saw HBO spending this leisure time on the Comedy Channel, so I thought it was a very innocent and clear comedy. But nothing here is ridiculous. A good cast was mostly spent on a script I could write to my left flank - after being beaten by the 15th century incarceration torturer. The first half is particularly bad, because I'm talking to the most boring, meaningless dialogue and zero comma strip I've encountered for a while. The stars like Evan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this small movie and must say the truth in this movie that they have received less than 1,000 votes in this scenario. <br /> <br /> This is because many people have good relationships (family relationships, preferably) and / or money around money.
