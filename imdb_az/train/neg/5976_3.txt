The word is right: girls are more like kids like COYOTE UGLY. And when the plot is given, the reasons are clear. The animated girl will go to New York to become a songwriter. After the start of the imagination, some girls came close to $ 300 each last night. They sounds in the bar and they are surprised! The story is not bad, and some of the characters, especially Cammie (part of the "fashion co-ordinator" was pretty sweet). ) and unique, but face to face, the drama was terrible and completely funny before. Violet and his father were very funny when they were related to the movie. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I thought, how bad can production be? For a brief moment with this film, Hollywood stood on two legs, "You were warned! Instead, COYOTE UGLY seems to have an intention to try to kiss each big back on the globe. <br /> <br /> And finally, the music at one bar at the bar, but just a piece of paper with a "dream of ours", every guy you target has been disappointed! <br /> <br /> Finally, music, in this movie, especially when it's needed (on the hospital scene) every scene was like a few short video clips that would stop until the bar opened, but it was extremely laughter: Cyndi Lauper as a song in the 80s, jumped on the stage and stuck with Violet Heck, I personally took Bon Jovi ' I thought it would leap from long hair and dwarfs! <br /> <br /> Apart from some really smart cameras, Coyote works with her daughters while dancing (especially humid scene), Double cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is just an embarrassment, if you do not see or do not look like nothing but time killing. Or wasting depending on how you look at it.
