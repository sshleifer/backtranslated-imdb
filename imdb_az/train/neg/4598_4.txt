In London, a staging producer's wife hopes to introduce an American song and dance man to her husband's latest show and to bring an American girlfriend to a fashionable fashion in her social circles. Unfortunately, couples have already met with the girl who thinks that the girl is actually a show producer who is married to her friend (not wearing a wedding on the wedding did not actually cause any misunderstanding!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers music is eventually drifted onto the earth by a idiotic script, full of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers just do not meet "sweet" - they meet ridiculous (he tap-dance and complain as a madman to her hotel suite above her). The audience in 1935 was probably not interested in how they would come together - they were happy and happy. As it is seen today, the central symbols seem to have no motivation to end in each other's arms: they cover it with flowers (after wanting to remain "unfaithful" in the love affair department) and brush it off. There was nothing to dance a little! This glamorous pair is intentionally unreal, as is the case with both London and Venice, but we can only see the traces as Fred and Ginger. This is a fantasy for those with each other. Musical moments break the monotone of the simplified scenario, but it does not go beyond the silliness of the surroundings. ** from ****
