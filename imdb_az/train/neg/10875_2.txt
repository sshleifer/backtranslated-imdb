I've seen this movie lately and have to say that the happiness I see is the worst attempt of the movie I've seen. What has happened to hell with Coolio? Do not shoot at people who are in difficult situations. Completely unusual, slow, tedious and independent. Worse than Spawn. long dead "dead dead II".
