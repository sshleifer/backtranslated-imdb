I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (many parents say the same thing as AGE 13) with a group of school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and it fell down to typical commercial ads that said we were a great comedy. We spent about 45 minutes and are happy to leave the theater. It was strange and tasty, and Billy Crystal was too far from laughing us, laughing. I accidentally missed this review and decided to register for the movie because it was a waste of a rotten bowel. Now you deserve that you are worthy of this rent!
