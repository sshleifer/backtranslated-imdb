I got a chance once again and I leased this bag. He was bowed as a terrifying whistle, had no scene, and was afraid of a distance. ONE ONE! There was undoubtedly nudity, but all the delightful movements were a bit old. Maybe it was the grace of saving the movie? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag! From the very beginning, I knew that I spoke to Dan when I was good. And could he be intimidating? What a laugh! Generally, this movie is a terrible horror! How are movies like this in Hell? If you want a movie that is a little exciting, do not rent it. This film is about thrilling as Teletubbies.
