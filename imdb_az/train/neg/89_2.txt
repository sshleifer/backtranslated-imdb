I saw all the movies in this series. Each one goes further than books. This is still the worst. My problem is that this book is not written in any way! The directors and producers called it "something else, happy joy." There is only one thing about this movie, which is reminiscent of the book (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / age / gender of children are incorrect. <br /> <br /> I think Janette Oke, his books and his fans are a great loss to create a movie under his head, in no way is wrong. Music is too high. Players are not convinced - they do not lose their emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie you can do it. This is clean. But look, if you hope for a shorter version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie of this series, but I doubt it. If more movies are shot, Michael Landon, Jr and others will approach the original plot and story lines. The books are perfect and closer to the next, we'll make the perfect movies!
