I ordered ebay with very high expectations of this very rare and highly overrated movie. I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal fan of horror, I told myself that this was going to be great, from the 80s of my favorite American slater to European zombie films! I can not tell you how wrong it is. Above all, I thought it would be really strange. Having heard this movie, he was afraid to watch me. Crimes are weak. Actor ... forget it, there is no action! The story is pretty bad, even if we do not care. Apparently, they tried to draw attention to some bizarre scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately, they do not help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere and it's the worst thing about flickering. This is a bad film from A to B. It's funny and fun to watch with your friends and many beers, but do not make any effort to get your hands off. Do not waste time watching Necro Files, it's a lot of movies in the world!
