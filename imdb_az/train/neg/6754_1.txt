<br /> <br /> The only reason I'm afraid to comment on this movie is that it's 97 minutes of your life, and it's likely to save your money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Demir Hamilton According to the writer and director, he should be kept only until winter and then thrown to the nearest sunshine. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, you'll see where the shops are. <br /> <br /> 1/10
