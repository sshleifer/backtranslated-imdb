I feel totally destroyed. Someone has to pay $ 4.95 a lease on the blockbuster at this home. It's not music, it's just a full time spending and not tonight. Why not? Why is it primarily distributed? ... someone had taken a heavy medicine one night. I've seen better movies than film schools, and I can say one fact because I'm a movie one. The quality of this work is also so bad to see just the images taken for the DV? Nuff said. Songs are not songs, but they all sounds the same. Want to see good music? THIS FILM IS THINKING.
