It was one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I am 64 years old and a football fan. I was looking forward to seeing a football movie. When I stayed about 10 minutes, I began to wonder how such a bad movie (especially the actor) could enter a theater. About half later, I heard that I was sad and told me the facts behind the movie. Even though I was a little scared (and they were not a Christian, some might betray) in a cinema theater, this was not a big deal. However, such predictability and non-realistic behavior and, above all, the actor's quality was a great deal to be exposed. Not a movie suitable for a church trip, but in a church hall, not in a theater. Can I go to the church? Yes. Would I like to go to church when I joined a movie? No. Do I recommend this movie? Absolutely!
