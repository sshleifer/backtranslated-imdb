Okay, the film is good, but the idea of ​​transforming a computer virus into an organic virus is not a good fairy tale. This type of computer virus adds to the paranoid delusions of the murky moron, where it is like a complete organic virus. First of all, the symbol of the code is added to the computer virus with 1s and 0s. Organic virus is much more complicated, although this path is more intense. One of the simplest forms of the universe is the release of the organic virus to the cells and connecting to the RNA, and then changing your RNA code. How can such a thing come from a monitor? Maybe radiation affects the cornea, which turns your spinal cord into these viruses? I could see it, but it is clear that the writer did not think about it.
