Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis is starring in this terrific third edition, all of which are funny and entertaining, "Honey I Got Kids". The concept is primarily played in the same way as the first film, but the kids are not the smallest adults and the inner house to explore instead of the spring as a universe. If this is a thoughtful thing, think again. <br /> <br /> First of all, the sustainability of the series is completely cleaned from the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first film is, of course, Rick Moranis. The actress who played his wife changed, the actors playing the children changed, and the neighbors changed the name .... Secondly, the story is not the first, it is not the originality, but the rehabilitation of the first one. <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. All the little jokes presented in the movie (and anything else) and dangerous situations are simply transferred from "Honey I Thrunk the Kids". I'm sure that this was done with a smaller budget, but they are worse and more infectious than those that appear in the rest of the array. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem is the fourth problem to find out what's going on inside the house. drilling. Only a few things happen and they do not excite when they happen. The first film was fun, because the children were busy with nature, lawn, and insects on it. In this case, adults (who come to be quite dull in comparison to children) are dealing with dust, cockroaches and hamburgers. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​being released so quickly was appealed to Disney's managers, and maybe they should have taken five minutes without thinking about anything new. I warn you: leave these tasteless money to buy dust from the store shelves.
