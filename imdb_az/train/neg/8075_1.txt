Final Score: 1.8 (from 10) <br /> <br /> After seeing Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, when I rented this movie, I was hit by a great Eliza Shushku. A Soul Survivors, a unique "psychological tension" with Affleck (Drowning Mona) and a loved one Melissa Sagemiller, a bewitching young slasher flick, from Dusququee, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), Casey to a young, lifeless, . Luke Wilson is ridiculous as a priest there. Writer / director Stephen Carpenter's film, "Open Your Eyes" or "Vanilla Sky" and an accident / death of a character (and viewers). The film continues to create amazing images, and it creates the whole process of confusion until this alternative reality is finally resolved. In my opinion, these movies are entertaining - according to their nature - I do not think to start, but you distribute it with a slash of cheap cheap rubbish film "SS". Visuals, scripts, movements, and attempts at any originality are post-movie ideas like all these. Moreover, PG-13 does not even protect T & A as a guilty pleasure (even a non-rating version). I heard that the film is a couple of "hot" shower scenes between Dushku and Sagemiller. As the movie crashed in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost, I was looking forward to the shower room - at least I took something from it. And then we come in: two girls draw a pair of t-shirts, throw them out of the shower and brush. This is so. Did people think it was hot? "Soul Survivors" is one of those drop-down drill films, which is so poor that it is difficult to feel any part of it. It does not put anything down and it's hard to write. Finally, it leaves us empty. The carpet's finishing, burning light and pounding sound is a mess and this is probably the most vibrant part. Of course, it is possible to make handmade at night late in the US or Sci-Fi channel and the PG-13 rating - this is probably the best.
