This movie believed that he would not believe what I saw. VIDEO shot! Do not shoot a movie! I did not see the like when I was shown the nightmare of the horrors of the week in the video ...... in the late 70's early night networks. It looks like a bad soap opera and it pays compliments to it. Some actors give their best shot. Michael Des Barres is no exception to what he's given, as if he were an addict. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski, like a therapist, almost sits in the cafe for almost all movie, there is little difference in the angle of the camera. I can not blame her for weaknesses, but her role is completely unbelievable. Her little girl's voice works against her. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> Everyone he gives The line is three communication points. Anyone should be directed to him to scream at all. Finally, Rosanna Arquette turns out as a sweet, injured woman, and is probably the most convincing part of the gang. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
