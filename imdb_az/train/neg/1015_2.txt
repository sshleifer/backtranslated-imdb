Strangely ... worse than a bad movie for TV. I do not believe Spacey and Freeman are in that flick. For some reason, the character of Morgan Freeman constantly speaks and NSync says "cat" while addressing a boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calls "woman" ... What was the courageous people behind this movie? <br /> <br /> I had leased this flop with low expectations .... but many of the holes in the film would not have been completely overcome to imagine this movie along with renting, mixed camera angles, a bare skirt, and cheap background music. .. well ... really sucked.
