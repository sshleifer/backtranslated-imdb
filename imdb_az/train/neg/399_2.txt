This picture started with good intentions, Bacon scientist and Shue are in a normal position in their role to test the invisibility theory. All this happens afterwards, now the typical Hollywood movie, special effects are sounds so much, it cleanses all kinds of humor, intelligence, or soul. In other words, do not spend time following it. Get audio cassette tape with John DeLancie as an invisible man playing Leonard Nimoy's lead role. It was good now and HG Wells serves a good way, unlike this confusion.
