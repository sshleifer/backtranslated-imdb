The worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this Turks. I heard that the movie would start with the title of "Treasure" at first, but turned into a "shark treasure" to use the excitement created by Jaws. In my opinion, the shark was on a scene of this movie; it was necessary to sell tickets to enter into the "thriller". I did not work. If there is a "good" thing in the film, the crew of the ship will hit each other with a brand new beer when preparing the film. Gee, do you think beer can be a sponsor? Could they have seen her more clearly? It's just something everyone has to put out of the beer. This is enough for the holidays.
