<br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> There is a woman who wants to kill her husband and daughter. <br /> <br /> In some cases, especially the most accused young people will look at their poems ... and some of the singing and ... not really the poor child's suffering ... <br /> <br /> Sufficient clumsy, and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but of course, at least I have to sit down. I do not recommend it to anyone.
