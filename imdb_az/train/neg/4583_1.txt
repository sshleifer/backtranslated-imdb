If you want to see a smart, philosophical discussion of human capabilities and potential, follow the bright "Waking Life". "What do you say? # $ * Do you know?" In the center of attention, poorly focused, poorly-guided, weak-minded, completely deprived of any art direction, and completely inexplicable. It's not funny or small fun. The introduction of the screaming "Ramtha" in this film is enough to prevent it. How do cinematographers do not look strange about seeing this woman worshiping an approximately 2,000-year-old Atlantic god or something? What is this old chicken and what was the overall loss of my movie and my money. People who are responsible for this film should not be allowed to shoot any more.
