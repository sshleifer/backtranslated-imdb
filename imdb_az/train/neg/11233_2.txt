I can tell you that despite the previous comments made by other commentators, this movie is currently on the DVD. I just saw it a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> This value is above the DVD tag, and I paid a total of 98 cents plus taxes. I found it in 98 cent shops in plastic containers and disposable chopsticks racks. Now you do not have people who spend out of the happy coup dollars out for a limited edition edition of the Swedish dubbing super dubbing? I thought so too. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually about 98 cents. 99 cents, I can argue with you. But exactly 98 kopecks. Remember, we have to pay for it. Only for slasher movie mists.
