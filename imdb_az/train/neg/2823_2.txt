TiVo noted it according to Angelina Jolie. There were 2.5 stars. It looked promising. <br /> <br /> But Angelina has too much patience. She is about 20 years old and 16 years old. There are three symbols for Italy. Everyone is Italian-American. The native Italian accent was good, I thought. The young man is a lead favorite, says my husband. Everyone in this movie is an oily Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I know that Dick Van Patten is a randy doctor, and that's a bad sign. The two pairs of children are like the four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife would not go far. I hope he does not buy makeup, clothes, and decorations. Ugly and attractive patient and wounded union. <br /> <br /> The death of my left liver was not enough to overlook this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, give yourself a blessing and push it off the TV screen instead. You'll be glad you did. The only movie that I found worse than the previous movie was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Deadly Friend".
