<br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is not a heartthrob? He deformed. If I knew that he and Naomi Watts were an item in real life, he was interested in seeing him in the longest 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is not a heartthrob? <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was his usual genius, but he did not look like Geoffrey Rush, as he could not see. Wait for the exit. <br /> <br /> I would apologize for bankruptcy and murderers? This Butch cries out more than Cassidy. It was actually a fun movie. It was striking, cliche-ridden and boring. We stayed because they believed they would be better. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or more were funny. Heath and his family stayed in a restricted hotel, and women and children die because of their existence. Not fun. But they were funny when they left the hotel with armor because we were Black Knight from Monty Python and Holy Grail. I was expecting them to say, "I will throw my feet from the ground". Like other members of the audience, we are embarrassed by laughter. <br /> <br /> We have not lost the time for this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not give cash to see this disaster (hidden preview), but of course it was not free. It costs 2 hours of my life so I'll never go back.
