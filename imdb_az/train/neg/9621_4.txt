When I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster I was dying to see it, and I said it would be the best line. What a brilliant idea for a satire - a genre audience. Unfortunately, the finished product (I think all of these may have been possible) is not a catalog of missed opportunities, but there's a lot of speeches and thank you (very thankful!). The most striking thing is that Janeane Garafolo is really in a bad situation where he is struggling to make fun of his plain role. David Hyde Pierce is sad to watch, watching and trying to look at Castro Nerd. Molly Shannon is so laughable that he laughs, but his segment does not give a snowball to a hysterical thing. Paul Rudd had great teenage behaviors and was as sexy as hell; other children are also really funny (nerdier ones). I think the problem is the director, it just does not move everything correctly. He begins to die very much and defines the monotone. But when things do really make it ugly (the narcotics movie is the second funniest moment I've had in the whole year, the first one comes from a single movie: Andrea Martin complained about IN & OUT in the movie), it's plain funny. I did not want this movie to work so badly, but it just did not happen. Perfection and 99.9% of the costume and styling for 1981 are also perfectly used. It ends up as a mid-bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating sketch sketches.
