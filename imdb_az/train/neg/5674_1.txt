God, what happened? Uwe Boll film and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> The majority of positives are just beginning to boll. I hope that, as I liked from the previous Uwe Boll, one day will do something really good. <br /> <br /> Behold, the seed is not that day. I know very well about the origin of the hive from the beginning of a horror movie that has a seed. To remember people, because all the patients in the world are watching videos or purely different sickly ..... or Mr. Boll believes. For the first 10 minutes of this film, my life is not yet possible to understand why real animals' assassinations and murders are needed. I understand that the salient is susceptible to watching such things ... but I do not understand why Mr. Boll thinks he will shoot REAL in the movie. Maybe we have shock? Hmmm ..... well, I'm not like each other and I'm not starting to see something in the movie. I DO NOT quit, but I do not have to use the animal life in real life at least in a fun way. If you tried to shock me, it did not work. This reminded me of how the world was just beginning. Because Uwe Boll was allowed to continue the film. This context could have worked for 70/80 (Cannibal Holocaust) films. <br /> <br /> In this way, we give Uwe a very inexpensive feeling around the movie like BloodRayne 2. You can just say that there is not a large amount of money floating around for production. As usual, Mr. Boll is really unimportant To make a good story because we are being treated for the dull shots of police officers watching various videos of the victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos results in the victim's acceleration. Very boring and exhausting. <br /> <br /> If you are able to sit in the first 25 minutes, then you will be treated by police officers. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" It's a very dark home to catch the seeds, the lighting is horrible, and Uwe is old and there is a fiasco "I do not use a continuous glass" with BloodRayne 2. Look at the dead as it is dying to the point where it is drifting up to the point where it is dropped, and the police say that it can shoot and shoot it, and because of some unknown reasons the police do not shoot it. I thought it would be dominant <br /> <br /> From here we are treated on a stupid executive scene The police who buried the seeds alive (and they know that they are alive ... why they will not happen to it), then come out of the ground and then some random kill a woman with a hammer and then kidnap a boy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the Hollywood horror is not stupid .... just a simple mute. Uwe Boll can not redirect ****. Any pleasant omen will agree with this statement. Everyone who watches this movie and sees it as entertaining in any shape and form should give a serious look to a person. <br /> <br /> Once again, we looked at a UB shit, which was a bit worse, directed, lighted, produced, written.
