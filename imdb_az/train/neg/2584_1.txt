Thus, American Pie: The 6th American Pie in the Beta House series. Although some characters are likely to be associated with the original trilogy of the characters, and Eugene Levy (although this guy can not get better concerts), he has nothing to do with the original American Pie movie. <br /> <br /> There is little to praise this movie. No funny jokes. The player is particularly painful to follow his daughter with a "southern" accent, which is more commonly referred to as a hillbilly British woman using the word "ya'll". This movie feels like a fool. Why does not anyone apply to a college where no one can enter the classroom, but if everyone has a good value, girls are constantly putting their clothes in the public, everyone has sex with unprotected sex without the baby's and STD burden and can wasted everything without a girl's family photo? Indeed, this series has lowered itself to softcore porn standards. Maybe they will eventually break and Ron Jeremy will hire a new one. On the contrary, Stif's third uncle can turn it into a series when it's being expelled or something like that.
