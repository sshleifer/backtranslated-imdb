If you want to know Wendigo's real story, I suggest you get a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This film is not only bad, but it has nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a kid (EM Freeman "Campfire Chillers") and it was very exciting to see a movie based on it. When I finally saw it, it was very disappointing. Another thing is that there are a lot of PCs (not politically correct) in the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on my offer! If you see it on the video store shelf, DO NOT.
