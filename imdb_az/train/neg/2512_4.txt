Tim Robbins left here in the 1950s as a garage mechanic in New Jersey, a beloved lover of Albert Einstein's only brother. Despite being a part of time, Robbins abolishes the intricacies of his intimate personality and remains in the background (it's easy to forget!). Lumpy plays a gimmick with romantic comedy, Einstein from Walter Matthau (what can be done with cartoonishly character character). Otherwise, sugary and sunny, by Fred Schepisi, who has shown his heart, but with no mind or brain. Meg Ryan is tempting as her sister and her older brother, who loves her as ordinary clever self and her relationship with Robbins. ** from ****
