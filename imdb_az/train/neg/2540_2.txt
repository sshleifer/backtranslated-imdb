I've seen this movie twice, I thought. Then I read all the other analyzes and they did not fit well. A man and three young students, two daughters and a boy go to this city to learn the traces of bigfoot. I believe it's still a movie I've seen, although there are disagreements in the reviews. So I'm reviewing: If you love the movie "B" accidentally, like me, then return to Boggy Creek, it's a movie for you! Set up a sleep timer and hang out with your favorite movie bombs or just hang with friends. There is Boggy Creek, a quiet button and a good party. Attention! Is legend right? I think it is possible to find it with only non-solary star. Will any equipment in the film be defective, especially in key moments? Our blonde, male, young hero have any chest hair? Will the perfect hi-tech Technicolor give the whole movie to the end? You need to watch out for yourself.
