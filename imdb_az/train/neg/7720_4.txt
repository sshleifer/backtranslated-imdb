Gay-themed films are insufficient and do not have enough 'exit' movies. Each is a bad addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (although the movie looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks good on a pair of jeans REAL). It is part of a period: gay life in pressure mode (Eastern Berlin, 1989) is a life that is 40 years from the west. We see our history in a way; It might have been like gay gangs in the 40s and 50s (this was often referred to as "Brooklyn 's Last"), but it must be assumed that it sent a true SCTV, Ingmar Bergman. It's a wonderful idea that Basbug does not hack it by accident. Yes, this miracle was released before the fall of the Wall and was released, and life behind the "curtain" was difficult for gay people. A good director could have shown all these without neglecting the audience. A good filmmaker made me one of these great movies and was not afraid of anyone.
