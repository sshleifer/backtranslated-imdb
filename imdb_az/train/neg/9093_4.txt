Today, for the first time, I saw this movie and had never heard of it before, it's probably a bad message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the director himself is very good, the actors play well, and CGI (I am not a CGI fan) is spectacular. But it's not just a movie. There is no story, there is no message behind beautifully exploited talents. <br /> <br /> If I have to remember a man, the art of directors is not your vision, but only a story telling. <br /> <br /> There is a simple 4 rating.
