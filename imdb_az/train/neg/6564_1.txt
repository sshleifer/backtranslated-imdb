One of the worst films I have ever seen, most of all Christian J. Meoli has attempted to move upstairs and down the bar at Leonard, and I wanted to have a DVD on the horror of this malignant man's film. "Andrew" with Sean Astin (played a great role, did a very good job, was very bad in this movie) I'm looking forward to having a good time with Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan". Roni Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poet" (they put their name in the film for less than 1 line and less than 4 seconds) ... <br /> <br /> any pride, they get out and get all the copies of this movie and Writing / Director George Hickenlooper and writer John Enbom
