"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. They told me that the Japanese version of Matrix was some sort of thing. Imagine my dream. The film was either bad dubbing, or the sound did not have a good time with the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue is pretty bad. The English version of this film has been given little thought and has only been admitted to the concept of "meaningless action". I would like to see a movie again.
