Of course, even though I consider Exorcist a terrific classic, I must admit that I treat it as many other terrifying fans. As a result, I have not seen many Exorcisms, and if Exorcismo has something to go, I have to say that this film is a good thing, though it's boring and not like hell, it's ninety minutes! To other Exorcist hernia, this is considered one of the worst and maybe not the best place to start. It is not difficult to guess what the hell is going to happen: it's just like Exorcist and sees a demon-possessed soul that is the soul of a girl's deadly ancestor. Later the peasant priest is called to exorcism later. Like many Spanish horror movies, this is a star Paul Naschy, a pretty good thing about the movie. Exorcismo was formerly run by Juan Bosch, the director of the Spanish Giallo's "The Killer Wear Gloves". I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of it: identity is not one of its strongest points. There are many good things I can say about the movie itself; often hit only one place and the leakage scene is not worth the wait. I, of course, do not recommend it!
