I found the film for Americans who lost one of the towers for American soldiers. Every filmmaker who has come through horrific facts in recent years has been able to polemize with old facts (not related to terrorist attacks) or to criticize American political behavior or to compare different political situation to himself. There is nothing that can or will not be done with brutality.
