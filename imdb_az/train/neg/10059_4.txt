I'm looking forward to a documentary film about the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I watched a great man telling the truth about the fact that the Duke family lost the tobacco empire. And that continued. If Mr McElwee's family had ruled the Dukes, I doubt that Mr McElwee would have any problems with the number of people injured as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. I grew up in the area where Mr McElwee's family started smoking; I was waiting for McEwee's family not to pay permanently. I got very little information about the history of tobacco and I had a great impact on the state's economy by the toughening of tobacco. There were numerous references to the film "Bright Leaves" - If Gary Cooper, Mr McElwee's grandfather played? Can the audience have any idea of ​​the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by demonstrating old film clips from the film? I did not do that.
