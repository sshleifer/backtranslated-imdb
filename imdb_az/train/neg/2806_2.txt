The worst kind of movie. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma display, which for a few days deceived the museum's security. <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> Many large car batteries and an inverter would be possible, but the system would not be appropriate in this case. We apologize for the analysis, but it is not too close to acceptable. The rest of the film is not a better thing and I wonder what the budget is for good or for me.
