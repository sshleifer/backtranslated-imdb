This movie is a bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of great talent that has agreed to appear in such a unique piece. I think there are several drowning agents spreading on Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets you is that it would be good. The directors challenged the star and the subject matter became fodder enough for interest and ticket sales, but it was a flop. Many story lines go badly badly until the end of the pictures and you feel like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that is rotten. The revenge against every Italians, which was a child that could be achieved by Spike or who insulted him, is an eternal number of Italian stereotypes of obsolete and possibly attacking movies. There are some really thought-provoking and magical cameras as well as in every Spike Lee movie. For just a few memorable scenes, there is a gift to catch his mentality and transport his vision. But the question remains ... Wait for the end of your next 2 hours of scratching and watching as you are surprised by watching the clock.
