I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night. But writing to a DVD box actually links me to a potential audience when it does not show this. <br /> <br /> <strong> If religious faith is not released, do not abandon religious propaganda. <br /> <br /> Although I am a religious person, I have to agree with other posters, this film was a mess. Poorly directed, poorly functioned, poorly modified, and attempted to sound hell. The fraudulent habits were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes and the durability came out of the window. The only reason we have to deal with this innocent wasteland is that it's too late to watch a movie instead. <br /> <br /> Only you have to go to bed. <br /> <br /> If you do not have any indifferent quality, even a religious form, you will immediately support something that does not believe in the film, even if it is a pile of rubbish. If not, avoid any issues. Do not be fooled by writing the box.
