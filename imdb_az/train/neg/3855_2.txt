Only a small part of the recovery is by Larry Miller. The film has done a very difficult thing to be "something about Mary", but I did not like this movie and still could not escape these standards. Paul playing the actor was great, but Selma Blair remained in the madness of his character. James Brolin was very nice, but Paul's father resembled that of the National Lamp Vakers trying hard to become a character of Randy Quaid.
