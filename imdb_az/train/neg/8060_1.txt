What a bad, bad movie! I tried to watch it quickly ... It was a failure. After 30 minutes, I stopped the movie and went on-line to see how much this disaster was. (Just 84 minutes, Whew!) This was a mixed, boring film. Do not think anyone can be knocked down by hitting a less gutted fluorescent lamp! One is a funny thing that I watched the movie The Killer Cut. Boldly called "More Blood" in the box "More Breeds!" "More terrorism than theater freedom!" Yikes! If this film were terrible with all these allegations, how lame was the "UN-Killer Schedule"? If you want to see a great movie about the world of living and the dead, you can watch one of the nights of the Living Dead series!
