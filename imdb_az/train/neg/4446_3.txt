"Serum" starts with "Re-animator" movies, which are quite reminiscent of the credits and they have a lot of things to do. The story is very similar; a foolish physician develops a serum that thinks he believes he will reduce pain, illness, and death, but he does not seem to be a great believer in clinical trials and, for this reason, creates a brain-powered zombie with his nephew's hands. The zombie resembles one of the "Re-animators", and some of the makeup effects in the "Serum" are actually not bad. Unfortunately, the script is slow and incredible in very few places, resulting in the soap opera for the majority of the first 3/4 parts of the film. For some reason, the director is forced to let the day know when the screen is blinking with big white letters in just a few minutes. I did not see why it was important, except for attempts to keep track of the audience; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a scene full of illuminating a hospital corridor (in fact, we can see the light circles on earth), looking at the whole world as it moves in the dark with a lamp in hand ... and then goes down the same corridor completely illuminated without one of the second characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < On the other hand, it is still the tree-working (in particular, one of the leading heroes, a sorcerer!) And stopping blasphemy and writing and continuing There are unusual moments that the air does not have anything, and perhaps these are the things that people who are involved in filming eventually have more experience. One of the problems of independent horror, which is not dependent on the budget, is that filmmakers will have to re-create more popular films that have more budgets and will almost never work. It did not happen in the case of "serum".
