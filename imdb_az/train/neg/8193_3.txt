Okay, when connecting the whole family during the Thanksgiving break in the past, everyone decided to see a movie, and what we went and said because the majority of voices in Fred voted. <br /> <br /> There was a strange hole to the start of the film, it was a pity. Simple explanations of why a particular event took place was invalid. sample; heck works for 'shut down' Santa? Is there some sort of corporation? A little explanation was welcome. Secondly, the film threw simple symbols that did not give you any loyalty from your emotions or actions. For example: a small elf called Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. After looking at each other for a couple of times, there are a couple of couples, and this movie did not care about me. <br /> <br /> Third: I was thinking of being a family movie? His rating is low only in PG. There were several conversations for a family movie. It did not bother me, but if I were a parent I had a problem. <br /> <br /> With the role of Paul Giamatti through the entire movie, he looked extremely bored, but honestly, he was the only one to watch the movie. Vaughn had some funny moments, but the same for the last two films. mouth frat boy (Nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other films) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely go through this crazy, or if you want to see it on a rainy day to rent it.
