The Dream Child is the fifth movie in 1989 (generally overrated) in the Nightmare series, and most of the time the series is a total trash. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's 1984 original and the third part was the "The Dream Warriors" in 1987. The second part was frustrating and boring, and was the fourth part of the former terrible madman Freddy Krueger. it resembles strange jokes. This fifth entry in the array does not have anything to do with exceptional flashback sequences (relatively large) visuals and a creepy scene because Freddy Krueger is about to occur. The rest of the film generally consisted of our heart-clawed manicured coup d'Ã©tat, with a bunch of jackasses, an old formula, trying to escape hopeless sleep, because foolish liners and old Freddy are waiting for them. dreams Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and has been added to a number of unnecessary shit, such as a 'scary' childish mischief, for no reason other than having to do some kind of dull and late cause. In short: no originality, just a reduction in the old formula and overloading painful annoying jokes. Thanks to the great visuals of my (generous) rating at 3/10, and especially the terrible subsequent subsequent distinction, "Freddy's Dead" scares the incredible beyond. If you're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, avoid the "The Dream Child" and even if that's a bit of a frustration.
