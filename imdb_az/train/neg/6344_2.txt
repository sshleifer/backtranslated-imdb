Yes, I blew a Woody Allen movie half an hour later (I know the immorality of commenting on a movie I saw less than half, but I hope you'll understand why). Basically, they seemed too early because we would be charged on the screen: a scenario with self-actualizing points; Hannah and her sisters (except for Chloe Sevigny) were a cast of characters who wanted to be characters, and it was bad; and a camera sitting around an orange, not only to shoot a movie, but also to chatter and convey the actor. Drama? There is no; <br /> <br /> Maybe I left this job early, but from that time I decided about one and a half hours. -liner-Allen clones. Do the scenarios have funny moments? Almost entirely behind the tracks of Will Ferrell's trail (trailer-mixing)? but in a good way, there is a little speed to fly in an unusual way. No worse than that. By saying that this film is wooden, it causes a look like a gel: a discussion on the opening cafe, the worst case. What is the only thing that needs to be done with numbers? 2/10.
