This movie really does not have a beginning or an end. And really is incredible. Mary-K and Ashley, an Italian fashion company, had to be a post office worker. However, for a reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located between Coliseum Street), and all other trainees are incredibly unusual. What is revealed in this film is that one of the twins does not end with a boy. In my opinion, they are just like each other. Nice try.
