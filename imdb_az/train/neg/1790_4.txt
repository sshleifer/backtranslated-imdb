<br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> King James is not only frustrating in today's English speaking world, it's always easy to comment, not always. Can you imagine that you are trying to listen to this movie today? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has good lines here and delights like "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") also had his good appearance and beautiful, long red hair attachment. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, it feels good, and I can not beat it. Perhaps this is a historic blessing or a great Crosby admirer, but in general, this is not a lot worth of rent.
