I will not bring a child at the age of eight to see this. Listening to a frightening laugh of Crucella's babies who are trapped in dangerous machines, a small child has a lot of trouble to name a few events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Live action, I do not know what people think, but neither the story nor the actor were ordinary. These puppies are cute. But this movie is well-behaved.
