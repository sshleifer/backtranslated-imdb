The corridor of time. If you are looking for a complicated way of suicide, you can watch the movie. Are you using some weapons, ropes or gas, but you want to destroy your brain? Wait! The corridor of time is probably one of the biggest mistakes possible: Christian Clavier is eager to move and have fun. This weak thing is that I miss 45 francs: Sometimes it is necessary to zero the evaluation system by looking at zero. This movie is worth 2/10, but I love Jean Reno. It's too bad for him, he's Ron's stars. I think I will not love him ...
