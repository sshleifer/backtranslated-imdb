It starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who want to come home and (not surprisingly) guards always lock their doors at night for a definite reason. Any person, laugh, joke, and so on. This doctor tells them a conscious story of this woman and some children. They are afraid, they begin to feel themselves. No, I see a girl's dream. Later many people chatting with this great ghost and so on. And so on. Income. This girl knows that she has killed these elderly children and releases their spirits, yes, yes, blah blah. He's dead but he's dead. This evil dream goes to heaven while on the way to hell. Two survive and run away from home. The scenario is terrible, because a boy cuts his head and says Elanor (the son who rescues children) says "oh no". Acting is a wooden, bent effect and sets are recurring recycling rooms. If you are laughing mostly in bad movies, but you only want to watch it, then you are afraid of it. I was extremely disappointed when watching this. Leave too large. In this movie, my brother (very easy to be sanctified) is boring in this movie.
