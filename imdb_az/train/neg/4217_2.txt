I recently had AMC's live film classics and had to laugh. There was great hope for this adventure, followed by the Voyage to Earth's Core and the Mysterious Island. I was just amazed at the story of a five-year-old comic book, not just the acting credentials. Make sure you see the wires in the wings of the cloak that "Akar" was a half-shooter. The last "people forgotten for the time" are also open to further the same effect. Do not waste your time.
