This movie was rented by a friend. His choice is normal. First I read the cover and was expecting a good movie. However, it was a scary movie. Which will not choose. But when watching the film, no horror came to mind. <br /> <br /> It was fun, not a fun movie. Denise Richards's appearance was a delight to the eye. But that's it. <br /> <br /> We were a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this movie and judge yourself.
