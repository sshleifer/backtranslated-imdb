In a minute I'll go to the movie. First, someone asked for "evidence" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, US, claiming that he was "deserved" of the 9-11 attacks in the United States. Dear Clinton, here, said: <br /> <br /> "During the First Crusade, when Christian soldiers captured Jerusalem, they burned synagogues with 300 Jews first and killed every Muslim woman and child. <br /> <br /> < / strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , paleface means? The sea did not attack the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in fact, Clinton did not really come out and exactly "9-11. Like all the statements he made during his presidency, he said we were worthy of 9-11. <br /> <br /> In fact, Clinton's "Facts" have added up to guacamole. <br /> <However, next to this point. We are here to talk about films, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver's "Captain Conspiracy" film is shot, he can not escape from his desperate politics. Prior to paying attention to his paranoid and bitterness during the Reagan era, it was only a matter of time, and when the dash of the stone was much better than it was, Reagan bought the farm. Hinckley's assassination attempt failed to identify any dangerous areas or schemes that aligned with Al-Haig. From a simple misconception of the chain of constitutional rule, Haig really turns into a civil servant who has become a conscious megalomaniac citizenship. Perhaps he will rub his hands like Haig Montgomery Burns and say to Cap Weinberger, "Leave Hounds." Stone also calls for the most exquisite man in Hollywood to play Richard Dreyfussu, former Secretary of State. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is complete. The average is below average. Do not worry about rent or purchase. Try to hold on the cable. From 10 to 4.
