You do not have to talk much about this movie. Peter Sellers could have gone through a wonderful era, but one of the most tragic mistakes in film history. <br /> <br /> The latest film of Sellers makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> The horrible scenario, direction and shocking wooden performers come together to be one of the best-ever horror films ever to be seen. <br /> I really want to find a spark or a spark buried in this meeting of the ugly monkeys, but this is a lifeless, humiliating disaster. <br /> <br /> Peter, why did you stand up there?
