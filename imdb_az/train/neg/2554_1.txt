Honestly, I'm not joking when I say that it's one of the worst films I've ever seen! This film has a single ounce in a specific dialogue or an explicit plagiarized storyline. Even in the movie "The Omen" and other films I can not count the number of disassembled. For example, in this film, the "Lucy" beater is really one of the minions of the devil, sent to guard and protect the devil ..... This voice is Bayt Bayloka's voice to anyone. Another thing is that the orphanage was burned to the ground after a few months before it was originally acknowledged as The Omen. But fortunately, a priest survived the fire and burned all over the body .... another chance? Moreover, all the burnt priests remain in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus on all walls, just like a priest with the pages of the Bible bent over the wall. Please, I'm starting to make a comparison between the end of this movie and Omen, because there's so much to be mentioned here as I mentioned above.
