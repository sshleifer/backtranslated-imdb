TV pilots, do not you like them? Quinn Martin, after a successful group of other television detective films, is a try, but it goes anywhere outside the MST area where it belongs. Roy Thinnes Diamond's head receives orders to find Super Spy Lovejoy from Aun Mary, I say Tree. Zulu and Tso Tsing are for ethnic funny relief and nothing else. Despite all the masks that make the tree look exactly the same as it normally does, it blends in with a bad person. There is a more unusual clothing fiber that you can imagine (in the 1970s), and the show itself is so anti-climateed. Why did not he go to the arrays? As you understand, this is quite clear. Again, MST is entertaining, but nothing else!
