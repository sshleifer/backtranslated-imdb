This movie should be only 10 minutes away. That means there's really a 10-minute watching content (even a movie I'm afraid to call). The opening credits of the film were encouraging. As the film begins with a brief interpretation of the human being, it is really a good idea to grab hands and stay tunnel for more images than Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave makes a reasonable job of covering one of Cohen's popular songs. The length of Cave's activity has touched your tastes, wisely and well-spoken words that you want to see more than Cohen. But as you can see, Cave's performance does not have a minimal attraction for you to sit down, with the start of a long dull exit with no one's words. What does the filmmaker really think about? She wants to have a five-minute shooting festoon at a fake concert in Australia! The filmmaker is thinking of insulting the audience by adding "fake applause" to these unlimited performers. The film shows that it is a very small torture that is less than what you see. Cohen's past does not have a look. In fact, there are absolutely nothing in the first few days except a singer / poet! Adding all the minutes of Cohen talks can not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are less proud of the catastrophic camera case that captures some of the most unconcerned people who scream at Cohen's words. If you decide to spend your money on this movie, DO NOT! just throw trash and at least spare your time.
