I watched an episode of this program and could not even come to the end of the program. Every time I watch this program, my IQ must be reduced by 10 points. This is basically a children's program, but promises. My insults and other insults made me laugh. In any case, the story should be written by a monkey and, in fact, those who write this script should be shown with a gun to shoot a film and should make no choice but to delay the delayed, disappointing, strange program. Sarah Silvermann should really use small money from this program and take some cursing lessons.
