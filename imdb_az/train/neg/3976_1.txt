The plot was fun, the girls were painful, and in fact the Italian men had never heard of an Italian story. Someone tells boys that they are sweet in this movie, but it was just packed with mediocre people. <br /> <br /> There were no indisputable features about this movie. I think this is a cemetery for an actor who will never work and, with the exception of Olsen twins who do not seem to be surprised by any clarity. <br /> <br /> I hope Olsen finds something out of the reach of twins to get away from fun. They have no place.
