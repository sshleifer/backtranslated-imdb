I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. According to a novel by Brian Aldiss, a science-fiction author, this movie tries to explain the story of Tom and Barry Hoy, who combines twins with impresario to create a rock band. <br /> <br> The film is about half clever enough (if you pardon). The genre, mixing styles and moods (formerly known as Lost In La Mancha) loses previous films. I never knew if I had to take seriously. Flashbacks, imagination sequences, were a bit more. Moreover, promising rock and roll did not just carry me. When I found the original and moving movie in Hedwig and Angry Inch, I remembered a bit. But in this case, the songs were not just good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. A more inconvenient comparison would have been the frustration of Velvet Goldmine.
