If I accidentally hit this script in text form, I should read it and laugh. I do not want to laugh at the movie where the director did not want me to laugh. I'm not completely sure where they are. This writer will not be able to write a dialogue or at least know how to write a written dialogue, and then the performances of actors who can laugh at most of the clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so I mention the fact, but honestly, do you know any art historian who said this? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that I do not know anything about Allen's work and I do not want to start learning. Are the heroes eagerly enjoyed and try to show that we all suffer from human condition? Or, really, really bad post writing? You are the judge.
