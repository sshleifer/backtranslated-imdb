A group of forest workers and scientists go into the forest to find fossils. They eventually look at a Bigfoot cemetery (they did not notice the darkness), CGI Bigfoot's scenes are strange, but they say it's rarer than endless scenes. I thought it would be just a good Bigfoot movie. But now I'm seriously doubtful after sadly sad movies about the legend. ONE beautiful-looking girl is not just naked to shed salt on the watching film. Although it may be better than Boggy Creek 2, the best documentary film in Bigfoot remains "Harry and Henriksons." D
