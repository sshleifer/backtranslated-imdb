First, I would like to say that I am an admirer of Chris Rock. I love his other films, but this movie looks like my summary. The biggest sack. Initially, Chris Rock plays a comedian who is afraid of the stage in a Comedy Building named Apollon. While walking home from a concert while on the road, she sees this woman she loves and hits a truck. After a while, he chooses the body of an old, white, and selfish millionaire. Then she tries to repeat the scene from Jokey's original, while she is wearing the Outkast music band. Second, he returns to Apollo and tries to eliminate the white population after trying to be in his previous body. Should I slide? It is terribly harder to be as genuine as the movie runs and the process goes like a sack wrapped around. Take my advice and do not even watch this movie.
