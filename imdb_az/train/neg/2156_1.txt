I've definitely got acquainted with the fantastic book Goodnight Mister Tom for the elderly, and I was lucky enough to follow this adaptation. I heard many positive words about it, so there were great hopes. It was horrified after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was a very poor adaptation and did not leave practically 4.5 / 10 of the book. In particular, I saw many characters and some great scenes in the book. There was not much dialogue, he fled and acted very quickly, but in fact I did not see bondage and affection between William Beech and Tom. Casting was also good. I thought it would be good, but it was different from this book! Anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst I've ever seen. It would be better than 1000 liters, which would be a good remake.
