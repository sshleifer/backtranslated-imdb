My first full Heston movie. Everyone knows the end of the movie. "Sci Fi Triller". Campaign factor. Everything that went with this movie was hired for me, and when I looked in the morning, it was a perfect movie to watch the mood I was (not in the blanket). Even though I tried to figure out what was happening to end with an endless destruction of pop culture, he did not really do it. Everything was all over the place, the relationship did not have any back pain, and the end resulted in no advancement. Everything was just a terrible way, and the guards' partial disintegration after the election ended, because even though we all know that people are responding that way. Why people try to enjoy the movie for anything other than the film's quiet silence.
