This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen! Nothing to say about this movie was not good. I've seen some bad movies, but that's something. Most of the film or most of the movie is speeding up the film to accelerate the speed or you wonder what the hell is, because you can not think seriously about someone watching it and watching it. I apologize to anyone who wants to sit in this painful hour and a half. Please do not buy advice and WATCH this movie. I know it's the biggest loss of time you've ever had in your life.
