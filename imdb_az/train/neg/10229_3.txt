Based on my observations of an episode I have seen last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll be watching again. The player was completely wooden, completely predictable, the last was totally unreal - I think who would believe in a $ 30m decision for the death of a drug addict that has recovered with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) was almost embarrassed by his role - maybe I realized how bad the writing was! I understand that the proposed drama is pretty weak this season, but they can find better writers. Perhaps they write to India or China! I will not see the next season.
