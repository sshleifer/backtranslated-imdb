Wicker Man playing Nicolas Cage is not a good movie, but I really can not say that I regret to watch it. About the disadvantages of the film, as Cage's daughter is looking for her daughter and long scenes, an increasingly hallucination, and then a ghost sequence - a hallucination and so on. However, when it comes to such a film, it is not necessary to live alone. However, there are five reasons to follow Wicker Man, though this is a good reason: <br /> 5. It is difficult to deny that some really creepy thoughts are the only problem in their cheese, in a ridiculously funny manner. If nothing else, this is a movie that can inspire you to see the original 1973 movie and even read a short story based on it. <br /> <br /> 4. For Cheesy's a horror / tension, it really is aesthetically pleasing. It is obvious that this is done instead of using a green screen or a set of cuts, so we begin to see many beautiful scenery. There are many beautifully drawn pictures. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. 3. Nicolas Cage is not a very actor because he is a natural force. Regardless of whether you are an admirer, Cage can not play a "normal boy". He always has some kind of eccentricity or ugliness to the characters he plays, and personally, I am amazed by watching him in any movie. Although Nicolas Cagein is great or horrific, he always puts his unique energy into play, and he never watches. <br /> <br /> He is a spouse, but in the best way he fears. 2. Even though a student may appear to be the most powerful anti-fiction film developed, he can write a newspaper in this movie. "See?" you can write, "This happens when women are allowed to govern society!" Similarities between the "Summersisle" society and a bee colony are quite interesting and should be noted. <br /> <br /> If you can read this, you probably have a good chance of seeing a very popular YouTube video: the "highlights" from the movie, Cage running around the shoe suit and, of course, "AAGH !! BEE! My eyes! " line. These scenes are not moody from the context and they are pretty laugh when watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I sold $ 5 to the DVD used in BlockBuster ... while working, it's about $ 1 for that reason. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unexpected version of the movie is best to watch, and it's better to just watch the Teatral version to epilogue, this is James Franco.
