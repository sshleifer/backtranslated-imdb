Recently I've been trying to find humor inside the Johnny Test. I have failed. Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to be displayed by all demonstrators, but Johnny Test is "fun" in its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable and the working gags are not too gags. Kids will love it, which is what matters. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not to say that everything is bad. The original opening theme was really pretty attractive, but for some reason, they took the skeleton and figuratively split up with a figurative aluminum bat. <br /> <br /> Some heroes can be very interested in the theory. With a little work, the characters can work well together, but they are very dimensional. Again, this makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The speed is a little too fast. Episodes are very busy, spending little time in intelligent writing. This, of course, is very unexpected, there are many interesting insights revealed by the show. Unfortunately, fast-paced children will not lose interest, and this is really the integrity of the target audience. <br /> <br /> Generally, the show looks good on paper, but it's funny or funny. This is a show that I want, but it is inevitable. There are many potentials that are not implemented. Kids love it, but about it.
