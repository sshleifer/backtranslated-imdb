This movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> As I thought Lantana was great, I was really looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some speeches are good. Bad things are all about this. <br /> <br /> As you know, the story is related to some blocks going to the fisherman and discovering the body, but they continue to fish on Friday, and finally inform them on Sunday they return. for mobile (mobile). <br /> <br /> In some films, several times, different from each other, I think that is consistent, because all of them are not difficult). I was very excited about not telling how the heroes were involved, and until the film's end, I did not have until I could create a family tree unusually. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to think of us without thinking of a movie; it is a failure in the structure of the story, because the life of the character looks worse than a fishing trip. <br /> <br /> After making such a high level barman, it is difficult for anyone who has committed suicide to be short. <br /> <br /> Logic has foolish lapses. The killer dumped the body inside the lake and then dragged a few miles into the mountains. Fishermen go out in the morning on Sunday, but for some reason, Byrne goes home late at night to go to her husband's bed. The next morning, the police are throwing a knife to the station in the first place. Um, did not they hear the phone? <br /> <br /> After finding a body that is totally missing from arrest, undoubtedly discussed, at the station below, the media knows the whole story. This is a sequence - everyone can say "How do you do it?" She asks. and the audience asks the same question. (What the body is talking about is the main scene on "Salvation"). I know exactly what to do in their situation. Someone needs to go to the car, drive the cell, call the police, wait, and guide them to the ground. <br /> <br /> Only the right thing to do is that the girl was black and she was "white girl" if she was racistly captured by fishermen's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting neglect for whom the girl was killed (which I think once), and there is no secret when watching the killer in the opening scene. /> <br /> So I sit there and sit at the same time boring and mixed, when there is a twist - not a subject but a subject. Suddenly, it resembles the calm of the lonely Aborigines, which leads to a terrible conclusion that is full of some unusual things about black and white peace. Huh? <br /> <br /> According to The Age film, the Australian film is "the best".
