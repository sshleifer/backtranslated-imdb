The only reason I have already given 1 out of 10 was not to allow zero from 10. This was the biggest loss of time I've ever had. For about 75 minutes, you are exposed to WORST (and I, in a good way, have acted terribly as KILLER NERD) and is not only ridiculous, but also entirely a massacre. I even leased this jacket, because there was a headline. That is, there was only one murder in the whole movie, and that was quite an elder. You spend more time than children and do the yard. When talking about children, the little boy is probably the most uncomfortable child actor ever since he came home from the cemetery. As far as I know, the video was taken. If you want to spend your money and for more than an hour then you have to watch everything. However, if you buy hard dollar and time, get as far away as you can.
