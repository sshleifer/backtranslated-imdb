<br /> <br /> It's hard to describe this movie and wants to work hard not to leave it too quickly because it's just a movie for a 12-year-old girl ... the movie is a nice concept - Sleeping Beauty- It has a modern version. There are some frustration and good relationships with a young mother-in-law who works with a working mother and schoolmates ... you can say a good start, but then she wants to be a bit greedy, a very greedy scientist. romantic love story, fairy tale, comedy and everything under the sun. As a result, the audience felt quite inadequate. For example, when the scene (by Risa Goto) was woken up by her (Yuki Kohara) kiss, she tried to be scared to make us laugh, instead of being romantic ... this is a cheap trick. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story for half (this is a well-known work). comedy artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for his interesting and complicated stories), do you wonder if all the problems are in the original story or that this adaptation occurs? This is very unreasonable for someone who is used for the "flawed logic" of the Japanese comic book. For example, the character of Yuki Kohara is the television after seeing his live interview right after seeing the character of Risa Goto immediately upon reaching the hospital immediately (when traveling with a long bus) to escape from television cameras? <br /> <br /> There are many scenes that are directly copied from other films (very unresistible!), and all seem to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is trying to be everything, but nothing will happen ... this is not a fairy tale There were not enough jokes to be a comedy ... and there are some scenes that seem to be a strange coincidental "ghost". Nevertheless, one has managed to use some of the feelings of a Japanese youth <br /> <br /> Some films that have come up with a warning label saying that this movie may be suitable for a person under the age of 18 <br /> <br /> The poster of this movie would be resolute. <br /> <br />
