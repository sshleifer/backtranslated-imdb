British 'heritage movie' industry is beyond control. There is nothing wrong with attracting classic novels, but why should all of them be made up of unlucky generations? This film, out of Orwell's challenging novel, is a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. The 'Aspidistra' can not be the best of Orwell, but anyone who reads it can forget about the poverty. Orwell stresses the importance of being poor, not just cold and hungry. In the novel, it is a dark, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock is praying for a blast by a bomber squad. But this movie boasts something that can be troublesome in any way, and London, illuminated with golden shaft lights, replaces the 1930s with a seductive nostalgic journey, even the Lambeth slums, which are picturesque and freshly enthralled hearts and happy whores. Poems about the wind that sweep the Comstock in the garbage streets are not completely visible on the world of this chocolate box. The worst of all is the dialogue of the brutal bonhomie, ancient jokes and dialogue. It's so frustrating, because Richard E. Grant is a perfect man to play Gordon Comstock and the movie is full of great actors. But there is nothing. This movie was so frustrating to me! British literary history is something that will be proud of its richness, complexity and power. And what can we do with it? We do not want to be mild-tempered, mild-to-people, to become anodyne pope for those who want to think, "When we get a culture when we are angry and quietly salvage."
