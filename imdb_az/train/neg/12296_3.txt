<br /> <br /> In some cases, in many cases, a really bad movie, with many good moments or features. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure pregnant Linda Blair, monsters or pitchforks. He wakes up by jumping from a window and we see that he is very pregnant. She changes widely throughout the film, as she is pregnant. <br /> <br /> He is a bored and probably delayed boy who thinks he and a boy are traveling to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find little boys who are the most annoying to put their movies on! The island already has David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriends (you know Germans love Hasselhoff ...). I think she draws photographs and she translates the esoteric German book on witches. <br /> <br /> Travelers on the island were also the elderly who bought it, and their real estate agent was their daughter. Obviously, he was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy were boys of old couples. Maybe they all went to the island together, but they really looked like Linda, and the boy was different from the rest (perhaps separated). <br /> <br /> Hotel is not used for external influences, but for any major impact. <br /> <br /> A woman in the past continues to appear in bad looks and black dresses and sometimes sings something in the German Susam Street cassette. <br /> <br /> People have either entered hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are ok, but not enough to recommend the movie. Even though I'm looking at the cover I'm looking at, it's really a cut off of a character exploded in its veins. The big part of the scene is the reaction of another character because we do not see anything. The kreepiest scene is an aggression that harms someone with a human or a mouth really messy-looking wound. It looked particularly bad. Linda Blair has a laughably and painful scene that he owns. If I'm going to shoot a horror movie, he's doing something original with me and I want Exorcist to go behind (except horror words every year). <br /> <br /> In a strange way, Italian is a tradition claiming to be the continuation of something that is not related to what is AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That's supposed to be a 3rd movie Ghosthouse, La (1988). La Casa 1 and the second The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - are not related to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and better). House (1986) is home to the Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5 (1989), House II (1986), Second Story (1987), Heroic Show (1987), Fake La Casa series and series House: House (1986) ) AKA House III and House IV (1992). How is the fear show here? Indeed, it is claimed to be a claim later, requiring it to re-write itself to cause less (or more) confusion. Unusual, the AKA Horror House at the Horror Show and the AKA Horror House at La Casa 5. Are your head still damaged?
