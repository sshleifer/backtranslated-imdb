I saw the film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know something or two about the movie. And Crispin Glover's film is dirty. He is primarily a mentally challenging exploitative. The Temple of Temple is not an Anti-Christ (a little funny I have taken), saying that they have been challenged to kill each other, but it is a decision to kill snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​falling in love with one of the actors. PETA and Human Rights should be above all. Crispin, as described at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, is a 'reflection of culture' rather than abuse.
