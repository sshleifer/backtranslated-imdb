I gave this 3 stars a possible 10. Because the stories are clear and unexplained, and because of someone else's disgusting eating and scenes of rotten body scenes. <br /> <br /> None of the above should be shown in such a graphic way. <br /> <br /> As in the movie, the film is about three stories related to each other, none of which gladly yields. <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern's bounty hunter is a character that combines three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First, we are Dylan McDermott, <br /> <br /> We have one of the Hemingway girls. <br /> <br /> We have one of the Hemingway girls. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> First, we are playing a charming red head with a western woman playing on a single border to meet a neighboring woman. The end of the film is returned to the hunter who gives it, and the events that are happening with it completely eliminate the final scene of the film.
