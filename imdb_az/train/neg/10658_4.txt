On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), five of us (crying, three of us, the heavily beloved Kamal) made a unanimous decision; The VV was a strong smell, and thanks to the film that we had suffered so much until Monday. <br /> <br /> It is dedicated to the filming of the <strong> Butterfly </ strong> <br /> <br /> He is a photographer of "Tamizh Cinema", "Tamil Cinema" <br /> <br /> Now, there are 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> 1.

The songs do not help to make the story or the story spatially / temporally inaccurate, nor do you want to sit and warn you.The movie consists of four parts consisting of four songs, one of which consists of four songs 5. One the best VV is not a short story, it's 2 hours plus "tension." Here's how to use a clichÃ© Energizer like bunny and you just do not want it. <br /> <br /> the next part of the film feels like a big drift. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jotika pairing As two ice cubes mixed together, It has sparked more sparkling than a pair of pairs, and there's no reason to root them together. In fact, when they come together in the second half of the film, they give a good irritation to the story. Hate to say this, Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute romance, is more than what Kamal and Jotika have earned in this film with 'Soali'. <br /> <br /> Kamal Haasan's emphasis on Kamal is that the ambitious emphasis is that nobody will speak in India or the United States; and that's not new. 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae' has been doing this since. It just happens in the nerve. Think of the anger that might have resulted in the flames of the use of this strange accent in the United States. She does not abandon her immigration, she advised men (Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond the TN police), Kobanat ("here we are worse than a bad cop wok"), 8. Logic Defined There are a few directors you expect to be on a scale. Gautam does not care about some of the bad things he does in a robust thinking department. D.C.P, who is part of it, will be interested in his love of the streets to discuss such issues both after himself and his life! The scene was very weak inside the theater; we can sing the people behind us. "He's stupid, can not just use his Siren or lights?" (On a popular Madras road, Kemal-police-on-a-police-Jeep follows a guy on a bicycle like any ordinary friend!). "Can he use his gun alone?" ("Bicycle Man" starts and we have a fully equipped Kemal in hot pursuit). <br /> <br /> <strong> I will not vote in the voting after the past. <br /> <br /> 9. Violence and Violence If I want to watch women exposed to rape, their throats are cut off, and more women are harassed and slamming their arms, they sit at home and watch the "Police Report" or "Kuttram" . Excessive use of violence should go one way to expand the story! <br /> <br /> Part of the Gautum line appears to be mixed about what extensions (aggression, crime) and the most basic (story) are. <br /> <br /> 10. Espresso did not get the headache so a double-stroke.
