This film is basically a jeep, and this is a good reason to watch the movie because Jean-Claud Vam Damme stars. This movie has good action scenes and the best of them at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are very bad and the worst acts I have ever seen and two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not move. Before this movie, Jean-Claude Vam Dammes has to watch the worst films he has ever had, and watch him watch one of his greatest movies, KickBoxer or Ani Death. <br /> <br /> All these films are crap / ok and my rank is 10 to 4.
