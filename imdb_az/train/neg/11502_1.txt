This movie is slowly slow and there is no area. It transfers the lives of a group of boat artists. One of the elderly is sincere when considering going to work. <br /> <br /> There may be some social commentaries here, but this is a mixed blend in which someone is not painted in a very sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> 7.8 I did not understand why I decided to watch it. I watched all the elegant things and set expectations for a big fee. No chance. The IMDb rating has always been a good match for my taste. <br /> <br /> My husband Javier Barem says this movie does not look good. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> I give it 1.
