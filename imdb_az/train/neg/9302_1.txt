This movie is just horror. <br /> <br /> If you think that the "mainstream" actor should be the hottest boy, it's of little quality; actors are the worst actors I've ever seen and scenarios are not that bad. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > A married couple did not see the "mother" boy after 5 years, and even when they were back, they were not really friends. The main guy's "history" is better than a girl who just got her from work and at the bar. Now they tell me that you lose your risk of spending a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even friends. This is what we did at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this lemon. <br /> <br /> I made home cinema scary! <br /> <br />
