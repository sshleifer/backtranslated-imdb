Omega Code is an example of kinematographic inaccuracies. At first, two prophets and one by Rostenberg (once appeared and no linear) were a bit of a good worker. Otherwise, the player was pretty bad. Line line was very weak and only partly based on suspicious Biblical statement. Of course not one of the best of the year.
