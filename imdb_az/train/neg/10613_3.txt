The dance was probably something that could only be watched with regard to this film - even some of the other films were frustrating. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of movie in the world - he thinks it's a work of art because he has all the jewelry of his art. Yes, beautiful pictures are drawn, but in the end, the film does not have dance depth and tension, which is supposedly self-contained. Tango is a tease, it's hot, drama, it's brave - exactly what's not this movie.
