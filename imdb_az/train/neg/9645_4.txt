A bad season for Bollywood, around the vicinity, proving that there are dudas in the box with all the great releases with a great ride. London Dreams is no exception. Explain our dreams ... Depends on your pursuit of dreams and how far you are going to do so. Impressive sounds? But, unfortunately, it's not a movie. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make a great day. His desire is to have fun in front of 90,000 spectators in the Wembley stadium. He is joined by two brothers Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a grasshopper Priya (Asin). Together they form the "London Dreams" their dream group. After being surprised by the head of the registrar, they feel night and day. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, who does not want to reveal her until she reaches her goal. Arjun brings childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan) to join his band, who later has no ambitions in his life. Mannu is a musician and true talent, who later became a stranger to Arjun's Mannu's skill and relationship with Priya. With the help of Zohb, Arjun plans to sink Mannu. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <strong> I just felt like it was visualizing the script. In short, to cut off the mighty cameraman. The scenario of Suresh Nairin, despite the moments of the moment. Detected in a well-defined way, the scenario toughened you. The camera job was awesome to capture the beauty of London. <br /> <br /> It is only an entertaining part of watching poems. <br /> <br /> Some songs are noisy, others have noisy noise. Ajay was the one who played the show with her negative character. Salman is monotonous and you are irks. The acne is unforgettable and I will do it in Bollywood. Adrian Roy is influential when Ranvijay is decent. As a betrayal, Brinda is seen in numerous films. The ompuri proceeds with the process. <br /> <br /> Finally, put me in a simple and straightforward way, the soulless movie that London Dreams can use better than the DVD.
