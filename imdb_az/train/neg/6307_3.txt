I have to know that because of the history that prevents it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the UK. The film was terrible. The whole clich√© has no real space. Historical and technical errors are numerous. Search technical views on DE 529 or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and see what I mean. Now it's his black date in the United States and I'm going to say it's a racist, but the history of this ship is not so great. As they accompanied some escort work, they chased a "submarine" as they were a tall gravel. We're sorry, but black people have done more in the Second World War. This movie treats them as treacherous. Let's start the call, I can handle it.
