Dave goes through a divorce and recalls his first love. The word "wanders" can not be. I say he's imagining his ex-girlfriend. He remembers the relationship ends. The imaginary sequence is only flawless transitions. She likes the songs she likes and places she loves. I'm not a consultant, but maybe this was a failed marriage? Dave is going to a support group, and instead of "extinguished" by his treachery, he meets half the age (divorced) of a woman who is interested in her. Did I tell you how terrifying Davin was? He sometimes expresses himself in the third person. He does not move his weapons while traveling. It's just strange. Too long storytelling, devil's plan to hunt Davy's Marian (old-fashioned friend) and kill her plans ... to make a mistake ... to oppose her. He does it. Which was really creepy. She believes she is married, but she still flies halfway across the country to meet her. He puts his house on the ground to make sure that he is alone before he comes to the "drop". There is an unusual conversation with her about 10 words or less, ending with sharing the gospel of Christ and traveling with a young girl. We were delighted to have the film basically the value of the unwanted comedy. I still enjoy my wife with Dave's impressions .... "I've heard Dave & Mary's songs!"
