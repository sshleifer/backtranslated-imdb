If this documentary was not made by famous French director Louis Malle, I would probably have shut it down in the first 15 minutes as an incredibly boring look in the usual Midwestern America in 1979. It's not exactly a fun theme and the idea of ​​filming is like a collection of home movies. <br /> <br /> I was curious when I watched the message I wanted to convey because the lifestyle document was a pretty boring form. ? Perhaps the values ​​are not as conservative as you think - many of these vignettes were good (for example, the son of a draft resolution, Republicans and men and women thinking of sex outside of marriage). Perhaps, it was a rudeness that laid the foundations of a beautiful home town because it was briefly researched as some of the ugly ideas of financial pressure, anti-Black, and homophobia for homophobia. <br /> <br /> In 1979, a small city was viewed with great depth and a legendary world was described, but when filmmakers returned six years later, President Reagan became moody. This seemed unbearable for several reasons. First, the 1979 part was about 90% of the movie, and the last 10% consisted of several interviews with the president alone. What is the rest of this city? Did they see that Reagani was bad or that their lives were far more worse? Only a few updates caused doubts. Secondly, if national debts were doubled in controversial years, the overall national product has been such. Since 1976 to 1979, he has been described as a very optimistic period since 1979, when he (Gas, sugar, etc.), strikes, high inflation and generally poorly characterized. I'm not a great admirer of Reagan because the government's development did not slow down during his leadership, and the country was more optimistic than Ford and Carter. While many people in the press have falsified Reagan (popular sports in the 80s), the economy has improved dramatically, and the documentary seems to have been unilaterally and on the agenda. The documentary was given a more comprehensive coverage in 1985 and did not seem too negative to believe (after all this led to deterioration of his life - it became a way of thinking), I thought differently. <br /> <br /> It is not a good documentary, which stretches from a 1979 film to a highly slanted appearance in 1985. <br /> <br /> By the way, does it seem to me, or the DROP DEAD GORGEOUS movie, at least partly inspired by this movie? Both were built in similar societies, but the last film was an exciting mock without all the seriousness.
