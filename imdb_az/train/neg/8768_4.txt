<br /> <br /> The length of this movie (4 hours ..!) is the biggest mistake. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; There is no editing - JP seems to have fallen in love with Dutta project. <Br /> <br /> Even Lagana had 4 hours, but it was fun and a message <br /> <br /> It is based on real events and real people, but Kudos, but recurring battle scenes, really needed it? Moreover, attention continued to move from one battalion to another and it was impossible to watch them all. <br / There are songs about loneliness, lovership and related things in the past conflicts.It was a bit of comfort from the beginning, but then it became a monotone because it could predict the nature of the upcoming debate. <br /> <br /> Why do soldiers travel around, unaware that the enemy is approaching? <br /> <br /> A few days ago, it has been repeatedly mentioned that. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else who has acted as novices such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna from experienced veterans like Sangai Dutt and Ajay Devkan, Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention when necessary to highlight the mood. <br /> <br /> Dialogs are brilliant ("With Love from Madhuri!") Unreliable / Monotonous ("Muslim Hindustan Mein Traitors in Pakistan"). And the expletive frenzy consisting of all the MCs, BCs, Cs and F-phrases was really not required. <br /> <br /> LK Kargil tries to respect the brave Indian soldiers, but is very tough and consequently unsuccessful. Indians, of course, deserve a better visit.
