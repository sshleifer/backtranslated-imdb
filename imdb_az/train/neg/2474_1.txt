When watching this movie, I thought OK OK every time ... I was wrong. The best part of this movie was over. 92 minutes full wasting. All the seriousness that came to the best part was when Wendigo eventually came to an end, and you really did not see him. And the end of the tail was really dumb. The film had many parts you thought would have happened, but it fell down. The worst part was Wendigo then Wendigo. You would not necessarily be able to say this movie so badly for the creature.
