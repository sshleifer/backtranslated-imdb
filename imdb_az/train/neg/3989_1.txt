In their right mind, they also play the lyrical song, describing an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper finds his elegant wife in the locker room, the lyrical song loudly sounds like a dialogue, so you can hear what is watching any emotional effect that may be the scene. Annabella's scenes with Annabella's fists were a lamp, and then a belt was too loud to be ridiculous. All this film is an animated film, and the prejudice against the white is completely astounding. After Flipper's wife talked about black women with a white woman - the discussion of the Oxford discussion group is ridiculous. Rampant racism can be tolerated, but this film has noise and noise. It was a technically weak film. I do not understand the main mastery of the film, the trace of the sound, the regret of the great players trying to shoot this movie, and the desperate attempt. I apologized for Anthony Quinn, and wondered why he had a role in this lane - his appearance was painful. This is the first movie I have ever seen by the director, and this is my end.
