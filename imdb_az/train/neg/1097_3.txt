I know the US Army is demoralized by 1971, but this movie was incredible. In a Sven Hassell novel, SS should not be a criminal penalty bureau but a training camp. The writer must be a real soldier. The psychological sergeant, who continued to be beaten, belonged to a prison cell, and the useless Black Officer was also dismissed. These guys were traveling abroad, and the accepting associations, of course, were wondering where all the badly damaged employers came from, and an investigation started. The event that was completely explosive was the power plant. Farrell, the alleged barracks lawyer, would be an instructor in a barrister to issue an illegal order (to imprison captive prisoners in contravention of the Geneva Convention), an actual attack on a person involved, sexual harassment and behavior of an officer. Intead just steps away. After that, discipline falls to the material level, and the film becomes inseparable. I do not know how it ends, I went to bed.
