I'm a true admirer of the original Cracker series and have a DVD. Kreker had a tendency to coincide with the occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and other actors and writers always do it themselves. I think the original Cracker is a series of major Brit TV series of that era and has some serious competition: Chief Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes and many others. <br /> <br /> The New Terror is even more sad ... <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a very pessimistic imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit down and really thought that it would not be that bad, and that it finally covered a spark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Hill: The innocent of both crimes and the killing of an English Junkie is "understandable, but not justified" in Fitz's words. I thought, "Did I throw two hours to hear this disgusting knife?" So, I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone brought by my faith ... Outside of politics, I was aware that this Cracker was a boost to the propaganda and that's really, <br /> <br /> Two, Robbie Coltrane- how much air time has passed? Fitz was a little player in this one, as though he had been stuck to a story written without any idea of ​​Fitz's role. Coltrane could have taken his show on its wide and still appropriate shoulders, but the writer was thinking of other things and missed his chances and wide margin. <br /> Thirdly: An ABYSMAL AWARD! Some sparkles and a few bits of actual character development (Fitz's son could not stay home when Fitz's kidnapping his plane in Australia), weak performers, heads, and several old sparks between Fitz and Missus), but enough to carry a tiring storyline is not. <br /> <br /> Fourth, hell was a panicked one? Now it would be interesting ... Later, he was Manchester and would have been 10 years old. <br /> <br /> I thought of AH-HA when the ad was posted on BBC-On-Demand after the ad was "Director of the Sadness", as it was released a few days ago, as the BBCA had come together with his wife) !! The cutting edge of the Director, who was temporarily paid, would see this night, but never showed it as an interesting story. Unfortunately, after being convinced of myself to sit in a terrible free version of "New Terror", it's worth seeing, looking at something, just disappointed, in fact a second, potentially longer and tedious version. At the same time, I thought the BBCA was sliced ​​and cut and I thought to sacrifice the show for placing an infinite (every ten minutes or more) ad flow, and then when should I return and read it? <br /> <br /> The first excerpt from the "New Terror" review: "The first alarm about Robbie Coltrane is committed to delivering this revival by BBC, the flawed, lying, Serious criminal psychologist, heavy-handed political statement writer Jimmy McGovern. In his message, the Americans dropped a brave figure-pambler, McGovern's chest-painted narrative, and forced Fitz to do the job. "
