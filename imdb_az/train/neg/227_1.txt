Was this a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with a light hearted joke of three women. Beautiful. When faced with a woman among women, she goes to a conflict between women. Beautiful. There are several antiques among them. Beautiful. However, when the plot is finally black, I begin to wonder if the first part of the movie is misinterpreted. This continues for a while, and eventually tries to get back to the original light heart. But it was too late now. It is difficult to see these women talking to each other and that the final is unsatisfactory. How to really film a movie (also for English film artists). It's hard for producers to see how this film is happy with it. And the bureau proved to be a real flop because I did not hear this movie until the end of this week (four years after its release).
