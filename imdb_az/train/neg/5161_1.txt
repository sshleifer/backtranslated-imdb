My life is to save animals. I work voluntarily with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian, because I did not kill an animal to continue my life. I can not even kill a spider, but I put it in the open air. The scene where birds fled to the rocks until the day they died, made me sick with Sooner, who took part in the adoption of other children and insulted me since then. It simply impresses me that the need for people to accept is quite miserable. Last - parents often take their parents - do not pay for animal abuse. Why does everyone want to see their children in this movie?
