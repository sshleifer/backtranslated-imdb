In 1984, this voice of "Gremlins" was definitely the biggest train crash ever recorded. Even for all the other cheapest fear movies on the same platform for a 'B' class movie, this film is completely complicated in terms of plot, action, and goodness. <br /> <br /> He is a casual old security guard and a young panker security guard who has no significance in the name. Why? <br /> <br /> A few minutes of the film is killed when he is in 'banned' security and fantasy to be a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just an appetizing diet. The main course is completed. The main character, KEVIN, struggles at different times to prove itself as a cats more. Maybe it succeeds in the film, but the viewer does not look like nothing but a bad actor. Kevin hires himself to work with an old security guard, and with his safety change in an abandoned studio lot (wait for him). Yes, why are you worried about creating a set when using the studio itself? Return to the movie. Kevin opens the banned safety and leaves the Hobboblins in a way. Hobgoblins force people to experience the most wild fantasies and then kill them for one reason. They must return from the sun or something else ... or what else? <br /> <br /> Among other characters, Kevin's "ma√ßo" friend NICK, Nick's "Ms" DAPHNE, has more of his character than prostitution prostitutes and prostitutes. Kevin's manipulative and 'guarded' girl friend AMY has the deepest desire of her to appear as a Cher, described in a similar way to purple socks .. plus a pair of blue gray dresses .. Do not ask me how it works. Perhaps the most entertaining character is KYLE. How are these friendly groups being prepared? Kyle is a devious dragger who can not go for an hour without stimulating himself. <br /> <br /> Detainees are looking for Hobboblins: knee-length creatures (aka hand puppets) have tried to travel more than one person's homes, some, more than the local neighborhood borders. <br /> <br /> Generally, every single character lives in the most strange fantasies of the film, which has nothing to do with millions of dollars and has the largest budget. <br /> <br /> CLAIMS WARNING AHEAD: This film is about watching the movie "What?" will defeat the question. Hobgoblins return to safety with their free will. Perhaps they had lost patience waiting for the sun to come out, or maybe the story writers had cramps of writers and decided to worry about the end. After returning to safety, an old security guard exploded explosive explosives and learned to break off the end of Hobgoblins and these rocks ended the coastal journey; <br /> <br /> It's enough to tear one of the real evil of this movie. If you're planning to watch this, I advise you to drink a few alcoholic drinks before taking up the movie.
