Clint Eastwood's romantic drama, a golden hippie (Kay Lenz) and a Los Angeles Real Estate agent (William Holden, surprisingly well-arranged in this highly-arranged arrangement). The scenario is small, but without some thoughtful passages; yet, the scenario is such a middle-aged clich√© that most of the picture is generous. Holden and Lenz do not look good (it's so flawless that it looks like a castle on it), sincerely worries about scenes, just worries. Dated, blurry-romantic and very unmemorable. ** from ****
