During the first 3 seasons, Fairly Odd Parents were tough, like sugar, bright and sweet and addictive. Now Pepto-Bismol is delicious. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol will be needed after watching the latest episodes of humiliation and violence that substitute all the desserts. Cosmo, one of the more beloved Nick characters, has become an aggressive cretin who does not even want to know the cast of the Guy of the Family. Timmy was an unhappy, arrogant betrayer who gave Bart Simpson the beat of the bone (and would have beat Timmy's calmness a lot). And the poor Wanda ... a real charming to be a victim of his wife and goddess, he labeled "nag" for taking care of others' wellbeing now. Cosmo's foolishness affects everyone, but not punishment for it or learning lessons. Butch Hartmann's attitude towards children is quite extensive: they are raw, vulgar and not very bright. With Butch Hartman's lover, Danny Phantom, this dull curse was canceled. At least Butch has what's worth it - Cosmo is different.
