THESE RULES OF THESE REASONS. IF YOU DO NOT PLANNE THIS FILM, SEE THIS OPPORTUNITIES. <br /> <br /> Kids today are TV problems. He is the most generous and praiseworthy. "Wow, that was fun, or not?" No, it was not. And, unfortunately, it also includes children's films. And what is the "Flight of Coachs". Of course, for a few years, I have not seen "Flight Operation Flight", so I can be confused at some moments, but since then I have not had a full impact on everything. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story is a teacher who gives a book for the following Christmas. Now the teacher is a respected scientist of flying habits of some animals. I think it was bullfrogs. In any case, through this book, the teacher / family brother can fly in the same way as wheat bulls. Undoubtedly, this book was written by a scholar several hundred years ago, lost in the North Pole. Now, if he had been with me, he'd throw the book out of the closest window. Flying bulls are naturally occurring phenomena, but the flying northern reindeer is a fantastic and completely non-realistic concept. But the Master teacher did not care about me, so he alleges that he decided to fly away to the north pole leaving his wife and child away without thinking of what he had fled. Of course, everything is inevitable, and before flying, a flying boat fell into its own plane and remained stranded on the North Pole. Well, good. <br /> <br /> His family is certainly damaged. I can be, that is, what a bare Christmas is. In other places, Mrs. Ms. Finder immediately finds himself in a hidden city in the North Pole, a red-and-white IDP and an oppressor. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I did, everyone greets them with open arms. Midget greets the secret civilization of these monsters and open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They consider this story as the elves of Santa Claus and carry toys for children who have no ideas for years. And the teacher accepts all of that. Even Santa Claus accepts that he is actually a scientist who died two hundred years ago or nothing. There is only one problem - they do not want to leave it. The world does not know the hidden existence. <br /> <br /> Now, the nice guy's family is talking to me. book and the North Pole. My son, if they only learned that they were going for a short walk, would not they be embarrassed? If the audience knows this, they are compelled to spend Christmas holidays on the planet's most original winter wonders. At the same time, Mr teacher decided to leave all the uppity midgets sick and leave. I do not remember exactly, but I urge him to take Santa Claus. Firefighters attacked attacks and tries to escape Santa's tent. Despite the blood shedding at Santa's eyes and bloodshed in his eyes, Mr. Mr Blair, with some surprising enthusiasm, blew himself along with his family's plane. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, he jumps to his plane, returns airplanes, and everyone lives happily after that. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are some shocking films that have been filmed for years, and this charm of attraction gets out of him. And it's a ghost that's completely deprived of the 'Reindeer Flight'. nothing that is offensive to intelligence (well, obviously, but this is a child's film and hence it can go away from such things), or something particularly aggressive, but the problem does not have much in this regard. This is not just Christmassy FEEL. And for a movie about Christmas, this is a pretty big flaw. But hey, I do not think the target audience of the "North Reale" can think about it? Why They Needed <br /> <br /> I give them all three of them. If it were a television movie, I'd add two stars. We all know how to get it.
