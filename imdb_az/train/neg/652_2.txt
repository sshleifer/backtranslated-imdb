I had an overrated PG-13 crap that I think! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good, and some people like IDRIS ELBA were good, but some of the other young people were not convinced like friends. The murderer was terrible and seemed stupid. Deaths were foolish, boring, and totally unoriginals. The film was very boring and very overrated. It's not unbearable, I almost fall asleep. Its another evil PG-13 remake, really a genius movie IMO. The end was very foolish, and the climax fled and was bored. The movie is also quite slow. Overall, the only good thing about this crap fest is perhaps BRITTANY SNOW I think I gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but along with it was a completely scary movie and terrible remake. Well, that's just my idea. I gave it 2/10.
