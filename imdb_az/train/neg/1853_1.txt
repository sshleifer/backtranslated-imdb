This film, without any correction, was this horrible disgust at the burning pit of hell, even before the author left his head. It is impossible to come up with enough adjectives to describe this film. But let's try it anyway. Terrible, bad, insidious, tasteless, painful, vomiting, intestinal, bad, bad, ugly, ugly, english does not have enough words! The "plot" consists of a series of trams that have become a snowman. Do not ask, how important it is. The Killer snowman is trying to kill people. How can the snowman kill someone if you ask him? If you do not just have to endure Styrofoam's snowy habits, it's tasteless to try to pull your eyes off. Ways to fill your ears with warm wax, so you no longer have to endure snow ants. Do not watch this movie! Destroy Your Sight! Do not Follow Him For Your Soul!
