What is the purpose of creating such films only? profit? and who is referring to intelligence that he should use his brain to look at something similar? If this movie is watched by children under 3, adults do not try to watch it. I think Hollywood began to use animated films in movies with similar actors, forget about cinema art, and you'll be a pop-saver that consumes tons of time to finish the movie, and make sure that many coke burgers can be easily used in a restaurant for your laptop phone, Although not in a theater, while watching the movie, my dog ​​was always next to my family building. Make sure that this is a movie, the demands of cinema. The only thing that can be used in this movie is to watch it on the supermarket's shopping list. I give 2 stars to support the Indian cinema's efforts, but there's nothing more.
