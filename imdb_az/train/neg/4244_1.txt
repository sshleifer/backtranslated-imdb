Unlike my principles, first of all, come to a conclusion, because I have seen this art only "art" and still live with impressive impressions. <br /> <br /> This movie is really horrible and I never never write a word about it. "44 Minutes" has rarely been a death to me. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the movie? - How wrong is this movie? Luxurious name - "44 minutes". The first one is thinking about "15 minutes", which is a better movie, but in my book it is still bad and can be compared to some extent. But, like luck, their shared things are the worst features. Both of them are owned by Mr Oleq Taqtarova, who meets expectations and prejudices, which are well-known by the powerful Russian accent. Its purpose is to resort to a cold war wave. Oh, do you miss the good old times? Now, I'm not saying he is a bad actor, I think he is still a real performer, but here's not just a real person, more like archetype. Still, it's not entirely up to me to be in such a thing. Here we know the modern American xenophobia. In the film, Taqtarov tells his comrade that the Romans are not Germans and that he is really laughing in America. What is the greatest desire of the unhappy prayers to be "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is a media issue. Yes, as we have seen, most of our learners are cameras, interviews and journalists. The director had to feel the 44-minute rhythm. Instead, he is trying to repeat his wheel, and, as with a cheap television show, he draws us with interviews throughout the film. A 15-minute media theme is a central point. The goal was to provide a teacher with a request for a student, but for a further 44 minutes, we thought. So, I tried to figure out the purpose of this film. What is this? To provide a good time for the audience? To glorify guns? For the glory of the police? Describe violence? Yes, the officer gives the Bible to the captives. So, should it improve peace and understanding? I do not think so, but do not ask me. <br /> <br /> Because, Michael Madsen. I acknowledge that I am a big fan. I hoped it would be a brilliant point, but I was wrong. Although not his fault. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, compared to the "will of fire", the last note was one of the worst lines I've heard. <br /> <br /> Summing up, on 1-10 points, I'll give it a clean, uncompromising one.
