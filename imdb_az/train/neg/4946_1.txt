Undoubtedly, I watched this piece with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen's lack of talent is more than just ego-size, not a very good composer's parody. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon movie I watched 100% humor free. It's rough, offensive, condemned and definitely opposed to women. This is a creativity worthy of Bohlen, but the average viewer will extinguish it more. It's no wonder that a movie theater does not show up: BIG time bombarded! <br /> <br /> 6.5 MegaEuros's costs did not believe in such a thing. Get rid of it ... and money!
