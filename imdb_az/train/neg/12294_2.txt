I watched this movie just for the reception. He was taken to an old hotel with a friend's shares. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's too much. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: I remember many, they did not even have the full potential of the hotel ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula, with a falling wave about 1/4 mile you can go to the gulf, which is really the first thing that wind is blowing in the morning or at night late. <br /> <br /> The best is to see this movie at a distance that is in your hands, so you can move forward with the move forward (and I use this word softly) Stop the scenes and the beauty of the surroundings!
