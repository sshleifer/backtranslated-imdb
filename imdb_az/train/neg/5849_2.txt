For the first time since being a fan of silent films, I was looking forward to seeing this photo. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> As noted, the movie Maxwell seems to be long, long, commercial. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, if the scene of the discovery is about half of this half, I'm more than happy to have the movie. But the old was too fast. Despite the fact that the reality stretches several times in films, what has happened to Mexican gangsters without reducing the audience's enjoyment? That is, they follow a car in the mountains, most cars have a car that moves about one mile per hour, but they can not catch it?
