HORRENDOUS! Avoid as tuberculosis. I appreciate it in the top 10 best films. Special effects by day care students, moving, mood, sound, and so on. Wait ... wait, I've seen better than the apps. The dusk of the shower surface opens like a mild porn show with a naked woman, and then gets worse. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems were sustained throughout the film. Sometimes I swear I've heard the cries of camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see a movie about this story, but it is done by different people. The actors and the crew need more lessons and lessons in filming. From 10 to 1 voted.
