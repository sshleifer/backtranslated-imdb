Phantasm .... Class. The Phantasm II ..... is awesome. <br /> <br /> I would not want to be prepared for this film, though I can not do it alone. The movie appears "sold". When there is a recording of other films that occur in the first place (something else is missing). Also, many incongruous characters, the first examples are children (a crack shot, initially funny, but soon you're dead), fighting the ball using karate (not working), and blossoming zombies (what's hell there, other Phatasms has nothing to do with). <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: <br /> <br /> For me, it looks like a filler between film II and IV and causes additional heroes to continue until the end of the 4th IV IV IV. <br /> <br /> Generally, it will VERY LOVE.
