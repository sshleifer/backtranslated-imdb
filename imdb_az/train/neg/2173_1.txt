If you rent a movie called "The 3rd Exterminators of the Year", you know yourself well. I sold myself with "nuke mutants", "motor-psychos" and future promising images, and of course, the "destruction", which grew younger all around post-apocalyptic Wednesday, was disappointing. Bring the perfect hijinks and low budget buffoonery - at least this was my hope for the "movie". <br /> <br /> Now I am fond of horror movies and Exterminators are probably more than 3000 per year. So I called this movie a solid "1 (terrible)" - I do not hate it completely, but because it's one of the most legitimate horror efforts I've ever seen. Dialogue, moving, cinematography, sound-editing, generalization, sky and so on. Vs and so on. - If this is a beautiful name, the audience deserves to have a low expectation. <br /> So what's really good about this bad movie? There are several things that my lover's lover "kills quality". Killing a person is not a difficult and fast process for those who are less familiar to you, but only to a person who is generally killed in a horrible, creative or laughable way. <br /> <br /> Exterminators are the "dialo-so-bad-it-becomes-funny" fair supply, which is best provided by Crazy Bull, the best part of the year 3000, in the best way possible. kills quality (Think again, if you're hoping for great things from nuke mutants, plays a zero part in the movie ... shucks!). Crazy Bull is all you can ask for b-movie motor-psycho. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> The film, The Exterminators of the Year part of it is disappointing, so it is limited to something that is frustrating and outdated, quality killing and bad dialogue, not just enough to justify full length, but forty minutes or a hard and boring car in a long and ugly sequence of listeners they have to watch the characters inside ... All this is a pretty good terrible movie, but hey, Death Race 2000 is not.
