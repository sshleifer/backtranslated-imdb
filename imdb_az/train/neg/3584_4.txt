Curiously, Jim Benson's "Buddy" through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope, Rene Russo's eyes and mouths, which emerged as the centerpiece of Jim Henson Pictures, is not Buddy the Gorilla's. As a result, Rosie passed through numerous post-production stages, and he has filled the poor monkeys for many times. Davies Lintin of Gertrude "Trudy" remembers the memories of the spouse of a wealthy doctor who makes pets and darkness for wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it is severely violated. The film is not glamorous with the "family movie" magic attraction and long ago people and animals were clearly programmed (nothing here actually feels). Within ten minutes, two chimpanzees take the Russo cuisine and roll back the butcher knife (Alan Cumming does not lose his head); But because of the fun of a day, the eyebrows are not lifted. Still, the full-grown gorilla Buddy is called by the police while barefooted during a storm, and everybody looks at Buddy from the window when the living room furniture is demolished. Furnishings must be at least the worst of anyone's worry in this horrified, unsuccessful failure. But at least Russo was in good hands: when director Caroline Thompson needed a good pick-up shot, she unstartled Rene gives another extreme close-up. What do I think about lipstick's picture? ** from ****
