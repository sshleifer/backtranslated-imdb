Before you begin, Eddie Izzard. I think it's one of the most funny stands around today. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Everyone knows her as a totally irresponsible comic and we all love her. But at Circle, he seems to have no contact with the comic and seems to have completely lost me in places. He recalled many of the topics we covered - even though I think I've seen some recurring jokes out there. <br /> <br /> If you take a DVD, you see a sense of relief at Eddie's tour (interesting, but not very funny) and one of his shows in French. Die-hards likes to see Eddie in a different language, but subtitled comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of Eddie or you already bought it, or buy what I said. Just go through Glorious or Outfit for clothing - you will not be disappointed. With the Circle, you will probably.
