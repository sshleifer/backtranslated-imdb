I only leased this movie with the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I think that this movie would be good after seeing RR's name on the cover (as an actor). If Rodriguez lends money on his behalf, is it a good thing to do so? WRONG WRONG WRONG. Worst regulator since Manos Hands of Tale. The edited method did not make any sense, and it was not possible to watch the movie and you would not want to follow it after the first 30 minutes. I did not have any idea how Dafoy and Rodriguez were involved in this film, maybe someone owes them, but there is a good way to do it. Moreover, they were in this movie only a few minutes and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you do not want to see anything other than being a bad-looking, bad-looking and confusing movie, you just have to be warned.
