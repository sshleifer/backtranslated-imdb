I thought the film was a poor document. The article did not discuss anything. It was necessary to reduce these ideas and did not give anything new. There is nothing miraculous or romantic in the film, or something that really does not bring science. Many scholars were "stereotypes" and sometimes seem strange. A woman said that her rewards did not help much, she just helped the children. He said after a 10-minute scene that he announced all his rewards. Do we play "little scientist"? "There are equations that dance in my head," he said. I do not see anything explaining to me. Science has no significant effect on our culture. <br /> <br /> Not a bad flick for 10-14 years old. <br /> <br /> <strong>
