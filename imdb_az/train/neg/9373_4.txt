Martin Kosleck's peculiar character brings certain certainty to the character of the ridiculous artist. He repeats his dialogue with the feeling of realism, the sculptor Marceli is a convincing individual. <br /> <br /> The storyline is nothing to write home, and many scenes are boring. What does it work? Strange chemistry, like the creeping between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton. Kosleck's speaking, philosophical character, contrasts with Hatton's low, monosyllabic approach. <br /> <br /> The character of the heart drive does not develop much more than the main monster level, but Hatton offers unprecedented opportunities and is interested in his back story. <br /> <br /> This film is a Shock Theater kid, so there is a certain nostalgia darling. Forties are worth seeing once for those who love horror movies.
