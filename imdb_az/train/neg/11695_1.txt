It's bad to call a movie like "Thinner" or Pauly Shore is called un-talent. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, the book was very good, even though it was a bit derivative from another story. "Be careful about what you want". Burke plays a gnawing lawyer who killed a gypsy girl and cursed his father (Constantine TV's "Room 222") a few cents a day. <br /> <br /> I said that this is a good job, but why is it included in the Mobility (Mantegna)? Why do you burn automatic weapons? Why do you turn it into something heavily dependent on FX? It would be more effective to focus more on weight loss, illnesses, deaths, gypsophores, and unique properties. <br /> <br /> But this can not be. Remember, Stephen King, we talked about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... is almost the same as the book, but it is talked a lot. In fact, the whole movie is talking very much and every area feels it needs to be explained to us. I did not expect the Dead Zone, but I could do it without another Pet Sematarium. <br /> <br /> A star for trying to do at least a half decent makeup job. However, the rest of the film was left ... tell me ... "Thinner".
