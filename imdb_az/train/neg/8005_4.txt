Gwoemul (The Host) - A mutated animal rattles for the pollution of the Khan River. Park's youngest member of the family has been taken away from the animal and remains to find the rest of his family before the animal's last meal. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the monster films: Mutated bears, multi-dimensional crocodiles, komodo crawlers packages, a lot. Creature features are my favorite Horror movie. So, I really like Host, but it did not happen. <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Very damned genres. He took himself very seriously to become a comedy and was still very light to have any real message (though he tried to make a statement, anti-pollution, anti-American and anti-government). Secondly, after the first monster attack, almost nothing will happen for the film. The central family is looking for themselves, and Korean and American governments seem to do nothing. And therefore, they are just kidding each other, perhaps for a little comedy aid. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Finally, the movie is groundless. It does paint Americans as dull and bad, but gives us a cartoon character that is not deeper than a cartoon. The opening scene has the most obvious American and wise Korean memory. The Korean morgue assistant asks his boss, the coroner, to pour chemicals on the Khan River. Maniacally spits when ordering the American doctor to continue his assistant. It's neither racist nor lazy, and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the monster is a mix of good, kind, The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the effects of the action are quite cool and the first monster in the park is a lot of fun. There are some nice pictures in the movie. Someone is, in a strange way, a Firefly film reminiscent of shooting (cameras shooting, attention, etc.) .The hero and the little boy have a wonderful scene at the end of the rescue, the family 's mobile dining stop. <br /> <br /> This is the night time and the snow falls, the street lamp gives a cold light, but there is a shimmer from it. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm really disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a good live flick and instead of taking some pseudo-political, horror-comedy lite. I can not help looking at comments on IMDb, but if it were a US production it would have been planned. Not just because of an external whistle is not good. In recent years, there were some nice films from Korea (such as the trilogy of revenge and brotherhood), but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was good at it. Directing signals, scripting, and making it a great movie. So it's not worth the few hours of a few hours.
