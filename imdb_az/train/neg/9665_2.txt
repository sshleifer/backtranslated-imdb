Interesting? Very hard. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the film is to provide 'scientific evidence' of the fact that Jews are cancerous, stupid and naked, almost laughing (we do not know what's going on in this period). <br /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine Germans (even in this terrible time) believe or believe in this movie. Compare Riefenstahl with Triumf des Willens. Now I'm very impressed with this movie. <br/> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> - It's a mole and a killer. Only a bad mind can do that in the eyes of the filmmakers. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hit's favorite movie M? Not known? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even in this genre of propaganda. 2/10.
