<br /> <br /> One of the first and a few film classics is the label line for this movie. Home If only three and four, a good movie, if you want three! As long as Sharkboy and Lavagirl try to be so funny, this is not it. Alex D'Linz or something else instead of Jack. He is a very mild player with gentle performances, but not entirely his fault, writing is a challenge for mild words and mild expressions. The crackers are copied only by the fraudsters of the first two, and we must be blind to think that the chicken pox is real. If you are a good choice, you will become a preschool teacher showing this movie on a rainy day. And to do the worst things is a completely different toy, look at me, but you'll regret it.
