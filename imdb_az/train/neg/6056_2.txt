This film is a lot of disappointment ... Most of these "horror masters" are horrified by their sub-par effects and laughing story characters ... Ron Perlman, in this movie, everyone moves to save their lives ... Bop-boom played something like someone playing and sounded as totally unrealistic ... in general, this film is just as scary as the home ... Only the best masters Cigarette Burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how some of these directors will sleep at night because they know that the genre they really understand is corrupt. .
