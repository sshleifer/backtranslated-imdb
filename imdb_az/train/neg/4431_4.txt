This agonizing comedy drama led to surprisingly striking assessments in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times movie section and looking at a two-page ad for "Chapter Two": "Better" Happy Girl! " and "Neil Simon is back!" What does Neil Simon do? It leads to autobiographical situation (reuniting after the death of a beloved wife) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and worst - unfunny. James Caan Neil - plays ... this is George, a writer who can not survive after losing his wife; Marsha Mason (real life lady Simon ... wants to get into the old lady Simon soon). Mason was very attractive here and could save the day for Caa's indifference (it's not a sub-plan of afflictive, blond blonde Valerie Harper, which leads to the denial of the proceedings). I love Mason's explosion ("I love it, I'm NUTS!"), But I did not see a happy end to these two people ... and time proved to me right. ** from ****
