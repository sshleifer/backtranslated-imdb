This strange movie is the reconstruction of the 1927 movie. <br /> <br /> What are some bombs? Douglas Fairbanks does not leave any dates here. Cesar Romero's role as a real horror and Bette Grable singing with chorus - What will I do in Hungary? <br /> <br /> The funny town draws a picture with a woman in a castle. 1561 Saved his day by killing the Roman winner. (Fairbanks) Now, let's go about 300 years soon. Graf married Count Romero, was occupied by Hungarian soldiers on the night of marriage. <br /> <br /> Romero is scary, and the army escapes from arriving. Hides himself as a gypsy, and his violin Feyrbanks are prepared to stay in the castle when he is happy. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in 1948. This poor imitation of the film took place in 1948. Harry Davenport is a veteran supporter who died in 1949; It should be his last film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Costumes are more like appears. I do not understand what Fairbanks is wearing.
