The first few episodes seemed encouraging when I first watched the show. Bill Compton introduced himself as a stereotypical "mysterious" vampire, and Sookie introduced himself as an independent woman. But this show was downloaded down here, and once an interesting character was fun as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> The story loses its major characters, losing its identity and movement abilities. On Episode 5, Bill's naked eyebrows are so low that his face is only his forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is more dead than the vampire love. All these tragic events cover him and he happily loses only his sister. Personally, I think that the main characters are lying too early in the show. Something that contradicts each other, closed me and could have been a little more fun. After Sookie's disappearance, he stands around a common ditz, thinking of Bill's libido and its size. Bill loses his attitude toward himself and is good, he's just silly. His actions are not really disclosed, except for Sookie. Why? Love for one another is not delved at all when there is no love. <br /> Yes, vampires are usually sexually equal, but come. I continue to breathe every five seconds.
