Fighting scenes slowly move as Jackie Chan, and the attempts of the mind are miserable (worst penalty: "What do you say? I heard you came this time"). Stars are incompatible: Brandon Lee says, despite the terrible lines, actually shows the traces of charisma and screen shouting - Dolph Lundgren is absolutely free (at least in this film). In the director's note: Stay away from any kind of love in the future, especially when the main actress does not have nudity and needs to rely double on one volume. (* 1/2)
