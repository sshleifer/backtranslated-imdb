<br /> <br /> I thought it was necessary to write a review on this site, but it is very worthwhile if the film is so badly created and appreciated by its product. <br /> <br /> A part of filmmakers in Palestine to show frustration and discredit. We discuss the grief that we feel through the oppression, but the film is being shot and we think that the weaker population is a Jewish Israeli population. Parallel to the position of the Palestinian young man we do not see any evidence. We only talk about other Palestinians in prison. I understand that there are restrictions, but the political nature of the restrictions is designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I felt the film's mother's screaming and totally closed mind. This is what we need to talk about at the edge of the wheel. The bomb did not want his father to see the harm of his parents, and the angry and closed words led the spiral out of the last meeting. I think that in my opinion, it is more realistic to see the Israeli mentality as the root of the problem; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < all this seems to be an exploiter. Also, poor adjustments, lack of background in the actual situation and, finally, failure to represent the Palestinian side. As a result, it is a poor documentary and poor film. This is partly due to the political situation, but I have to note the defects, regardless of the issue of heartbreak and regret.
