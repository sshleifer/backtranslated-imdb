When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. These sad creatures, the crab muppets with big naked teeth mean to be really scary? Or, wherever they are meant to make a good laugh (heartfelt hope). If you watch it carefully, it is possible to see the working faces (better, drag on the screen). All the scare was more funny and I had a good time watching the movie because I just dropped out of a good part. This is a great joke from beginning to end, and I believe that this movie belongs to a new category: Incredible misery will be funny from beginning to end. (I will not even comment on the actor or all other things)
