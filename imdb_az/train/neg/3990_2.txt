Jungle Fever is highly stylized, stereotyped and largely rare. Wesley was wrong for Snipes' leadership, and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although this film has a lot of talent, it's consuming more than just a few pieces of decorative kameos. Moreover, instead of simply showing racism for something ugly and stupid, Spike Lee chooses to wave around as a flag in the most painful and irritating way. I drew the majority of the film, but I did not finish it completely and it rarely happens to me.
