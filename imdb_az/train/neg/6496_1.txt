This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the kind of person who filmed the movie and did not shut it up until the end, but I was forced to shut it down. <br /> <br /> Because I did not extinguish it. Because I'm a great Christian Slater admirer, so I wanted to see him. After watching the movie, I really became thirsty. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst films ever seen in my life. Thank you for putting some humor on Christian Slater. <br /> <br /> If I were not in this movie, I would be squeezed out of my mind. <br /> <br /> I also acknowledge that Anthony Hopkins should remain committed to his functioning. Despite the end of the movie, I was not deceived. I am both mixed and dissatisfied.
