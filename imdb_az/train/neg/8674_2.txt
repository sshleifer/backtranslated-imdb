The first few minutes of The Bodyguard have a campaign of appeal: The Bible begins with a screening text (Samuel Jackson goes on to the victim at Pulp Fiction soon), with two Karate schools. Teachers in New York have a longstanding problem of humanity Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?) And then plays Chiba himself; he immediately stops an airplane and breaks two bottles with his bare hands. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, deliberate or unexpected, soon disjointed story, lack of movement for a long time and the quality of any current activity is reduced. <br /> <br /> 1) If you do not know what's happening, we'll see that The Bodyguard is a durable movie to keep it unkempt. <br /> <br /> 2) But there is no fighting. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles that are there are short and often drawn. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, his face is dignified. Only for them, "The Bodyguard" is for the 10th grade students. This movie feels like 87 minutes and 5 hours.
