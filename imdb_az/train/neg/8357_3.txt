Man oh man! It's a strange movie piece! But even though we hate to admit that childhood, it is a sinful pleasure. This movie was always shown on my main cable system. Where we grew up in San Jose, California, on the Cupertino border, we gave the name "G Channel" on our cable system. They basically repeated the same films. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. In the 1940s, I fell in love and love with young Brooke Shields in the Grand Canyon and loved dopey adventures. The scenario almost does not make any sense, the direction is weak, Henry gives a look at Fon, is a very bad dialogue and is a beautiful Carole King song played on recent credits. Perhaps you have to stoned to enjoy this flick. And hey, everyone knows that Grand Canyon does not have gold!
