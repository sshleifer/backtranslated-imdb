The film is the two brothers who are likely to be the same - but they are not expected to be clever - one is a surgeon and the others can write a computer code. <br /> <br /> <strong> It was said that I did not like the style of the movie. I believe there is anxiety, confusion, and deep blues, but there is so much to do. The film is cheaper in the scenes and generally explains the story with no human being. He looks at the comedy as an experience. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is very simple, most of the events happen, and there are lots of information. <br /> <br /> I say openly that this movie did not respond to my wishes.
