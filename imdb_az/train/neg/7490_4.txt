This film creates disappointment. It was incomplete and boring. When Alec Baldwin tried to show himself as a perfect fair and simply a prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film did not show any defender or attempted to challenge the audience with a realistic discussion of how a country might affect it. <br /> Of course, nobody wants to defend the Nazi idea, but it's the point of Nuremberg! He stabbed a giant person for four hours .... c'mon! <br /> <br /> I think Alec Baldwin should only be Kim Bassinger's wife. <br /> <br /> With the film's ending, the TNT trail in Nuremberg in 1959. This movie is FAR superior.
