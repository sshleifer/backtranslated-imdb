When I hear about "Earth To Down" for the first time, I am very excited. I play the role of a Chris Rock, and it was particularly fun at Dogma. But this movie was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Chris Koko's past performances have not been so good and the film has been run in a very bad way. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. The whole movie is played as a recurring comedy. Obviously, he works well in the scenes he needs to standup, but not in the rest of the film. Talking to another character, he thinks it's trying to make a person's smile. There are several funny moments, but most come in stenographic scenes (it's not surprising that they decided to make a comedian). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As for the rest, they are just enough to give someone to talk to Rock. The film has a joke area: an old white man acting as a young black comedian. While enjoying movies with more than one joke, it could have worked and was very funny. There was a lot of trouble, and we saw a lot of old white guys. This white man explains Chris Rock's jokes, but it's not nearly as funny as he can only see Chris Rock for most of the time. The few scenes that they decided to show the white boy who talked to Rock are actually cheerful. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> is badly directed. <br /> <br /> <strong>
