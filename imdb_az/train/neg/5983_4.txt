I am one of the few "Americans" growing up with all the beautiful works of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great time for the time and would have made a great action / adventure film, if only the writers were focusing on the target. <br /> <br /> We do not expect such a downward age group to be directed. Like Lost in space, it could have been visually embarrassed and exciting. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> younger). Breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not pay much attention to the original characters, but I am grateful for the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a child ...;)
