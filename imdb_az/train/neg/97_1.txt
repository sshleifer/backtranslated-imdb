I have not seen a lot of budgetary films, but this is the worst movie that I've ever talked to as an old man, who has a lobotomy and has lost more than 5 words every 5 seconds. age can move better. This story was the most terrible and the army soldier thought it was an army, and then just went upstairs, watching how laughing it was and hoping you were going to the movie. I do not know, it was under blockbusters for rent for 2 nights; instead, take it for free and take it out of our eyes. I think there was another half-worthy actor from her, only one thing with her budget was completely created, but at the beginning of each important stage of the film she showed a musical bit. Terrible just terrible.
