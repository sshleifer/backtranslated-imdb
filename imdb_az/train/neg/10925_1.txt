I'm still discussing whether I'm watching this "poppyka" of a movie. There was an interesting idea with the embedded movie set and that was it. Until now, this incomprehensible confusion has no real story. There was a set of burial ground, some monsters started attacking because of the amok, a fox and a wolf attack. If I had left it, it was a good idea to get this nonsense, but it was a really bad CGI, some incredible stupid dialogue, worse CGI, and heroic battlefields. Apart from the original idea, this movie has the qualities that are completely free from scratch. The calendar I'm watching. - MERK
