For a fan series, I have to admit that the Hidden Frontier is not bad at all. However, considering this series is based on whether you have a fan series. The initiative itself is worthy of praise. And his creativity. I think these are ordinary people and a great heart for Star Trek. But it does all of this. Take all these resources. <br /> <br /> First of all, actors and lines are terrific. For most. Dialogs are about 70 military demonstrations not in Star Trek. Captain (Mr Squinty) is always like a burst of laughter. And most characters only read lines. It is important for the directors to know that the word "retake" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I guess that the series is made in the form of "Two Takes Frakes", which directs most TNG episodes and movies. And I do not think most actors are typical Trekkies. <br /> <br /> My biggest discount on the entire project is the quality of freedoms. First, when it decided to spend a lot of time and resources on this series - why did not it provide good quality? Using a fast time format loses down ability. Using the Xvid codec, the "higres" episodes are considered to be the worst quality than the standard quality range, even with a higher resolution and file size. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> is worth it.
