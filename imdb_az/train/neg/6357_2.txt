I'm very upset. This movie has gone beyond my time and mental energy. Here again, there was a recurring Woody Allen movie: the neurotic top-level Manhattan, discussing their spouses would not be deceived. Woody, I've already seen these characters, I've been watching a story ten times more than you. Where did your creativity come from? You need to open your eyes and look around. <br /> <br /> Since our time on Annie Hall, our world has changed and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are more fun and funny scenarios that you can apply to your brand's anthology and neurotic - why not test them? <br /> <br /> When I heard that Wild Allen had come up with a new project, there was nothing for me because now I came to wait for her old waiting period: a pair of tired and betraying couples. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to get back his fans, then we have to understand that our source of humor and intelligence should not be insulted.
