From 1 to 5/26/2002 - From 10 to 4 (Dir-Mikel Almerey): A strange story about the druid witch who inherited her son's body and seized eternity. At least I think this is a relationship. Unlike Stephen King's The Shining movie, this is a kind of disappointment. In contrast to the differences, there was a camp in which Nicholsson did not take part in this film. Some laughs are taken seriously until the end, with one-liners and attempts to mood. The performances are not a problem here, but the story. Everything will not come together in a very smooth manner, and there is no lack of information about the audience and many details. Christopher Walken's granddaughter has a very small shot performance, of course, giving top-billing with an attempt to sell the movie. <br /> Do not take this cunning and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
