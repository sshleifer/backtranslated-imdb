This movie is gratifying, with the gear change to 4 or 1 without having to worry about the 3 or 2 gears to alter the entire path to the b-film finish line. The main thing is the best and most intelligent part of the film. It's worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in Vanna is so fast that you can miss it. It's all the ballyhoo absolute provided by Robert Osborne, presenting his TCM to the bad-to-mediat confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this fringe society are particularly striking, Al. Is there a job for me in Cincinnati?
