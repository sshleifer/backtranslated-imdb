I am very excited after this series was released in 2005. The stage was very simple and attractive: every episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous, notorious horror filmmaker. Then it was a bit strange when finally watching them. Some good episodes started from the first season, but all this was a mixed bag. </ strong> </ span> </ span> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> At least one season there were some good stories here and there. Season 2 (excluding the "The Black Cat" starring Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and total loss for me. The episode "Sounds" can be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV over the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not the best. I hope that this season will be around next year, but I will not breathe.
