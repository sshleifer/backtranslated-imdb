this movie is really bad ....... or I'm really bad. Tony Scott is a terrific director. He is one of the worst executives of all time, besides all the films I have just done as an enemy of the state. Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko) directed this to me the most horrible scenario. Richard Kelly is now genius in my eyes, but he hopes to deal with it and has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> I love Mickey Rourke's new roles now, but I do not like him because of such horror story and his appearance. It does not make me mistaken for Mickey Rourke to still make me, but it's one of the few moments of suffering. I do not know what Keira knightly is about, I think a little too overrated. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is done ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
