When I was shown at Philly Film Fest last year, I did not see it, but when I see that tonight it would be in the cables, I might have been reminded of it soon. So worth the wait? Yes, just as I still do not give you a plot, take a tram back. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what's going on in his life. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who introduced him to the boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray was totally fluttering, Sean wanted to get out of his son, Sean, watching around. And it goes from him. He asked me what I was asking. Is It Worth the Expectations? Yes and no, it was so good, and George Wendt's movie rang for me. He just took the ball and fled. But I believe that in a single place and in one place, the ball is in a severe state during the movies that have just dropped, but are shot in the other direction. I know where this point is from, but I can not say that I do not violate the film. But it does not have to say what happened. The latter does not save the movie. The weak Stuart Gordon can not be as good as "Re-animator" or "Gala Freak". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < pan ... OH MY EYES MY EYES MY EYE !!!!!
