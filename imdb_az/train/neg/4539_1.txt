I have never seen anything terrifying like this movie for a long time. The movie was dull, long and terrible. Special effects come as hell - like watching a movie in 1999. This is a total loss of one and a half hours of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw the Brothers band playing Lt.Speirs, it's not bad. In fact, it is not bad at all. But in this film, his player was not quite convincing, pretty bad, and there was no chemistry among the rest of the crew. Moreover, his eyes look as empty as he does not feel. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this movie anyway. It takes a great deal of time. If you have to kill an hour or two, do something else but watch this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
