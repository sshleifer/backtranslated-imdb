OK - helicopter shooting fantastic and the director used some of Barcelona's most sights. Otherwise ... the price of the production exploded in the first few minutes, and the rest was felt as a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and entertaining to watch, Abel Folk had the deepest and was very impressive and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. It is possible to use a martial art in a good way and to be a jumping-and-move figure. The rest of the pour was good wood, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain, this is a picture card with an action twist and a solid dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
