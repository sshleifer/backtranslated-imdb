This movie was one of the best films, there was everything to make a movie great. Awesome action, awesome special effects ...... oh wait to think of a good movie. Here is one of them, not just flat sucked. <br /> <br /> I know that this film director thinks there are 10 films. 10. When I sounded my voice there were 206, God knew what was happening to them. Now it's 8 or even 9 too high for any other sound, but how much did it do to get this movie up to 10? I know that this is the same as that of Jean Claude Van Damm, a great dramatic actor.
