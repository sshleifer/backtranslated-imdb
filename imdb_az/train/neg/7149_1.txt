Everyone who writes Redline as a great car movie must have been paid to collect amateur geniuses by Daniel Sadek. Easily the worst car movie or movie ever made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What hurt me is that the creators of this film are not sexual, but they think that it will bring the film to the public, which is a fool enough to be unhappy.
