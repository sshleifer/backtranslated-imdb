The blue monkey is actually remembered in the film, but in any sense it is impossible. At some point, some children explore and explore deeper levels. <br /> <br /> Because they will begin to discuss what they can find there, and one of them claims that she can find a blue monkey. <br /> Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> Life's inadequacy is simply a sad connection to the head, and for some reason it will not think that it will find blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. <br /> <br /> Embarrassed for remembering me, someone had to remember to guess!
