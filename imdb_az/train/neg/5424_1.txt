Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a plain toy movie. Why did I watch movies when I was young? Who knows? Maybe I'm just one to punish myself by watching a terrible movie. I do not know, I think I need a hobby in my teenage years. Rainbow Harvest wants to make an effort in the old mirror. Soon he learns the awesome power of the ancient mirror and uses it to strike against unrighteous. Movies like this have a bad influence on the power. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few years ago. I do not know why. They left the shelter on the shelf. People like this movie for the enemy. If you know why I know. Since then, I have not liked this movie and have no reason to watch it again. <br /> <br /> No advice is given.
