After seeing the film, it was the first question I had in my mind: Is it irony or not? After reading a few comments about Doc Savage and the cartoon series, I knew this movie would not be boring. Thus, the story tells the US-American Super-Doc that the South American nation is getting worse. It sounds like a typical story. But this is ridiculous, so it comes in an unreal way. The worst presentation of the martial arts I have seen in the last battle is shown. The film may be of interest to low-budget film designers as a bad example.
