This movie was lightweight from headlines to credits, it was dull to the tedium point and the player was wooden and stylted! Let's admit that director Richard Jobson was originally a director, but who wrote the worst scripts on earth? Drainage seems like another money falling from the government project (Scotland Screen is a surprise, surprise). I fell asleep three times and, unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, this should be more restrictive. Please, Mr. Jobson, do what you did before heading to this bedroom, come back here!
