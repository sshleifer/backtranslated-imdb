Support! I took this movie because Elizabeth Hartmann was in this movie. I was disappointed to learn that it was just like the two short scenes to the end. Besides, I hit the button fast all the way forward fast. Some teens go to Romania with their father, and a worm is over and turns into a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and his comrades. It's about 30 years old, but it's a little older and does not write to a secondary school. She slept there and then met with a shy teacher who was with her children. This movie sucked and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace Instead Just Ms. Hartman did a great job. Look at these many young Bob Saget!
