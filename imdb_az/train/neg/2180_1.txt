There is a lot of mistake and horror about where to start, where am I sure to start? Okay, it's two stooges that call this bell. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton did not create the so-called minds for their names first. In my opinion, they divide the difference, so the main topic will not be BAZA, but the last screen says that it will not die. She does not know anything about medical profession. All doctors say "no harm" after the assassination. Killing a woman to transport her head was considered a "loss". Something called a blood and tissue adaptation. The director wrote Janda panda death. Plus, which holds the patch business monster. Which faculty did FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY graduate from? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, and it would not fall on me. Already, the brilliant surgeon does not tell Bill Cortner how to catch a patient sedated? The entire film and all the disaster, except MST3K, is incredibly stupid and unwatchable. I give it to TURKEY lover.
