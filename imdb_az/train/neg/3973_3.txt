The actor was weak, but with a great deal of horror, if the story is good, I live. It was not. The initial event was an unusual and explicit job to exploit many traditions. Okay, good. Take the "Land in the Country" to be emotionally restored. I love the unit of spirits. Okay, hello - this part of your world will rot in the world, and this will be a strange kind of scary story. Then it moves like a three-headed dog in cats and birds - Is there a bad power trying to attack directly? Is there a bad force trying to attack them? - Do people do terrible things they really can not do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is a series of psychic echo cameras that can turn into environmental crimes? Okay, hold it - maybe a person who flies in a delusional "Delbert" style with his mother and has a whip like K-Tel Norman Bates. Oh, yeah - extra points: the only black character looks like the grandson of the Revolutionary Porter of Our Grace. The actor plays as if he could give a dialogue, but in fact his goal was to "go to Beta, hea, Boss!" At least they can bring it to GTF. The end of the little girl's silence and withdrawal, like a chicken in the shower, was absolutely creepy. There are only a few really delicious warnings in this movie. The problem is that they are directly combined with disharmonious ways like a steak, a chocolate flavor and a part of the Gummi shrub. Each one is great, but is it confused? Bleah! Such a potential. Now.
