<br /> Ooh, this movie is soooo lame. I'm just L.A. around shooting and crew around with the poor, courageous Tim Thomerson to brush with the camera and make it into the camera. Families of the stars may have come to the conclusion that they really can not afford the real "supplements" of the full moon. <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it's the rules. This is exactly what I said about Trancers IV. I say this because it's right. What can we do if an old boy can tackle a zombie in a trench, and then bust with quills like "Do not worry about their ladies, they're bio-degrading"? <br /> <br /> One of my important orders, Megan Ward, really burns together. There is a great opponent of Helen Hunt's character - they are also young candy and they would be more effective if they were slightly different. Well, you can not have everything. At least the most beautiful structure of the "long second watchman" is back and we are from Hap Ashby, the least credulous athlete in film history (oh, wait a minute - he has a rival.) I have not seen lately, but Martine Besvik I remember twice running in the last battle, Hooray for sadness! Only one of the many moments in this beautiful movie.
