The definition of a disgusting Webster by Dictioary is "the cause of hatred or hatred". Let me know if someone can think of a more relevant word or phrase in the Dark, because this is the best with me. But I do not imagine how terribly this movie is in this movie. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with my two guest rooms. Someone gives me a lot of pleasure, both of which are a movement / adventure flick. <br /> <br /> This film is said to have entered the theater because we look at Friday. Only in the dark. I was surprised to be the only person in the theater. <br /> <br /> Starts with the worst opening scene of any movie and, unfortunately, I must admit that it just gets worse. The opening scene is a 5-minute scroll text. But I understand why I narrated it. The director realized that only uneducated people could even figure out how to pay for seeing this movie. However, this first scene is not only the longest drawn text in the history of cinema, but also its meaning. As you can see, in the same sequence we heard to completely separate the films. One is an ancient civilization and its replacement with a single portal, the other is a crazy scientist and his orphans. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you read this story and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then the horrible story, movement, impact and camera work begins. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. He thinks he is a curator of a museum until one second. <br /> <br /> Slater is not only bad, it's not credible, and no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> This question is probably the worst thing human created. All the time, I ask myself questions like myself and a tasteful guest room: What is this? And what happens? Apart from this scroll trash, we have several precedent sequences by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do you explain anything? NO. Is there any smallest issue for us to pay attention to what happens as a spectator at any point? <br /> <br /> Then there is a casual sex scene. They tell us that Slater and Reid are together, but they never even care about anyone else. But then BAM ... sex scene. I did not know it any more. <br /> <br /> Well, oh, I know that after 30 seconds after the end of this miserable scene, we have armed fighting with 20 or more military and alien strangers. <br /> <br /> If this is not enough, <br /> <br /> There is no basis. scandalous There is a scientist and "foreign" things. At one point, the scientist controls the things outside and stands on a hill that orders the army to attack. Why? How was he the commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? Once again I had no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends in a city that is evacuated by Slater and Reid. Why was the city evacuated? Foreign things are broken? Did the military inform them? Who knows ... and who cares about it in this respect? <br /> <br /> Therefore, Slater and Reid are attacking an outsider. It was stated that foreign objects will be killed as a result of exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's in the middle of the day &% $ ing day and can be brilliant. <br /> <br /> After the film's end, I ran across the theater, all 6 feet 6 inches tucked in with me and shook my guns and my aphrodites telling everyone that I did not see this movie. Even my crazy move / adventure guest room (a film that exploded the film for 2 hours and looked at the biggest thing that creates the biggest thing) was also very clear. <br /> <br /> I would give a 0.0 / 10 to complete this CRAP-FEST, and I could handle it. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the worst movie ever. I wish this film to my worst enemy.
