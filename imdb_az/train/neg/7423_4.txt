There is really no word about the leader of Las Vegas. This is harmless, but less than the dull heist film of the 70s. The film is neither smart nor sexy. The assassination is a retread of the old casino robbery story that has been dead. I think the robbery area is prepared by a 3-year-old, except Las Vegas leader. Is the plan covering three women? one of them creates an unnecessary and flat view on the edge of the Circus Cicus building and one at the first opportunity, as a waiter to hit the lid and continues to stop the fragmentation of one. This is pretty much. It's complicated, huh? Apart from Stella Stevens and her abovementioned tits, other women in the plot are not particularly memorable. Co-stars of Las Vegas's wife, Stuart Whitman. <br /> <br /> When Stevens does not make a poving, his filming is highlighted by one of the most ironic gun battles on the film. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. I love 70 at all times, and I feel a few beautiful things since 1975 in Las Vegas. But the film itself is over 4/10. and is probably multiplying it. Finally, the leader of Las Vegas is a good loss of fragmentation.
