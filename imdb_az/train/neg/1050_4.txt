Nathan Detroit works in NYC on illegal cigars for crazy cats, but the heat continues and he can not find a safe place. He goes to dinner with Sky Masterson, a charming gambler with Sarah Brown, who will not be able to get a rewarding missionary to heaven. The sky solves the problem, but both of them have some surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most expensive MGM music, with great sets, loud music, playing a bigger role than life. and speeches on the game; Broadway took a picture for a big screen, and if I love such things, I have not done it. The main problem with my films is simply music. I love all kinds of music from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but in the end of every fourth rope in Broadway, my tunic is not a melted melody of the endless pah-tah-dah trumpet. It was written by a label team based on Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (a few of Damon Runyon stories). For example, Blaine's two numbers are the same, not unnecessary, the field is not moving and ears (and this kind of thing disturbs you). There are only two memorable ringtones, Luck Be Lady (read by Brando, as you would expect from Sinatra), and Sit Down, Rockin 'Boat (well played by Kaye), but need to sit within two hours. The movie card, a young Brando, gives a thoughtful, neat performance; he also reads very well and even dance a little and is always compatible with the exciting Simmons. The sequence they flee to Havana in Havana is a welcome reminder of Noo Yawk's noise, noise, and silent murders. The admirer of the musicals can dig this but in my opinion one should just do something more than just a scene show movie.
