This movie is the worst I have ever seen. There was a sharp pain in my head when watching this movie. CGI was terrible and the story is just a complicated loss. Dean Cain's character was Mr Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-something, with his own helicopter working properly. The biggest problem was the split screen camera work. I felt like watching Brady Bunch or something, just boxes were different people, just different and different views of the same thing. I only realize that the actors really need money because this movie was not worth the movie.
