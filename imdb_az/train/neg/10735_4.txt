Perhaps I'm an old Moscow and having a flexible sense of humor will prevent me from throwing this movie into the 'arthouse / festival crap' trashcan. Not the biggest film of 2005, nor is it a complete trash. There are just a few problems. I doubt that this film is forbidden to say "fierce" and "uncompromising" for any "ideological fear" or "conservative taboo" or otherwise. Scenarios knew that 99% of Russian filmmakers knew they would offend because of bad taste used in shooting and editing this skimpy movie. <br /> <br /> Thus, we have a strong opening. Great sound design, excellent premise - loaded with meaning and symbolism. Using and deploying characters consists of the strongest aspect of the movie (not a number 4, a difficult visual challenge). During the next 40 minutes, we have an even stronger device. It's a fun and well-written conversation between 3 (major) characters, and we feel for these people, Russia's great state, the human condition and all of them. Then the film begins to slow down. <br /> <br /> The rest are dull, simply put. Of course, the boy in the village closes his heart and has some fun moments. Nice sound, I'm sure. However, the enjoyment of this movie is seriously undermined by pacing problems. And this is the lack of failure to sit down with all the good shocks and fools, which ultimately leads people to 'offensive' things (personally made them happy on the main attack scene). <br /> If you see a good movie that the Russians have wasted for a long time (the whole film) you can watch the features of the National Hunt if you want to. More post-Soviet rewards. So yes, my post-mediocre movie situation is beautiful and symbolic 4 to 4 out of 4.
