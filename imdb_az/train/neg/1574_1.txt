There is no story! The field is hopeless! A compressed accelerator, a brake-free shooting and an automatic gearbox handle can not be good! I'll stop inside that car just a minute or in a constantly running police car. I'm sorry for the actors who are forced to quit this vulnerable script. Most of the similarities to the event are dramatized and few scenarios that can go away from reality. In addition, there were many mistakes, for example, the heads of the fugitive car, throwing 100 mph. First, it was folded on the windshield, just like it was, but then it exploded. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a freakish thing, do not stay away from it!
