If you live a bad day or a bad week. If you are looking for a movie that will laugh and forget about your concerns. <br /> <br /> Film centers around Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) encourage two juices to schools promoting their products, children avoiding drugs and raising more water. But Danny lives in the worst of the week and crashes her car. Soon, a lawyer, Beth (Elizabeth Banks), volunteers at a large fraternity called "Sturdy Wings" led by Mr. Geysel (Jane Lynch), trying to avoid being punished. Wheeler is assigned to 10-year-old Ronnie (J. Thompson to Bobb) and has a bad mouth like Chris Rock. Danny fights like Augie (McLovins, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and medieval times who want to wear a knight. Will Danny and Wheeler be better or better in prison? <br /> <br /> Okay, I will not be defeated around the nose, this film was unpleasant in many ways. Perhaps, Ronnie's character, when he heard the bad words, came out of a young boy and was very shocked. If he were a little old, that would not be so much of a mater. I'm telling my parents that they are thinking about signing it. The character of Elizabeth Banks was so unwatchable, perhaps I had to feel bad for her character, but she was annoyingly predictably described as a woman who would be performed in these comedicas because I did not feel anything. And the worst is Jane Lynch. It offers the most indispensable performance. Playing an old drug addiction, he still acts as a drug. Listening to her, all this bored dialogue wanted me to throw my head over the wall. Seann William Scott plays another game like Stifler, really trying to separate himself, and this movie will not do it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; but the rest of the film is the most interesting thing because Rudd is not very strong and does not work hard, and it is possible to watch the scenes with Mintz-Plasse, but the rest of the film is very stupid and sometimes very selectable, but it is very unplanned and uninteresting. It's a reminder of the fact that these comedies are nothing new, they are in the same place, they do not get any chance, Role Models are an example of this.
