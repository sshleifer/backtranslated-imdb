I love Billy Crystal and thought it would be entertaining to watch this movie, because I knew he was amazed at Alan King and would be laughing together. I've seen Billy's films, but I could not remember it, and now I know why. It's packed with clich√©s and fake emotion; You can get the smell coming (and going) in every scene. Billy is not very ridiculous. She is busy trying to tackle her fake tears or justify her father's poor condition. Alan King himself is a subpopulation that is something extra in movies. But Billy's only a big health crisis is that he or she visits his father, and so on. Two doctors can only switch on the moon applications in LA. And when it comes to the last, boy, coming soon! Almost the writers themselves were painted in a corner, and only one outlet was a scene of death. Mostly disappointing with some of the best humorous glimmers.
