Director Jonathan Lynn made some stubborn comedies such as "Open" and "Clich√©" in the past. This is not one of them. More than his inspiration, Steve Martin, who is closer to the 'Police Academy' film, has been deceived as a soldier sergeant in the role of former Phil Silvers from the beginning. Bilco's courageous life and his lazy team seem unbearable when visiting a base to catch an old enemy enemy. There is not really much. All is pretty short. Not too funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd, and Phil Hartman laugh at some strange effort, but all of them are better, and it is very painful to work with such subtle materials.
