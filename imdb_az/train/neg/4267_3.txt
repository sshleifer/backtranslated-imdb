I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, probably all other voters. The director was ready and worked very hard and seemed to be very loyal to the project. I think that explains the above-mentioned average receptions and I'm celebrating it. Aussie's children's favorite "Round Twist" is very similar to the length episode, but this is a very serious backbone for itself. The film itself is not going to think of another Fiji movie, but it's probably worth seeing though it's generally a mild action (even if it's an amateur toy), trying to make a cinematic world tour of all UN member countries. and gain subaltern mentality. The moral aspect of the story seems to be that the native islands try and interconnect each other, but in the process of being a clever white ruler all problems can be solved (separated from the island).
