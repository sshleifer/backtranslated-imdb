This film was definitely tortured. Above all, this 4 + clock is fast! True, the War of Cargill may have been captured and fought, but there is no need to show each of these battles. Perhaps this is not a commercial movie, but a commercial movie. Certainly, it did not seem like it was because there was insufficient information and there were some drawbacks. The combat sequence was very bad. I was very disappointed with the guy who gave a good sequence on the border. Each battle was the same as before. It was very much anticipated. (It can be a spoiler.) The whole army disappears, and five or five soldiers are cursed 5,000 times each time (they also use those words each time), one of the leading actors is shot, others are shouting at the dining room, No, do not take a stretcher, it will take six people in the battalion, "and then an actor dies. This same thing happens repeatedly. Oh, and the songs are too bad and too long. Filming is great for itself. Despite such a long film, none of the characters were well developed. The actress had the smallest roles. All are equally dressed and described. Two of them were synchronized. It was very funny. <br /> <br /> I know that I still forgot something. Anyway, I think I'm pretty much praised for the film.
