In Wal-Mart, I found a DVD named "I Dream Of Jeanie" worth $ 1.00 thousand. I saw that I was a musician and musician, "Steven Foster's story", and I had to see it. After rebuilding Sewanee River in 1939, I did not know why they were preparing for the cover. Bill Shirin's composer's image is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man has NO testosterone and is a blow to the whole way! Stephen Foster has a hard time believing that musicians have made him a blessing without publishing his songs! In addition to this ridiculous concept, Ray Middleton's nearly 20-minute segment and its hero, Christy Minstrels, plays at least the hardest to watch Steven Foster's songs. I do not believe anyone will think that this movie is appropriate for the current time. It is embarrassing and should not be forgotten. Fortunately, the songs of Stephen Foster will never be forgotten .... Eileen Christy's Jeanie images, of course, are the lowest point in Hollywood history.
