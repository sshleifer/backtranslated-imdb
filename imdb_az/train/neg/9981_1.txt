This movie was billed as comedy and mystery. Both deteriorate. Why is the sole mystery here such a poorly structured movie? Only the comedy is the smile that I gained when I see how high the reader is here. Can there be two films with the same name? In the film I have seen, a girl with pretty blue eyes and a role in a structure that is not there. <br /> <br />
