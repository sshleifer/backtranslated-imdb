Harold Pinter rewrites the classic game of Anthony Schaeffer's man who goes to visit her husband and goes to her. The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has played Olivier in this version and is paired with Jude Law. The film is directed by Kennet Branaugh. <br /> <br /> Acting is magnificent. Both Caine and the law gangbusters in their roles. I really love the encounter of individuals and personalities. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is sharp and often very intelligent, and I understand why the game was rewritten (updated) from surveillance cameras and so on. The purpose of the task is to show how awful the surrounding characters are. Michale Caine walks through a strange modern home with sliding doors and panels as it's not really a good reason. Conversations occur repeatedly in different locations. I know Pinter plays in these games, but it's tedious in this situation. In fact, what law does the law have with a spouse, and why do couples go? At some points, it would be good to say that the Law was sufficient, but it does not act as it does for the first time. Not all of the scenarios do not act on Geyni's law. He started angrily to begin at the beginning, because he does not have the chance to turn around and intimidate us. (Do not delay the game's decline, which causes you to wonder why it is distressing). here we will do it, and when we give it an edge, we feel misunderstood, so we understand that we have to wonder why Mila did not see her being established. <br /> <br /> There are many other things, but we can say that it will give more. <br /> <br /> I think the film is backwards, I think it's a stupid opportunity and a wrong movie. Opportunities out there, the chance to prepare a better fireworks between Caine and the Law. Choosing an incorrect choice and single shift change are avoiding a tension and convincing tension. Instead, we get a very clever dialogue and beautiful performances in a movie. <br /> <br /> Despite some great speeches and intelligent dialogue, it does not just work from 10 to 4
