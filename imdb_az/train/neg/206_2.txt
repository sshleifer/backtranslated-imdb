I gave only 2 stars because Dominic Monaghan actually worked with his player. Everything about this movie is extremely passionate. Everything related to the direction of this film was carried out in a very bad way. The director should not rethink what he has done for a career, but he should watch several films. Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in this calibrated film causes him a terrible look. Whose "actor" Kim was the step in front of the camera that Jack played the best friend. I did not expect much from such a small movie, but maybe somewhat more time and effort and characters around them. Do not waste your time or money in this movie (like me), you will be very surprised.
