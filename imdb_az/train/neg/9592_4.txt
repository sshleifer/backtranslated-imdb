Although it appeared in 2001, I just saw the movie lately. I hoped to see a fun movie, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. As you can see, the "princess" is not very spoken ... He reminded me only Jean Claude Van Damme, he just looked to make his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the whole movie, I was waiting for a confession about what she loved, why she fought, who loved and trusted her. I waited in my spare time. Naked film. Destructive dialogue. Do not watch it if you do not want to get caught up in your minds! It was so bad that I realized I was not going to be annoyed at the end of the first half hour. Approximately. I give 4/10.
