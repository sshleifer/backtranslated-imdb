What is an incomprehensible mixture of a movie. Something about a police officer who shoots bullets and bottles a bottle after his shot (and about the size of a jar of about fifty times so far) and five or six unidentified soldiers to Mexico. There has never been any deliberate deliveries or delays that have actually been lost. And in another scenario you will not hear the word "butthorn". Gary Busey releases Mel Gibson's role as "Deadly Weapon" and Busey is an actor who serves, but his scenario delivers the whole film to mediocrity. William Smith works in another queue like a Russian soldier with the same character as he played a few years ago at Red Dawn. After watching the biker weighing more than 70 people, it was nice to expand the range of communist heavyweights. Unfortunately, it will always be best remembered that Clint Eastwood is "Everyone Can Live the Road."
