I was delighted that this movie was really bad. Should the audience need to learn something or think of anything here? What happened to the pumpkin? Do not think I was affected by motel boots? Is it important to have a trash bag on a roof of a hotel? Why the narrator shook the people with controversy (he made really informative parts of his interviews to reach the miracles). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film was interviewed by a film teacher about how bad it would be before the movie was over. <br /> <br /> I really was surprised. I believe that his creator struggles to be intellectual or tries to influence the intellectual community.
