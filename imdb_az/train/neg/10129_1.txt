I can not find but words to express how this movie is really heartwarming. I was sold on Segal and secret airplanes, a move to make an entertaining action movie, usually. I can honestly say that I do not want to make a bigger eye with a cocktail stick than seeing this movie again. The player was terrible, it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with the soil holes expanding with age, flying F117. If I know that a 10-year-old writer has written, it should not be surprising at me. Movement and production are very passionate, even though I encourage these people to take a wedding video with my worst enemies. Copyright. Those who are responsible for filming have reduced their art and are ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never show off his face in public, and I can not imagine that he was the worst movie ever seen in my whole life and that he was a star on this subject.
