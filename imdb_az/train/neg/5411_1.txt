I think it's a great admirer of films. I still think about it long and hard, seven minutes after the loan is accumulated. My neurons are really a prostitute attraction related to the naked girlie area of ​​fondling his slick oily body, which is enriched by how cheap video shots really complicate. It happens three times and I understand it later. For the filmmakers, I was convinced that this wrong attempt to attract audiences is justified. <br /> <br /> This movie should be the worst I've ever encountered in the genre. Sets are the chemicals that occurred in the 1970s and appear to be a cross between a person's dingy-painted room. Lighting is impossible (if your sets were bad, hide them at least in the darkness to hide the gypsum boards and create some air). The girl from the kidnapping quartet differs particularly nudity, but no one is given identification. The plans of foreigners on world domination are simply foolishness - all the necessary birth control pills are needed and their problems are solved. Most of the film is made up of people falling from the corridors. Yes, it really is interesting. The special effect of "Ray gun" ... is curious, at least (a weapon that kills a concentrated explosion of 15 seconds to use, and even then comes back more than boys). The scenario is like a bad episode of The A-Team and women's hairstyles come from the same era, so they appear to be school teachers, not the leading team of dead alien invaders. Finally, when you look at how foreigners really look, they are not baseless animations or even their boxes. The story of the story - the treacherous xaini has a few words with the occupier of the navy commander and heading home without a second thought - a sign of a writer who really does not have a worse idea than a cartoon on Saturday morning (I say badly) <br /> But what is serious, with the naked chick? Could they really be right to put a lid to increase the sales of DVDs?
