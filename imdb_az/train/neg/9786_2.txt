<br /> <br /> I took this movie from Woolworths for my friend on a birthday joke, because it was a sexual betrayal in the front cover. <br /> <br /> But we have decided to follow it anyway. <br /> <br /> For some of my films, it's the best movie for me. <br /> <br /> Well, "Okay, that could be really good." Only about 10 minutes later, we were just mistaken. <br /> <br /> The "mysterious paint ballerina" has become the most obvious character, from head to foot (Australia). Today has ended and since then we have all the will to live. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not look like this was that they were not really winning, but they were losing enough. <br /> <br /> I know that it has nothing to do with it, but the name of the team was just horrible. Critical damage. That is, they have been chosen to be "a slaughter of the holy Christ" or something bigger. Otherwise, the film should be called in any way.
