Mr. Syndton's Higher Education comes from the University of Southern California in line with his personal experience. <br /> <br /> A racist policy-based film that takes place everyday in college. <br /> <br /> The film's core is based on three main characters: Malik Williams, an African American caretaker undercover American man. Kristin Conner, Remy, a soft white girl with a shelter and an unforgettable white man. All three eliminate the fact that collective life is not as good as advertised, with three unlucky (Malik), heartless (Kristin) and unsuccessful (Remy). > <br /> One good thing about the film is that modern American colleges just write a great deal of high school. Colleges are not places to build character, develop capacity and personalize, but they are the organizations used to gather all types of students in one dimensional atmosphere. This is usually a practice built for most student failure. <br /> <br /> The film is not about race politics, it would be good if you had a story about travesty. <br /> <br /> But films did not have a place to leave. Singleton, apparently, had a very bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie, he allows you to hang all. There is no need to beat around this place. Singleton allows the heroes to easily see the creatures of this piece. <br /> <br /> Many hero heroes in the film appear here as heroes, all the films in the film, who can understand the inconsistency of this film? After arriving after giving a promise to those who shot their mouths, members of the black black gang arrived? The comfort of the black gang members at the university, while a set of skin heads meet the planning of violence in a dark little country? <br /> <br /> Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) make the appearances disappointing. They seem to be the third choice for their roles in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore had to play Malik and Kristin, but they were unavailable). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King are annoyed in their role. And Laurence Fishburne was in a bad state here as a historical professor. Only Michael Rappaport was good at this movie, and he took into account the character of the three main characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to take part in racial and inequality issues. This film is in American college life. And he did it very badly. It was like killing a shotgun with a shotgun. Life is more complicated than it is, and all people are alike and should know it. Higher Learning proves that he did not understand it. Seeing the film, then and now, the same public, who just wanted to talk, was confused, frustration and angry. You can not entertain it in the least.
