It could be just Antichrist behind such a disaster. One just hopes that this is a motivating force behind the movie! This movie was very dirty, forced me to register with IMDb. What made this movie more tragic was such a great source material! <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">. I am proud to be proud of having a music degree! When I listened to what John Scheffer did with the glowing account of Goldsmith, he was torn between laughter and dry player; Burlesk was more terrible than any of the scenes of death and almost accidentally was like a comedy. It was the most discrepancy I've heard from today, and I'm really worse than ever. Maybe JAWS 4? <br /> <br /> When it comes to hell ... Sorry. New age mysticism ??? What happened to the strange realism of the original trilogy? These films (in the first three, more, but still!) Were meant to be supernatural, and it was such a delicacy that made movies so convincing. Here we would have been perfectly normal in certain areas crucifux, but for the camera angle, we have black crystals (all Skechs and Mystics!) And there are plenty of reverse cruciferous, black going. Gone is an elegant psychlogical manipulation by knocking our collective mental illnesses: slapping on the surface of the recycled clich√© and transparent incompetence. I am thankful to the director for such unprecedented scenes as an incredible "actress". <br /> <br /> So I have strong feelings for me ;-) Fortunately, the first three films are enough adroit to learn how to make this waste an inevitable celluloid train or most movie. Be careful of the viewer! It may cause vomiting if you are lucky.
