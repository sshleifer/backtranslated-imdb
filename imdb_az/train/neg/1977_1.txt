Wait, do not tell me ... filmed and caught it. You know, this film could be shot at the back of New York. I'm saying "Gangster Bangster". Gangster Rap, the designer gangster tozer dresses, as well as from head to toe protection from the neck of the neck. I think that protects my head from cleaning through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie" equips horses as seen. She had a bedroom and a boy talking to her. You know, watching this movie only confirms that it does not function anymore ... its appearance and money. There was not much in the place where this film was. Yes, in my opinion, this film will never be filmed as the worst movie. Of course, what was Ice T? Finally, was he able to go to Oprah?
