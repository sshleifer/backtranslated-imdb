It takes all the first 5 minutes to know about the film: it looks cool, a solid original soundtrack reflecting the late 60s and a few of the whole characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At that time, he is advised to join the real world - not a fantasy film, but an imaginary director - doing it by pushing it away and uniting with an idealist outside. <br /> <br /> This film is as interesting as Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's life was a bitter exaggeration, but here's the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family relationship clearly dropped this role; I hope to improve your choices here.
