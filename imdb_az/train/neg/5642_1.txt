This title appears to be a lot of shooting than a film released by the public. Dafoy and his wife should be entertaining together for the first time in a movie, without taking into consideration that people can really follow. <br /> <br /> Try and adapt this movie to a genre, because I feel like a 90mins dump because it's not a beginner, moderate. or ended. <br /> <br /> I've seen "arty" movies before, and it does not seem to be arty, abstract, or original, but it just seems to me completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> I think that the only people who evaluated this movie were 10 or so. Undoubtedly, the film is for constant, senseless erotic scenes that accuses us of throwing it. So you can say erotic. Of course, there was no taste.
