It could have been a very interesting look in the life of one of America's most famous serial killers, but unfortunately it did not come close. Troubleshooting, guiding, acting badly, you call it. This film is approximately 100 meters in length for about 100 minutes. Only the depreciation quality is just like the father of Bruce Davidson, but it is not enough to keep this stinker. 10 to 1.
