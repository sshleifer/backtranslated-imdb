This film is related to a woman and is psychologically tortured. There is a woman full of frontal nakedness, dead animal parts, dog lick dogs, loose woman. All shots in gray cold colors. Effective, but a bit too. Later, we will continue to look at the youth of the BTK killer as well as the history and history of crime. The stages of the psychological and the murder of victims of tension in their homes and talking with them are quite long and creepy. Here we do not see fancy or good images, it looks like it's stuck in your home camera. It does not look terrible, but it's quite unusual and hesitant for a while to see a murderer killed before being killed. This movie really does not have any drama. There are several police stations every time, but there is no excitement in finding a murderer. There are not many springs for this story. This effective psychological tension could be madness. Unfortunately, the movie is packed with real killing cameras. She's scattered throughout the movie and suddenly comes back. Sometimes you do not know when he comes and you do not have enough time to get away. I must reject it. I'm talking about films with little budgetary fate, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. Unnecessary, excessive and without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate left things that nobody did, but they did not have this movie or just fixed the animal's eyes. Stay away from this rubbish.
