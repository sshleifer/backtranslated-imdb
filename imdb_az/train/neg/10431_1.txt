I liked the first season. The quality fell slightly in the second season, but it was a big medium (Pegasus!). The third season was pretty romantic and original and OK. The fourth season began to swiftly move, because even when we started to need them, we did not start to give any explanation. Cylon mode was hell? Why was there two Cylon groups? What was the point that the Navy-Qara fleet had taken to a ruined Earth? What was the last five Cilons, and how did they survive or reincarnations? <br /> <br /> Ask everywhere and answer anywhere. <br /> And it ends. Past-2 (Our Place). Okay, okay. But destroy the fleet! By giving up technology, giving up all kinds of urban life, a few thousand people spread gently on paper? It's just anti-science, anti-cause and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show seems to have been trapped in a devastating capitalist society in the AI ​​trapped in a circle of humanity's eternal romanticism. everything is ruined. Without a vision without hope for a great future for humanity, this is not right for science science fiction. And do not even start to angels! The most terrible skin of the skin! <br /> <br /> Generally, all this happened and would happen again. As we know, it should be related to the previous incarnation of the series rather than the Earth. Adapting the new show directly to the old would be a definite hit. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> From 1 to 10.
