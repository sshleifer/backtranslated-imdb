The only good thing about "I Know People" is that Al Pacino should serve as a perfect example of the films that should not be realized. The first major transformation I had was Pacino's way of expressing Georgian accents; sometimes weak and confused, and in other parts too late. The interaction between the dialogue and the character was terrible, along with a weak area. The support film has done an extremely useful job to capture an interesting movie and I have not seen any signs of a solid field within an hour. <br /> <br /> This movie, of course, will bring you ... avoid any responsibility.
