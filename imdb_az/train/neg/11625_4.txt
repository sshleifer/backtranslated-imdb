Except for Brady Variety Hour, this was the most enjoyable television I've seen in a while. Video production qualities were not very bad, but overall looks and feelings did not happen in the early 80's. And Marie Osmond appears to be in the battle with Avon's spouse and has lost a great deal of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> then it has not been opened yet. <br /> <br /> This post has not been opened yet after 17 years. (If Disney does not count the Animal Kingdom). All this, for all its shortcomings, is still an interesting part of Disney's history.
