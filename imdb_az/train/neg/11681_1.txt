The film's trailer was better than the movie. What Is Talent And Money Making? I would like to wait for this movie to come on DVD because I will not be at least $ 9. The film leaves the trail completely. It could be a great movie for all actors, and the best B movie appeared. The film was moving slowly, and when I thought I was going somewhere, it almost did not exist, but then it was not. At present and in the age of the film, we need the square folds and closures that can not be predicted, and what the movie has to offer. Everyone knows that everyone is a suspect, but it is not convinced of the direction, illumination, transmission, writing, or what it does not come from. A lot of palms for nothing. I'm very excited about this movie, and I'll tell everyone that I do not see it. The peculiar saxophone music made the film even worse. And the end has not had anything to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
