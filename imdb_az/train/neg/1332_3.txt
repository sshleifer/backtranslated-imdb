Updating the clean-cut Jay Leno bread message is the only memorable aspect of this unmatched police cops. In the COLLISION course, comedy teams with pelicans, along with the late Pat Morita, to watch the stolen prototype turbocharger (think that the car lover Leno has taken the field?). Two heroes are working, they really work, but Leno is not an actor, and Morita is quick to rush out of the fish. The film has a love of the 80's, but its decent moments are gradually reduced to 100 minutes of running time. Fans of Leno's comic talent will feel down; everyone will be just bored.
