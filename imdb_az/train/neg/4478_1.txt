I have not been expecting this movie for a long time - a little bit of fun. Wuthering Heights can be a beautiful and early, melodramatic and spectacular story. But this film decided to throw the talent of the people in the sympathetic version, so it was filtered down from the boiling material that could not bear to surprise that the Heights, which stirred these stories. This is actually the story of a person who is different, mostly spotless and often oppressing one another. It changes the nature of certain characters - for example, in the novel, Isabel has no bones in his body - they have blinded their idealism and turned it into prostitution. Heathcliff is a terrific man in his way who is psychologically tortured, but in this version, Catherine takes care of her. This is a dialogue and there is a miracle of how the actors communicate with their faces. When you scream in front of one of the depths or actual feelings, it means something. In the early 90's, I read Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche's critique "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights," so dark, turned the Gothic story into dark bodice ripper. A little more reliable commentary, but the MTV version is a step further, using the main story structure to deliver the chip beach bums that really sounds bad.
