The original "Vanishing Point" was a great flick. Single motifs, real and spontaneous characters. Preachy, obviously open; missed the point where the original was classic. The black charger was cool, but could not even save this flick. Why stay with White Challenger? I did not think that '71 was the best choice. Some parts of the film were spontaneously hilarious. Vigo's like "Dream Quest" just like in a cliff facing the canyon. Her Indian palace was with her. Vigo only wore white clothes. We're sorry - he just looked at it foolishly - he looked at the fruits in his fruits. Another scene is over - after the explosion bulldozers - the spokesman said that the effect lasted to 180 mph. The cops tell him that his remains were not found, because he was evacuated, but some believed that he had come to the conclusion and hiding in the congregation by his friends. Then, on the 180-meter car, he shows it! First of all, the door of the car could not be opened up to 180 degrees. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel on a straight line for 100 yds. no one will manage it. It would take about 30 times immediately. Thirdly, if you hit the sidewalk 180 meters, you'll get different squishy pieces. No matter what happens, we can see her as we stand with her daughter. All this is a film that insults everyone's intelligence.
