A clever movie about a well-visible, but clever couple who wants to dwell on their dreams and dive their tours. The couple almost immediately selects instant clients, and blends with some people who want to rebuild elements on the ocean floor during their opening credits. A great look for the video movie would be better if it is not interesting, first of all. Performances are served and the scene is not really bad, or when the director and the producers see beautiful people in the beach suits (or "unrated" "a few naked naked tits moniker), the film does not make any tension and does not rise above the level of a memorable television movie. though, you do not expect the eyelid to look good, but producers need to avoid films that are pretentious for paid vacations.
