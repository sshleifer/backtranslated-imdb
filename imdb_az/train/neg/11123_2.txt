Who is Kim Ki Duk, the "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring", lifestyle? Who is Kim Ki Duk, who is delicate, about thirty, thirsty and thirsty for "Iron"? The same Kim Ki Duk, surprised us with the surprising tragedy of the Coast Guard, and irritated the illegal youth prostitution obscenity before returning to almost patented nature motives to allow us (heroes and viewers) to live equally with the "Samaritan girl"? <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's not possible to find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the motive of nature is still present. The film is full of fish in a lake surrounded by mountains and quietly resting on the surface of calm waters. Yes, Kim Ki Duk is good. Who even portrays the film as "beautiful" in an interview with DVD's special features. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A speeding, ? These are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in a totally surprising and ultimately senseless film. This reviewer is not familiar with the source material if it is based on a worship or intended as a parable or a symbol of something bigger. Notwithstanding some surprising good performances, I found this to be very few reasons to consider the Japanese director Takashi Miiken's "Audition" compared to others, but given the other things that Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk used to do. I did not see Audition, but I doubt that The Isle would not change my mind in any way. Violence is pornographic and meaningless sadistic. Her sex is pornographic, not passive and masochistic. Characters are progressive impulses, because there is no plot. <br /> <br /> Only one beauty is in classic Kim, which is literally dragging the shroud boats. Throughout a quiet lake, slowly dominate the mountainous terrain and the color is creative and playful. Sometimes it looks like the audience is locked in the huge Kim Ki Duk romper room. Some tendencies, such as the use of motorcycles and some unpleasant motorcycles, are mysterious and attractive as Jung's quiet merchants. But as a film, this effort is confusing, and ultimately attacks senses, not sensuities. Who hopes that this film will be abandoned in the garbage dump of the past, because we know he can do so much more.
