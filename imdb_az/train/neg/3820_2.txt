It's painful for Buster Keaton followers who follow "Easy to Speak". Such a philosopher, writer, actor, comedian, director, and a dreadful man, seeing a Picasso, used as a droplet cover, or cheated by Camembertin's more prominent items, and seeing Cheez-Whiz handling. <br /> <br /> Keaton is ill-treated like Professor Postu. According to him, say "tell rabbits, George." (Post would say, "I'm telling you that I'm talking to George's nickname, tell me about the status of small mammals in the Leporidae family owned by Lagomorpha.) When Keaton creates their characters, they may be clueless in the situation, but they're stupid They were quick to conduct researches and become masterminds of their worlds.Tumblr and bumbling did not stop and do not destroy Titanic with more than a synthetic rat, but with Keaton's original characters being a charming fairy tale and innocence, Post has a deeper sexual tension If he had never been physically attracted, he would have put an ice bag on his sweat and asked for medical help. <br /> <br /> Keaton was a few small, There are indisputable moments, but just do all that If you are an admirer of bad movies, be drunken and watch with your friends "Speak easily" and "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But besides, stay silent. Buster Keaton is 100% of what he remembers.
