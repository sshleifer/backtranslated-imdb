I rented this movie to see Amber Benson, though after reading the box I thought was a good story ..... but the first problem was not really a story ... or it was really an event, but it did not mean absolutely did not. The second problem was not set up for these characters ... yes, they all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie they understood that they were not common and they did not like each other ... why did they come together? The number of defects is 3 ... as the director stops for a long time and is heavily captured by intense camera shots (especially typical mixed music) ... he was sadly mistaken. It was a painful time for Amber Benson to take his life back as an awesome actress .... My only hope was to put the money here to prepare a movie.
