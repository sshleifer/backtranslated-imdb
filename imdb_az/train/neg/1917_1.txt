Although this film is not bad at all, it should be in the place where actual events occur. Grand Island, Nebraska, has been devastated by at least seven tornados on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the rough, flat Platte River valley in the Hall district. The creators of this film were filmed on the covered hills of the Ontario Trees, and the whole event moved to a non-existent city, Blainsworth. The Grand Island people bravely rescued this terrible night just to be forgotten because of a bad film.
