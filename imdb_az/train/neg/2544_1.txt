Gung Ho was a good idea, but Americans' viewers were trying hard to understand American business and foreign competition dynamics. The main character in this film, Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), goes to Japan and helps the Japanese automobile company to America and the city of Pennsylvania, which helps him die. Two things come to you. First, why is a Japanese company coming to America to do so when it comes to America and is it so good? Secondly, can everyone understand that American companies are moving to third world countries to avoid their American labor costs? It gives the premiere of the film that the world's No. 1 car manufacturer will go to one of its top competitors (out of Germany) and that there will not be a plant there. Keaton was in the comedy mode this time. But she can prove to be able to go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds, and she can still prove to be not embarrassed, but director Howard Howard can not continue to be a movie. In any case, they have to end a difficult story with a happy ending of policy and Japanese and American relations. Gung Ho is a Happy Days, and Laverne and Shirley both feel that TV show producers are making a movie, and the film also makes the movie's television version 'lighter. The Japanese manager loves American and American and other Japanese people from the Americans. It is not a matter of a man who does not love the Americans. Saito paste all Japanese characters, such as Saito's soft goofball. They would make the film even more interesting.
