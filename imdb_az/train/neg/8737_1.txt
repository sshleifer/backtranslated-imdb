Dennis Hopper is undoubtedly one of the best-known American actors of our time and was eager to see how a child could play a role as a police killer. Many film hopers have always been embarrassed by the explosion or killing of things that threaten psychotic threats, but Hopper has done his best to keep this intensity and feeling while carrying a shield. After entering the film area, I was hooked, but only small things that were filmed. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is very good - it's just a chance to catch the killer but not the police, but to see how globalists work to kill the killer. The football stadium's playground is ridiculous, but pirate hunters need to be involved. <br /> <br /> What can you say about this movie? Although Hopper is trying to act as a tough, experienced street street intelligent officer, I do not feel that his toy is down and I do not feel that he is not convinced that he is truthful. The director was terrifying - he did not feel a real movie, but produced a television movie. This is the most obvious when the bandits meet to create an elite group to hunt for the first time. When a trusted gangster shoots another smart gangster on a slower move, the player is vulnerable, predictable and quite uncertain. <br /> <br /> Any event that causes the grief of his spouse and nephew,. If not, it would not have been. <br /> <br /> Everyone was horrified and even did not feel his character for Hopper and really interested in his relationship with his daughter. <br /> <br /> The last thing worrying me is the Swat team. After seeing a moving commander, I finally thought of a good thing. But I made a mistake. First, all Swat team consisted of 4 people. It is impossible. Of all this, two of them probably have no teachings from the Swat team, because several times the HKA4 submachine is carrying the weapons on the one hand. If the killer was hiding near the staircase with a shotgun, these 4 immorality would have been exploded, since they did not even lean on anything and were closely interested. They need to move on both sides of the weapon, but they just do not take the job seriously and only make flaws around them. Third, the members of the SWAT group do not close orders such as "Keep your eyes open, wait for yourself, and go better". In fact, there are hand signals or radio sets. But they shout at one another: how do you keep your killing when you hear it? And on top of all this, these guys have no plans - they are probably only going to chase in a wild India and trying to get down. Finally, they end up doing nothing. It was the last straw. I'm not an expert on special forces, but basically, just what I justify is pretty good idea. If the audience knew that the film was horrific, the action could save the film's life - even the film would not be filmed to make it bigger. <br /> <br /> I give you 2 stars for the concept, the rest can not be credited. Do not worry if you want to watch the crime. The film has a lot of crime - but there is no excitement.
