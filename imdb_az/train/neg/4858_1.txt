Why would anyone in the world do this garbage movie? The first two Zombie Bloodbath films were quite foolish, but this trilogy takes the cake for the worst (maybe all the time). Todd Sheets is still a director, but since he has written a writer, he is a negative or non-positive screenwriter. The word f-word, which is used between 200 and 300 times during the nausea, is very heavy. The player is parallel to the last two Bloodbath films, and, of course, is one of the worst I've ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2 but they still look teary. Suicide was too complicated and some government practices went wrong and zombies were produced. As can be seen, cryogenic frozen mutant zombies and school children know how to travel, leading to one of the most stupid ends I've ever seen. After the movie, it's a strange thing that the whole film is out there. <br /> <br /> My rating is BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
