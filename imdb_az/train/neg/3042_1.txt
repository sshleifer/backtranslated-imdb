I allowed about 1,000 words about this movie, but one word is enough: it is strange. Husband and I did not laugh in this really scary movie. We looked at each other with the best "What ...?" expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this film. Killer tomatoes were funny, but this is just sick. Such thinking creates such images and puts them in the movie to see others? In what strange and strange film, what kind of children are thinking of innocent children and then pack them as it is suitable for children? Parents, do what you do, and do not let this child see if your child still believes in Santa. Preteens can watch it - probably "What?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to give this movie to others, you can open their meals. <br /> <br /> Maybe the worst movie ever made.
