Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a very entertaining feature series (but updated and lost) Bush jokes. As I have seen, I lowered my expectations even further. <br /> <br /> The article was completely miserable. Cheney-Chicken-eating strangers and some giggly-little swipes were really dull and unfunny. <br /> Animation was enhanced as a thirteen-year-old Flash Project. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Macromedia has more product. <br /> <br /> I do not like it very much and I love the bud show. it has shaken handsome moments to the president several times painful moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did more with my bucket. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Thank you.
