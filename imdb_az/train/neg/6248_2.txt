<br /> <br /> When it comes to Global Warming, something strange is happening: science goes out of the window and becomes a subject of "belief" and "consensus" discussion. <br /> <br /> Because, in fact, Al Gore is a documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of encouraging intelligent discussion, he held the debate at "level of faith" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Certainly, to expose the world's trillions of dollars to "stop global warming" may be a problem: we do not know how many people are in the current warming. <br /> <br /> In some cases, maybe some of them, perhaps some, or perhaps the next Ice Age have the advantage, and are really lucky to have the planet fuse. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we wanted to believe in "consensus". Do not ever think that any scientist who goes away from the "consensus" has himself abandoned himself. Do not think of a scientific research consensus. <br /> <br /> Einstein did not "believe" such as Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> Why are so many disappointing to these researchers who are asking very hard questions and developing the field? <br /> <br /> If Global Warming is very subtle, there are definitely few people who test this theory so dangerous. <br /> <br /> What happens here? The film I hope Al Gore will do. Instead, he chose to put his support for the "consensus" with the true "believers." <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
