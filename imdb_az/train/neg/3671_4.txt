A dull, predictable and uninterrupted story of a person who has been polluted by a Chinese chemical substance (Weller) to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, it kills everyone in the hands of just one touch. On the dangerous road, a doctor (Hurt) and a young correspondent (Natasha) are trying to stop people. The film does not have an original structure, but even though it is better. The result is only for a while without a movie or screaming moments. Even good casting is completely wasted. I give it 4 (four).
