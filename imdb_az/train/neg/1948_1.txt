Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a hint. It's like watching a loved one in the last shoots of a degenerative disease! Certainly, there are no works of people who do not have anything, no respect for the original work, and love. What did all the holy ones think? Apparently, they were trying to go all the post-modern and ironic. Instead, it's just a terrible wave! What is a successful franchise winning point like Scooby-Doo? My son likes some of the original series - even spin-off films - but he can not stay on this drive! You will not experience the taste of seven years
