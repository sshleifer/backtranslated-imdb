I consider myself an admirer of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film that presented the series was a weak start. While the Gathering pace is slow, makeup is somewhat inadequate and the plot is confusing, although there are many elements that can be more intense and more attractive to sequences. Worse, it is poor in the premiere episode. The range of ratings shows that many fans are ready to cope with these problems, although the meeting soon turned me back to a spectacular series.
