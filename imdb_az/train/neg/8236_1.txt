I do not believe it's on DVD. <br /> <br /> If you consider some that is a good movie, it's only $ 4,000 budget. This funny find. <br /> <br /> I'm still laughing and I read another review: "If you like dramatic, horror, and love something along the Duel line (1971) <br /> What? <br /> <br /> It's a shame that compares these two films. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a "1" because I can not give "0", and I'm not looking at having fun in this movie.
