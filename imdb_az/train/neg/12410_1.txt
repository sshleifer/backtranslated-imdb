This movie was terrible. The player was the worst! It was worse than a student film. I think the super-cheese and the worst actor are the old lady. First of all, I thought it was a good old film. Then I remembered that this was no excuse! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> This is really small. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is not worth even one. I just watched it because I was very bored and the movie was fun to me. He just laughed. My dead grandmother could have made a better movie than her left heart.
