I tried to watch this movie just by bringing bad words about "killing and killing people in their home". I think that when I was 10 years old, I saw a part of this movie when I fled the cables for the first time. This made a pretty impression! Children are a movie they know they are not watching and change their channel when it comes to their parents. When I saw who it was, I did not believe some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Again, if you want to see men who want to kill their wives, this is an interesting movie. And remember, there are many interesting pseudo-delusional moments. Probably the most terrible end of all time, but still ... memorable.
