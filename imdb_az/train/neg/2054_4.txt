Cold Blood was one of the few 60 films to create a new vision of violence in the Hollywood movie industry. Capote prepared the phrase "novel novel" to describe the book he was filming, and he carried it to the movie script he wrote. Although we look good at the colorful film cycle, Richard Brooks chose to present this film on black and white, and stressed the stiffness of the landscape and the story's indestructibility. This is the first issue with TV reconstruction - changing the tone of the color story. However, limiting a movie to a television reduces the possibility that the shooting is in the focus and focus. As a result, we lost a dramatic confrontation that claustrophobic, the second part of the original film (interviews with police, trial, imprisonment and execution). On the small screen there is another version of the Law and Order spin offs. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's searches are constantly being returned to films that succeed in another era. In general, this is a mistake and this is no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are enough. The scenario is complete. The director is not. The film does not just work as a real sensitive tool. The audience does not take ambivalence against Smith and Hickock, the original film. At the end of the television version, we feel like: "Ho hum, who cares?" <br /> <br /> First, look at the big screen as possible, then watch the TV version <br /> <br /> In 1967, the first is to understand why this is an important film. <br /> <br /> Capote and the original book will read directly and will not benefit from reading a bit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
