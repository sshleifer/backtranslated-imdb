This is a very ridiculous film about slavery in West Indies and Puddy stars from the Seinfeld show! Patrick Warburton made his debut in the film he was filming and is very elegant here. Oliver Reed was awarded the best billing, but it was very difficult in the film. Warburton is playing a white slave and forcing him to see all the young and humble women of the older men because they want to have sex with him. The owner of the Eartha Kitt border is very naked in the film. If he were not drunk on the border, then the young women would return with him. Then, of course, there is a revolt against the slaves and bloody confrontation. No real political message like the "burn" movie, but another kind of device for moving the story somewhere. They gave an incredible result and all the rest of Warburton came back! I hope they have paid a few dough because this first movie is pretty bad. Nudity keeps him waiting, and the absence of Warburton's emphasis makes him laugh. It's a very bad movie, but I want to see that later.
