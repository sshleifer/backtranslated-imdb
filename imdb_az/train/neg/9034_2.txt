The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good, and I can not understand half of the things she said about her exaggerated accusations. Melvyn Douglas also plays a different role, and Constance Bennett is so funny, except for a few cries. <br /> <br /> In addition, Roland Young played the best role in the film. He disappeared in the second half of his life because he would draw more lines. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon appear young. I saw it in horrible roles playing with an old old woman playing only 80s from the late 60s. Story-wise, the best part of the douglas slopes claiming to fall, when you see a stunt man seeing good things about skis, may last few minutes. <br /> <br /> <strong> One of the largest cities in the Caucasus, Garbo, It just drags things up, about departure and provocations. This is a boring story. Garbo also knew it and left it.
