In fact, it never happened. I'm not sure Billy Crystal wants to create a great comedy in the 1940s. How many empty places! None of these people are Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, and others. It does not approach, and in any case, today's audience is not facing this easily. Writing is very unimportant. The hackneyed area is thin and clear. There is no chemistry in the foregoing symbols. Interestingly, Julia Roberts thinks that when she was, she was reincarnated by some of the big stars of Hollywood's golden age. This is an effect that can be further successful with Richard Gere at Runaway Bride.
