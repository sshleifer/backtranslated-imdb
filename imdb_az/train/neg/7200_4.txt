I really like this movie - the filming was mostly shot in Pittsburgh and there were some nice photography on the trailer. But even a movie is a really bad movie for a cartoon. Sustainability and pacing were just terrible. The best bits in the movie are end-to-end loans, so it's almost until the end (though it can take less than half an hour). /> When you get the best performance in a movie, Andy Dick, you know there's a problem ...
