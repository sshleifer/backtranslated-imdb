What are your scenes with extreme activity, bad management, exciting long, terrible lighting, painful editing and horrific effects? You got Jessica: A Ghost Story Betacam hit, but this lighting has to praise this media. This is not the case. There are several KIs in which the face is completely shadowed. Especially a scene is the scene of psychiatrists. If you ask me, this is a joke. Some scenes were so long that they could easily be dropped halfway down ... But they would not be a movie like that. The main character is incredibly straightforward. He is a LEAD man, so his character needs elements of "hero", but he is not. She scared the movie and scared all the movies. I can continue, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting is awful, it should be said that they have a nice camera movement. Lighting was very bad, praised it. The DVD's coverage is awesome and it's the end of it. Just horrible.
