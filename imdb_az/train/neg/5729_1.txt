This should be no WORST movie! Acting is not afraid of the movie. There are many bloodsheds, but when I come, I have no idea, they do not even show you the cuts. I do not believe you have watched this movie and spent time. We laughed as we watched a comedy and a fright film. Shame on these horror movies! If we were in Asia, why is there a white police waste waste management box in the old one? There is another language you do not know what's happening in half an hour. Editing a movie is a joke, my teenage daughter would be better. When I went to a cinema theater and worked in the window, which was the first hint of a bad old man. DO NOT USE THIS THEME! HERE AGAINST HAMMIN, AND SORRY YOU DID NOT!
