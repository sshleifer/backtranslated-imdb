Horrible film! Must be against some real stinkers put forward for golden spawn. They took the story of the first female celebrity Renaissance artist and went beyond recognition. My complaint does not accept freedom of expression; If the story is good, that would be a great thing. But it's just strange - the real story of all artists would make this artist a better movie, so why did it come with a delightful scenario of this delight? I think there is not enough nude in the actual version. With a summary of the painter's life, we have come to a halt - if we support the rest of the film with the same restrictions, we can save ourselves in a few hours.
