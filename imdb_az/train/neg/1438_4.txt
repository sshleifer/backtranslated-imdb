Yes! What does he say? First, this adaptation is 4 hours longer than the complexity (or lack of) of the plot. Actors make this movie really difficult to do, but there is very little content for the present time. Swayzee is really a Quatermain character. After seeing the great man in Sean Connery's "Extraordinary Gentle Union," Swayzee really does not value it. The Winchester repetitive rifle does not have the strength, height, sensitivity or humor required for the part of this trail, and that everyone's excitement, including the attraction physician, is more credible as an actor than the rest of the remainder. Some vistas are pleasing, but there are some mistakes in cinematography. For example. As the happy group comes to the water hole in the middle of the desert, their traces are awaited oasis, just waiting for them to go. Climbing over the mine leads to a subsequent shooting, as they can be seen from the passing passage and they protest. I was waiting for Doug McClure to wait any moment. I wish him some ways. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who follow Quatermain is an enthusiastic stereotypical character who shoots everything. Swayzee is very good as a sad father, he can return to London and can not control his son. Swayzee should have something like this. <br /> <br /> A part of a serious gentleman can not bear with heart, life experience and fair play.
