Too bad what animals or Eddie Murphy was worth saying. <br /> <br /> Children's movie? Yes, if you try to take them a wildlife, maybe. The funny quip is just about 90 minutes away from a few poor eyesight lips. And lip-sync'ing is seen in the brilliant comparison of old Godzilla films. Eddie, "Pluto Nash" Murphy, has a regrettable supply, but it is painful. Apparently, he tries to change the old manic identity, but why? In short, all the magic and miracles of the original version of 1967 are re-imagined or lost, no matter what. A city wants to blame some of the forest creatures for violence and evil. No, really. And Pluto Nash can be psycho-neglected with them. <br /> <br /> <strong> Lease "67" movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
