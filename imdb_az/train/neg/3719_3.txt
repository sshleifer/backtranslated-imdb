Throw a mask of a deadly conspirator and look for Barbara Kartli ... what happens to this movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " "(Andrea) is" innocent, whimsical beauty "(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of spending her time to create a unique place, the filmmakers pulled straight into the pocket: the bad guy was beautifully crazy about that. a series of sincere and heavy cliché love scenes scattered by philosophical / poetic smokes.It is used to alter Andrey's "poet" to change the qualities of the Byronic hero - but in writing heavily and emphatically, he still believes in him difficult - or care. <br /> <br /> Byronic hero / antihero work This is a modern day, not Funk Phantom, but a poor and very stupid woman (soft knicker elastic) who looks dangerous as a bunny slipper after a conversation with her is a bad man what happens when. <br /> <br /> The audience could save this movie, if they were good, how sexy and "other" women would look, no matter how strong or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been seen as a narcotic, as it was crushed by his own part. This is not his best job. Interesting enthusiasts are Jürgen Prochnow's "Wise" and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. She had a good film sister and instead of her brother.
