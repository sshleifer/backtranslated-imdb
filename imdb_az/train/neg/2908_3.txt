Based on one of the books given by Gabriel Marquez, it can be a brilliant literature, which is more sounds like cinema-adaptation, rather than enjoying some cinematographic impressions, as a fight against sleep. The story is about an old couple who died in a lifetime of extreme poverty, and the main character I hope is a cock that brings some money for a future cocktail. You do not have a soul to leak more words on this useless ambitious piece, maybe you can see Salma Hayek from where it is, but does it sit for 90 minutes in front of your screen? No gracias .....
