Amazing! Wow. Who said Edward D. Wood Jr did not influence anyone? This ingredient of donkey dropping is a perfect situation; this "Violent Years" looks like "Casablanca"! Keith Richards's negative delays in "Santa Claus" seem to be my first night emission. I'm in fear, you know, wake up and do not swing the bullets, never will Santa Claus come close to viseral terror that appears from the visible pure earth of my existence. But I can think about some of the parties that I think is going to be really good. Also, if you want a perfect example for a Santa-Satan dichotomy in the VHS tape, look no further. Check out this movie because the MST3K version has already been reported. Take action on the devil, here is "Santa Claus."
