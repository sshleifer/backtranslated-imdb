Actually, I really did not like this movie for the main films! These are both uneducated, self-dependent, and self-dependent people. They play a painful game for everyone around them. Visual effects were good, but no characters or an interesting storyline is good. These two psychological men Finally, should I be happy when I finish my love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, "Should this be France's No. 1 beam?" <br /> Spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the end, GOOD RIDDANCE! Both deserve one another! <br /> <br />
