Generally, as a great fan of gorilla films, I was expecting one of them to be great and when it comes to the effects of ghosts, they are pretty good - this is the only thing I can write about flop. Based on a true story, the film claims that Buddy, in real life, is not the closest to what's happening, but the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros with our "heroism". Gertrude Lintz, as a woman known by many animal enthusiasts, was in the best interest of the animals' welfare. As Buddy was portrayed as an aggressor, it was a common artworks and, in fact, the ghosts in real life resorted to such behavior. he was saved from a storm during a storm (not a plush ceiling room described in the film) to seek shelter and comfort in a home that my friend Gertrude Lintz was afraid to sell. No, Buddy was not allowed to go to a gorilla family surrounded by trees in paradise - he was left alone in a wooden box with a light bulb for comfort at a depth of the garage, and then circus - until he was really killed before a show in Miami he had lived a better life with the crushed peanut, until he was killed by the oldest live gorilla writing. In the film, let's also tell you how Buddy grows, but chimpanzees are not aging. (The chimpanzee is not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy)
