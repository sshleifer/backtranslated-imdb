The worry about the book "Memories of Geisha" was Japanese surfaces, but it was the mindset of all people on the surfaces. <br /> <br /> Reading the book was like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, kits and suits prepared by the barnyard animals dressed in this suit. About Japan or real geisha. It is a story of a few American people who have been mistaken in their ignorance and mistaken ideas about Japan and the geisha. So what if this film is not about Japan or geisha? Is a clean fantasy as many people say? Yes, but then why is it America's fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were many missed opportunities. The crime of sex does not have any meaning, and think of a culture that has no puritan suspension. Sex is normal and normal. How does this movie manage sex? Thanks. As is dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the film is that a couple of cockroaches have dropped into his mouth while trying to close Sayuri's nose in a dull way up to five seconds. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be different, but what we see is pushing her lover because she looks like she does not want to get dirty. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. Nope. It is like a cold wooden meat in a cut-off block. Of course, it is not necessary to dislike it. And what does this movie mean? Why did not you like to give him something? Why Should All Sex Be Moral and False? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br He could have falsified his auction and could save himself. Nobu did not even bid. So why did the old codger, leading the lead, let him get it and let the old man grieve and throw his fingers into his bare body? <br /> Does any woman truly forgive a person for this sin? <br /> <br /> Let's try to figure it out. Because of his being behind the mama, the chairman paid off his debts for Sayuri's geisha education. To recall his debts, Mr. Sayuri Kr. He sold it to Crab. Through Mameha, President Sauer sold his old geyser sexual superiority, and his head could make some money. The board is not its boss. He was a mouse! Some romantic love stories. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is beautiful, but the beauty of a very attractive, attractive transvestite, which is exciting for its voice, appearance, and touch. But this is a harmful mystery under the feminine surface. Under the film's wrong-looking Japanese surface, the heart, soul, spirit and core of this movie are absolutely American and personal. <br /> <br /> Some contradictions between Japan and the MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Carefree, refined simplicity. MOAG style? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Hair sweeped. MOAG geisha ?? <br /> <br /> Japanese chicken ice - Japanese are very tough against seasonal observations. The accumulated ice is fresh in the summer. MOAG sweat - Young Saure, played by Chio's prominent Suzuka Ohgo, takes this treatment in the cherry-flower-care season. <br /> <br /> The Japanese geisha ??? Training and experienced entertainers. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind bell - after hearing the voice used in the summer, thanks to the salutary, the Japanese people feel a bit cold. MOAG wind bell - a doorbell! <br /> <br /> If a man stood in front of someone else's house, and the wind was blowing, he would be considered a lunat. <br /> <br /> Japan? Focus on human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance: "I want a life" American Individuality. Caring elegance. Immediate geometric and mechanical accuracy. MOAG dance? Martha Graham was overwhelmed by LSD wearing numerous good white Japanese funeral shroud. A ramp to a place seemed like a strip club by geisha? Ha ha ha! <br /> What is the fire in Japan? It is worse than offense to extinguish or even allow fire because it creates such a danger to society. The fire can pass through hundreds of villages, towns and towns where thousands of homes are destroyed and many people have been killed. Fire in the MOAG house - a great addition to the Stage of Struggle, but there are zero defects and an unexpected fire exposes itself miraculously. Technically, the film here has ended, because at least Sayuri has been accused of committing herself and joining her sister again and again. <br /> <br /> Both Arthur Gold and Rob Marshall should be released. <br /> Enough. Movie is incorrect.
