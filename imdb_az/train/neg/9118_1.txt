This is the worst movie ever I've ever seen in my life. It could be the worst movie ever. Some movies are good, so good; this film goes to an unpleasant camp in the past and is simply unwatchably terrible. Anti-enantiodromia. We had the intention of joining it, and my whole family gathered in the entertaining evening of clever words; <br /> <br /> This is worse than the rings of the animated king. This Matrix is ​​worse than resistant. Worse than Krulld. Worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film should not be on television at ten feet.
