It's probably a comedy comedy that sets out the feminists' teeth in modern times. Branch Manager Betsy Drake is in love with babies and the idea of ​​marriage, and hopes for women magazines spying on milk until they have a cured virgin Cary Grant. The rest of the film goes to a post-staged phase because the relentless Drake follows her quarry. I guess just about the role of the rolling role. He has a seductive smile, but remembering 20 minutes of prosthesis, I began to dose over the dose. Grant's role is basically secondary and reduces its usual ability. However, there is a scene that almost keeps these delicate exercises. Drake asks hottest Hrant, watching a one-room ceremony of esteemed women. Here's a very strikingly fresh way of life that is really remarkable - and after the production of the 90 minutes of delight with our nose, the film could have been more than a girl's day-up in 1948.
