I am 47 years old and I remember most of my life as an admirer of horror and fantasy films. They are silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, and few can find anything like me. Well, I'm going to give this movie credit for the good and the living, but that's all. This is an effect on the story. Truth, we live at a time when we are a little left in the fear movie. To do this, you really need a good, original story for any movie to have fun. A good story can overcome bad influences and act badly, but a bad event with good action and good effects is still a bad movie. There are no good effects in this movie, which have a good effect. So go through the process of fear alone.
