The B movie is the best. The sound effects are pretty good. Lame concept, decent execution. I guess that's a rent. <br /> <br /> "You think that you throw olive oil out of poison, so you touch it and get rid of it, and Tommy will do well." When Agent Harris calls you to call, "You are in an airstrike!" <br /> <br /> "Weapons - we need weapons, does silver have a place?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
