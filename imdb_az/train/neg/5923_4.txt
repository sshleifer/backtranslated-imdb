The commitment split during the civil war was in most cases; Undoubtedly, many of them were in "Border States". From the border, a young father, Ouen Moore, went to join the Union Army. As soon as the Confederate soldier Henry B. left Walthall, he goes into the enemy's property and is waterless; The juvenile finds a supply from his young daughter, Gladys Egan. While Yankee soldiers are watching him, Little Gladys helps to conceal the Confederacy innocently. Later, when he returned to kill his father, he was remembered for the goodness of the little girl. A sweet little story from Director D.W. Griffith. Earth imagery and humanity are shown with love. <br /> <br /> In Border Countries (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
