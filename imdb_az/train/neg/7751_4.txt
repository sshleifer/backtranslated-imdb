First, in this film CGI was terrible. I watched the SciFi channel watch the bad movies marathon. After being killed by the park owner, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The night of the dead was also better animation. <br /> <br /> There was almost no plot in the movie. Why did you have this island especially? Yes, it was not in the film. Why do people enter the cat area? <br /> <br /> What's going on in this movie is a mid-level player. In the movie "Prepared for B Movie", the player was very good. Parry Shen was particularly noteworthy. <br /> <br /> If you do not have anything on Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.
