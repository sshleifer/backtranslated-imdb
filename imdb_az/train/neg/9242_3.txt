What a fantastic foundation: a film about Berlin Airlift. All this must be. Tragedy. Thirst. Friendly. Competitors. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and tears. What we do is a movie that does not have any of the above. Heino Ferch looks like John Wayne or like it, but he fails to fail. He works on a wooden floor, at any one point. Trying to play a tough guy instead of being a difficult guy! Why does Bettina Zimmermann love her? Because they throw stones at a lake? Because it brings coal bricks? SFX has done very well. Very much though. Hundreds or more airplanes on Berlin seem to be an attack-fighter-forming team instead of an organized air? in fact as it is. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clays are all identical and dark and dusty. As a protective shield against nuclear disintegration, pay close attention to the same coatings that depend on the depth of the windows. What is almost every scene is dark and dusty? Incidentally, GENERAL LUCIUS D. Clay comes to his gigantic idea as a small, insecure, weak General who relies on the airplane. He was on the contrary. Thus, it combines all these individual mistakes and ultimately does not have any passion, no downturn, or historical accuracy. Sad, so hopefully began?
