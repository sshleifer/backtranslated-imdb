Dear dear dear dear dear ... to me! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it's so bad that we've had problems with everything. It was a kind of Tremors for kids. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this movie is all prepared. It looks like a props from some bad brands (children), and what can they do just that? <br /> <br /> Is the audience the movie? Only 12-14 years old can think. If you are over 14 years old, you will face serious problems with this movie. It's not just slow, but it's very boring. The heroes (though a bit) have been overcrowded and have fun for some time ... but it's not long enough to throw tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that's going to happen, yes ... In some cases you've seen a BILLION times on television for children in any heroic series. I chose all the salvors and all the food. <br /> <br /> That's why we've had laughter now and then. It's just a scenic scene with a repeat or two ... or two baby tremors that they throw themselves into one of the open-air tremor feeding guys ... Indeed, read it over and over again, and laugh out loud. Still, when I think of it, I feel encouraged. But it just happens once more ... And when the "badass" looks like an armed man with a very good part ... and "On the one hand they spread out like a DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point, we laugh with laughter. But then .. nothing could have been top .. (?) .. so there is a poorly poor person there. <br /> <br /> So the balls are demonic and prove. If someone tells you that's a good movie ... or a "plant", a plant or a very bad one. This film is one of the worst disturbing tremors. We look forward to seeing the Tremors 3, but they are able to have a box office shape ... this * walnut boom * is good ... I'll leave it.
