Everything about this movie was terrible. There was a good cast to start with this movie, and I can not make such a big cast in the gangster film genre. The sound track looked like one of the very bad squash comedy. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This movie has been filmed throughout the whole film and is a very disturbing one began to take action. <br /> <br /> Please Please,
