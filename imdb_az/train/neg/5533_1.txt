Before the night, describing George Romero's "Dead Dead" night, zombies were relatively well-behaved animals. In the old days, of course, it was a better table. But how did the early zombie film show the public's excitement on the public? <br /> <br /> There is nothing to talk about this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition going to Cambodia to find and destroy the mystery of zombie violence. One party detects their secrets and builds a zombie army. <br /> <br /> This film is mostly a triangle of love with zombies. But because of the 30th movie, the zombies are more Somnambulists than the meat we eat today. They seem to be an intolerable appetite, not an answer to the control of the mind. And, in general, the "rebellion" is a bit below. Everything is really boring. There is no top melodramatic theater to entertain us, except that there is no horror. It does not seem likely that more than 70 years ago would provide much fun. You have to see everything under the 'zombie', but in another way I advise you to skip this one.
