What a joke. I watch it on Channel 1 and watch the dyes are more entertaining. Caspar went to Van Dien for this. Horrible motion, a very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so scary, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of tension, but more comedy. Check out this movie if you want to see terrifying, scary, and sub-parable. If I were Van Dien, I do not want 10% of my agent, but it's a mess. What is turkey? This is not suitable for MST 3K! You would be a good movie for the treatment of insomnia. Especially love Van Dien part of the sea and then return it back in a few minutes! I was writing by the writers of the nonviolent writer's writing. What a horrible movie!
