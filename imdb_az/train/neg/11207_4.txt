After the release of this movie for the first time, I showed great interest in seeing Flashy on the big screen. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment - I left it alone for 20 years without going to watch it, but it was not the best for the second time. Mr. Fraser is a very sophisticated writer, but I'm not an admirer of the film's scenario with Richard Lester. An angel for the slapstick 'Three Muslims' is spoiled for me and is being applied here too. For me, all the tones and feelings of the film are wrong. Flashman books are very funny, but adventure novels. Flash is very serious to exhibit - all in dangerous situations. It is delivered in novels, but in comedy style it is not transmitted in any way. It is a great shame that it would be a great movie if it had a more consistent adaptation to the style of the book. When I first read that book was going to be, the film was the star of Oliver Reed. I'm glad that Rid was Flashman's episode for me. I would like to see her in her role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit Flashman's visual appearance created by books (very sensitive! Flashman should have been a big sticky man). Reed was as good as Bismarck. It's done as a killing comedy. The only scene that creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene where Flashman killed Gautet (Tom Bell). Generally, production values, suits, kits and so on. It's a great shame, and casting is absolutely excellent - just everyone in the movie is very well beyond Malcolm McDowell. The director of Richard Lester was responsible for the film, because a new radio adaptation called "Freedom for Flash" adapted by Mr. Fraser worked very well. Probably one day we may have seen justice on the screen of Flash.
