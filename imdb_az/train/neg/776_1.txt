When I was 6 or 7, I saw this cartoon. My dad bought a free video at the shopping center. I was reminded that it really sucked. Land is meaningless. I hated Casper's friendly fox. That was so fool! Casper cried when he could not find a friend. So what? Get him out! When the tissue is shot and when it dies, it is only a good part and I do not want to vote for my heart. I had a lot of this cartoon because I laughed at the repayment. The bad news fox gives life and is a dream. Oh, I wish she was dead. I think that's because I hated this video because I hated it. They offered free at the shopping center. If you have a child, do not allow them to watch them. Certainly, they will agree with me.
