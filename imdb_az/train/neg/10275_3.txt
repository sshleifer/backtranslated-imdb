It's spectacular and some of the players, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but it's not possible to watch this movie. Music is just as if it were written in some kind of royalty free online site and the words written in the cover dictionary on the lid. Singing is mostly off-key. I think they were singing and listening to music ... The dialogue was really stupid and surprising. The movie works really well when talking about real estate, but unfortunately, this often deals with foolish farcical subfields. I checked myself in the first twenty minutes, and after 40, it would never end.
