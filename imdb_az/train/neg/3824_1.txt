I do not feel the film has historically shown Smithi. The purpose of this film was to describe Smith's life in a "relaxed" way to the leaders of the LDS Church, and historic accuracy seems less of anxiety. The film "as a human being" was intended to be a "faith-propagating" experience, not a balanced view of Smith. I took it from myself to study Smith's life and read the LDS works as well as LDS's work. The film, like most of the LDS projects, is beautifully drawn and well-functioned. But this is not a true description of the beginning of a relatively short life of Mormonism or Smith. <br /> <br /> Smit, at age seven, was given an important time to perform an accident. Although this phenomenon is undoubtedly important in shaping his mental outlook, the main reason to include him in the film is to help Joseph Smith create a sympathetic look. Another point describes Smith's younger years: The film is silent about the presence of the Smith family in magic applications in the 1820s. Some problems show that Joseph Smith, who is kindly entertained in the film, wrestling competitions, sometimes does not show how he has lost and suffered. <br /> <br /> I can continue. This film is in no way history and should be regarded as a fictional film about a man. I do not advise to invite this movie to other entertainment than to other entertainment.
