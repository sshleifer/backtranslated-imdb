and rents a good fear film. The writer, first of all, did not see a horror film, everything he wrote was klichel and hackneyed, and was a parody for the films like "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> </ b> The BANAL and BORING dialog boxes are the most common among frightened bits. Stupid said, "We are going to the baby." I wanted to close my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was not necessary to make this movie. Leader lady is not interested and I thought "Is it true that Guy obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters are acting stupid, including the police. <br /> Without at least one problem killing anyone he wants. There is no resistance from victims (or gates). No one can protect or revert (or turn the safety lock on the door of the hotel room) is the least idea. People look like sheeplike ones with mental disabilities. <br /> <br /> If you are a supporter, you will be disappointed. All the killings are kept on the screen and the ahem is finished with taste. <br /> <br /> None of the murders is at least interesting. <br /> <br /> Because we know most of the recent events. <br /> <br /> It was always a cats that were just filmed in such clumsy films. "Oh kitty, I scared me, I killed you - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> When it comes to murder at the end of the murder, at the end, is the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience shouted and spoke through the screen. To believe was terrible and not enough scary. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> So, to save some good fears with some of the original folds, keep your money on "Carrie" or "Friday 13" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" any one) to rent.
