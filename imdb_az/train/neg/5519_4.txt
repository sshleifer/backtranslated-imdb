Okay, so the preview on this movie says only one rebellious young girl is going to live with her grandmother for summer to sort out the summer. In fact it is not! <br /> <br /> That's why it really makes the concept of a movie really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there was a very good field between Anna and her daughter and a matter of love / hatred really good. But I did not like watching Lindsay Lohan's player. In fact, this film would be great if it was someone else, perhaps a better actress. Rachel's (Lohan) character is a very sexually aggressive person, and this movie reminds us of the real Lindsay, which is more than a film. <br /> I think that too. On the one hand, Lindsay, you will enjoy this movie. The end is quite big (and sad).
