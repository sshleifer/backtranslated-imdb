good writing is versatile, management was very effective, and correction was even worse (hopefully at least it was adjusted). Actor is not bad, but not good either. none of the many characters seemed to like it. at least 45 minutes of film time was spent and was not used anywhere near the other clock or its full potential. It was a good idea, but another good idea wasted. It could end in 3 different places, but an extremely well-anticipated Hollywood came to an end. and the unexpected thing was bad, though not bad. the last thing was not worth the look. sandra bullock was out of its element and should avoid such films. The film also looked fled. The film was not really worth seeing, and I would be crazy if I had earned a lot of money for that. Perhaps I'm more disappointed than expecting a better movie and worse. The whole movie was terrible, but I would not advise. I gave it 10 b / c, and I liked it very much and I'm just like a character (I just believe it is super clever). and there were many inexpensive ways to cover the field holes. It was as if it was trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it's pretty. Perhaps you can see a $ 1.50 theater or video, and if you do not like any movie you like, you'll be like that.
