Well then. I just watched some of the movies - all of them with different quality grades. At first I was not sure how much I wanted to review. Then he hit me like sack-rats: Rodentz. Warning about Rodentz. These monsters do not give the stars to anyone and sits painfully. And about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... true freaking 'original. Who is the "dish of gods" or "Willard"? These are better than this, and this is not so much ... <br /> <br /> Possible skillful guys ** The story here: Inna Laboratory scientist and his brave assistant are testing the rats and their laboratories in an unhappy neighborhood and in a terrible building and the brave boss's moronic friends look drunken, and everyone is fed to dull rats and there is only one death giant and a giant mouse that's just about everyone's death, but it's dead. There is one sentence all there! Spoyler, you say? Ppfff !! I differ, I beg you! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ strong> br / > <br /> - I was watching him free, but for everyone ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> He did not give life, he did not help: <br /> <br /> - Good ... good. Gore was good. - Very moderate cinematography. <br /> <br /> CG rats are not as bad as it might be in some shooting ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CG rats in other shots are pathetically inexpensive was. If the movie has a low budget, you should not rely on CG. We must take lessons. <br /> <br /> The player is very weak. <br /> <br /> - The heroes are not interested - we have a mish-mash clich√©, and none of them works well. . <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - It has been seen before - many times. <br /> <br /> The true story is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> - Giant mice seem like a fat man in a miserable bear costume - it was funny, but not quite funny. <br /> <br /> - Give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> - Nearly unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> All college students, rat rat people drink tequila in large plastic cups - still do not seem drunk for anything longer than a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. Just horrible. Worse than you think. For example, it is not funny as "Cork" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these films can be unhappy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Life is a companion. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (Sometimes Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialog: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for time) Writing: 1/10 Director: 2/10 <br /> < Cheese: 7/10 Frost: 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only you can watch rattling and pile-based fright films if you like.
