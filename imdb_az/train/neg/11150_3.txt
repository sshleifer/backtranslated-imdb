I watched this movie individually, in the dark, and was full of love! That's what I was aiming to do. So all the elements were in this movie to frighten me to hell! In fact, I did not want to close the DVD player in just 8 minutes, but, unfortunately, I thought about giving it a chance. The player was terrific, only Samaire Armstrong had a good game. The area is not the original, but a curtain of fear, the same thing that you have seen many times before. Some scenes do not understand anything, and you just want the director to want a movie for a longer time! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. (Scared) scenes look like a horror movie when there is not enough technology since the 1980s, but some good movies are back! At the beginning of the film, I was surprised to see the name of a major production company, and I thought it would be unlikely that it would put a bit of money on it and make it worth it. !! The rating of the film could not have been more agreeable, which is a rating for me, from 3 to 10.
