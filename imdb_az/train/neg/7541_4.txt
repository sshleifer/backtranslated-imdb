big mystery, but the film falls below the hill. A car crashed from the very beginning and a woman and her daughter are promised a police officer revived before Edward. This is followed by trauma and sensitive medication. A mysterious letter begins to ask the old girl to help her find the missing girl. So, Ed goes mainly to a woman's island. They do not like the outside. Ed with many filler, Ed is looking at the city for the city. The film took a long time. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, not a well-written story, but a long time ago. <br /> <br /> As you know, <br /> <br /> RESULTS: I would skip it.
