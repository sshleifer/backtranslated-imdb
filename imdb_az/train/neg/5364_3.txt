The complaints are valid, and the biggest challenge for me is to direct this soap opera to women. Like the sky's anatomy or the Ugly Betty or the West wing, I'm good at this night because there are stories that are interesting to them even when they never end. However, a female colleague for the general hospital ... or baywatch, to put the hunting men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) to make parallels with innocent soaps, to make sexual tension and tears and even funny situations in even a small hospitals. Men wanted and they existed, so it is true that women want to be like that, but this high brown show (or something to watch) is true.
