Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote a story from Roth. This is a zombie film and a genuine Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot, a huge owed to George Romero and his previous "live dead movies", Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead." there is no work here, and the story is not of this kind, it is not related to this story, but this story is unsuccessful. and said it was better. Roth is a filmmaker, and a crazy, strange, mean, meaningless (though more ambitious) crap fest Hostel.Roth is a good film, but it is a work of art compared to the profession. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) believes that filmmaking is a wrong choice of profession. Cabin fever, as poor as a 3/10 hostel, is like a Hostel.
