Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most satisfying areas (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in the hands of hands. Even his random floppy (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows the signs of life and humor so that he can appreciate it. So I was disappointed that Reith could not get enough of the original space (a person takes off the super-hero, the super-hero gets superpower-intensive revenge) and makes it a pleasant one. "Girlfriend" is a meaningless action. The tooth for a long time after the first 20 minutes of a trick pony area. The film can not resolve whether romantic comedy or super heroism is a drama. As a result, what is a movie of flip flops between both sides, what is done in a very good way. Uma Thurman as usual, and Luke Wilson does not take on his role, although his creepy antics are often tired. It is even more confusing that in some scenes (when you hit a head on a wall), you feel practically shouting, flawless Reitman opus to quit. But later, as if magic, the movies were as fast as superheroine, which was almost disappointed in every way.
