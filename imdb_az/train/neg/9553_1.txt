It is not surprising that this DVD is released to the Australian DVD, but it does not have anything to do with it. Dialogue hockey, the player was terrific and asked for a script! Whoever thinks, then a better John Badham movie, Wargames from the 80s, would be a good idea and something that was a good idea! Amanda Walsh was good as candy / love in the eyes, Matt Lanter was as good as the other main reason - about it. I will not offer Wargames: give the Death Code to anyone, check Hackers or the original Wargames - both are better than this crap!
