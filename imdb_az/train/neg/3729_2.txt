First, I saw this movie at Christian Scholl, where I was 7 years old. Of course, I was afraid of my mind. Though not terrible, for content. Because ... I was 7 years old. Cinematography was pretty bad and the player was cheese. I think it's only 7 years old, and I remember it. Something that insulted me was that scary song, "If we were all ready", which ended with the chorus "... behind you". I will not offer to see this. Probably because of nostalgia. In addition, I'm sure that remake is better. Although this is the best part of the movie, everyone should be "dissapears"; empty car collapses, meadows work on themselves ... pretty cheerful.
