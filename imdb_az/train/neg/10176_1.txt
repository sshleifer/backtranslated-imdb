INFORMATION LEGISLATION: FUTURE FINDINGS (1998) ½ *. Written by Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, John Warren and 100 minutes of PG-13 directed by Blake French <br /> <br /> Believe or not believe in the comedy "MAHOR LEAGUE: BACK TO YOU" in the new John Warren comedy, there is a comic scene, a sequence of baseball difficulties in a wall behind a tough coach, only hitting and hitting the cement. but not all linen, all this movie offers ... it was not enough. <br /> <br /> This movie is not structurally developed, predictable and bad, but just bad Even members of non-critical audiences will hate all that they get from this movie, not so much fun that is not just funny. <br /> <br /> Idm How many times should we shoot the same movie about the moment? In recent years, we have seen the same movie in "Air Bud: Gold Reception" and it is worse than this movie, which is even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family-oriented. "The Greatest League for the Junior" is a strange thing to look at at a friendly family on Sunday afternoon. This is very childhood for adults. Who is this movie? Teens? Older? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Yes, there is a great moral to try to prove it. Unfortunately, we have already seen it, and many times we have to exclude it many times that these guys are the men in the ballerin's suits that have so little talent and intelligence. Intelligent speakers have a liner for themselves, where they create "friends comedy rhythms" for themselves, "They suck," "The fast ball of these guys is full of one hour bottle." "This man lost a lot of time to find something - maybe his mind "" Someone needs a cushion "and" I see a beautiful sunset like this. "The heroes are not as important as we do not know them by name. <br /> <br /> The only sincere lecture on teamwork is unclear - it's not funny. <br /> <br /> "Going to the Big League for Juniors" is very bad; bent in the middle of a good bonding sequence. A good baseball team will return, they are going to win - power off. For a moment I thought that this piece of trash had come to an end, but in fact, the fake final scene is just to add a minute to the running period. The film is made up of many unusual sketches. A coach and a player have another kind of funny dialogue line chatting with each other for a long time about what the outsider is no longer in this position. Technical Coach's Response: "You're too old, too slow and very greasy". The player is to die for the reaction. However, this scene does not focus on your time and, of course, is not worth a percentage of your money. <br /> <br /> So, in this genre of film, there is another horrible entrée, something else is limited to its own script, something that has not been seen before, and something else familiar to it seems like a vampire. <br /> <br />
