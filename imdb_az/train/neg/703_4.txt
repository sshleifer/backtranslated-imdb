<br /> <br /> The dead guest (aka Pranks) consists of a mixed bag for slasher fans. Film production values ​​are pretty low, and for most of the story, the story is pretty routine, there's a creepy bum hanging around for red gum. In fact, most of the story's structure is unforgettable, apart from one or two brutal crimes. But the film is really amazed at the staggering peak (atmospheric conditions) and a fairly brave, unconventional outcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stephen Sachs is a very good thing, as is the case with a pretty good shift. Also look for Daphne Zuniga as a young student. <br /> <br /> All of this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but wants the finale good and this is a movie for the audience. <br /> <br /> <strong>
