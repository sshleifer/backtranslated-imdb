Dane is overwhelming by calling all the trouble and rounding up the whole bundle and bare, wavy water. More. Calm yourself, gather yourself and make us laugh. I did not quite understand comic and rock stars comparison. Is it just on stage or somewhere? Every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure that Rodney Dangerfield was right then. People are like a driver, there are some good jokes like Burger King jokes. I also liked Reese's Pieces jokes. Dane did not just act like that, she could have fun, and maybe I could give her a high rating as eighth.
