The film is dirty. Just horrible. The bad movies in Bollywood do not end! <br /> <br /> This problem can be referred to the major directors. There are two good players in the film who have proved in the past that it is capable of delivering a great performance ... but they are very poorly directed. Poor script also did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie has very funny moments and very bad regulations in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his 1st big concert, Ajay Devgan meets Om Puri (who fled 30 years ago and again) and Om Puri says that with Salman's friendship! What is the empty space? Seriously. Baaad soundtrack is not to mention. <br /> <br /> Ayay Devg√ºn is a general crisis of describing a rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace is good output in the second half. Ajay shines as dark as the dark side. Salman is a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Maybe just watch in the last half an hour.
