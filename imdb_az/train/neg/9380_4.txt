A dead vagabond woman told flashbacks in the past few weeks in her life. Like Vagabond, the film is purposefully and rationless. Mona is lazy, lazy, dark and addicted to drug addiction, but Bonnaire is not interesting. Although he has some ambitious dialogue trying to explain Mona's choice of self-sacrificing lifestyle, his motivations are not really clear. The episodic nature of the movie covers some random characters, and after a while it becomes tiring and longer than its duration. It is difficult to believe that an attractive young homeless woman will not pay more attention to men.
