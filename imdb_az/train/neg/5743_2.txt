Yes, I know that this film is one of the few people who want to get into the dust of oblivion. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about events in the Caucasus. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" What can happen * Start with the first big drawback I did not know that the movie was called "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and I did not see any contact with vampires if I had not seen some people see blood bleeding, FANGLESS ???? The second bad point: What is Metal? Apparently, all young people, mostly vampires, come from different types of Metal, unlike their shirts! Do not misunderstand me, For more than 15 years, I have been involved in more extreme music, but Iron Maiden (all bands !!!) will not be scared by showing me a little ridiculous T-shirts running around T- Vampires! <br /> <br /> Third weakness: actors, wait a minute, what's the actor? You're the director's boardwalk! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <stron "Briliant" director was able to become a strong point and something if he did not want to create ARTIFICIAL Vampire theme. I wanted to see vampires, but I would like to use my baseball bubble that was treated with some stupid children. Filmmakers should only advertise the film, saying "B-rank is not something horrifying, it's too expensive." <br /> <br /> This film is a blasphemy against the whole concept of Vampirism. And that makes me sick.
