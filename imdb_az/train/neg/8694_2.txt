The female device was a terrifying actress who made the entire movie inaccessible. When she went to the cameras to talk with her daughter, she was very smiling. This police had to question her. In the same situation, I would be hurt. She calmed down for a mother who could not find her daughter. It did not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played better. And it would have made more money on such a controversial issue. Everyone was excellent. I do not know where the actress is, but I hope she has some actor lessons.
