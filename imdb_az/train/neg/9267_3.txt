After the disappointing "Last Conflict", there is a rock bottom in the series with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film failed to continue Damien's story (with this failure) "Omen" (animals are afraid of the Dajjal, death is one of the deaths, the death of a man in the first film). But here, exciting and creative, may seem just dumb. And the little girl just looks like a damaged kid.
