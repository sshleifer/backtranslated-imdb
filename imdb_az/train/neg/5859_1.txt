Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They want to be local and folklore but international. This brings the kitsch results to a movie. <br /> <br /> The film has jokes from Spanish to Turkish and has no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even after 10 years for the Turkish audience. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have a worse game than average. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing about Cuba. Thus, Cuba is thought to be a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Money, time loss.
