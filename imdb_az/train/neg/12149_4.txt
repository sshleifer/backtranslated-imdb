Providence, founded on the island of Roda, is trying to look at a satirical view of the role of media in the government, eating the Mass. At best, while the US tries to control the media during the Iraq war, it feels hollow. The story is never really tense and will never go well. The worst thing is that the direction of the film is strange, "When it's not the only way to capture the camera," they pay more attention to the single camera angles that can not deliver anything. <br /> <br /> For a while, the video of the explosion has been covered with green screen and is the best laugh. <br /> <br /> There are several bright spots in the film ... for post-zombie services (including melioration and party buses). But the film is too small to be valuable. <br /> <br /> Hide and Creep for a better zombie movie. It has the same weak production value, but there is more wisdom, humor, and talent behind it.
