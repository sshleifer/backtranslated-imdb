Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had a broad (separate) movie career before they were grouped. For many of the pre-Stan movies of the movie, Babe Hardy was shown to the screen ... and in her mature life, Hardy was known as "Babe". Hardy interviewed John McCabe, a journalist describing the origin of this nickname: Early in the actor's career, Hardy took a shave of a gay hairdresser. Hardy's soft cheeks (those on the face) and "Beautiful baby!" They said. Hardy's colleague 'Babe' began crying and his nickname was tightened. <br /> <br /> Although most of Hardy's pre-Laurel work is interesting, especially with Larry Semon and Chaplin's imitator Billy West - Billy Ruge (who?) on a number of low-budget shorts for Vim Comedy Film Company scared. Hardy and Ruge Screen Names Plump and Runt: They were given unpleasant titles, but Ruge (even shorter than Hardy) deteriorated, especially because of a run. As you can see here, Hardy appears to be as much as in the early Hal Roach movies with Laurel ... but without saliva curls and sensitive small mustache. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Plump (Hardy) is a star-owned property in a single-family home with long distances. Runt is a porter. Plump receives a letter from his rich uncle, John, waiting for his inheritance. His uncle comes to see him and reach Plump's wife and his baby. There is only one problem: plump did not have a wife and baby. She lies to her uncle for the family to appear. Now, of course, Plump expects Runt to find a wife and a baby soon enough. Of course, the result is disastrous. These catastrophic results would be good if laughable, but they are not. <br /> <br /> Some mistaken humor is an empty rifle with symbols that separate each other from the winds. <br /> <br /> ALLEGATIONS WILL COME. Vim director Will Louis (who?) Does not show any instinct for the camera's shooting: The actress playing the house is significantly longer than Hardy, and Louis is continuously building his shooting so that she can scratch her head. It can be funny if implemented for this purpose, but it is simply unreasonable. At this point in the worst comedy, when Runt approaches a black linen dress, the horizontally rattling stick rises. "Surely they will not be down for a laugh," I said. But they are doing it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <The uncle's ladder comes with a ladder, Dolanma calls, call for infancy. This wand worked with only a midget or even worked with a really small-sized actor like Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is slightly below the average altitude. It's neither fun nor funny for Rugger to have a baby, but John's cousin must be a complete moron to fall for her. <br /> <br /> The most prominent feature of "most of them" is a short look - one of his only looks - Madelyn Saloshin, Oliver Hardy's first wife. While Hardy's marriage problems did not reach Stan Laurel's epic proportions, the marriage was happy. <br /> <br /> Only one thing in this movie affected me. Hardy has a very short flashback sequence reminiscent of beach beauty and seamstress romance. In 1916, there is still no standard movie grammar to deliver flashbacks: Here's a graceful way and simply done. This film has no other meaning. "Many" is a very definitely a movie in Oliver Hardy's CV, and I appreciate this film at a point of 10. Laurel and Hardy are more strange than they are.
