At the beginning of the film I was very worried about the real images that I was ill in my belly and started filming. This movie can give me more than one baffle rating. I know the purpose of the film is to shock, but to show the actual appearance of a live dog (keep vomiting as I write) - Please! After the scene with the infant, I closed it. My eyes were often covered up to this point. This movie was not found at the barracks in HMV. I really want to see another movie of this Uwe person. Everyone in need of this treatment needs treatment. Period.
