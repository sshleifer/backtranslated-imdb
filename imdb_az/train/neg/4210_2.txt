Richard Tyler is a small boy who scares everything. He does not like riding a bicycle or riding a tree because he knows what an accident can be. One day, he bikes and starts to rain because he decides to wait until the rain stops. There is a whole story. He lives in all kinds of squads, and as a result he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is incredible, and good players like Macaulay Culkin can not make the story better.
