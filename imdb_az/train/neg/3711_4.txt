When I went to see the movie, I did not see the movie romance, but instead took the decisions of a friend. Now I love Chris Rock and his comedy, but this film is just flat. <br /> <br /> A few comic jokes in the film, but unfortunately, are not drunk in a movie comedy. The film wants to integrate both laughter and love, and it also fails. The story of love in the film is true (fortunately), but the movie severely and softly smashes the film. For all this, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy with the primary concern of the laughter. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is part of the film. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" Some parts would not be cut off, and if the supporting player intended to be funny, they did not do a good job, and the angels from heaven tried to joke about a couple of dry and boring jokes. The first embodiment was also elegant, and if anything, they did it right, though they seem to be funnier compared to the Rock.
