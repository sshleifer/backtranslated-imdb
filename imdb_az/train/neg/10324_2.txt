Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. There is one way they can create the easiest comedy program for the most outrageous audience for CBC's 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. All these jokes are foreseen and therefore condemned to death. Guides are very brave and moving, but I do not blame the actors because some kind of single stereotype characters are what the CBC requires and requires. The Hour, 22 minutes, sought to present the "worse" than the other dull CBC comedies like the Royal Canadian Air Farce and the Rick Mercer Report.
