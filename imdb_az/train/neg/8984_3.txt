If you want to see a movie that stands on the item, this is for you. For me, the Son de Mar is fine for SEE, but there are few valuable items, unless artistic, melodramatic, manipulative love lines turn to you. This may be the famous "Chicken Bone" that you've heard most. Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes to the sea looking for tuna, and his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and his son have to pay for themselves. Then the screen suddenly buries in Ulysses for six minutes, and Martina gets married again and her son becomes middle child. Moving at this speed is minimal and very fertile: after less than 40 minutes or less, we get into a melodrama that's totally blown, all six minutes. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises returns to find out that he is just married to "Penelope" (Watling) as a super hero who walks in Ulysses. Sierra (Eduard Fernandez) is a rich man who keeps crocodile as pets (what does he do to win all the dough?). <br /> <br /> Martina, in a big rage, asks her questions about the absence of Ulises, tells her that she will take her to Sumatra one day and understand everything. <br /> <br /> And there's one thing: DOESN Take her to Sumatra. The application dies only in one place. Why he did not see where he was and why he and his wife were five years old? He does not rebuild himself as a glorious boy and does not fill the plot holes at least half of the film we are looking at. Only director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the story lines with mystical tips (fish, reptiles, sea) presented to us through the breathtaking film and silent dialogue. This does not just work. <br /> <br /> Dear Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I am sure that we can not get the Ulis as any hero. (what should be the original Ulysses). With moist sensitivity, Virgil joins a short strip of the same strip about 2000 times, and each time Martina and the explosive orgasm admire. This man must be hired to revive the old marriage. I am sure that Virgil would be amazed. As I understand, he did not miss it often. <br /> <br /> This poetic 'device' had significant figures in the film and I had a famous siren song called Ulysses (that is, beautiful women singing a song from a distance), siren calling it a good, siren call. If Bigas Luna is so, you can see the problem - it offers symbolism, which is characterized by an attempt to grab and hold the High Art. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> ">"> even romantic depth. In my presence, it may be hated by a person who has his face (as empty) as the moss of the 1960s, which looks more like algae, and one of the bearded beards of the 21st century. (you know, four-day increase, more, less). He wanted me to be a dreamy person, but his eyes could not have been overwhelmed by an extreme scenario. <br /> <br /> However, do not despair, it's great to look at this movie. Just do not try to tie your dots to red bottles and do not worry about what you hear in dialogue. In this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) you will lose fast transmission and you will not miss most of them.
