As a film critic for a few Dutch websites, I have to see very good films. Some movies are so bad that they will not be surprised at the direct video footage. Naturally, the Imam was surprised that all videos were released. This is really a poorly written waste of bad quality poor budget. <br /> <br /> A group of young people plays taboo games. They write their most frightening desires or actions, and then they are killed by taboos. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> But it can be interesting, stupid, bad moves and no no reason why some of the previous players played in big names, so why did they register so much on earth? If you see it anywhere, try to skip it. Nobody has the logic and the quality of this movie.
