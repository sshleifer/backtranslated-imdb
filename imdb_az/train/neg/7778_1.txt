It was the most cheesiest, most stupid, and most delayed monster movie of all time. This is a complete joke, even sent to theaters. It's like watching Loch Ness monster in America. This film deserves to be taken to the toilet and is completely forgotten. John Carradine, embarrasses you. People involved in this moronic rubbish should be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them a lot of credit. I am sure that they are lobotomized before filming. How can one explain the obvious and obvious foolishness of another excuse in the boom? Do not waste your time doing this. Do not waste your time reviewing it.
