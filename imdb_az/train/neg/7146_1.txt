I just posted this comment (which reflects some of the weak ones already). The operation is worse than subpare, contradicts dispersed stereotypes, has the worst appearance of delusional women's objectivity (whole bod no brain) <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Of course, it feels bad for innocent people and the characters begin to hate themselves. Eddie Griffy's character is one of the most stereotypical black men in the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow for such characteristic searches. Want to have a movie that puts viewers away with bad guys? Oceans 11. This film hates people instead of just replacing audiences. <br /> <br /> Even the car does not give anything to this movie. Enzo, who was killed by Griffin, perfectly finished this film. It only creates.
