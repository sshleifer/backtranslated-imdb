<br /> <br /> If I did not see some ignorance, it was really a pretty decent horror / monster croak. First of all, I will give you some of the good points: - The Dragon was particularly convincing when working with tunnels looking for dinner (tip: loves people). - The action was not stopped enough and after a weak start I was very tired of the story line. - I'm sorry, I was a dragon - it was the most convincing and consistent character in the film. <br /> <br /> Now for incredible things ** some spoilers **: In 1100, we shot a dragon who was breathing a fire, and would you give it to his cave with a barrel finger under the gun? Duh. - a character of a woman with all the names of America, her hair and a Slavic accent, she tries to act like a Spanish? Huh? - Can we cut the Slavic accents with a knife and were born in Chicago, USA, who had previously been educated? - a military helicopter pilot, a self-repairing fighter, a flying boat with a large number of other crew members, and a professional soldier for a visit? OK. Uh huh <br /> <br /> It's better than some Japanese monsters, but not many since the 1960s. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, this naturally ending opportunity has opened wide. Perhaps, next time they will hire a real director. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, I gave this flick 10 to 4. If they write again, add more and Dean Cain ate at first ten minutes. <grin>
