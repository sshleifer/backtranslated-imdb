Is it wrong, or is the 2007 version part of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I've taken is one of the worst films I've ever seen ..... badly operating, bad edit, and so on. .... the only aspect of our "exploit" here is how our money is buying this piece of money. This is nothing but light porn flicker ... no real eye, no intimidation, just a piece of rubbish in a cheap way. If somebody wants to see a beautiful movie that does not have a single actor, some delicate eyes and a decent story ... Baby Blood ... is also made on a cheap budget, but it's done in a good way ... and a real event! Money is lost, but I'll just keep it for a laugh .... it's a pitiful thing! The new comment .... September 3 ..... I'm going to keep this movie forever because it's not bad at SOOOOO .... in a really bad way .... real crap-classic!
