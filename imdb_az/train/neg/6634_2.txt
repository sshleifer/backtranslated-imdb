In the picture, it looks like a good rock n roll film at first glance. But your cover does not deceive you, or it's in Alice Cooper and Blondie. The story line is simply terrible and at the same time moving. Plain and simple: BAD <br /> It's a funny movie, it's just a movie about a delicate love story. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. It's a good song, so I'll give 10 to 2. If it were not for music, it would take 10 to 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least in the 1980s) and the girl playing the band does not even look good! This movie was a great disappointment for me because it gives very good promises.
