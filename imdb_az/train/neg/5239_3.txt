<br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the basis of a very good analysis I read by others. <br /> <br /> I saw something I saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > Peace begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, goes into a madman, telling yourself: "What?", Will he do it? buy a bottle of wine. Auggie Rose, robbery and secretary of a new store, was killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John goes into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> John is completely dissatisfied with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John, <br /> Therefore, she wanted to be a victim like Auggie Rose and has a low paid job experience, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and having a possible relationship with the dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why, these smart, semi-fired films have never received scientific assessments. Of course, Goldblum is doing a good job - he always does - and his appearance improved with age - but if you had not had a big infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and had not seen any movie in it, he would not recommend it to Turkey. You will not get about two hours of your life - and I believe you will have no chance but after being grateful for two hours, we are still thankful for watching this movie <br />
