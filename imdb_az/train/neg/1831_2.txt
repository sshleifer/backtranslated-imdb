I usually love comedy movies. I really love them. But I really can not get the "envy" point. I want to say that it has a humble content / theme and it is not really funny. Despite the fact that the game is absolutely fine, it is not enough to ensure that the film is at least a bit interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talents in this film. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to rent a comedy, I suggest you do not go for it. You do not want to get bogged down, and I can see that I'm not alone because Jack Black even apologized for it (look at Trivia).
