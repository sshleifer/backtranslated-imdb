The film is basically a story of a Russian prostitute's return home to the funeral of a brother / friend. In fact, there are several other little story lines that are more interesting, but they are not completely explored. The main purpose of the film is discussion about the future of a community with funeral, waking, and subsequent puppets, and selling lines for vodka, but lacking the artists sold their babies. As you can see, the movie is not filmed. The harassing of a whore from the city to the city is an endless journey journey and clay. Perhaps we should be surprised by the size of the Russian landscape. Like a village, a widow and a legion of a deceased girl lives. Puppet is problematic for everyone who continues their work, and as a result it seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that can cause heart attacks. Another problem for the audience of the West is that it does not cover the songs and lyrics of the crones in subtitles. Do not go to this movie without a good talk in Russian.
