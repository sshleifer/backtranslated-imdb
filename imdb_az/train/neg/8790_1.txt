I recently saw cables and I'm so glad. I read the comments here and it seems that everybody loves the second half more than the first half. Personally I liked the first story (badly bad). I thought the second story was written. And if I heard "California Dreaming" once more ... Chungking Express is good, but it's not something that looks like the main watcher's "Cigli Tiger".
