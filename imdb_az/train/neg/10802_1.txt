Allow the movie to be broadcast quickly: an ugly, outrageous boy named Max is poured on a radio with Kazaami: a seductive jen. Like all the jinn, he gives three wishes, but he helps with Max's personal life, being well-behaved, because he should deal with violence and an organized crime. All this during the time of the Kazaim repps (also demonstrated Shaq's horrible rap skills). <br /> <br /> This film proves what you all know: athletes need to stay in the sport. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy film, but everything about this film's hardness was terrible. These characters are either tricky or stupid, even if their wife does not remember, the dialogue is a joke, and Shag is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, Denzel's Washington movie, this movie will still be a joke. I know that the film was only Ankabali because Shak was too big at that time. Honestly, I can not say a single thing about spending this time. Shag should take the time to use this movie to deal with free shots.
