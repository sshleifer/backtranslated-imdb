Sheesh! What a horrible movie. Dodgy camera work, a more complex script from Kellogg, and a pig farm that can act like this. <br /> <br /> Does not know what viewers are targeted to cover all of these - do we have Cornel Wilde or Corny Wilde? - In the soap box there is always a smoking cigarette, dear dear, dear, and in a mistakenly staged stage, we are baddie, Lobo, self-compelling, ahem, striptease decorated with 'male friend' bikini. Try to tell one of the children ... <br /> <br /> Throw a horse with a treasure-hunted Treasure Island-cum-Jaws-type story and ultimately an unusual funny movie in such an unpleasant way - I would not expect a Special If the version DVD is coming soon.
