Blood Legacy begins with the arrival of Dean's property attorney, Tom Drake (Norman Bartold), formerly deceased by Christopher Dean (John Carradine), after Mr Four's four children, Gregory (Jeff Morrow), his wife Laura (Merry Anders) Victoria (Faith Domergue), Johnny (Richard Davalos) and Leslie (Brooke Mills) and her son Carl Isenberg (John Smith). Drake is recording a tape record of his father's desires after his death, and the $ 136 million property will be evenly divided between four children, and if it dies, the money will be equal to the rest Elven (Ivy Bethune), Igor (Buck Kartalian) and more Frank (John Russell ) will die of freaky servants who bear the name. Yes, someone who did not provide a quarterly share of $ 136 million (still worth not less than $ 35 million in 1971) can decide for themselves what they want for themselves, and this is just a cooler than the start of the presidents ... <br / Roy Monson betrayed me with two accounts written, produced and managed jointly by the Legion of the Law. For beginners, this film is an Alternative and More Popular Title, as well as the Blood Law, which is the name of a dark fear movie, directed by Andy Milliagn in 78 ', which I always wanted to see, both films are also regular, mixed stories and I When I returned to the cable TV guide for my legacy, it was said that it was a Milligan movie and I was so excited that you listed it as a director, I sat really to watch, and when I heard John Carradine sounded I noticed that it was not the Milligan movie, but my heart. Then, of course, the Blood Leg is a violet violet purple to watch a few times. The script developed by Monson & Eric Norden is slow, boring and highly predictable. This character is strangely strange, a slave who wants to connect with her sister (?) Is strange, just a terrible look, and a strange set of Brother & Sisters, a reality that has so far gone out of reality, is a simple wisdom story that can get any tension or mystery and then there is a terrible twist that you can guess in the first 10 minutes. It's boring to watch, it's a bad paced, and it's just a matter of thinking about it. Please, somebody saves me because it's really bad. <br /> <br /> Director Monson was either not in the budget or in spite of the fact that he had not even been trained to traffic. The whole movie looks ugly, it is shot poorly, and there is no atmosphere or fear. There is a scene in which blood and body are incontrovertible, the head on the head, the head cut, the one killed by the piranha and killing one's best murder. But there are question marks on this stage, so there is a sacrifice, right. There's a piranha tank, right. The victims were placed in a piranha tank. Eat the face of Pirahna's victims right away. <br /> <br /> Ancient explorer, <strong> Ancient sayings> terrible dialogue maybe good for mascara can give. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> </ STRONG> </ I do not think there is. Give yourself a blessing and do not worry about it, there are better movies there.
