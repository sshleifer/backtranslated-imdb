I've seen the film many years ago and I was surprised to see that there was no indefatigable morality in cinema: Dennis Quaid is a two-pointed trademark that never smiles or does not smile. Danny Glover sounded like a bad man, but still most of the audience's dreams could not go enough to believe in this role. In addition, Jared Leto was incredible as a former medical student. The tension was not there, because the killer was soon recognized. The prize was neither dramatic nor tense - nobody around me knew what to do next. It was the end of all the film we were expecting. All this spent an unpleasant evening in cinema.
