I thought that the movie is another way to pay attention to everything that's needed in the scheme or story line or something that's happening. <br /> <br /> This film showed me that it really should not be such a thing. <br /> <br /> I just can understand that. But IMDb wants to give me more lines. That was beautiful. Not the smallest thing. The heroes of the film think that you are causing a few days, but it will not take time and I'm sure it will take about an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to entertain yourself, you can drink a liter of milk and drink how fast you are before you throw. Better use of your time. No time to get back. Jurassic Park 3 is better than this movie.
