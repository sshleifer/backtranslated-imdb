Over time, the "writer" is one of the Lone Ulders, for the character development and interaction, dialogue and actor activity. In the opening scene for the gambler's personalities, Kansas Charli (Eddy Chandler) and his friend John Scott (John Wayne) are rodeo (Roh-Day-oh), both randy. The film follows the adventures that Mexico pursues after Juanita, and then follows an inevitable brother Maryam Cornman (even though she has been set out from her original ancestor and wants to repent). And, of course, they are mistakenly charged with two crimes, and they must escape and finally serve in jail before being denied. <br /> <br /> The high point is not Scott, but constantly and deliberately push Mary's cover. he can grab his grocery store and grab it up and grab it. All of this seems a little modern in the west of the 30s, but in fact it is better. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, here are some of the other interesting elements we have seen in Lone Stars. Yakima does not have Canutt. Horses use the cheap and bad photographs of horsemen falling. No, George Hayes. Bi-play, like Charlie Scott, dropped out like Charlie Scott, and Scott leaps to his feet and then shoots him (repeat twice!). An experienced Paul Fix is ​​not corrected. Eddy Chandler himself, the big star here, is really unbelievable as a randy side hit. This villain looks too old and greasy. Later Chandler, who has been an unforgettable filmmaker in more than 300 films, is this. Mary Kornman is cute in the scenes of Twentyies "Our Gang" (see 'Mary, King of Tots' 1925), but it's about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. The well-visible ultra-short color version moves so fast that it's over when you burn more than once. Fortunately, embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler were cut off.
