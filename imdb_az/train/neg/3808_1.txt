WARNING! This review shows that the movie is over, "Scoop." <br /> <br /> <strong> Annie Hall </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> to see Hugh Jackman's bare chest <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> ALL WITNESSES ALL THE KIND OF EARLY, and therefore, the film that he has just identified young women to be a grandson has broken any ability to shoot. <br /> <br /> A living partner <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ span> </ span> <br /> <br /> < Allen helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film is a complete disappointment, or humor, or even an atmosphere of an unbelievably sturdy, amateur effort, <br /> <br /> Unlike previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, eventually led to a younger man <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yoxansson has an early scene, "Seduced" is an euphemism what happens. This is the moment "slam, bam, I should go". It does not have anything to do with this area and Johansson is cheaper in the eyes of the viewer. Why Allen added the unnecessary scene to the movie? Because, like Allen, a strong filmmaker - a female partner. <br /> <br /> Yoxansson is not yet an actress. It does not rule out the screen order, except for the dense, cut-down top. <br /> <br /> She looks like Allen on several occasions and looks just strange and sad. <br /> <br /> Does not help her character to be written as a puppet that can not function without a ghost or an old man. <br /> <br /> He is about half of Jackman's age and is experiencing a vapid screen presence on his own scene. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" Hugh Jackman has been deceived by the script in the same way, and Allen does not stop Jackman so much as to appear and look younger, and does not give Jackman anything to tell or give. <br /> <br /> This is a shame, as demonstrated by any production from the United States to Oklahoma, to X Men. <br /> <br /> Here's a large circle twist - Jackman, a suave, a charming Englishman, is really a murderer, so the film says that besides Allen, he can not afford to take another girl, get her, Jackman is a man who loves a prostitute. Beautiful, Woody. <br /> <br /> In a positively aggressive touch, Allen killed his hero, his symbol, his magic Scarlett abandons Johansson and is deprived of his or her own will at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> One last note: when I was watching, no audience member laughed. The film is always a bad sign when it is advertised as a comedy.
