It is a typical budget of the 1970s. There must be a docudrama about the crew hunting Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype from native America to a cowboy. The player and story is a complete joke. If you hope to shoot a lot of movies - you are hopeful. Will not be too much and what you can do with your cheap suit and camera on your wife; it would be better than this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like the low cost of the 1970s; I am. This is a great deal of bad behavior, bad characters, a bad story, and an exciting thing you can only enjoy. You can get a smile on how bad it is, without the help of the "good" category, nor with the help of illegal content. It is basically a lot of boring images of people camping, hiking, hiking, and watching wildlife. There is a huge attack, which is totally stupid; as our fellow Sasquatch throws the stones they put on the camps and threw off their rifles. At this point, some cliffs fall on the film's hammer, and you're heavier than a large budget to stop everything.
