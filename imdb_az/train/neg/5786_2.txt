Now when you look at the entire language you are looking at, it has received the name "PG", but it's a rating system for the 1970s. Peter Falk opens the name of the Lord six times in the first ten minutes of this film! <br /> <br /> People who are filming, filming, and even criticizing the film are also saying. <br /> <br /> This film is an idea to show how bad this film is: Falk, Peter Boyle Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly players who can not find exactly in the Music Sound. <br /> <br /> I love the heist films in the film, William Friedkin, but this does not convey the script, and I feel more than 70 "Sleazy" sounds and sound, as for Falk's TV's "Columbo" It is a shock to hear that it uses too much blasphemy.
