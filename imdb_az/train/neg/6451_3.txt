"Steve" (Chris Hoffman), a twin brother Wes, collects a group of secondary schoolmates to unite in the missing cabin. Even though they were there, a creature that creeps in the form of a human being (waiting for Gillman to remind me of the Black Sea from YARATUF) waits for the right time to separate each other in the wilderness. A biker, Ellen Ripley-type female bad ass, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military hegemony, and serves as a safe place from the bloody ramp. She knows more than she knows (she was also exposed to a child's loss), but most of the group has another innovation twist. This creature can have more people than they realize ... and the previous personality can light a deception that only one person has hidden from Wes's death. The floor occupies many secrets that are locked, as is the case with the group's cabin. <br /> <br /> Thank God that most of the film is moving away from the splashed creature in the air, a flawless display when we look in the eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek type melodramas and often hinders any real tension needed to build a monster movie. This direction is not very intimidating, leading to a relatively refined experience instead of scare. The cast is more life-less and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) can be the only weapon in this film.
