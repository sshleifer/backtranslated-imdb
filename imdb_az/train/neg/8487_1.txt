Twenty years ago, I did not see anything bad from the James Bond movie "Moonraker". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The heroes were cardboard and could not show any kind of sympathy. The area was completely unbelievable. The player was amateur, except for Swinton. Computer graphics were worse than "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely bored. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie was in Tilda Swinton. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this stinker. There is nothing worth seeing here.
