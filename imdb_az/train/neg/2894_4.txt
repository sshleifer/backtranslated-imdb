With the many Ealing films I have ever seen, I acknowledged that this could have been so far. To my liking, they are bright and ludicrous, or illuminated to be dissatisfied with comedy or stories. <br /> <br /> Akin Guinness, Aunt Guinness, is a non-respectable but progressive attempts to invent a piece of tissue that is not fragmented or contaminated. Using a factory lab for his latest experience, he works against material and human constraints - secondly, cowboy mills who do not understand what he is, then understand and stick to stop him. <br /> <br /> <strong> Man in the White Suit "Sydney's vision of progress but also a little bit more mindset than the bosses or employees who are surprised by their work. "My problem is more elemental: The comedy is not comic." <br /> <br /> The best joke machine sound: <br /> < <br /> <br /> The best joke - Sydney, goes to Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop, Sydney also makes a miracle or breaks it and looks strange to every guest. <br /> <br /> Everyone who works decently in this film is just as laughing as it is for a long time. <br /> <br /> Guinness has less influence on the film, at least young and courageous (although in fact, in the mid-30s.) He is no more than a waxed general at the Doctor Zhivago The bull was the same cold fish, despite the sad love of the mill girl who offered her the life saving while losing the same job. (as he is Bertha face-to-face Vida Hope), or as he put it, he could only be Greenwood, the only singer Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood) who sings like these incredibly sexy with these more charming charm in the fight against "festivity and leakage." <br /> <br /> The White Suit, which supports gamers, does so. Ernest Thesinger, the "Frankenstein Bride" fame, looks like the Nosferatu and plays the only bad captain of a laughing industry, just like a death strike. Howard Marion-Crawford is here as memorable as another factory leader who plays as a medical practitioner in Lawrence Of Arabia. <br /> <br /> That's why Mandy Miller's charm. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes, director Alexander, will not think. Mackendrick had previously worked on a comedy (the previous Ealing comedy "Whisky Galore" is not surprising, regrettable). Roger MacDougall's game presents the concept of scientific progress as a potential catastrophe, but the tiresome Sydney will not offer the lights in the most advantageous, unpleasant thing. <br /> <br /> Ealing comedies are remembered to capture the human side of the comedy. But I've seen that I have not seen anything, but only when we play aggressors against our own attitudes. "Sincere hearts and coronals" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick re-go figure) are classics in this way. On the other hand, "White Suit", as it is an unpleasant costume, is a distinctive point when it needs to be aligned.
