Woody Allen made some of the biggest comedies and I was serious about saying that Annie Hall is the biggest film, but I really think about it, but I would probably think it would be a good one or two. Of course, Manhattan was not as good as Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but there were some films that were not that bad, but had never had a bad movie like Melinda and Melinda. Not too tired and very unfinny, his films are usually witty and cheerful, but how did this happen, still our good old Woody? The area works around four friends who eat together. Two players are writers, and one is reminiscent of a funny story with a friend of his. This is a young woman who exploded in an unexpected evening meal. The two games begin to argue for a better comedy or tragedy, because we do not hear the rest. We will begin to look at two points. This woman is also called Melinda, who is concerned with drugs and her old husband. She is an old friend of the family because she has suicidal attempts, since her old friend is no good reason for the front door. The comedy is about Melida, who stumbles on the dining poem after creating 28 bed pills. Both are actually going to a wild wind wind of events that do not really have any sense or are incompatible or that can not smile more than once. There are some nice speeches by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not fit in there. They do not stop dropping this year more than most other films.
