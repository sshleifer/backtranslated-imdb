It is difficult for me to say because I like "Targets" and "Paper Bear", but "The Last Picture Show" was a bit of a fascinating but very self-styled movie. His main positive is so stunning photography that I am interested in. But for me, there was nothing in the world to offer the beauty of the movie (and some kind of hidden beauty). It was very difficult to deal with heroes or to care for them. In fact, this was a very slow pace and this was a way of nature, but there were many formulaists and predictable stories that were completed with all the jewelery from any small city melodrama - the teacher's wife spoke to disabled people who voted for everyone. <br /> <br /> Some people can say that this movie is more realistic. However, many people think that realism is the only virtue of the film. But for me, the movie was just a bit of a pressure, and I would like to see it again, just as I want to spend a few hours in this depraved city where characters live. <br /> <br /> Maybe this film is really just about the time - maybe if I had seen it in 1971, I would be affected by the innovation, and I just saw something different on the screen. But I have never seen anything like God's "Breathless". Perhaps, open references to classic films would invite me to a movie that was inside me and help me lose some of the film's weaknesses. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < strong> As I mentioned in the photo show, we see three films. First of all, we can see Vincente Minnelli's "Father of the Bride" - Liz Taylor's delicate images provide a contradiction with Sonny's girlfriend, and the upper-middle class environment Minnelli reads in a contrast to the "real life" of the symbol. Later, Howard Hawks's "Red River" clips highlight a distorted friendship issue between mentor and protégé. It really reminds me that Bogdanovich kisses his mentor himself as he correctly chooses the Hawks movie as a counter-intelligence piece on the screen with Boris Karloff. In 1971, something like this was new, but looking at it, I feel attractive as the rest of this movie. <br /> Finally, I would like to see more of a movie, reminded me of how careful it is to do more delicately than the film of Hawkins, Ford or Minnelli Bogdanovich. Perhaps he intends to remind us of the passing giants - he remembers how small he and most of his contemporaries are.
