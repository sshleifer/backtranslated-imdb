Bo, a long-time anthropologist, Jane Parker (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very incompatible career) studies in Africa. He is watching (how?) And explains the local stories of a giant monster that his nightly whistles can be heard from the mosquito. Ape Man looks at horny monkey looking fresh and fresh, leaving himself alone for two hours after this difficult two hours, who saved him from the evil guys (Miles O'Keeffe, the best dialogue of the film). Normally, I have to give a look at different ideas about any movie, but this is the exception. This is the worst movie ever. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: I can say the best news story on the day of the news is "Movie movie" should have a lower rating than BOMB.)
