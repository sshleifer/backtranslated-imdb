I also saw Montreal Festival Festival du Monde Midnight Slam last night. What a disappointment. This film is clearly appreciated by IMDb supporters. Acting was only regular. The director did not bring anything new and interesting. Extremely unsatisfactory field: film, college graduates and game play (level 7). Moreover, you can guess the end of the movie in the first 5 minutes. You can love it if you want a small blow and blow by jumping only once or twice in the entire movie. If you do not, it's not worth the movie.
