With some fun, I realized that last year, Detroit PD would like to thank for their participation. The Chief of Police has even a self-guided speech line (and the guy can say that he can not move). The reason for this fun is to shoot the police first and then ask questions. Not the PR type, I would think of a police force. In addition, this standard police and bandit film has been designed with a race angle for the 70s. Alex Rocco is given a stubborn role of a pseudo-police who can not be taken from the front and swinging with a mentally ill woman. It creates a cunning place by hanging it. Hari Rhodes likes to have a naked wardrobe and chase him with suspects after him. The movie is moving from the point of view of the fact that the film does not give any meaning (why not only the guilty people in robbery, the whole police force?). Even though we have only one shot, we begin to see four, since there are four bad guys. Then there is a twist, but I'm thinking how stupid it is to think of leaving a hypothesis that guessed what would happen. When I saw that Arthur Marks was behind Brainead's "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown," I was not worried.
