I was shocked that there were people who loved this movie ... I saw Tribeca and laughed at the scenes where most viewers were not comical. Because the main actress was in the audience, but frankly, the main idea of ​​this film was that MAXOR needed revision ... even though it was not logical, in a second they asked for the characters to be fully optimistic ... on the scene they were hopelessly addicted and how to understand it? Also, the latter only took a cake ... I am not spoiled for a spectacular result ... but very mixed with very terrific plot / script ... if you need this movie look for comedy.
