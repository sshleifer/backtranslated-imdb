Several critics have provided this film with positive comments. In their opinion, I do not want to argue, but I do not agree. When I first watched this movie I was just as surprised. But after comparing with other films, especially the late master, Bruce Lee quickly changed me. If it were not for the movie, I would never buy it. Death 2's game does not belong to the original game of Death (Billy Lo, except one character). <br /> <br /> Dragon, compared to the Death 2 game. The landscape has a striking resemblance: Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are a mission to take revenge on a relative. The two places are similar, both of them are very isolated and are covered by thousands of Blackbelts. Both films have prostitution elements (women are sent to two guest rooms in both films). Both Han (enter Dragon) and Lewis' sister have lost their hands. They are an underground narcotics involved in the Dragon, there is one in Death Game, whether we believe or not. 2. There is a cat in the Dragon Dragon, the director used his imagination and rewarded Lewis with a monkey fruit! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of the film, such as scripts and actors, I felt very bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists in the directorship and prayed that they could move. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that positively choreography is effective. In the sequence of war, they have strong elements of acrobatics, although no one has been able to do less. But if the plot was insufficient, I could not get in touch with the characters, so the battle sequences were more than just giving a movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I say that this movie should be recommended to fans of any martial art, but I do not recommend this film seriously for those who are in a good story and a strong movie with strong characters. My views on this film may seem biased and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee puts a new standard in the art of martial arts, especially after his fame: Enter Dragon, this movie has not been upgraded to these standards. If anything, they have imitated the truly brilliant martial arts movie, with the same hope of gaining the same fame. <br /> <br /> According to my assessment, filming more than 10 tough 1 of this film can be seen in barley and should be grateful for the consistency of this fight.
