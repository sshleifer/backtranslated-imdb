What did he think? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop that combines a dinosaur (!) for a criminal case related to a madrasa who wants to start another ice age in the future. Straight-to-tape oddity is a shocking and ridiculously high concept of hacking itself. It seems that writer-director Jonathan Betuel (one of the producers) was in love; Unfortunately, the results are kind and charitable. The presence of just Goldberg's on screen can often result in good will and laughter, but here it is drowning and you can see unusual results. NO STARS from ****
