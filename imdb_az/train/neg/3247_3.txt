I looked at this film with great courage, for it seemed to me that it was truly hopeful: Jim Carrey, with the power of God, was the most working idea for me. As a magnificent fan, I was convinced that such an element would be superior to such a promising organization, and what could be worse? Yesterday, I saw the movie because my balloon exploded great-time boys and girls. <br /> <br /> The first action (when he hates his life, he is a surprising worker and a great caregiver who is unhappy with God's shackles), the second act (He accepts God through the phone and accepts the Power of Prophets) BIG - enjoying "toys" and really enjoying being funny. But the third is unhappy because he believes. <br /> <br /> Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who is good at taking part in this movie when she goes out) (even her name is wrong) thinks she will answer "the question", but instead, Finally, the news says that he got anchor work and is still not so excited. <br /> <br /> He does not think so. She wants her to marry her, so she leaves her, looks, though she still loves her, and the rest of the film has made us sad, and since then she has presented me a morally appealing clich√©. . It's about to end. <br /> <br /> I do not suffer from the first two moves (one example is that, after receiving his powers, in the second movement, Bruce Curse reads "us as a wand just like one", blah blah blah) From the miraculous contradictions (for openers, Morgan Freeman says God - Bruce breaks the will of anyone, but this is a great deal). These choices were guilty - this is Jim Carrey's comedy directed by Tom Shadyac - Remains of the Day. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Scenario writers (in this terrible action 3) lose their trail and try to turn trials into direct messages, instead of hell on earth. Bruce understands the mistakes of his selfish ways, he understands that GRACE is its savings - it must be said - grace and his priorities in life are seriously misinterpreted. But all of them could have been delivered more seriously. The film did not go to the drop to make these points. Unfortunately, writers and Shadyac had no idea how to solve the story in any intelligent way, so they went along with the hopes of bang-over-the-heads. They even hope that some of them will perform in a surprisingly unforgettable way, ultimately reducing their bad taste. He did not work for me.
