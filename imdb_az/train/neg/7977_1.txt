Well, Montreal Jesus is basically a clever movie. Actors are really good and the technical side of the film is complete. However, although I am very interested in the subject, I do not want to think and discuss religion (I am an atheist), I have made the film painful and in my opinion a ghostly end to a funny end. Why is this movie incredibly boring? I dont know. This is just and it is not recommended.
