This is an interesting thing about youth that you can easily be deceived by advertising. At first, I talked about another movie, for which the commercial movie (comedy) is more strange than this one. That's why I thought advertising in 1981 would make me an ignorant comic movie. My brother and I saw with me, the scene used in television commercial was the latest scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the result of everything that comes before the movie, I can guess that there is nothing else I can use! Last scene, thanks to a youth potion, Dr. Fu Manchy turns into a bright young Asian / Elvis, a long bearded old man, a rock star! <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Peter Sellers did his best in hand, but his comedian understands. The rest of the actors were just boring, and my brother and I were laughing at something so tough. We were waiting for the comedy "Pink Panther", of course, Peter Sellers was so great. <br /> <br /> He was his last movie before his death. Muppet's show appearance was more fun than this bad tricks. Still, I do not blame him. I'm sorry for everyone trying to make a better movie. 2 stars are generous!
