Every time a movie comes often, it hits me, and my taste in films that I want to watch is always immaculate. I usually stay away from things like this, but I was duped by some brilliant reviews and Rohmer coolers. <br /> <br /> Rohmer is actually the actor's reversal of the Revolutionary period (digital). This speeds are considerably reduced and it is interesting to look at the figures on a painting for the scene. We're here a dull and exciting movie about French aristocrats in the 18th century. None of the heroes are attractive or sympathetic. The speed is so intolerable that dialogue is such a difficult and negative thing for Rohmer, I did not think I was rolling his head, or what the revolution was. The film would have benefited from some images of the romantic mix and music honey (there are some nice classic music used very well). Despite being so "talking", the film is a boring and uninteresting movie about infinite topics, like a silent movie and the worst movie in the film. Only the most brutal French historians will find something to get from this movie. Because the dose seems to have been painted in a good way (Lady English and royalist) in a good way. Otherwise, avoid any distance from this yawner until I suffer from insomnia.
