Have you heard a Taiwan horror movie? Or any Taiwanese movie? For one reason, in advance. <br /> <br /> While reading other people's thoughts, I was waiting for some violence. and it resembles it, but there is not much. You'll be disappointed if you're awaiting some blood sparks and other naked things, graphics, or any awesome effects. <br /> <br /> There's nothing very good about this movie; Just like a single character and a few arrows, black magic wizards, which are not completely soft. The area was mixed and boring. The characters were subtle and boring, including the main character. The worst thing was the Albino girl (not really scary), since the sign of horror never worked. This is the worst Asian movie I've ever seen.
