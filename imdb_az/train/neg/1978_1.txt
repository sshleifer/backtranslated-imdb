It's a pitiful word. Bad fun, miserable scripts, cheezy dialogue and hip-hop music and fashion ... what was this hell? The director of this movie is as bad as his film. It would be a chance for everyone to take some time and effort to re-run everything. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was Stacey Stone ... The worst was the Asian chick. It carried all the gals of the film. <br /> <br /> I would destroy the copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste any of those who have not seen it and have the same idea ... then you will only regret it.
