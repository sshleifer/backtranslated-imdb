Well, maybe, recently, I've started a bad job with Hindi movies. I asked Apharan (Prakash Jha) for a video store boy, but it's still not possible to be a new release. So I have to solve this problem. It turned out to be the most stupid Indian movie I've ever seen (and I've seen most of them). BULLUDUD is the laughing part of the whole world! If IMDb had a negative rating, I had given Karam Masala one. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing a television show on jazz premiere released in Mumbai. All the usual celebs and their sideys showed. For some strange reasons, people are expecting good things from the Pyramid. I did not like Hulchul, Hungama or other films. Hulchul probably had a loud voice, which was dubbed Tamil or the Woland, with no other meaning outside the Bollywood lance. This last piece of CXXP shows that this man is EARLY. Who directed him, even Bollywood director? <br /> <br /> In any case, he's in the movie. As a romantic escapade, a non-sensual woman turns into a hunt. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (2 dudes work for gossip magazine and do not look like any entries they share their office, Jezuz Christ now copies their stories!) In any case, in search of multi-tasking + multi-timing some cook or chef trying to help one of the dodos. As a result, I had no idea what happened. I'm out of the middle road. What a ridiculous loss. I do not even believe they have released it. And sadistic how to tear with your own impurities! What kind of audience did they make for them - poorly-harsh Indian masses (up to 700 Miles), or the best of the best in Phoenix NRI Desis? Both ways are not important. <br /> <br /> Both groups have a good film, and there is probably no clue that is worthy of such horrible things. <br /> <br /> It is a shortcut because there is nothing to write, but the F-class trash can. The Bollywood name must be changed to Follica. Yes, this view is better than the movie itself.
