Finally, after a long wait I looked at this experienced Lynch ... and, unfortunately, it was not worth it! If there is nothing, there will be nothing, nothing long, long, long painful postures, nothing long, nothing monotonous exits. and all the things that happened to him, whether he was watching or taking care of him, were completely overwhelming, and those who had been thereafter boldly ended. <br /> <br /> There was a Mulholland Drive sliding - the blonde girl and the terrible girl was Diane and Rita-sque, and it was an instant moment at Lost Highway with alusions for a significant event, but it is impossible to speak clearly. Unfortunately, everything is very unkind and very boring, nothing happens, it's very unforgettable, and I think I'll remove it from my computer and never watch it. Sorry!
