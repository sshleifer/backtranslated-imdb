I do not know the writer or the director's previous job, so I did not give any pretension to the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be interesting, according to a short description of the TV-led organization. <br /> <br /> But the expediency is full of disadvantages. It seemed like an excuse to drag bloody, terrible makeup or special effects in every turn of the site. <br /> <br /> The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer seemed to be a worthy actress, and the rest was more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna is an isolated home and the previous victim (Wendt) removes the frozen body from deep freezing. McKenna killed Wendt by collecting a piece of her neck. Now he thinks he must prove his involvement in Wendt's death. McKenna opens Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag, gets her ax, and begins to break off Wendt's head. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. The bit of the ax flies on Wendtin's neck. The weather is full of frozen nuggets of frozen meat, one falls at McKenna's head. McKenna takes a small fire that he has built outside his frozen head. She sat down, slipped down, photographed a woman she killed, and showed them with Wendtin's head. "Remember him, if he had not been for you, we would have really done that," she says. "Duke, do you always like swallows or not?" he asks. Then he put his head in the wood. <br /> <br /> We do not want such cadavers to be censored. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the film. Yes, I'm going to point out an "immeasurable" example of what we're thinking. McKenna was kidnapped and a dark bare sack was locked. In the following days, he knows that half of it will lead to his death. (He invites you to do this). What do you do in this case like Poe? Here is what McKenna can do with what may be the last night of her life. She finds a calendar thrown by a pin-up girl and masturbates (a success). Give this man a Medal of Honor! <br /> <br /> A pawn looks like a cat is thrown out of some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera often caught and shaken. There is such a line in the dialogue: "Life is a thing *** or the best of all possible worlds, it depends on your opinion." The use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. <br /> <br /> Hero McKenna went to the next place. <br /> <br /> It's also a hero. First, a man with a heavy statue on his head several times, and then with a dried plant, kills a man at $ 13,000 to throw the refrigerator over the body. (This is a bit pity for her, but it's not enough to blame her for paying it). Then I hope they straighten, cut the neck and kill Wendt. Then, the first victim's wife kills her in an accident and blames her weight even though she has nothing to do with any morale. Then it burns odor (Baldwin) alive. Later on, with less than two weight restrictions, it deliberately damages them, although one of them is not entirely indifferent. <br /> <br /> This is a must-have for McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not the animated deaths like those in Dirty Harry films - bang bang and you are dead. They are slow and painful. The first one is a crime of $ 13,000 - something that can happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another person as Hitchcock shows on the Torn Curtain. But this scene does not lead to anywhere. <br /> <br /> Some people can use enough young people to think that pain and death are some of the things that happen in the movies. Some of the meretricious things here.
