<br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore fan, but I like this movie as well. Live Bread, ALL LONG TIME! I have never seen a great toy, but hey, who was surprised? Well-run, good food! I've seen some comments as to whether it should be a school project or something. Okey is not a student at a media or actor school. It was no class! And what is the story? Really saddened at the hostel. What is it? What do you say about psychopathic torture scenes designed to bend your bodies and to sweat? It was the most disappointing thing about the hole movie! Short, fast, and NO offside. Torture, not as an execution. Okay did not even seem to be in the bloodstream. Massacre and violence Braindead remembered more than Hostel or Saw-movies. Braindead has fun! Okay, I laughed a few times at a live dinner, but it was more disappointing than fun! <br /> <br /> So, look at something else instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed!
