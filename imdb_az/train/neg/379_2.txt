Television leadership calls this movie a mystery. What is secret is that a culture that can create such sophisticated and sophisticated classical music and brilliant mathematicians can not produce a movie that is beyond the garbage level that perfectly represents this movie. This is the best in Bollywood, and I can not say honestly. Everything is sweet, kitschy stereotypes in storylines, situations, dialogues, music and choreography at every level. To make it clear, you need to be late to enjoy it. I looked to protect my cultural interests, but when I had to move away from it, I could not get more. The only quality of the film is the subtle beauty of leading actresses. <br /> <br />
