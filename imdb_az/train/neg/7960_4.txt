In the second part, I was hired because of trauma as a small child. One morning I was really down, watching HBO, Raft (Section 2) did me good. Though I was unable to explain why the nostalgia was a cause or a really good short, this time around, I still enjoyed the Raft. The other two segments were completely trash. I do not believe paying for a single producer to collect money. What I was able to do was to destroy the childhood memory once again. Creepshow 2 is on the list of my sad kids listening classics. 4/10
