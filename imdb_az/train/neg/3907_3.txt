I'm glad to rent this movie for some reason: its lack of me wanted to read the Allende book and read the full story. <br /> <br /> Now, the film is beautiful, the best of the times is described in the best (the best I know), and Meryl and Glenn do well. <br /> <br /> The worst case I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I was interested in something wrong with her mouth. (And I say "Transito" that I hate English) Winona Ryder is nothing but convincing than the young and idealistic images. Most other speeches are OK, but very few have frustrated and frustrated before the outcome of the character and the relationships that are closely linked to each other. <br /> <br /> This film is something characteristic of Bille August. Smilla's Snowy Landscape may cost a few more dollars to rent.
