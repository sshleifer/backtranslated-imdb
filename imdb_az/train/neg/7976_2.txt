You have believed in God or you do not. You do not believe in Jesus or not. You believe he is the Son of God or you do not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Denys Arcand, Director, has done everything in his power to fulfill Jesus' historical personality, public servant, son of two men, the Son of Holy God. The Spirit and Mary opened our paradise for us again. A world that promotes Big Bang comes from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <<<Instead of having sex with a female footballer in the Love Game he played in Montreal, he showed his love for God. The author does not appear more often than the church's hatred. <br /> <br /> The director tried to parallel the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion Play actor. <br /> <br /> My idea is not important, but God's thoughts, but I am God's, but I am God's. Jesus did not want to stand in the shoes of the director and gamblers when standing in front of his throne.
