Living Dead is a young scientist named Rick, who lives with her brother in Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill streets. One night, Rick's brother was shot by a bunch of slippers on the street that fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls on his academician to bring the last formula that works on bringing sick blood cells to health. Formula is not a human being, even a dead body, but Rick is committed to bringing his brother back to life. The body is given a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is exclusively for human life to come to life and celebration. Now Rick needs to find his zombie brother before the whole head turned into a dead neighborhood. The head of the deceased is a piece of garbage. Field Resident Evil's direct disassembly, the player, especially for Rick's brother, is just terrible, the guns are very fake because the weapon always sends sparks when it is put and the make-up is just bare. It's just a fake actor in front of you. The zombie also changes. They run away, grow up, and be slaughtered to die! Zombies must be brainwashed just to confuse, moan, and die! This film is very scary, it's the only real moment of the movie. Living in the Hood, 3 out of 10, is a little fun and here, but only one budget is a small cinge fest.
