<br /> <br /> I love movies with Brian O'Halloran, they're funny and happy. When I saw this name and genre, I thought well, it would be really good ... a parody for scary or other movies ... but .. then I read it in the foreground and thought it would be good at all <br /> <br /> In my opinion: If movies seem like a little documentary, try some Moore movies or Alien autopsies with a little comedy, they're really about something. it was empty. <br /> <br /> Putting a comedy into a title ... no comment ... really a bad joke
