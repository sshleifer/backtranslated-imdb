When you hear these three words ... "Joe Don Baker", I'm scared ... <br /> <br /> The last justice is a sheriff-based low-budget action movie called Heronimo in a Texas city called Geronimo. He is an ugly, bony, rude person in the hunt for a criminal in Malta, who killed his Texas counterpart. His partner dropped twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in prison as it's 4 or 5 times in the film. Additionally, he is hitting everyone, as is the case with the West. I was reminded that it was the 20th century. A female police officer was assigned to show him around Malta (visible from Seinfeld to Elaine), and he is the only one who can agree with the redneck. He must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The bartenders in the bar are the most entertaining characters of this movie. The dance is shown throughout the film and I get in touch with dark women. Yes, at least Geronimo was better than trying to put things right. The latter is flawed and somewhat predictable and finally over. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine how the Three Bond movie is ... very strange! Anyway, if you are going to a laugh, look at this time at MST3K. Also, I heard his other bad movie (amongst others), Mitchell's MST3K version was released on DVD by Rhino. I will not wait to see this!
