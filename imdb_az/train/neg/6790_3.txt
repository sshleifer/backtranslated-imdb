Ohhh cruelty, ohhhhh sex of death, ohhhh loss, ohhhh bias! Jeez, when does the Revisionists stop analyzing the West to cry out loud? S ** t. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attractive, exhausting, with the participation of Kelbajar and Hekman / Bergen <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and very attractive celluloid wastage. There is nothing interesting or interesting here in the 19th century when it is not cautious with the desert dentist. Very bad teeth and a Mexican boy on the ground can be a little better without a steady move. A monument to sensitive ultra-left sliding sensitivity of 60 / 70s. It is not possible to sit in the whole movie. I would like to have my eyes open for all Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10 - all deader'n hell.
