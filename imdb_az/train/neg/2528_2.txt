Van is an inseparable movie about a man trying to deceive her while trying to cheat her daughters on a new drive. The only thing that will not fail this movie is the exact description of the van fad in the United States in the late 1970s. It looks completely prepared by amateurs. There's rubbish, but I liked it! I must admit that I am an admirer of a 70-year-old dump! I hope it turns it into the 100th part of IMDB! <br /> <br /> 2
