I really was expecting this movie on the front of the screen and waiting for the press I received, but I was very disappointed after seeing it. Slums is a totally unfounded movie that has been mixed with the Todd Todd brand humor brand of Todd Solondz. The story is dragged and every scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point, but I'm glad I'm a human being if this is an example of every girl's growing experience.
