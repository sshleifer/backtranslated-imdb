I'm sorry for all the fans, but it's a useless movie. Acting is bad, even on the wooden, this fear factor is early on, and it does not work properly. I think, in the end it should have a twist, but that's a very striking thing. What is this episode? Was any of the friend hunts who wanted to kill everyone? Try again. <br /> <br /> Its not as good as its a tough original and straight slasher. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she can not resolve any issues. this movie. If someone puts it on the party, drop the discs out of the window and put it in a good film of fear, Lips' Silence and Glitter.
