I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedians, and you probably have seen more of Buster Keaton movies than anyone else for IMDb. From the beginning of my career, I was reviewing every movie made only by two exceptions at the beginning of the 1930s, so I can say that I'm a big fan. That's because I found this episode very painful and hard to watch. I liked the man's films and said, "Buster, how can you do it?" He was thinking. Yes, I think now that Buster Keaton's TWILIGHT Zone is the cause of his God-terrible episode. After a divorce in the early 1930's, she lost more than her neck, and she had a long career as a leading man. The biggest problem with the episode is that it is very scary and Buster deserves more. . The show should have been funny, but instead of respecting silent films, it's just painful - especially with Keaton, in a foolish slot, with a flippant helmet. Give yourself a blessing, THIS ONE - this is a pale imitation that once was Keaton's career!
