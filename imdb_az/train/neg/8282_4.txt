Now we need to know more about this movie, Jessica Simpson says "bomb" is a video (limited, anemic theater). Basically, Mrs. Simpson's Katie sets out on a small town in Oklahoma City to find her in a bed with only one woman to surprise her. He has been stranded, but he has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like to see in more movies), allows him to stay. Katie begins to work through two collaborative staffs (Penelope Ann Miller and always entertaining Andy Dick), who use Katie to get the president of the firm (Larry Miller). This is a serious film, not a deeper one. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress in any way, but she's pretty nice and actually not irritable. The film can be watched with its unwanted hair, not its disgusting. Penny Marshall is ridiculous with a group of people (a delicate joke about Milwaukee hits me) and a funny scene that covers the priests of Norway (much to read). So not terrible, it's not easy to jump. Safe betting is at least watching TV. It is not a good one, it is not a profound catastrophe.
