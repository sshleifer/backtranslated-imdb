It's up to WORST I've ever seen. I'm looking forward to a nice movie, but at least some cool cars were going through scenes / races. What happened to me? The racing scene brings them down to the budget to ensure that the car looks as fast as it goes. On one scene, the Mercedes SLR will only turn around and reach more than 200 in 4 seconds. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about the car, watch the fast and angry series. They may have a little cheese, but they can hope to get 100x better than this movie. Better yet to just watch the Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever thought.
