I have not liked this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I was very disappointed and I came to the conclusion that if this film saved itself, at least I would have to go out of the great pit that I had earned. Unfortunately, this did not happen. For me, the film's two shots were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about what Lindsay Lohan is going to bring to the film. Later, though, each of them had "moments", but only three of them were disappointed. Imagine trying to find each one's "moments" because of character development and lack of information. Though conspiracy is interesting, in general, the film is written down, directed and edited so that everybody can suffer and act as an actor. Sexual abuse, cunning, and street-settlement were two main reasons why the insulting American viewers were not dishonored in the film. A reviewer noted and agreed that the film can not be put on the market if the movie is finished. I suspect, or at least (for any player), I hope there are some real stones in the cutting room. It's heartfelt for us, but if this is true, actors can be happy about it and can feel good about lending their talents and time to such floppies. Oh yeah and something else ... I saw in a movie that just disappeared, but in this film, the main heroes have never been filmed with absentmindedly and / or disrespectful trash, country pop boxes, CDs and other debris with boxes!
