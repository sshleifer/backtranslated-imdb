Like a movie-maker in the cinema's white noise, it's a pretty good, well-lit, well-camouflaged, smart destination. But like a film, she flew like pre-thought like all other "so-called" amber films that said the market was flooded recently. Even though it's a bit of Chill Factor, the concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Fenomena) does not seem convincing. This film did not reveal the causes of certain incidents, but went ahead. <br /> <br /> I do not want to shoot a new movie in many films. <br /> <br /> I'm going to buy a DVD movie and I do not think anyone will ever recommend it. .
