<br /> <br /> <strong> I thought it was a good movie in 1955. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> I still think that I'm sorry for the stupid. <br /> <br /> The story is simply. .. funny. <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say that Dean is great in this movie and is good, probably maybe he has played his role. His character is expected to be 16 or 17 or more. But Dean was a 24-year-old man in the film. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wud is beautiful, but the early scenes of the crying and leaked police station are not convincing. This sets a bad example for the film ... and for the rest of the time, you feel like you're becoming one of those nasty emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> It would be good for him <br /> <br /> This film should have been the only thing that had to do with the Dean's death, which was so inflated.
