It was a pretty creepy movie; I found the music to be effective. Mario was surprised at the photographs taken from the village. However, I had three problems with this movie. First, lighting was very dark, but it was difficult to say what was happening sometimes, but that could have been my shot. Secondly, I'm not sure what the start is going to be very well understood and what's going on there. The third problem I did not understand, but it seems that some people do it. Of course, there are ordinary problems that make people stupid, and the number of men reaches 70. Everything is beautiful, but it's not too close to being loved.
