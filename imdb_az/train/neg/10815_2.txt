I love the Jane Eyre book, and I've seen many versions of it. Everyone has strong points and their mistakes. But it was one of the worst I ever saw. I was not interested in Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and of course looked straight, but there was no emotion on any of her lines. Mr. Rochester was unable to imagine him. <br /> <br /> He brings us to Rochester. William Hurt, if possible, was less emotional than Jane. This is a mystery that can be fooled by two people, but of course I did not care. Perhaps the director (Zeffelly) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! it was perfect.
