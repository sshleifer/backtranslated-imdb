Tragedy, this trash is part of my curriculum while learning cinema. So imagine how I should fully follow. To believe in hell is much easier. Our professor told us that this movie was a movie, but we did not agree or disagree with any ideas. I have no god on earth, I do not think we are human beings, so all movie artists can make mistakes, bad movies .. Or very bad. The main problem is not art, but endlessly sensitive, but many people do not recognize that every person has his own original taste, his own opinion, and I thought that he was the best film, and you could be the worst person this is how it is right in both ways, but what is so many people can understand this correctly? My professor believes in this movie and I'm not the only one. However, the only way to evaluate this "thing" is to measure the original mentality of various old folk stories or any kind to capture the mindset, imagination, and nature of this society. Director Pierre Paolo Pasolini, the artist's writer, was in the forefront of watching the truth about the damned reality. The film is so UGLY. I can not stop it, how to analyze it, then find the potential of the potential! It's not the ugliness of the idea, and it's not strange, for the film's business or something, for that unstable look (Pasolini). Its foundation is insufficient primitive. Deadly kinematic technique, effective sense of relaxation and incredible intolerance are sensitive to everything. Look at sensitive motion, productive cinematography, and very weak groups. OH MY GOD I already have nausea. While waiting for this movie, you can vigorously eliminate your objectivity, which is a real pain like a teeth of a blind doctor. There are some fearful horrors that can be more compassionate than this. So first, how can we continue to be judged fairly? Actually, you did not. This film is not fair. Some guys have a really memorable scene that lights up the camera's eye (!) I'm trying to combine things like killed by Pasolini.
