In 1937, Barbara Stanwyck "Stella Dallas" was not perfectly mature - a half-revised version of the story is a real puzzler he thinks he's working on. Perhaps they would be able to produce something from Blaise Midler, smiling, thinking ridiculous, but this attractive script defeated him. A non-married baby bartender and a young woman who transferred a young girl to a child's father after a few years will be in a better life than a bartender, and will not be able to escape the disfiguring, old traces and feelings. Midler works well with a film director who can control his limits, but it does not happen here; Stephen Collins is reinforcing as a man who has changed his life, but Trini plays Alvarado Midler as a girl. It is something used to be called a "female figure", but it does not go from being rooted in the roots of 1930. * From 1/2
