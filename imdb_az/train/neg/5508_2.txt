Tim (Gary Daniels) bravely wants to enter television reports. He was angry, and he was dismissed. His beautiful, but hollow girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also tells the Sayonara. As for the home, Tim was surprised to discover that his home was an unexpected visitor from Christ (Christopher Lloyd)! By saying her brother Martin, Tim soon tries to help a new friend walk around the globe. However, Martin goes to the laundry and more in the bathroom where he goes. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) sees an opportunity to spend time with Tim, but the true love cycle does not work smoothly in this situation. Soon, everyone on Television hopes for Tim, a story about a true foreigner. What should a man do? For those who love the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy of unlocking boots. In fact, it is undoubtedly terrifying, no plot and, with certainty, of special effects that are likely to fall flat. Daniels are as good as locals, but Lloyd is probably as awkward as a foreigner and overturns the storm. The remainder of the cast is enough like suits, sets and production details. Even if your kids see the cover but beg for this movie, they will be pleased to choose another flick in the video store. Be safe, children and adults will find a great hole in this movie, so you can choose to spend more than 80 Days in the Museum or in the World.
