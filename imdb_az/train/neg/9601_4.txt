This film ends with a speech that tells us that the epic is the fate of the two main symbols of our owner and that the names of people and places are changed ... before telling us absolutely casual relationships with actual people and events. The line that ends up really completes everything that goes before it; Rino Di Silvestroun's dirty film is totally inadequate and has any point in this area; there was no goal. Werewolf Woman is often regarded as a guilty pleasure or 'worse' movie, but I'm not totally content. Normally, I love movies like this; But Werewolf Woman is a really bad movie and despite all sex and horror; Even if it's fun, it's really not forgiving. The film does not have a lot of space, but a gentle poem given to us is about a young woman who thinks she's a werewolf. She makes her dreams come out and find men, sex with them and ultimately kill them. When he returns to the real world, his love falls, but his beloved is killed and turned into revenge ... <br /> <br /> The film consists of sex and gore scenes. extremely dull conversations that highlight various events related to recent events. These areas are likely to advance the field and build symbols; but they really do not do it and can only result in a very difficult use. It seems that Basbug is more interested in style and atmosphere than the director, and this shows that the film looks beautiful and sounded. Sex scenes are often not erotic and are very good. There are many naked women and the fact that the central character is a shadow origin can be a very erotic one because it is competent to allow a very sexy sexual exploitation; but it's not capitalized and I am capable of watching and boring while watching big doses of poorly drawn plot lines. Generally, I do not even recommend this movie to the great exploiters. There are many good things out there and the headline may be interesting - not a movie.
