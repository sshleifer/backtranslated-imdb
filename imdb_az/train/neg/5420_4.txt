<br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black & White - Short Movie) <br /> <Stan 'n' Ollie, with several floosies (Kay Deslys & Vera White) get confused after visiting their burning theater without their confusion! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leo McCarey's comedy, playing brown-based sacrifices, had to say a terrible lie that flares back in a spectacular way. Many of these are very funny, especially when it comes to Stanley's Deslys, which is a playful and pushing game. In addition, some of the entertainment is down by Oakland and the Flower, and its roles are completely straightforward, adding an unpleasant element to the 'devious' scenario. First of all, we are free in the UK, WHO WE.
