Although this is a pretty old show (2002), I have to say that I watched the first episode last night and I must say the worst show ever. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > The episode last night covered many imaginary story lines, created imaginations of everything and tried to promote friendship. Family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The main cause of the episode: Frat House was misled by a large amount of alcohol - Death turned into a senator who wants to investigate the FBI. Death is actually killed by peanut allergy. The senator earns money as he votes for the bill, but ultimately earns the conscience and not the "no", the more millionaire. Everyone is suspicious, but everything else has a common misconception (a former girlfriend was a liar liar teacher, a victim student was actually a life-changing experience of the victim, Senators did not pay a desperate student to kill the enemy enemy enemy, and he freely gives many classmates ). He is the protagonist of all this spark, his brother at that time, suffers a boy, and finally he dares to speak with his advice, but he only said that 'girls' were not good enough to throw it out and wanted to capture them. Do not betray, when he learns the truth about life, he becomes equal to the boy and the girls leave him. Aunt is also the only person God can really rely on (at this point I'm almost sick) <br /> <br /> This drama is getting better when Sue and her FBI team know who the murderer is. . . So you laugh, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> One of Frat's sons, who had been accepted only a year ago and found her true taste to be an international terrorist, put a boy and a bomb on the funeral and worked effectively. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why do writers show the show in a show that they are trying to gather EVERY pioneer, obviously It means that you do not have the character development or players' ability to draw a simple line. Arnie, who watched this show, was killed by 5'000 people with Arnie's teeth collection, except for Arnie, a better player (wow, I never thought it would be a day) 'Son Action Hero' <br /> Simpsons Loved character with the words "comic book boy". . . . <br /> <br /> PUBLISH TV SHOW. . . . . EVERYTHING.
