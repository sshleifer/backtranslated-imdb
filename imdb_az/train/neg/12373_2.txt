Repetition of words - "my sweet little goddess" and the minor variations of this line of mind ... and only the civilian soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the music is too light !! Moreover, the main bluesy "theme" is creepy, and this is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Later, when it looks, it remains as a headache, because the alignment, correction and adjustment of this topic will never change. transition from one field to another. <br /> <br /> The roots of the music and the writer wrote music for a soap or sitcom - there's a budget similar to that of the 80's Canada - this is what makes it <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thing , there is much endurance, and most of these characters are just a real lane running ONE type. Engagement accent - thick Bronx accent. <br /> I do not know if the limited power of actors is only knowing * a * NY highlight, or whether the director is capable of seeing this kind of glare anomaly. <br /> <br /> Last, this is an amateur script, with all the ghost lines that hit the whole film. When any foundation is shaky and unstable, it is impossible to reveal themselves in even more harmful and hateful ways without its shortcomings.
