Do not bump. Minimum area. No character development. I look at this movie from the book with a high eye. It could have been a beautiful movie. Perhaps a cult can be classic. Instead, it was a huge opportunity. There were weak castings and horrible special effects. Who are the bad guys: rebels, military or church, or all of them? I was still amazed at some mini-plot from the movie. I was nervous about certain aspects of this so-called "prophethood," which is not really fully disclosed. I felt I was watching a mixed episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It looked like a film prepared for television. Do not watch this movie. It spends time and money.
