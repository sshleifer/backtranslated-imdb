This movie is not ridiculous, it is a dry and boring thing that the film is tortured only for 2 hours. Throughout the whole movie, I was thinking of something, "this time will end." It is a handy thing to do, they have very little funny moments that gave me 2 stars as a whole. This book is not unusual and the book is almost not funny for the first time, it uses almost every old blonde joke. <br /> <br /> In spite of some of the movies, this is the beginning of the film, he takes several films. Look, it's just bad.
