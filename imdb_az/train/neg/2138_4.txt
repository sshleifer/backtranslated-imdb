War, Inc. - Corporations are warping in the future, and only using a sophisticated Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to carry out sensitive work against competitor CEOs. We sell a mixed comedy to military and corporations. Often, it was hard to figure out what was happening. I'm looking forward to something smart. <br /> <br /> Gusse Point Blank, by Cusak, is thought to be a "spiritual heir". Ä°.E., the war more or less choking. We see Cusack as a man who, with his conscience, killed his murderer as a spoiler. To be fair, John Cusack is safe, taking half-layered children with relative comfort. Short battles look good. Not the rest of the movie. It's strange that we are often surprised neighbors. War Inc is not quite funny enough to be a parody, and it's not a very funny thing to think about what will be the film's message for everyone, so how does corporations like warriors like schemes affect middle-class citizens? It's interesting, but satire does not just work because it's not funny and there's no heart in the heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. Its character strawberries draw hot sauce and control the smallest private plane, but quirks change character traits. Marisa Tomei shoves like a romantic sidekick journalist. There are actually many chemists among them. Hilary Duff breaks a Russian vector and does not deceive himself. Joan Cusack just shouts and screams and shines. Blech. If Kingsley does not start giving a good performance now, he will have to return to Oscar. It's strange. <br /> <br /> This is not a terrible film, but in the end you should ask: "Why is war good?" Absolutely nothing. C-
