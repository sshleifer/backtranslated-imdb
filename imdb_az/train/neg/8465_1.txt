I do not believe in the horror of this movie. I feel respected even by referring to a "movie". The player was straight, correcting was terrible and the line left many unanswered questions unanswered. The situation here was normal: if a small group of foreigners live in the United States and slowly try to seize humanity. But it falls rapidly from there. How can they be satisfied to accept a lie as a "human" as their spouse, the alien human hybrid they demand? They show a pound an edge, but never show what to do. They have a plastic surgeon that can produce a perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. Harmful by the teeth of the great alien monster. The last was almost painful to watch. I suppose, I hope Bruce Boxley will be something like this. How could he say, "Get away from your backs" straight with a wild beast's teeth? It's been five days longer than Babylon. Avoid all costs.
