O my dear god. That was terrible. There is something wrong, and that's it. This movie has no meaning. Works on the entire map and there is no information about what he said. Music tried to be like Batman. 'Edison' acknowledges that it is not a real city. As I live in Vancouver, while watching this movie and recognizing all these places, it has made it unbearable. Why did not they make a real city? Honorable writing was 'Tilman', which was just a fantastic job by John Heard. He was the only actor in the realist role, not on the top and the camp. In fact, John Heard was shameless to see a lot of bad guys spending a lot of time and the film could have been a mopping. Very bad. Hopefully, someone will see this as important and at least give him a loan from John Heard, and he will hire him as an evil person to the ground. On A list.
