This movie is similar to the movie "Cat and Mouse". (The following may sound like a spoiler, but it really only describes a great class of films), passionate, wise main character, his proud, but good sidekick, with his mistaken attempts at humorous interpretations, but soon the inevitable "hard" love story, loyal to her lovers and, of course, a gigantic woman, who was in the grip of the careless, evil enemies of her cruel minions. Everyone has seen the tone of these films, and just like any one of the "National Treasure", just a slightly changed bandage. Every turn of the story is easily predicted (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in casting). When I left the Hollywood movie theater, I was tired of being deceived for the money, and even when I felt like this I accepted my warning; stay away from this movie.
