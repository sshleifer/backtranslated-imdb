First of all, let me know that I am a great believer in the Fanpro squad. I see it as a way to continue a good show after canceling it. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of dignified efforts. <br /> <br /> So for me, there is a soft spot for fanpro products. That is, I usually do not see things that I say bad things about. <br /> That means ST: HF. Well, first of all, good things. Enthusiasm is a great part of making any show credible, and most of the ships have a good time with their roles. After that, the effects are not bad for home-based efforts, and nothing really gets weaker. The stories are not too bad. <br /> <br /> Therefore, on the one hand, there are many problems. Star Trek has never begun to erase any other science-fiction music account to shake, uproar, adjust its backgrounds, music, and effects. Everything from foreigners to Starship Troopers brings the orchestra head to one spot or somewhere else. Similarly, the majority of films are dutifully made by CGI to look different than other films. For example, gray-colored warships, star-destroyers from Star Wars seem pretty clear. The station is also open to Starship Troopers from the Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga. Likewise, it appears in space battles among warriors, as animated sound effects from different Star Wars movies. In the first or second season on one stage, I think that even two TIE fighters are going through the past in one battle, which can not make it difficult to stop the unbelief. <br /> It's nice to watch the pain. Everyone is getting better with the season's adventure, but in the early seasons, waiting for a little bit on the screen. They have also made some exciting choices. Let's just say that the replicators on this show constantly prepare a cake and release it. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are generally very effective. But they must die in a miserable way from the death of the person who decides to use the cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than the use of the background or the shooting. They are simply unreal. Every time I saw that I did not try to laugh more than one, the rifle spirit took off the weapon and said, "This is a stick!" He declared it. On one scene, "Cardassian" actually speaks on one of these. The lips are not just moving, but the mask does not even have an opening on the mouth. One needs to slap it for that. They did not buy a jewel of blades for goodness! <br /> <br /> There are some good things like Herman MÃ¼nster, but there are some funny makeup jobs. <br /> <br /> Writing is not something new, though it is relevant. Instead, it runs as a continuation of the script's DSX, with ships coming out of DS12 on different missions. The new enemy, "The Gray," is not very intimidating, and the cunning line that encompasses them is the effective use of the Borg process. Starfleet Gray, Gray is strong, Starfleet succeeds in escaping his life, then begins to find ways to deal with enemies through technology, and so on. Equals with Borg. <br /> <br /> Another Argument Bone Dialogue. Star Trek writers have long been able to write texnobabble. This is usually the case of "quantum discriminators" or "isolation charges" and so on. Using an explicit exposition of the last plan. In other words, they are nonsense, saying that you are in action and in the resolution. <br /> <br /> The words are really confusing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> but you can not talk to three of the characters in a group. Even when asked what the situation is, a tactic officer who answers "we count on three warships" is heard. Was he really obliged to count them? C'mon! Questioner asked her, "Are you sure?" He was expected to ask. or "double check". <br /> <br /> Commissioner: "No, we can just send and receive." <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> Upon telling the above, he gets better at the show. Season 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 have a good improvement, but 4 and 5 start to improve. <br /> <br /> Quicktime sucks, pretty candid and soon they move better in divx / avi format. Someone really wants to download the downloaded show and watch them on a flat screen instead of a small QT window on the computer screen. Quicktime only complicates the resolution, but the resolution of 320x180 is not scale-scale. In fact, these indicators are pretty unwatchable, as they are the tenth generation VHS tape copy. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show promises, and even begin to love some of the characters. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Demonstrated as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... did we watch the same impression? Or are you at the age of 19?
