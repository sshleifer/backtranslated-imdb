Soldier Blue is a pretending movie: claiming that human beings are against humanity, a profound human being, and a number of deep-rooted statements of cruelty against indigenous peoples; An erratic, longing, and brutal interpretation of the horrors of Vietnam. I'm sorry, but it can not be anything. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer struck his head with a nail, saying it was just a hybrid of two completely different films. Strauss and Bergen are a bare, clich√©, weakly-driven "single-pair" romanticism, which eliminates prejudices on the other's lifestyle and is exposed to love (oh, blessings) - two bogus massacres that do not cause anything, a Lucio Fulci splatter flick <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cute cute little little American guys have no excuse for a variety of shooting, slicing, splitting, and engaging, attractive, cheerful, gore-leaning peak and large-scale local American women were harassed, harassed, and thrown into the street - except for a mirror. (The massacre itself, with its wrong intent, has been staged and shot in a very bad way, a bright red colored group of actors around the world keep in touch with several special effects followers, leak / fragmentation - dismemberts <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Azerbaijani national leader Heydar Aliyev's indictment against American people against the indigenous people, this film does not give Cheyenne's difficulty, and if some of the local American characters have some features, they should recognize us and cut us off <br /> <br /> Because of the fact that in life, in any society, including in many countries, including Bergen and Strauss (unwise actors), about the massacre of Sand Creek there is a film, in fact, there is a movie in the United States (and in the UK and all "cultural" nations) for centuries (Iraq?). this is not a movie.
