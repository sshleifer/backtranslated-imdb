Everything about this movie is hog wash. Strong motion, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie is obliviona !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Leaders should be steady at the end of the week. Robert C. has completely lost and has no clue about what happened. The college kids are bad. There is no ability to act, very foolish thoughts and the right dumbbells down. Special effects are for birds. The security forces around the park include toy grounds: smart weapons, useless walkie talkies; and a toilet paper roller computer system. If the park construction continues and nothing is working; Why should we invite potential customers until everything is completed? along with writers, producers and crew, should be the first victim of the blend. The whole movie belongs to a septic tanks that hit another planet to watch. What a gem. Prisoners have to follow this, so they can commit suicide.
