Creator admits that films have to endure many terrible movies in recent years. Blood Surf has been involved in a list of unnecessary horrifying horrors, ridiculous big animals who want to overwhelm the food chain. As crocodiles are particularly successful, we have to go on our way through the "Crocodile" (directed by Tobe Hooper, a disappointed) and Lake Placid at the summit. Blood Surf, it's as bad as every other movie, and every bit? On top of that? he loves to exaggerate the crowd. The salty suede crocodile says it's 90 years old, 30 meters long (!) And kills fun! In the film, he enjoyed himself by eating many totally stupid surfer dudes and dudettes, surfing in an area full of sharks to search for new excitements. The only good thing about this film is the tropical place. Although it is not entirely inappropriate for a movie like this, the neglected and the nature looks amazing. Each other is simply disastrous. There is a little eye, but all are fake and ridiculous. Dialogue is painful to listen! You do not believe some of these actors say! I know that the surfers should have a less developed team, but I hope they are not stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters says Jaws is a "mechanical toy", but here at least 10 times more realistic than the big white shark of croc Spielberg. The visual effects on 'Blood Surf' are amateurs and the massacres are not impressive. I'm not going to talk about the player because he's secondary in such actions. Girls look sexy from drunken shirts, and fungus jumps with joy when escaping from the animal. You were right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. That's a bad thing to do. But for a different reason than what James Hickox meant, he was 'funny'.
