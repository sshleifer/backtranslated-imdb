Takashi Miike, a well-known Japanese director, can not seem to buy teddy bearing tricks, as the adaptation of a bad woman (and child obedient!) Yasushi Akimoto, part of the legend of a new city: if your cell phone rings with a strange tone - and You will see the message 'Missing Call' - you will repeat the message just to hear your last words before your death. The most successful part of the film is the sharp line of Reality television cameras that integrates future victims, but unusual deaths (red candy includes a hidden piece!) Is frustrating and gruffy. Frequent shootings of predatory dead bodies are actually shown very effectively and the result of the film is so freely. Hollywood has come to the forefront in 2008, but the US version is not a better thing. NO STARS from ****
