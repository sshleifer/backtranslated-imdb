<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> Life is a companion. <br /> <br /> This film has all the basics for this slasher toage: <br /> <br /> - Black women, young people, or young adults are put together, murder scenes - save me, always show her his midriff, but never show off, on a non-floor, which is a female killer, who knows the scene, bra, little pseudo, crazy man, evil, swollen kiss scene. <br /> Even for an unpleasant slasher movie later this is really terrible was. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, even sexually explicit scenes and nudity, were enough to keep an audience of men and lesbian women interested. <br /> <br /> Give the devil ..... 0/10.
