OK, let me know I'm a lot of people, give me a free ticket, and I'll go and see most of the things. Now, multiplex cinemas are very good (I remember the old "one-pitch" single-screen cinemas and I'm 40). In the UK, this film was released as a "liar", a dog. It is a good waste of good cellulose. Just for photo 4/10.
