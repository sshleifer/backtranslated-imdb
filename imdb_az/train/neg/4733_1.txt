I do not really believe that I'm sitting in all things. This movie has the worst player since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a short description: The movie starts with Jojo and another chick, with a torn blonde hair, sitting on the beach One day in the life of a ghost hunter, which looks like it is not for the gym. Anyway, everyone knows it and every chick in the movie wants it. Uh OH! Compete here! The stereotypical "hot chick" that drives the ugly pink car and its best friend. So soon Jojo's mother finds a job in Australia for a lifetime, and Jojo should put her back on her best friend (no, I think she'll cry). A great storm comes and fills the pool with bad water. In any case, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool and faces, yup, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This "story" really stands out. Basically, mermaid wants to fall in love with the "hunt". <br /> <br /> This is a preteen flick, which acts very badly, looks like the summit of the 80's Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the possible stereotypes ... the best friends, the "hunter", the "hot" evil girl and her dear friends, the terrible old man ... that's all there. Following it, I took it for a lot of people. Think of my time and a victim of 40 minutes. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do that, so I'm frustrated.
