ZOMBIAN CHRONICLES Ratio of the aspect: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> <br /> < a young author (Emmy Smith) receives a grizzled herb (Joseph Haggerty) who describes two stories related to meat-eating zombies, which are nowhere known to immerse in the midst of a dream camp. <br /> <br /> The key role played by Haggerty's painful amateurs, which begins with sensitivity, is a waste of time. The two stories that are even worse, the more part of the working time are completely regular, worse than indifferent performances by Brad Sykes who were previously not respected by CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not an "entertaining" movie in which Ed Wood films are "entertaining" (at least he is convinced of what he is doing and is sincere in his efforts despite the lack of talent); Sykes's home cinema films are, in fact, aggravating, boring, and completely free of any virtue, and most of the audience will be deceived by justly angry and crafty, ill-considered junk. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
