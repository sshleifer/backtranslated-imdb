I did not want to watch this movie at first, because the trailer gave an impression of a general and highly anticipated movie ... but I was surprised by the recent "Mensonges et trahesons et plus si affinité", a beautiful writer and author Laurent Tirard ("prête-moi ta main" script), changed my mind and decided to think it would be as good as "Prête-moi ta main", "mensonges". Like Edmund Baer or Clovis Cornillac, Charlotte is not usually as an attractive actress, but rather as a "Mensonges" scenario, and I'm honest, but I do not understand how such a crunch can make such a breakthrough. .. Anyway, this story could have been an excuse to create very interesting fields, but it's not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ..." but an easy, surprising and lazy job.
