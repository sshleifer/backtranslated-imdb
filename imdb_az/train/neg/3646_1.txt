Oh ... my God ... this is definitely the cheesiest movie I've ever seen. The operation is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weak and the whole movie is not just logical. The only thing that Mr. Atlas can defeat is a part of the charm of this movie, with very strange scenes (as the child is drooping and mysteriously frustrated) and with a terrific dialogue ("Look!" "Musta peed his trousers!" Sit down and watch with a few friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just BAD!
