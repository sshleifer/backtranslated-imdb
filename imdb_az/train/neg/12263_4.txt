I've seen this movie just for the first time in Turner Classic (I'm listening to "Dangerous Woman"), just like in 1941, you can appreciate the Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must be paid by smirk. I hope her dentist and trader of Brylcreem remember her with her will; They made him an actor. Women are good, but better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a bit better. The more "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman deliver most of the individual tricks in an attractive way, but the role of roles is virtually nothing in the changing environment, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor sometimes rebuilt the basic texture of their characters; Here, you can not be Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!). <br /> <br /> This film is not exactly sad; there is a big slice there. Its core value today is '41 'that reminds us that great movies such as Hawk will not take place. In the scale of 1 to 10, I value it mainly for camera work and 4 supporting players.
