This is a very old and inexpensive movie - a typically low-budget B-West. Gary Cooper is not yet a star, and this movie reminiscent of John Wayne's early films, seen in the "poverty line" studio. The style and identity of both players were not completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look like Cooper in a few years (he speaks faster in this early movie, among other things). However, unlike the medium B-movie, there are at least a few exciting elements in the era that make the movie unique (not good). If you want to see a woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita faces stars like female love interests, and it has a strong emphasis (she was French) and the "movie star" was pretty close. By the way, he married the director Michael Curtis. <br /> <br /> But the most memorable and strange thing for me is the gay subplot that looks like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN since the 1930s (and we thought this was a new idea). The character of Gary Cooper has been raised by two men who hate women, and most women can do everything they can to make Cooper a part of the film to cleanse women. Not only that misogyny just meant to say, but the movie has a lot of clues that filmmakers have really tried to portray as a gay couple. Particularly, when one is killed by the end of the year, both are hit by an axis and long enough to drag the body of a dead friend, and then fall - guns have fun around him! It was a strange thing to do, and this is why this movie is really cool today! As Cooper and the field goes, the film is a little disappointing and very short-lived. If you are not interested about Damita or homosexual undertones, find yourself a blessing and a good West.
