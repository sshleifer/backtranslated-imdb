If Bob Ludlum saw this mini-series, he would cry. It was a total loss of time and money. I read a book and did exactly what the movie was about, though CBS spent time and money on it and was not ashamed of claiming that it was the work of Ludlum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Miri, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign up to put it down? <br /> Terrible!
