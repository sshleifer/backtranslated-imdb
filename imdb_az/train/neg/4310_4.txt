This movie is about a very sexy Olympic star hired to train a middle school boy basketball team. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, he plays with Cathy Lee Crosby, a leading role-player, and is also a script. I think Racquel Welch would be a better choice, but taking into account the unique movie movie budget of the movie, he probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great at every shot, but we will not see him completely naked. The story is something unexpected, at least it means no surprise. Young and lucky Michael Biehn plays the leading role of men. He's the star of the team, and Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some entertaining scenes, such as a wealthy old man who runs a sporting program and does not think of a woman doing sports. This point is cultivated throughout the film, and should not be said, it is historic. According to Hell, Cathy Lee does not give a team through any non-practical practice session; a man does not do anything to coach. There is a funny subplot that covers long and non-ghost players, passing his lesson and hypnosis to play pro basketball player Sidney Vicks. Although everyone has a good time to shoot this movie, the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has a striking smile, beautiful hair and many body parts.
