You did not expect this to be a good movie, and that's not it. It's an ultra weak zombie movie shot with no budget, hand-held camera ... and it's not funny. The postcards have never before been recorded and shown in their terrifying exciting readings. There is no area to view. A small plot that I could find seemed to frustrate a government experience, and a group of zombies seemed to put terror into several families. Gore Effects is one of the most common illnesses I've ever seen. As you can see, people are hitting the butcher shop for all body parts, and many scenes are zombies that break down people and eat their bodies. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> 90 minutes .
