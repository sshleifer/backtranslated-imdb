My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this film was. After 15 minutes, we will not leave it unless we want to know that the film can save itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the praises given to this movie. <br /> <br /> There is something that particularly disturbs me about this movie, when people were talking to each other frequently, an unnatural break in their lines. I understand using a break to create unpleasant feelings (like Happiness). It was uninterrupted - it's just a bad course. This film can actually be better with subtitles, and maybe the market abroad is best for this movie, because the dialogue and the bad behavior of people will not be very different. I generally love these little quirky films (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but it failed on many levels so I was one of the worst movies I've had in the last few years I consider.
