I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006, and this festival forces me not to actually film the films before the nation's election. The film was simply horrible - I say, without hyperbole or heart motions - it was terrible. Matthew Modin's leading men are set off for days. Gina Gershon dropped an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she is ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben was also a strange community - and she should be ashamed. The scenario was terrible and there was no reason to care for the characters. I doubt that it would be chosen, but still in Hollywood, sometimes it is wrong to know. I really, "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
