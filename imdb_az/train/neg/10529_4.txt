From 1 to 12/6/2009, Dir-Walter Lang was watching: Maybe this is the disappointment of music from the point of view of a character from Rodgers and Hammerstein. Sometimes there are some good songs and decent comic descriptions by King Siam by Yul Brynner - but the movie really does not do a good job of presenting the situation and setting. I just do not exactly understand the scenario and possibly some features and features. I know it would be very small to ask for music and dance to use music, but this part was not so different to me. The main story, an English woman, comes to Siam to teach children about extreme European things. Then we learn that the King is truly the greatest student. The king's most recent wife, Rita Moreno (like a Latin-like Arab, come!) Has a romance ban that banned her from playing an old lover who played and had some difficulties, but nothing to admire anything. Deborah Kerr, Annie as the main female character - OK, but that's also not convincing. The King learns some things because of his existence, and then goes away as the film itself. It's really a little story with a few songs and dances, but it's not a great experience for the audience.
