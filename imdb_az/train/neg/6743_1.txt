How many times should we watch the movies with the killer with Scream-Ripoff Mask? Bleed's originality is original, but the film itself is a complete failure. In short, although the dialogue is weak, it is a lot of time consuming, delicate and insignificant information, the player is bad, and cetera. I want my money back, this rent is worse than skunk.
