Yes, I'm lucky enough to see the original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical compositions. It was an incredible experience and I paid for the movie when I hit the theaters in 1985. Terrible. Almost everything fails. First of all, Attenborough (a good player, a good director with the right material) is a disadvantageous choice - almost as bad as John Huston was involved in mixing ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they bump songs and CAUTION! They are terrifying - the power of the game was this dancer - it was a hungry, talented performers who wanted a chance to show just what they could do, and when they got their chances - they could not get your eyes off them. But this dance only dance, "beautiful" work, but none runs a little. In fact, seek to cast in the IMDb - none of them really went for something. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). Thus, this film-action coup will not miss the magic, desperation, and scenic music for a moment. Overall attack! (Although they are trying to steal music - great music still rises and reminds how big the score is).
