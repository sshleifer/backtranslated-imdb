While actors play a convincing role in losing parades along the screen, it's not possible to describe these characters, so I watch only 20 minutes (and a few times later). The field development is separate and slow, the only sign of the only character of the main character is practically impossible, the basic quality of the majority of characters and the cavalier path they treat. <br /> <br /> Ventura Pons is typical of psychological disruptions. At the same time, this efficient sociological analysis has dropped from CARICIAS or Caresses. Here the cartoons hinder each other and despise one another for good reason. In AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to adhere to a subnormal intelligence platform, as we are sitting with a serious depressed and individual woman. I guess it depends on your own depression, but the scenario does not support it. If there are any masochists there will not just give the rest of the story? Has he been cured by his own will or shocked by his own depression? <br /> <br /> If you can sit down with all this superstition, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, ugly philosophy, and everything else, The camera work was pretty good and it looked like something inspired by the DOGMA team. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, makeup, these players to show to the crisp and curly light, as I have seen the worst Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any movie (personally attractive personally) <br /> <br /> I think if we think that we have to see the lower strata of the society that we can be grateful then Pons achieved its goal. Approximately the same sex scenes were a good loss of the film (the actors were filmed, but at one time blue backgrounds could have earned money in a special effects studio). It is true that most of the men shouted at the place where they were living, but the objective view proves that these scenes are not the true purpose. <br /> Set yourself up and look at something else.
