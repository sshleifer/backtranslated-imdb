The really bad movie, the story is very simple, predictable and acts as a defective set. <br /> <br /> This vampire hunter's story is the worst thing I've ever seen, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) searched some blood suckers in Mexico, he used some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to the Blade) and some Van Helsig is part of the vampire's hunting network, OK, but it works alone. He has been assigned to the search for a powerful vampire queen looking for some black hippocrates to perform a ceasefire against sunlight (Vampires (1998) by Johns Carpenter and Vermeer Vermeer (1998) began searching for a queen with a new friend: Sancho (Diego Luna, a teenager without experience), Rodrigo Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), a special vampire from Catholic priest Zoey (Natasha Wagner) and another expert vampire hunter, Ray Collins (Darius McCrary). <br /> <br / > You can see this movie only starring John Bon Jovi, a great difference in quality of movement compared to James Woods, and if you watch the movie (if I do not advise you), you will be joining one of the more simple stories and predicting, > <br /> I recommend not see this movie rent, rent another movie, watch another channel, go with friends and so on. <br /> <br /> 3/10
