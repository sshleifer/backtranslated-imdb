This movie is spoofed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In my opinion, the MST3K was the best when it fell. <br /> <br /> Terrible player, bad makeup, poor effects, chicken in underwear (1960s) underwear. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Assistant says NACHOO as "not you"! (I'm sorry). Only poor. Long eyebrows are joyful in one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I did not even know what the predicted Adam was from the plot view. I missed some starters. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum of these 10 lines?
