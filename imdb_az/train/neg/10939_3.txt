This movie has one of the worst things I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails from the ground. This nail trap captures these bad guys. As you go, the rest of the movie goes down. I do not believe that this movie is not in the 100 films of all time. I do not believe there are also sequels! R.O.T.O.R. I want to watch the next shit movie. <br /> <br /> Is R.O.T.O.R really really worse? <br /> <br />
