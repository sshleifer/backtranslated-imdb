The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was a dark, less child-focused Gojira (Godzilla) update of sensitivity for the 1960s. Gamera, of course, is not as big as some versions of Godzilla, but a giant, flying, burning turtle that has a similar energy in most cases. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film has been edited and read by famous Sandy Frank. And like the American version of Godzilla ("The Monsters of Godzilla King"), "Gammera Invincible" is more than just a spelling mistake. American scenes are not as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the Big Gojira, but they do not add much to the truth, though little is added to the truth. <br /> <br /> The film begins to be promising, there are several scenarios for character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside the main area. However, after the Gamera appeared, the film began to fall into a fairly ill-fated kaiju film. <br /> <br /> Acting is good enough - American add-ons are also good. The director is pretty good for this period and genre, and special effects are not timely (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backgrounds are really good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is, of course, nothing really about this movie. Gamera then develops a more unique identity in movies - it's worth watching whether it's the most kaiju fan.
