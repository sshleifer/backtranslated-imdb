Only because I was a great fan of the BSG's first two seasons and only being a BSG Razor, I was hoping that this freedom would bring the franchise back to its original glory days. I have no problems with the science fiction, which is mainly the dialogue against the visual bonanza of the special effects. If the scenario is intense with some of the original ideas bestowed by actors, little CGI can create a deeper movie. This prequel does not have one of the above-mentioned requirements. The virtual real world created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene is just for raising the rating to limit. Teenagers will not love the virtual reality mosh holes filled with sex and violence and heavy dance music. It's part of the same youth who have intellectual depth or thought, or political or religious passion, to become suicide bombers that create or amaze such fragmentary software. These children are not necessarily from this planet. The film is played just like a soap opera, which is only a bit of interest in the last 10 minutes. It is not fun to play with Eric Stolz, to deliberately entertain her cybercard with student software. However, this old concept was well-portrayed and more convincing in the bright, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica breaks only her fascinate views of the old Hollywood movie. There is no surprise there! Generally, this film was soft and uncertain and cheap, using the BGP's Caprica's CGI again. I suspect I'll watch this place when it's happening on the Sci-Fi channel. Of course, this insomnia once suffered a bad illness when this show would definitely be cure. Zzzzzzzzz
