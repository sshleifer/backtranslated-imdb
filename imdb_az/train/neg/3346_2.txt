Cheezy acting movie Dolph Lungren. The mosquitoes are a military man once taught. However, changes in the neighborhood and the student body made him angry and decided to hang it. Things are simplified when some robbers watch over many students in prison, taking the basics of an armored car robbery operation into school. His Dolph versus baddies to fight against death. Jaw bad guys are decorated with punks and some of the bad women have returned to the exploits of the late grindhouse era, which shines in the daytime. What a stupid movie. People did it in such a way, perhaps a motion film, fraudulent cleavage sets, and a weak movement oriented to the low budget before the manufacturer's glare. How late they were filmed in the movie, though they did not go to school through the car's cars, they were safely hit by a turret (a prison looks like a secondary school) does not seem to be in the previous shoots. What are the gods of bad movies doing? In fact, it was a really good director who prepared films like Sid C Furie (?), The Boys in the Desert. The difficulty did not reach him, or was it hopeless without leaving, even worrying about it? This is a turkey. Expected one, but Turkey is not the least.
