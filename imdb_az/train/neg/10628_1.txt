This so-called "documentary" tries to say that the US has caused the moon to fall. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> When astronauts are available monthly, one month for geological surveys brought a very small penny boat. Hundreds of world-wide labs have been tested and tested. They all realized that they came from the same place, not from the same planet: the inner isotopes of the main elements differ from those on earth, but are similar to those per month. Ä°.E. <br /> <br /> <strong> One of the researchers at Qafqaz University has taught one thing: they only get things that are relevant to their theory, and they do not see the rest. <br /> <br /> Another breath of claim, IE flag moves. There is an unreasonable explanation: the astronaut transmits it with his hand, so he moved. Here's what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theory examines the imagery, the astronaut will never see the flag as it leaves it. conspiracy theorists are bad scholars, they can not properly study a topic or investigate them as much as they can, so they can lie and profit (this "documentary"). <br /> <br /> According to one claim, the shooting is impossible, because all shadows come from different places, because there are various sources of light and artificial lighting from the studio. Once the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as always), there is no nighttime outdoors, no light source. <br /> <br /> For some days, over a few days, it's more than just a Star Treck congress. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Denies the constitution theorists, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So all these lies are important - this is a fact.
