The most spectacular scene of this movie is that our creators have medals and boards. So the main idea is police, which cuts the pirates down to one million, but they are weak, because the villains' weapons are a bit bigger. I think police forces are running a little. They decided to film this movie with fake interviews and with all of them seriously. They speak as if armed with newspapers. Okay, I acknowledge that even if the situation is too much for your advantage, the likelihood of being in the line of fire is still dangerous, but do not go to the hazelnuts. And why did the hell take 44 minutes to solve everything? I can tell you that it's been a long time when you covered them and allowed them to shoot. They were ten feet away and did not hit anything at all. Then they can go on to increase heroism and get bigger weapons. And then yes, there's one of the cops really hitting someone. Bullet is probably directed with a bulb post or something. I had a good laugh.
