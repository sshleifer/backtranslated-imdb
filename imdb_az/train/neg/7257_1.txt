I was waiting for the B-Movie French music. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès was the superstar of low-budget French films of that time. And it's colorful! But this is an amazing hour at 30 pure partner hallucinations. Music numbers are awful and comedy is totally boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? This is the sequence of evil numbers that follow one another. Only a very rare thing about that thing is the nakedness of women. At that time he did not meet. In fact, some numbers have to show us top-notch women. This adds a partnership! And in his first film as a musician, try to find the future actor of the French cinema, Young Michelle Serrault. Good luck!
