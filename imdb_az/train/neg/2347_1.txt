First of all, I express my great admiration of Ashley Judd; Therefore, it was interesting to check his debut role. His talent is clear and there is no argument that his performance is good. I think that professional critics like the aesthetic content of the story. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movies are entertaining us and this is where the film is failing. <br /> <br /> At half a point, I thought myself: the girls in the store, standing in a mysterious shop entering the empty place, were fixing things up? <br /> <br /> Then I thought that perhaps the film director could be one of the movies he was trying to make audiences comfortable before hitting a dynamic event. <br /> <br /> <strong > <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies, but I'm waiting for fun. <br /> <br /> Include that cinematography and sound quality can be compared to bad home movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know who will be able to do this movie. <br /> <br /> My life is 114 minutes long. <br /> <br />
