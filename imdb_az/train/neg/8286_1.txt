- = contains spoilers from original and movie versions. <br /> <br /> I am a great admirer of the music of Notre Dame De Paris, and I have read this article and watched the movie today, hopefully, especially at 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes Although good to watch a good movie, but I really did book the scene directly from the scene, the scene was awhile, but it was normal but when something kissed Esmeralda gringoire ... they kiss in the book, even in the music .. <br /> <br /> <br /> Esmeralda had a huge gap on the magician's case, in his book, how he could answer the clock numbers, or read a "phoebus." Wait there was a phoebus there? In this film, he did more than just some of the soldiers, but the creators made love to show around Quasimodo, and even canceled Frollo's love. But it was Notre Dame Frollo. his thoughts in the film will not fight the struggle of human love, we will not find anything like us, killing people who are really bad about some of their foreigners and their thoughts ... Do not talk about Foebus, does not remind the love of frollo, Jahan (brother, not celebrating Esmeralda's mother) frollo) did not even mention the true story (maybe this is good, the story would betray too much) (other PS: frollo opus dei or <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not watch this movie, a real masterpiece director's edition, <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than the film's notorious animated movie Notre Dame II .. Notre dame de Paris when watching music .. it was not enough.
