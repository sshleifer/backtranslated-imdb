I'm also surprised and hated by people who claim that this film is accurate in Vietnam. Since Rodney King's beating is a truth about all police officers, this movie is a truth about the entire Vietnam War. Yes, bad things happen, but in general, people are like you and me. There are people, they do not kill cars, they are not drugs. Cruelty was not an exception in Vietnam. They rarely happened to believe in the "hype". Oliver Stone has a skill to create a film that shows Vietnam War as a brutal blood lake, but in fact it takes the foundation of Star Wars. If you believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam honestly, give yourself a blessing and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA have done worse things in South Vietnam than any US Army soldier. Fact: Soldiers in the Second World War were worse than the Vietnamese soldiers in general, and they enjoyed it when they came home. Amazing Americans who serve this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was politically bad, no one would want more than our soldiers, and it is a great loss to claim that such a "true truth" is really in the form of artistic things.
