First of all, I would like to tell everyone who saw this movie that the actor who played the role of "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, a very good actor, he has had several plays and music. Currently Terrace B.C. I'm here, laughing at almost every saturday * OK, now about the movie, I will not offer it to anyone who has not seen it because it's never been the main reason I'm a bad movie, it's back in time, so at some points is hard to watch, and secondly, the really dull * laughs * movie just does not compare.
