Author Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate Smithsonian Institution to her troubled reduction / expansion machine as she and her husband Diane (Eve Gordon) are ready for a weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Looking at the family, Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteers will wait for you to head), by adult Wayne's contraction is zapped. As the kids are amok, their miniaturized nation must deal with the cunning big insects, carpet wrinkles and other threats that appear to be canyons. It was bad, like direct video shooting, Honey, to shrink ourselves, it was funny.
