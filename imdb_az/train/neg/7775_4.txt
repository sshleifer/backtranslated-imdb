I do not know the Trinity, but watched this movie at Showtime yesterday. The film was well-known for its design and cinematography, but scenarios were styles and wooden. The player was pretty bad - I thought the two women could serve their potential. Of course, if you support actors, you would not even believe it. There were stereotypes - a copy of the Bible, an influential Captain, a hot soldier, and so on. Without a Holy Reverend. I did not know it as Canadian did so in the light of these shortcomings. Telefilm gave it to Canada for the latest credits. I know that I am a terrible man. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at the beginning, but hostility towards girls is not disclosed. Here they can stay in the castle by the wolves, and men spend time and energy exposing two young women without any cause. FOCUS people. Beyond the walls, there are some more cases when these girls are lesbian - this is just my speech for hostility toward them. If you can target the gun and shoot, you will be better off. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's related to trilogy of the trilogy, these girls are heroes? One of them killed an Indian man and eventually saved one of his life. In some cases, he is a victim of the state of affairs that can not be brought to account for his status, but it is a murder that is not worthy of the other end.
