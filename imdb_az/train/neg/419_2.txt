The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie since 1933. This is, in fact, a premier film for the time when objects appear on an invisible human being. Go, look at the movie, the first truly real-life effect movie that you shocked to do in 1933. In 2000, when computer-assisted special effects appear to be children's play, the audience is not exploded with special effects and are disappointed if they do not. Updating HG-Wells in Hollow Man is special effects, but the biggest problem of this film is managed by Paul Verhoeven, you can remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays a Sebastian Caine, a dabbling scientist in the world of bio-invisibilation (yes, not a word), but certainly struggles with high ups that threaten team finances. Thus, because they are prone to the film characteristic of their funding privilege, it finally sacrifices and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibility (yes, I know that I used the word again). This process leads to strange results, Caine is not immortal, but instead of a fierce, fierce creature, a brother. Apparently, Caine has taken on a sexual partner, a worker, an old girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and a financial institution. Then it's funny, Caine becomes a new extraordinary creature, "It's not going to die." Naturally, laughing in front of everything, Caine appears after death, and feels like a clock for the death of this creature, as if it were dragged to the end of the movie. The film is nervous, stupid and realistic, sometimes used sometimes laughs, sometimes not. Hollow Man has clean opportunities, but of course, none of them can be investigated. For a more intriguing look of an invisible being, get ready for some good old black and white movies and check out 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon is still invisible when he returns, probably still alive under a volcano.
