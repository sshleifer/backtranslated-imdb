Sad, independent, theater, Christian Slater - all the teasers who have been waiting for me to spend an hour or one for a "discovery" of a movie. Boy, I'm disappointed. Julian Po will never happen to him. The film simply makes itself conscious. I am unable to stop myself from blasphemy for a moment. Clear, clear theater sets, extravagant, clear theater opera- tion, extreme, clear theater management - is a good idea. <br /> <br /> There is no need to convey allegories to childhood hammer style. It is hard for Julian Po to feel a lot, because we did not know much about him. Stylish girlfriend, teasing suburbs, terrible clerics, bratty kids - why everyone who has longevity to become seafarer (Slater's character) decides to stay in such a disappointing place?
