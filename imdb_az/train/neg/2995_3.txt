Only very rarely the x-files fail to create an excerpt from an episode, or there's nothing absolutely boring to just watch the episode. The detective and his former partner will also die in unexplained circumstances. Death is Due to the existence of a young girl who was there when deaths occur. Mulder prepared a theory that came as a young girl who was killed by her colleagues, reincarnated and resolutely intensified for a strange bite. The little girl does not have any contact and looks like a random person chosen as reincarnation. I think it's a little lazy by writers, and this episode is sorted as one of the worst of x-file history!
