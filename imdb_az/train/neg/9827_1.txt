First, this movie reminded me of the old movies used to watch in my classroom in the classroom. This is not a good thing. Basically, the terrifying "Left Behind" series is just a piece of worship and ambitious piece. I'm not afraid of religious movies ... but when it's terribly religious, I hurt it. I just want to say good things about a Christian movie, but it does not look like it will happen anytime soon. I bribed you for paying a decent amount of bills to the bumper, but it still can not be a good thing. Avoid this. Also, dissemination of the "American Family Association" (mainly due to the lack of Reverend Wildmon) on its website on this film is another reason to hate me. In fact, after reviewing it, I went home and looked at David Cronenberg's NC-17 "Crash" rating. Forgive me for blasphemy. Hahahahaha!
