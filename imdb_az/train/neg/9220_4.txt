The first 4 minutes at the start of the film was like a California trip, did I mix the bands? Then I got a comfortable breath to see Paul Thomas on stage with my favorite Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. It is attracted by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Jimmy's worries about Honey Wilder's behavior, he hires a special teacher (Kay Parker). <br /> <br /> Byron and Parker have a good sex scene but it's not good to rescue this movie. <br /> My Degree: D +
