Let's see him; Some naked children who are dead and have been strangely transferred to the spirit. It will not! OMFG takes his ass back to him by some drunk bastards who embrace the mother of this stupid child who can not stand up for herself. He looks at the dead as he is dead and frightens his spirit. The drunken man hid his death by thinking that he had committed suicide and stayed with him. He then sees that he is thrown out of the trader, and then gets another encounter with fear. Drunk calling it a loser and "Losing someone, losing a bit!" Frightened by the building, he calls it "daddy-o" and then heads the poor man. Here's how this awesome movie comes from. Then he continues to kill many people. He basically kills people who are in trouble at RL and went to kill some casual donkeys for some laughs. Let's not laugh here. Adds a punchline to kill each one. Each time he kills someone, a few karate squeaks and completes it with one of the signature punchline. In the case of someone who is hard to listen, he would say, "There's a corn here." then push the donkeys. Otherwise, we can take an example from the movie! He set out to kill a single policeman and kill the only one he stood up for. His father, the sheriff, shouted madly to stop him and said, "Hey, stay for a while!" a dagger threw his chest and put it on the tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two boys and punchline "Gotta split!" struck a head and killed two boys on their heads. Wowzors, this movie wanted me very bad cream for my champagne. Maybe next time this guy will shoot a movie, not gay.
