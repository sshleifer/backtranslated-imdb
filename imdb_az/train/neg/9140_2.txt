Phew - I do not want to say what to do. It can be a really good movie with a staggering audience. Some of the players reminded me of John Waters's early victims. Perhaps I should return - I do not want to insult Waters as a director / story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked my lawyer for the article "Full confidence and reliability." This means "full faith and credit"! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "Conrad Boys," the main actor, writer, director, film editor and so on. Thus, they are most like the most experienced filmmakers who have the capability to do something.
