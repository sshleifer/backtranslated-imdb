I killed it on DVD 10 pack. You should love these bargain packages. Although they are remastering, restore and all these hoo-ha features and movies are not fully framed pan and browsing formats, there's always a few stones involved. And with "stones" almost all the movies, especially films, are a good thing to do, if there are some "madness lodges" from the 70's. <br /> <br /> My name is called "Madness Lodge", but when the title screens take on, Poe's Dr. Tarr Torture Dungeon. Indeed, drowning is not as important as twisting, right? Yes! But it is not right to say that this film is absolutely worthless. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ font> </ font> </ font> Dialogue is always fun. At the start of the film, a horse and a carriage driver moves on a dead carriage in the middle of the road. "What power?" The hero says. Later funny, this fun guy did not fight a brilliant orchestra. You will not forget that this guy is in the movie until the end is over. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that for several days it has become one of many countries. Three-year-olds like a bad cartoon that will find something sad. Why all the strange rifles, anyway? It was my fave moment when I pulled out of the horse and car's forest hearts, dropping a stupid-looking homemade ghost with a stick in the middle of the road and stopping the buggy. What is this episode? Yes, perhaps there are plenty of things to be done for those who want to win such things. Boobies, bad dialogue and wacky music. This is the best place to look at the mansion. It deserves at least one review and may be better if you drink a few or something. I can not say that I have difficulty watching it, but I can not deny that I have to touch it once. Kinda is like Magical Mystery Tour, but not with a plot, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
