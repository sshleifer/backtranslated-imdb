This movie was incredibly terrible, even though the idea that these awesome characters personally witnessed every important point of the 1960s (of course, not joining Katie Manson's Family and not being able to die in Altamont). The "Writers" closed themselves in a room and repeatedly watched the films of Forrest Gump, The Wonder Years, and Oliver Stone, and called it a research. A Canadian television critic called for the outcome of the first episode's "head-spinning". He was right.
