* ALLEGEDS * When it was released in 1958, I am sure that it was time-appropriate. From then on, the movies were moving slowly to allow viewers to watch and analyze the story. Here, a man moves to a house of his last spouse who has mysteriously died with his new wife. Gardening Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who directed the film) is really of a very little character. She gets a skull to warn Jenny about her worry, as she knows her first husband is a bad play in her death. He can not tell Jenny directly what happened, so he tries to scare him with the skull. Jenny, as we have seen, has seen the death of her parents, leading to a lifetime of mental illness, which leads to institutionalization. Today, as a large number of audiences, I was able to get a little slower for my taste. <br /> <br /> But if you resemble a very slow, horrible horror, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
