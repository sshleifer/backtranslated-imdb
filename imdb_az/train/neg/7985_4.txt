"Kings and the Queen" is a conscious French drama that has no apparent point or purpose between two hours and thirty-two minutes. <br /> <br /> The film has two stories without first having a connection. resulting in a connection between half the film and one another. There are only a few days to live, including the first centers around Nora and the struggles with different people in his life, including an old father. Another story is called a violinist who puts a man named Ismail - in an unfair way, believes that he is in a mental form with the torture of an unknown third party. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If Ismail finds out that Nora's old lover and his son is the one whom he chose to marry from a tragic relationship, these two stories will soon come together. <br /> <br> With a little more focus and more, "Kings and the Queen" could have been a powerful, delicate drama related to contemporary day-to-day relationships. Certainly there are moments of great surprise and emotional power, and performances are often complex and inviolable. But as a whole film shoots and miracles are so sincere, that it begins to hurt our patience and oppose the early start. Even worse, we spend some of the things we look like in a mere eternity in this company, but at the end of the show, we do not know what will happen to one another. For example, Nora's father writes a scattered diatribe against the character of his unmarried daughter, who is more than two hours in the dying floor. Nora is certainly not a mother Theresa (who she is again?), But she is not worthy of the author who was thrown at her by her very own father. Nora can sometimes be accused of being confused, indifferent, sometimes even slightly self-conscious, but she is somewhat wicked to ask her father to give cancer and die in her place? I do not even think so. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, this movie did not work just at a deep level, so I could not be proud of it. But I doubt that even writer Roger Bohbot and writer / director Arnaud Desplechin were fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well-behaved, ambitious lamp of a film that travels a long way from the sea to the spectacle of individual crises, a journey that is smarter and more clarifying than the beginning.
