This movie has negative comments and I agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever. True, most of the movies based on the King's works are very bad, but it does have a bad effect on the terrible world. There is no time for fear until you consider stupidity to be scary. PeeWee's Playhouse (at least as entertaining) is mixed with the so-called "scary", which is astonishingly open and belabored, in the first place did not mean the twisted myths - typical King Dip. At least Alice Krigein's character is full of these ridiculous moments. It is very absurd to be unhappy if he continues screaming and begins to get bored with the old Batman TV. All the people in this community (including John Landis) still have a career. But the most absurd part should be the cat suits at the end of the line, which looks like cheap rubber outfit in K-mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of some real cats that actually make people in the movie.
