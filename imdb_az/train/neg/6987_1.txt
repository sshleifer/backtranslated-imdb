This is what I have for the great epic idea of ​​the American Revolutionary War. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a presentation show at the previous MGM studios (now Sony). came out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His Scottish glory was the American frontier (! (!!). Then the story began, and all went fast. <br /> <br /> Motivation was shocking, dialogue was defective, there was no history and political context. There was a plot proposed by ineffective coincidences; Pacino and Kinski have been desperate for the third or third time their lover claimed. Donald Sutherland gave an improvised performance as an English officer / pederast. His accents were all on the map. I know that there are no English actors. <br /> <br /> Many people have left. They tried to strangle my spark, and then they trusted. I compressed her - I thought that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. However, it is not clear that Hudson chose to film with his cameras, even with Steadicam. <br /> <br /> There were eighties famous television inspector. a few other people in front of me: (the latter) Gary Franklin, Witness on Channel 7. That's why he was dependent on his behavior after returning to us. I'm sure that the next day on television, he gave her movie "From 10 to 10" Franklin's size from 1 to 10. I know the art when they see it. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino could not take part in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career has never been restored. I can not say I did not warn you.
