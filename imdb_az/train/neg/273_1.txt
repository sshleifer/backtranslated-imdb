A sign of a classic film is like a beautiful red wine. This movie is Cabarnet and of course not Casablanca. Together with other reviewers, I agree that children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that occurs in sit-com nights and is stilted and preoccupied with dialogue. However, let's look at the old film's theme. <br /> <br /> Six-plus plus-year-wise wisdom comes. The author, Lillian Hellman, has been described as a Bidenesque suicide by Julien from the Pentimento, as he has been watching in Rhine. As one of the most feared Americans in the West, the theme of the game and the film seemed clear, but it was America's military superiority in Spain to get rid of the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and the international communism only to prove that it was fascists. <br /> <br /> Lillian is not the American-American game and movie, as one reviewer correctly notes, as Lillian goes to the American-hatred Communist. This movie reminds the introductory smile of the intellectual elite, which forms America's left, and is now part of the Sun's Kos and Michael Moore's left foot, theories of conspiracy theories, and has once again obtained the proven theories of America's destruction.
