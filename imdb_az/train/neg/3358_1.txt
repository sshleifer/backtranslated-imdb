Haunting. Of course, a remake. It was a genuine, creepy psychological tension and improved over time. Compared to the reconstruction of 1999, this is classic. There is no development of characters here, just cartoons (prostitute, authoritative brain, "pull us out of here" is a very sensitive book worm). However, when you see how specializing in "star" banking, I think that empathy is a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effect is laughable. The washing of acne, tense gates, irritating dead children who can not speak clearly ... and a wish to give a new age for butterflies and rainbows. Thanks to my Skittles, thank you. Bruce Dern, I loved you since The Cowboys. Stop it.
