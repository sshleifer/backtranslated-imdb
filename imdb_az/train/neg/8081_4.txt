One of the demands of science fiction is at least acceptable before at least satirization. I think an anti-grenade bomb will be damaged more than what it is supposed to do. <br /> <br /> For the physicists who are seeing the sun crisis. <br /> <br /> The Earth's Crisis, when the solar batteries are completely abandoned. They approach the ground, and therefore the entire planet is as warm as the Valley of Death. The answer is an anti-matter bomber that will split into space and explode a space ship. This will leave the cartridges for Mercury to say that it does not fit directly with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who will hand it over, but captain Tim Matheson and his crew? That is, he can keep his job, not his corrupt son Corin Nemec. <br /> <br /> Admiral Charlton Heston, the father of Matheson and the father of Nemecin, originated in a personal sense of family problems. <br /> <br /> There is a funeral here, CEO of a multinational corporation, Peter Boyle, tries to control the world's food supply for those who are struggling. The idea that he will not be included is not his. <br /> <br /> The sun crisis, like a bad mixture of 2001, looks like A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Sea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He is the only player who knows that he is in Turkey and that he has won. <br /> <br /> The rest of the game is strange, true blue and boring. Except for Jack Palance, who found Nemeci and cared for her wildlife mall. <br /> <br /> The film is a film that Hollywood's flop films are written by Allen Smithee. The film earns four stars for the shooting and was given time for a Thanksgiving carving.
