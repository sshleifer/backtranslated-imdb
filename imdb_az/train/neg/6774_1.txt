As an enthusiastic fan of Cary Grant, I watch this movie and laugh at laughter because AMC has invented it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with the movie! Cary's usual charm and elegant comedy is all about AWOL; he is tense, bored and just as herself. Mississippi's character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his emphasis is exaggerated (and incorrectly, according to a part of Mississippi's claim), and when he delivers a line, the other cast member is higher than a few decibels. Mississippi tried to show himself as a goofball in the movie, a beloved country, but in the end he managed only to get away with weak guarantees. Mansfield resembles a flammable explosive puppet than a Hollywood cats, and casts a wail on Hollywood, though it has never been known for its ability to act. The character of Ray Walston was sugary and eventually the result. For four people on the beach, it was the best vacation I've ever had. I was watching until the end of this nightmare and I do not know when I do not know anyone, so I'm going to see that it's the most absurd. The film tries to make warriors feel patriotic and debt-minded, but the film completely misses that point because of a poor plot line and weak shots. We're sorry, Cary!
