The film is terribly horrific and irritates the victim to be harassed. On the surface, a brave film about aggression can only be filmed, but if it is drilled under the surface, there is a very good message of aggression. Aishwarya is a victim of harassment and is shown to be a victimless victim who can not cope with it. She needs her to help her. The society does not stand up for itself if it poses and comments on itself. <br /> <br /> Aishvarya is something that Anil Kapoor has left to talk while weeping. <br /> <br /> Basbug (Satish Kushik) has misjudged the victim as a weak and obedient victim of aggression. It would be more effective to describe a strong woman who bravely rebelled against her enemies. The director is famous for being a chauvinist. Films are usually full of vulnerable women, but they try to hide them in controversial roles. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya is the scene in the film when it is self-cleaning after being harassed. She is doing this to please her father, who thinks she's already dirty. What Shah does not indicate to us is that it is wrong for a father to do something like that of his father's daughter if Shah is stamping on victims in aggressive light. Thus, we were left with a mixed message about aggression. <br /> <br /> There is no need for a comedy like this. And even more, the comedy is not just funny. While Anil Kapoor did nothing else, Ash was in his role as a board member. Music is mediocre, except for beautiful images (the only luminous point of this film), except the headline. The role of Sonale Bendrein is frustrating and meaningless. Generally, a great movie to remember was a wonder miracle that would pave the way for some viewers.
