This documentary begins with an interesting point - an interesting and convincing argument that the history of Jesus is generally believed to be a myth. Unfortunately, however, after sparing us, the film is completely geared and less direct to Christianity and is aimed at very easy goals. <br /> <br /> There are some issues with the writer / director of the church (he has an old evangelical Christian and some legit anger) and this movie seems to be its form of liberty. It would be interesting to see that the first 20 minutes expanded, but in general, the film creates disappointment.
