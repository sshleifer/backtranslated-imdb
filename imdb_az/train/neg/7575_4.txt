A retired diplomat well-versed by Michael York went to Russia to take revenge on a Russian gangster who killed his son's son. There the diplomat prevents a very powerful and worthy Russian police who helps bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old movements of the 1980s that the righteous US government, which always portrays Russians as bad people. <br /> <br /> Today, it's interesting to see Russia as a hero. <br /> <br /> It's not a big flick, it's actually a bumping of the B movement. Michael gives some of the classes in this mid-range film. Alexander Nevsky, a Russian police officer, has some sort of "blah" but has a few chemistry with Michael Kimya in a surprising way. Face-to-face, a good actor that has chemistry with everyone who has a scene in Michael York. Frustrated, beautiful Adrian Paul was killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul had been in this movie for a long time, the average "B" would move. About Adrian Paul I can say that it's a great thing to look at the first 15 minutes of the movie. The guy that Richard Tyson plays is your typical bad guy. This film is very dark and very troublesome. <br /> <br /> If you do not have anything else on the television to watch, get this flick rent. Everything is OK. Not too bad. The scene is worthy of the event. The player could have been better, the plot could move faster, but hey, you see Russia today!
