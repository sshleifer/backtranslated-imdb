I bought this movie on the DVD so I can get the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, because Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are not the movie itself. Although it's a plot, you can follow a story and there are only a few actors that can act. The film was very boring, and I strongly affirmed that we would not look again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As it was summarized above, it was better than the one shown in the previous MST3K episode; Mitchell.
