<br /> <br /> For this movie, I was shown to see this movie and to be afraid to watch it. <br /> <br /> Because of my disappointment, this has become more comedy. The film's actor, dialogue and movement were very bad. Most of this was not logical. For example, about 30 people have a party, and although they are in a secret place, we are afraid of one person and all healthy looking young people, and the person who threatens them sounds sounds of pain. I think that maybe this was a parody of a movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying hard to appear as shouting - focusing on the initiative. <br /> <br /> Blood and gore do not do bad things. I saw that Halloween suits seem more convincing than that. A man who washed his head ... clean, lost bone, meat, blood, and even lost his head. <br /> <br /> With a bullet on the body, a strong down strike should be something ... <br /> <br /> Instead of a corpse, a bat looked like a hell. , but contrary to other parts of the story. What was the man's mind going to get out of that man? If it were a twist, it would be necessary to build at least the mystery and tension.
