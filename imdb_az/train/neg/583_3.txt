I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Bronte's novel when I read it a while ago and usually love the BBC's dramas. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is a very unpleasant thing to me that I did not think it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh more than just a novel. <br /> <br /> First of all, music (and songs) has completely disappeared in a periodic drama (written for a modern-day fear film) and, as another commentator, I was particularly disturbed as the cameras rolled and rolled the players. I have seen some scenes in this "North and South" and everything seems to be there, but the Kirazan is absolutely extreme and just annoying. Camera movements can not move live on board. <br /> <br /> The majority of the latter roles were difficult to distinguish first and the script was not clear. None of the preceding symbols have been properly presented. The little boy had a very good performance, he is very cute and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> ALLEGATIONS The characteristic of Tara Fitzgerald's Helen Graham seemed cold and tough and did not allow any emotion. He does not seem to be really crying. I did not believe Markham could fall into it, and I do not remember the horrible hair I gave her. She could not bear a little patience with her husband! It was fancy to marry such a marriage ... In addition, it was the only main actor to address me. Toby Stephens I just found OK, Helen Graham's brother was very good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with dark subjects such as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, the book is just an admonition to the reader, and what is happening happens with complaining about television adaptation: Huntingdon's eyes can breathe and many scenes can also be general and funny. period drama! Perhaps we can not get enough of these bed scenes in these modern dramas?
