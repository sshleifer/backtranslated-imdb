This film is related to a man escort who participates in a criminal investigation of a powerful man's wife. <br /> <br /> I thought "Walker" would be excited and engaging, but I was wrong. Pacing, with excitement and excessive slowdown, will not happen after 40 minutes of the movie. It can strictly be taken within 10 minutes of the first hour. <br /> <br /> The absence of any excitement or action scenes increases this boredom. Certainly, even argument scenes are so flat and deprived of their emotions. Maybe because of the rigid upper lips of a high class social class? <br /> <br /> Even though Walker is such a powerful cast, it becomes a dull state. Charge the poor area and the worse pacing.
