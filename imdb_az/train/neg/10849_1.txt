When I go to Normal Hollywood Video, I go to B-Horror. The basic principles behind the B-Horror movie are special effects for me, Camping Costs, Heavy Gore, Very Unnecessary Harm and everyone with a corn syrup pack and latex. I leased the coward because I was an admirer of the band because of the first demonstration in 1995. The film began an interesting note, and when she saw Dani Filth discovering an extremely latex mask, LUGHED. When I saw a Lesbian sex scene for a Lesbian sex scene, I LOST ANY HARDER. I was laughing at the whole movie, and I was shocked by the thought that I wanted to shoot a film that seemed to be a multi-million dollar star in a multi-billion dollar budget. For me, all the moments of this movie seemed to involve the children of Hardcore Goth, who thought "Death, Destruction, Sex, Blood, and Satan Lava Lamps." This movie, which took place in 80.5% for this movie, had only a lot of potential and could have been a really good movie, but in the end, "Film" was really an expanded cradle.
