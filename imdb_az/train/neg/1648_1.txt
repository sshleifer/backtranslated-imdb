Personally, if I can really appreciate the good movies, I have a strange ability to enjoy the most strange purple. You know, when you just want to watch some terrifying cookie action movie to sit there and kill your time. This really is the only film that I remember, and I have no intention of completing it. The area was very flawless and could not be predicted, so I would say what the next scene would be easily (and I'm not very good about it). The actors were terrific, and I did better in playing at secondary school. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody forgotten parody.
