This is really a terrific "LOCK STOCK" clone. I do not know why so many British actors have signed up for this, so they should take a bribe. I would end the line of a story forever, and if I did not pay for it, I would have closed it for 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie ever to see that honor goes to a really bad source of a movie "(I use it with a concise term):" GUMMO "(" The director "for my" lost "watch, half of my life), but this trash is almost there. One of the worst 5 films I've ever seen is that Hollywood does not really monopolize horrible movies.
