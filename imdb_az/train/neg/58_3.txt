When an attempt was made to assassin Oktar's cousin, D.C., who had an Arab visit to Washington, survived his life by a cocktail-baker named Sunny Davis. Sunny turns into a national heroic and media element and is offering an award for the Protocol Division of the US Department of State. <br /> <br /> <strong> Located near the border with Saudi Arabia and South Yemen, the Autonomous Region of Afghanistan's rural area indicates Rub El-Khali or Buzz Quarter. In fact, a state will have a population of almost zero and zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film, Ohtar has great strategic value in the Cold War, and those who want to build a military base there, do their best to stay in power. should. The Amir indicates that he has betrayed a charming young woman who rescues her and has contracted with the State Department; their base could be Sunny's most recent addition to her. Sunny's new job is a tool to ensure that Amir has more opportunity to meet with him. <br /> <br /> Well, such a story could have been an event for some hilarious satirists, but in fact, the satirical content of the film is down. It is possible that in 1984, the American people are not in a mood for sharp sellers in their foreign policy; it was a year when Ronald Reagan was forty-nine out of a handful of states in the presidential election, and he was well-off with the Soviet Union with voters. (The film could have been different in a few years, after Iran / Contra case). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> \ Sunny is a typical Goldie character - pretty sweet, temperate, naive and very bright. However, there is only one limitation on how far you can get away with odor and charm and you can not do a good auto-bad movie automatically by making a dumb blush with a leading character. (In fact, it sounds like a recipe for a good movie). Goldie is doing his best to save money, but it's unsuccessful. A part of the goal is a contradictory way of describing its character. On the one hand, Sunny is a sweet, innocent girl from Oregon. On the other hand, she is a 35-year-old woman wearing a suit and working suit. The effect is that Sunnybrook Farm grew up and does not like to imagine Rebecca to work as Bunny Girl <br /> <br /> The most important reason why Goldie can not save this movie is not the best comedian or comedienne his materials and the "Protocol" is simply unfounded. Some women, especially those with yellow and blue eyes, have any humor, based on sensitive stereotypes against Arab men who have all the lusts of Western women. There was something like this in the mid-eighties because it was the time when Ben Kingsley / Nastassia Kinski filmed "Harem" about a dignified Middle Eastern ruler who killed a young American woman and was actually the same story describing the same story mini-series. Film artists realized that their films would not work as a pure comedy, because at the end of the day, Mr Smith was going to become a kind of "going to Washington". Sunny turns into a hometown of political wisdom from a blonde bimbo and Democracy and Constitution and Citizen and Election Citizen's Position and Liberty Price How Does Everlasting Insomnia Begin by Saying Any Kind Of Platitudes? Goldie Hawn, Cactus Flower, Overboard, and some good comedies. "" Married ", but the" Protocol "is not one of them, I have not seen all of their films, but it's the worst I've seen in this challenging comedy.
