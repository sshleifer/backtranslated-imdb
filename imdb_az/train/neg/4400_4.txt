One of Frances Farmer's earliest films; At age 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is a great voice, but not the best of the songs. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interested, but their comedy is probably a great time, and today it's really dark. Roy Rogers also appears in a role-playing role. In my opinion, you need to watch out for a Frances Farmer fan and maybe a Bing Crosby fan.
