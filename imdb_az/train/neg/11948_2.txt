<br /> <br /> How convincing the text is to develop such a loyalty to Bates. It can be harder to play with her, but she still does not help her with her actions. (a relatively strange recent stay in a motel that has not been used recently, a seductive young girl of her past mental problems, a lie about her knives, etc.) Although she is extremely cautious, it can not happen in the same way, they can play an error-identity-murder game. It's also ridiculous: "The soldier who kills is also with him!" <br /> <br /> It was good to see Perkins repeating his famous role, but it was just a little pleasure to have a patch in Hitchcock and do not worry if you do not even intend to try to get closer.
