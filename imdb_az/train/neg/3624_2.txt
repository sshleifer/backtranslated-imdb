I know that for a few dollars I bought GABEA DVD on eBay and I can not say I'm not surprised by this purchase. THE DAY OF BLOOD is one of the dirty European frightening films, with almost no irreplaceable quality except for all the bad reasons. Only the boot fell to the value of the DVD: our heroine, Dr. Ivanna came to the castle, where a scientist who had experimented with dead tissue was supposed to help Baron Dalma. On the way to the castle 1) a person tries to agitate Ivanna. 2) The servant of the castle fights with him. 3) The servant wants his dead. 4) and finally, Baron Dalmar touches him and wants him the next day. Hmm ... one thing says nothing to me. With such a miserable adventure, you thought Ivanna would leave his place in a NY minute, but as a very big bare film, our "proud" hero decided to stay, and even accepts that delicious Baron candlelight dinner. <br /> <br /> But it's a very pleasing thing. <br /> <br /> But this is not fun, it's T there. Ivanna repeatedly goes to bed during bedtime as an unprecedented person is bare, sealed and tortured during the S & M sessions. After spending the night S & M sessions, Ivanna stayed in the castle, believing that the angry Baron had lived in a peaceful manner was nothing but a dream. After awaiting a bad treatment, Ivanna fell in love with Baron. Ivanna does not completely ignore anything negative about Baron, including a clear fact that Baron is famous for young women. Every woman in the castle is in love with an angry champion, who is not afraid of utilizing quite a few things (just visible to women working there). Someone sits around the property and even kills women (and kills) even sillier. Basically, the baron physically outdated brother, Igor, is responsible for everything. In a long time, his brother Baron warns that he will not have much to do with Ivanna or will have consequences. What do Baron and Ivanna do about it? Yes, of course they get married! During a very short wedding ceremony, Baron is shot by an angry native (father of one of the dead girls). All this does not prevent Ivana from torturing all the dead young ladies, but Baron has suffered damage, "this is just a meat wound" and can continue for two and enjoy their honeymoon in the castle, where there is a killer / aggressor / torture brother. Everything is often turned into a sweet triangle between Ivana, Baron and Igor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you get ideas: it's not fine. Almost everything is funny in this movie, and this is not OTT, for example, as a predictable summit, everything is a delight. But for most filmmakers, the filmmaker or writer accuses each other of a complicated hell. I really like these movies, everything is slimmer and slim and humorous characters. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD do it, and when we go to the scene selection section, we've heard one of the most conversational dubbing movies. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are beautiful. These candles and red windows are opening and closing loans ... it is a class soup. Music sometimes sounds like something from Tim Burton's movie. <br /> <br /> According to the custom of these films, when young women pick up their clothes, they beg not only to be killed. <br /> <br /> As a standard movie, I appreciate this 2, but it's too bad, it's good, it's a 8 star rating, you can watch this page if you enjoy nude movies. There was only one thing to think about: what would she get to get that strange castle?
