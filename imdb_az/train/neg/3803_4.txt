The film appears to be discriminatory and generally poorly written. Scenarios act as if they were written by 10 different people, and none of them communicate with each other. As you can imagine, they want to make a page from a Miracle on a 34th Street (original) movie, but the film is so poorly executed. This movie is for many young people and even those who scripted it will see nothing about baseball. As follows: <br /> When angels are dead in the last place, the owner is not careful nor is his head concerned worrying that he is fighting with his broom? THEM? or PUNCHED the team game by the game spokesman on a live TV. However, when the team divides in a Division game, it bends over a story (sourced by 6 year olds) that gets help from a child assistant who claims to see the real angels. What sounds bad? The loss of control team lost by the team in 15 consecutive terms? Or a minimal eccentric runner who works on and off the playoffs that help children? The owner's reaction does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> During the press conference, Maggie and his "click land" talked to change their minds. <br /> <br /> The angels will play for White Sox in the final weekend, but at the end of the game they say the player will say, FINANCING person can not decide if he can not win the LEAGUE championship. <br /> <br /> <strong > News> DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is said to be throwing 156 pitchs at the ninth shot, playing a ball scored down. <br /> <br /> At the end of the angel with the word "AL" he says, "The championships themselves have to win," though he and his angels manipulate and correct it. plays in the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> Like other examples where the story is, I can continue. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years), this movie may be entertaining. Is it too bad? It could have been a classic. This is a mistake and an eternal UHF / cable is an unforgettable confusion that can survive as a Saturday night discharge.
