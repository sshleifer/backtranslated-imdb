This is a movement of the West. James Steart plays a great all-star role in the north-west of the scenery. Decoration and dresses are great. There is movement and adventure. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a wealthy rabbi who protects a curfew in the former Nothwest Province. <br /> <br /> The key shortcomings are the stereotypic kinship that Hollywood has always been heroic. Although it was a film, it was a stereotypical hero, and a Stewart portrait really has little to do. <br /> <br /> However, it is very appealing to anyone, it's really hard to care for, or it's very important for her. Accept it. <br /> <br /> Even small characters are still nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others.
