Although Bartleby is a terrific product, although the other reviewer has left it because it is "inconvenient", on the contrary, this version does not keep the spirit of the book. This is a painful story that tells the story. While watching this, I can not be very entertaining when I turn my pages into my book and deal with an adaptation. On the contrary, look at Bartleby's 2001 version with Crispin Glover. This version, though romantic, brings new details to the movie while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What's important is not the soul, structure, character names and minutiae suits. The difference between this version of the movie is day and night, exhausting and delightful. This version is something that can go wrong if a fit is considered weak, painful, mental-numbing chocolate.
