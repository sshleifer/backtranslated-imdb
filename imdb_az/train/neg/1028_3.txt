Like Justin Timberlake's "Edison," I do not remember the last time I reacted emotionally to the performance. I was so excited that I had to scream in pain, to destroy the screen, and to accept the hopeless pain of Nihilism. Timberlake is over-misleading; In fact, knocking Andy Dick like casting as Patton or Nathan Lane played a leading role in playing Jesus. Simply Timberlake was just a bad player and would be equally scary in any role. I've had problems with Ben Affleck's acting skills, but it looks like Timberlake Affleck is Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. Emotional expressions, such as his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), and his "25 Cliché actors", poison the screens that he brutally gave and how do I sneer it, as a fighter devoted to an unfair justice journalist and will not take its role. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake is not responsible only for its failure. Director David J. Burke puts it aside (not only) but Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and I (as good as myself). LL Cool J <br /> <br /> I'm having a physical disability that says part of this film is encountered by Timberlake. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, one of these actors, of course, does not have any interaction with Justin,. A pleasure, if any. Freeman and Spacey can not only have more than 10 minutes of display time, but ten minutes are different from their scenes with our heroes. Dylan McDermott is a fresh air breath. <br /> <br /> But enough Timberlake bashing - words in this particular case are not enough to make the words. "Edison" is a very, very, very corrupt story. This is just a piece of cliché that is immoral. Nevertheless, I love the motivation behind this moment when commenting on "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or perhaps even "Chinatown". Do not get me wrong - Edison is not exactly the same ballpark in these films, but I can continue to stop the faith so as to justify my existence to justify my residence. <br /> <br /> The scenario writes itself and some awesome bad articles. Yes, there are some good links, but the conversation between Piper Perabo and Timberlake seems to have been raised straight from Dawson's Creek episode. This is a typical thing for you, really, the audience-with-how-good-we-expression (and failure) dialogue. This dialogue is emphasized with great music at times of thought - sometimes "Edison" wants to turn the scene into a non-coherent music video, but with precision music and option film speed (read slow motion). <br /> <br /> Think about it, Edison is an interest. There is a shot to kill the hell, but it is simply condemned by Timberlake for failing to perform. In a movie like most art, if something off, all the stuff feels off. Directors should make a difficult choice. David J. Burke missed this place. Some of the scenes are good and well-behaved, but generally they do not look like puzzle pieces from different puzzles that are forced into the images that are not compatible with each other. And it's not an exciting puzzle, especially starting.
