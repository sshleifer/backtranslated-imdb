I think that my favorite part of this film, a film that sings the meaningless, foolish and convincing process, is at the top of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unwelcome friend, Sheriff, have finally slipped into the opening of some staircases at a melt plant. Considering that Nelson will examine the MM for nearly all films and that MM has killed and ate several people at this point (including its director), Nelson knows very well that he is open to a violent man and man. meat and blood. <br /> <br /> So, Sheriff's weapon is pointing to the MM, and I give the movie and Rick Baker's props for this movie, the most disgusting and horrible object in human form. was seen. And Dr. TED Nelson asks a very important question: "WHAT DO YOU THINK? What Should We Do?"? <br /> <br /> DOCTOR TED NELSON has cut a camera and does not know what Ted will do next. Apparently, Ted had such an intention to find a melt-man, he never had any restrictive devices, a lasso or a stitjacket, or a net or a few transhilizers, or a new age tape by Vangelis, > <br /> So, the sheriff's panic and shoots, the merry-looking man, and the disgust. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, NASA's Space Shuttle program explains that it's bent around the subfield for the past 30 years, just like everybody else, instead of going to Mars every month or Mars. they do. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, this is a bad, lazy writing and direction that sharpened every aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also diminish the foolishness of the process: There is a lumpiest scene. Couples living around the world want to split the lemons in one territory, only to break apart by the melt-man. This scene is rare in the 1970s. I can ensure that you never look at a more meaningless and irritating structure with people watching the scene. And the mourning Adam's attacks on women living in the house oppose every attempt by the horses to capture the walls. (BTW, the famous director Jonathon Demme, who went on the stage to go home and never left). The only thing that kept the actress from shaving just like chewing was the horses, as the horses said. We have to follow the desires of at least two minutes longer than any SANE director will continue to shoot. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning was forced to quit the IMC director and photographer. I remember her here, she looked better than the work here - I do not remember the idea of ​​an old man, but a solid and surprising old Columbo episode. But no one can be baseless in life, just as no one can guide his director here. <br /> <br /> Everyone is a bit better than other elderly couples (and shut, I know they laugh, but do not laugh), but not much. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the category of movie disasters, 'you can not be too bad.' Still looking at over 70 other 80's and 80's abortions before watching ("The Moonbeast" and "The Night By Lives") and the MST's coverage is so fun, so if you have a chance, MST version.
