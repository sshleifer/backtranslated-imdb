For a while, I've had something for this Kari Chicken and no complaints until I look at this movie. But after capturing UPDATE night last night, I'm sure there is something in the film that is not standard. The scenario is terrible, the action is terrible, the direction is terrible. I saw another statement commenting on how great the sex scenes are ... what? Not worth it. Although it's a movie that's bad, you can just turn softcore porn, but instead see some of my pasty white dude tell me to stop me from nothing else to sell me to see Wuhrer's body and scenes. The film should only go to the cinema, as the film has not been spent all the time, but not. This horrible scenario could not capitalize on Wuhrer's appearance because he is the only supporter of the film. 2/10, because it looked very hot.
