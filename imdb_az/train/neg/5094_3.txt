This movie sucked. Imagine, scenarios were asked, and the movie was generally sucked. <br /> <br /> There were two issues that were not developed in the film and had to do a little to understand what the audience was doing. <br /> <br /> I say that I have written it, but you see things happening suddenly and are talked about as if you were a little clue about what happened. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative comments about hero Hero. The viewer does not know anything about the man and never shows how his fiancee is dead. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is a scene with loads of machine-guns and machine guns, and you'll see all of them before you cut them off. to other scenes. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we did not feel like we did not want to go back because we gave 3. While watching the movie, the movie was fun for a bad mouth, so at least it gave us some fun. ;-)
