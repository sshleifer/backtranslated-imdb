I did not like this movie, but after a lot of "masterpiece", I did not think much of the book, I found it in a characteristic, complex and incompatible character. <br /> <br /> The first involvement of Fante's "Los Angeles Road" is not readable until Fanteus became fashionable until mid-80s. <br /> <br /> Towne was curious to see what soup was with such trivial ingredients. He has worked hard to write a lot of the book's shortcomings, but his money did not save him. There was never a film asking for dust while trying to stay loyal to the book. <br /> <br /> The city's tragedy I think of this movie. <br /> <br /> In a word: unforgettable.
