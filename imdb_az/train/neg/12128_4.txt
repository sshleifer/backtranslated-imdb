It's a strange look at the half of the movie, which means watching the weird Italian horror! As you can see, the famous knife Lucio Fulci did not just create this movie, and he (and more easily traced) "The Cats in the Brain" received the freedom to re-use the most sadistic killings. The opening scene where a prostitute is severely cut off by the ax is similar to Fulci's next film and some of the fraudulent killings and sleaz moments. "Massacre" is unsuccessful because Andrea Bianchi's "Massesacre" is a sadistic murderer among a film crew who threw a horrible film, but it's a charming and durable but cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. This incompatible script presents many defective characters with all potential maniacs, but Biachi does not approve of any of the red purple and you can almost instantly see the murder. Anything that continues to enjoy is really terrifying makeup effects and the horrible horrible activities of the ensemble. Whenever blood sheds on the screen, as in the case of the first and second offenses, the massacre is as slow and almost unbearable as dialogues and explains photographs in detail. Fortunately, in the second half of the day, women are stabbed several times with stainless steel nails and women. Music is bent and the use of shooting places is very senseless. My advice would skip this puppy and go for the "Cat in Brain" mentioned above. Here is the greatest moment of the Massacre, and then some.
