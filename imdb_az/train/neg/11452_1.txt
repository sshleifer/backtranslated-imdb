If I could score this movie by 0! I see several ppl on the IMDb, the funniest movie of the year and so on. Forgive me? LSD or ........? Nothing about this movie is strange. I really wanted to take 27 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> If I read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie after 30 minutes, I would totally understand that I would watch a snake on a plane instead of watching this movie once in 2 times! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, do something useful with your life, eat it, go crazy, go into hell ... something better than spending time with TV watching a hot tub.
