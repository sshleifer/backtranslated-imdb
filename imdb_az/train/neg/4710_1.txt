My brother loves this show, that's right. I'm totally agree with people who say they were dropped out of Dexter's lab and pretty strange parents. <br /> <br /> Some things made me laugh, but I almost did not like very strange parents, but most of them are obviously hookahs and not really cute. This is about the Johnny Test. Besides, nothing laughs at the show. Gags is so foolish and meaningless, and to tell the truth, maybe not just me, but the kids are not such a dress! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but c'Mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter Labas, used to be one of my favorite shows, and I still did not expect it. <br /> <br /> <strong> Johnny Test's absolute JOKE outburst from this beautiful show hurt me and embarrasses me. <br /> <br /> Another thing. Articles Dog. That's it. So that. It's annoying. He is higher and surprising than Johnny! And gay flow? What a fudge! I hate this dog and I hope he will die. Because the children would be better off hearing and watching the shouting and watching of this show, as if they were an emphasis. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it if you do not want to burn miracles and watch your eyes off the show!
