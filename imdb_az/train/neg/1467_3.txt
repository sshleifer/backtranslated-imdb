Naturally, the historian Ian Kershav, who was the author of the first paper, a scientific adviser to this television movie, drove away from him. Film history is very wrong. When Hitler's father, Alois died at home, the mistakes began immediately, in fact he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, but actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on forever. The Hitler's path of childhood and youth is very briefly described, making it difficult for those unreformed people to understand the nature of this nervous neurotic man. Significant people in the early part of the party, such as Hitler's father-friend Dietrich Eckart or the party's "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, have completely disappeared. Characterization of Ernst Hanfstaenglin is very problematic. In the film, he is described as a noble character that hides Hitler. The scenario obviously explicitly explains Hanfstaenglin himself, in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was anti-Semitic and was crazy about his "FÃ¼hrer". But the biggest problem of the film is Hitler's illustration. He is always described as a person who is hostile, destroys, does not have the attraction, and orders all around. After watching the movie, it is a miracle that such an abusive person can not get any trace. As we all know, Hitler was a bad criminal, naturally, not every writer wants to show the writer Hitler absolutely disgusting and uncharismatic. Facts can be very attractive and entertaining, individually. His companions did not follow him, for he always shouted at them, but because he loved this strange man. Apart from all these historical errors, the movie is well-prepared, the actors give a convincing impression of the era of the first class, space-throwing and production design.
