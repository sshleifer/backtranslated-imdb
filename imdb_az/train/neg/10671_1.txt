MST 3000 should do this movie. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, the rifle has no bank account and history after leaving the army in 1993 and pays its rental fee in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person will not be allowed to be close to the president to avoid a high-level job. Also, the head of safety for POTHUS will not be emotionally absorbed when he's hit by the president. This movie sucked. I can not express the extremity of this film. Each player was terrified. Chicken even in the trader's park. I'm bent down from this rubbish. When is the time lost?
