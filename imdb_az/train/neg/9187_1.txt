In the past I watched a few poor movies, but what did hell think when they created this film? <br /> <br /> I am an admirer of many genres, and I enjoy it, because when the production team comes to the idea of ​​becoming zombies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was more unhappy than video shooting, so they gave me one finger, and I leased it to them. <br /> <br /> <strong> In movies there was a second movie to watch for rebuilding some of my beliefs. <br /> <br /> Comic book guy who said "The worst movie" would be right!
