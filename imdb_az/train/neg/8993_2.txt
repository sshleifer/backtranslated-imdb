When I first saw it in the 70's, I was in high school. It was cool at that time. Now, as adults, I'm looking at him and telling myself. How funny is it? There are moments, but they are few and far. So jokes do not stop. Show it to a smaller crowd and we've completely lost it. If you love this kind of humor, you can ask for Kentucky Fried Movie or Ayazadan Women in Amazon. The Tunnel Vision and Groove Tube are also very dated for today's look.
