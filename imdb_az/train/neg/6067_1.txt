They are not here and John Carpenter is not a master. Period. And no trite analysis of the easy public comment here will change. Sometimes there was nothing but the director of Carpenter B, but at least "Sis" and "The Thing" had a terrific atmosphere (one of my favorite ones). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting.

Perfectly flat that can be like a human wallpaper. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And the father who cares for his pregnant daughter has a dad who travels like a lover.
