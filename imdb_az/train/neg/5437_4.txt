Based on Michael Shabo's novel, Pittsburgh's secrets are the youngest son of a notorious gangster who spent the teenage summer running around with two friends. This year is 1983 and is at the intersection of Young Arts Bechstein (Jon Foster). He intends to become an Art stockbroker that is completely opposed to his father's lifestyle. Beautiful hip feels like an all-film director with painful attempts to create an indie cinematography - his previous efforts, although Dodgeball is funny, is a clear trade - gathering aspects of other indie films, but with Mena, like Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many other premieres in Sundance this year, it was felt like a project sponsored by a secret studio to help the filmmaker win indie relief points - in that regard he failed and he was a movie.
