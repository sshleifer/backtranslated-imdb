"Creepshow 2" is less than the pseudonym of the original made with a small purpose, except for giving the money to the name of the previous film. Even further strengthens the defects of the predecessor. Still, for the first time around, it was quite exciting for its periodic pins, it was uneven, but overall it made a pretty entertaining effort. Then there are a few valuable moments, so the story's transparency is clearer. <br /> <br /> For the first time, he provides, but often he will stay there. <br /> <br /> As in fact, all stories turn into a general revenge and only to desserts. A wooden Hindu comes to life by taking revenge on the owner's murder. Young people are devoured by a water monster. It rotates to take a car from a dead car to a car. None of these buildings are bad in themselves, but they are completely inspired. There are a few surprises and no fear. An example of this is a textbook for creating non-standard, literary films. This cheap-looking film suffers from a direct directorship, but despite being honest, there's little to do. In the end, the second story is good, but not much. <br /> <br /> In most parts, speeches are good. George Kennedy, like a lost general store owner, does not work fairly, is not particularly inspirational. On the other hand, Dorothy Lamour, as a guilty tool, is pretty good, despite its predictable, unnecessary material, its position. However, most of the characters are very kind. <br /> <br /> I think Creepshow 2 would be better. Actually, George Romero returned to the scenario by taking more of the story of King Stephen. Make-up artist Tom Savini is a good, strange work. So why is the movie an anger? I guess Romero really did not want to make a second movie, but for financial reasons, he had to do it. It is inevitable that the horror's continuity, clones, rip-offs and already ten years were. I can imagine the guy who wrote the scenario with haste, money, and running. I think that you need to do what you can to fund your own project; <br /> <br /> <strong> "New World" has been released
