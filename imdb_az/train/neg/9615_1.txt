Apparently, he did not give up this adaptation. He did not just leave the plot, he organized himself! He chose to abandon the most important parts of the novel because I was dissatisfied with what he wanted to leave. The land was confused, impartial and desperate to say the least. I do not want to say anything significant about actors, but can not move! Dickens certainly is hard, but that's a ghost! Micawber had much to do with Kramer in the middle of the nineteenth century and less like Betsy Trotwood! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the beautiful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the script writer, I think he reads Cliff's notes!
