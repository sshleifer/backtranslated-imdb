Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good about this crap festival. Randolph Scott is a secret homosexual who has been living with her boyfriend Cary Grant for twelve years, the most commonly played and dull. At the age of 57 he was too old for these romantic roles, though it is not so important, because Gail Russell is over 31 years old and is much nasty because of his chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual cruel role, but it's not enough to keep the garbage. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
