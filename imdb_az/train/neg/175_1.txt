I watched the cabin this afternoon in the United States. This movie was interesting enough to watch later, considering that it was prepared for television. So I am adjusted to ventilate this evening and was very disappointed. I knew I would not want a movie, but I did not expect to be surprised by the use of the DV (digital video). The film would be tolerated if it were not for any such unprecedented digital photography. I've been thinking about dealing with this line of arguments, but there is no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE CONTRIBUTION IS EXPECTED!) The open end in the lake was acceptable, but later the open end was ridiculous. When I watch the movie, we can advance to the return of the lake to the Cabin.
