This is a perfect example of a great book that will be damaged by a movie. Jacob loved me so much that I was the worst movie I ever saw. There is no storyline, no fields are scarce and editing. To overcome all of this, the music sounds a plain synthesizer and incredibly terrifying. Bridget Fonda's player deserves to be, but everyone is absolutely amateur. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to read this film as a producer to avoid producing a movie, because it is packed with bad scenes, bad transitions and actions that need to be repeated! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
