What are the people here? I have never seen a film different from you. I went to the theater and I was very bored. What are these things? It only laughs once, it's not even difficult. Those who want to make this film green should be thrown into the street and be beaten. I usually find something I love in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" is another "teenage film" like the classic. All the trash, such as "Body Multipliers", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory," is always one of the worst. Avoid at all costs! Like the theater they did not want to apologize, I thought the studio would give the money to people, but that did not happen. As you can see, I will not be able to earn money for that or two hours.
