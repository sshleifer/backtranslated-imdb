This early Adam Sandler movie is a comic way to compare his life in the same period of 1989. The stealthy comic genius of his character and the constant confirmation of the disappointment of humor matter come from Sandler's scripts. The film is nothing compared to films like Big Daddy or Spider Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express his character in a similar, consistent, successful and funny way when he was preparing the film. Most of the "jokes" of the movie are talking to Sandler himself, usually unrecognizable with comic talent and beating himself, so ugly and can not get a woman. The film itself is difficult to watch because it does not see itself as a real film. Sandler talked about the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the low budget or suspicious content of the movie. The film is difficult at last and it is embarrassing to watch. I immediately forgot that after the end of this movie I saw that Sandler would destroy his career if I knew more. This video goes through the store, I rented it for free and it's still a waste of time.
