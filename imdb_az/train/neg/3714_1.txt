The film was rewritten in 1978 by Warren Beatty, "Heaven Can Wait", but Mr. Rockun's stand was written for comedy style. The presentation remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken to the beginning of his life, and God's representative does something to return to the earth as another. As in the Beatty movie; chooses Charles Wellington, who was killed because of the bizarre Sontee Jenkins (Regina King), who wanted to open at Wellington's house during her murder. The role of Ms Wellington and his lover does not just work out of these arrangements and a black comedy that does not want Sontee to turn into an aging white millionaire. The intercuts used to display Rock as Wellington, and then real, like "white" Wellington, fail. The improvements could have been given to the original Beatty area - he did not describe the idea of ​​posthumous death - but was not found at Down To Earth.
