DR. SEUSS 'THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (Four) <br /> <br /> If you are to inspire seasonal spirits and traditional Dr. If you want to see a festive film that will continue Seuss classic worship, "Dr. Seuss," I do not see how Grinchin surprises Christmas. "If you are older enough to read this review, it is most likely to enjoy this movie, many colors, creative design and creative set and costume structure, funny noise and symbols to look like the real inhabitants of the so-called village Whoville Unfortunately, the positive elements of the movie have come to an end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many people know this story, Dr. Seuss vision that does not understand the shouts and development of the development, the Whoville Festival, and Kim's pillage from Christmas. There are many familiar names but there are people who do not know. "Just like in Battlefield Earth, I do not see producers hiring expensive actors just because they protect their identities with makeup and costumes. SNL's Molly Shannon, Bill Irwin's wife, Betty Lou, Lou Lou, later played by Taylor Momsen, a younger Cindy Lou father. Jeffrey Tambor, Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins, gives a quiet voice to the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski Grinchin is just the lover of the missing. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers pay much attention to small Cindy Lou, adding unnecessary subplots. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman's scenario feels like going around the film; director Howard Howard and the screenwriter are very small in the spotlight, are very advanced, very large and flawless. The only character given here is Grinch, the other characters are scouts, pictures, and uninteresting. And the dialogue is superficial and very fragile. Example-Grinch: Oh, Kim-humanity! <br /> <br /> The talent behind the film comes from the talented designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack and the extensive makeup department. "How Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very beautiful look. The sets created by the filmmakers and the atmosphere are detailed and creative; a visitor to a world as a dream. The people of Whoville have come to the point where we can not read humorous lines that are plastered with makeup. <br /> <br /> <strong> An actor who can talk about Jim Carrey. His performance almost destroyed the film itself. He is very egoist like Grus, very exaggerated, and funny to make sure the story is somewhere that can be recognized as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, there are some funny moments in a few clever sequences, but Jim Carry's staggering indestructibility is no laugh. Almost part of the movie was written specifically for overplay for Carry. <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the synchronized coffin. <br /> <br /> The late writer could have beaten Dr. Seuss in his grave. <br /> <br />
