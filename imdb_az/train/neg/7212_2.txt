Why does every horror director want to imitate Exorcist? As William Friedky's "classic" is a very overrated movie, in my opinion all this is not intense or shocking. And still a clean crush, this time Spanish is a shame that repeats the story of a young girl who has clean filth and reverts to her family. Paul Naschy (here I have to admit here is pretty hot here) is a glorious priest approaching by John Gibson, because his sister Leyla's behavior has changed much more than she met a new comrade. At first, the priest did not believe in it, but when John's body wrapped around his neck, Leyla's devil behavior became even more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is just too inadequate, which is also an insufficient drilling film! Here, Nashi and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to expose abuse on religious issues with a shocking, gloomy, and ultimately a flawless and flawless drama that would make you sleep! The last twenty minutes are foolish but contain some moments of atmospheric moments, and women's nakedness and sleazy are very chic. The absence of the budget is not a real pretext, as Paul Naski has already proven that he has enough imagination for the lack of money. This is just a horrible movie, the end of the story. Other European "The Excorcist" rip-off "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they also suck!
