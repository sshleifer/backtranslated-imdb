<br /> <br /> As you can see from the general character of these comments, the movie has some stunning animation (when I look at the blu ray) is really inevitable of any real depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters are boring. Agito, Tool and the main antagonist Shunack has a kind of point about the state of Laputa. But maybe my mind was weakened and this was a desirable thought (Laputa was my favorite anim√©m, the original Engilsh dub). Heroes are also not really happy, and as mentioned in another record, they soon fall in love, Ago loves the old jealousy and rejection of the old rough Mink (he did not forget it). Nevertheless, the Tool does not give any explanation for the change of heart except for the one who will eventually become a little more "happy" in the end. <br /> <br /> There is no serious explanation. Indeed, who are the druids? Do people exist? and who are strange women / girls who seem like to be with them and manage the forest? There is nothing that explains why they are there and how powerful it can be for regular people. Plants coming from the month still do not fill the gaps. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is a strange version of the Day of the Stands. <br /> <br /> I would like to love this movie, but I have never found a place like Shell, a movie like Ghost, or a real character like that of Miyazaki. I'm not complaining about watching him, but I did not buy it, so I'm doing it. My advice? Give it a way to keep a few hours of spare, but let's get a loan or get cheaper! Probably new to your animated movies and if you do not have enough of them. Of course, it is visual pleasure.
