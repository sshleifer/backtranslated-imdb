Can a picture of fake scenery be corrupted? You will not think so, but it's actually here for me. Listen, there are many movies in the classic era and even know what's happening, even if the drivers drive steering wheel in front of a screen, and so on. As I know. However, most of these hockey jobs are related to action scenes. Fraudulent mountains and flowers shot after being shot as seen in "Brigadoon" for fake scenery are a bit offensive. <br /> <br /> Music is fun, it's always subjective. It could be that a man likes the songs he loves and that he is not a big part of another movie (he loves someone's songs). The songs, dances, romances and symbols of the 1950s could have explode this movie, but it was in the 50's and many people loved it. The musicians did very well in the '50s. I liked the great tapas of the 30s and 40s. It was in the '50s, and these were new things - it was. Is this a bad movie? No. Not only did I have a negative impact on many things. <br /> <br /> Despite being a good player, good director and high expectations, this movie was bombed at the cash register and with me. I really like it, it's a betrayal of myself and a good part of this story. I am not a cynical type and beautiful people and nice people who feel wonderful about me. Why can not I contact this movie? Part of it was a dance. I'm not interested in things that change the tap dance on the screen. But not - this thing really turned me into this stage. Scotland was not a mountainous area, it was just a hockey-looking warranty, and it almost turned from start to finish. Find a point for today's realism where they are often "on the ground."
