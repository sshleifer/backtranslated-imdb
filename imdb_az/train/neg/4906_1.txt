I do not know how to get started well. Obviously, it was prepared for this television movie, so my expectations were low. I was very surprised by the general trend of the second hour, but it seemed like a dye with some type of movie before or after. <br /> <br /> And talk about the worst chemistry among shouldebear lovebird detectives. <br /> <br /> I go deeper, but this movie is not really worthy. Rank: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
