It's a bad job. Bad fun, bad music, bad scenario, bad edit, bad attitude and bad idea. The chocolate pieces did not come to anything more than that, or to the desires. Why did you worry about the film before the end of the movie? Poor Malcolm McDowell, was that money or something short? Do you still think of it? * CLAIMS AHOY *: From the moment you see cyborg town called Cytown, you will not die in the first thirty minutes. Take away my friends from this movie. Avoid it.
