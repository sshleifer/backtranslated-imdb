I will admit that I did not give this movie much. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> In the early 70's, Manhattan's scenes look very good, like a leading actress. This is a very strange black and white, almost the film can feel impartial and fresh. However, some of the other ways in the film industry are putting this prospect into hell. Separate editing is the end of the 60s between the very reality and the new wave. <br /> <br /> This film is felt in many places at a time when free love idealism and cultural experience are present. <br /> <br /> In the film she is looking for a man with an anonymous phone, with sex. When he encounters other strange characters, he opens his quirks and reveals himself. The film is intended as an unusual comedy, but adds an avant-garde feeling. If you love Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover the phonebook. <br /> <br /> I have some problems: A close-up of the movie ends with an anecdote of friction that has been going on for some time. more than twelve minutes - it is cruel to sit. Also, there is a very clear animation sequence that I find in the movie's top and most popular names. I was laughing four or five times loud and did not like the last one (a peculiar disgusting animation). When the movie was shifted to the last phone booth-night sequence, it really liked it better. If I were a bit different, it really was one of the things I really liked. But cinematographers gave us this. Protecting from the challenges, craftsmanship, and the road, but none of them gives advice. I did not find it as compelling and ambitious as unique and creative.
