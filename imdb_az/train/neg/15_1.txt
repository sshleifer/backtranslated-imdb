That's it. This is one. This is the worst movie ever. Ever. Everything eats. I did not look worse. <br /> <br /> Even after three days they have been watching (for some reason I still do not) why do not I believe people? This movie was terrible. Its so bad. <br /> <br /> This is a movie, a story, or anything that has never been created or something that can be considered as something that can be brought to our existence. <br /> This makes me really good people in this world. I'm not surprised at ourselves and our progress as a kind of universe. Such films are a frustrating society. We should be ashamed. In fact, our global responsibility, such as people living here and creating art, is to prevent us from bringing these great distortions to our own. That's embarrassing. I do not know when lying at night because they know they're playing a role in being "loaded" from these actors, writers or film directors around the world. <br /> <br /> Behold, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. <br /> <br /> But this ....... this is a whole new dimension to the "bad" line. This is an unusual filth. It's a mistake you know of everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence of events; <br /> <br /> Every cheese-making "effect" is used up to a recurring disease point of shame. I really do not want to see the "horrific" camera's "dragging on a drug", or it can squint or cut the cut or cut it down before cutting any tail. <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, I state that I'm special here, but the most different thing about this film is the production. said that a bit of a decent amount of money was actually thrown into this nap. <br /> <br /> If I see him personally, I'll take the director's shoulders, if I take him home, if I want him to run two minutes or Drain-O, or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> While we are in need of a new humanitarian torture trait for war prisoners abroad, it repeats the film repeatedly and repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are the most offensive of all of our society. Please. Stop. IT'S.
