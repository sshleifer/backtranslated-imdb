What has lost time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing and thinking about the preview, it could be "funny". Lying! This movie is about 90 minutes away. Players are in a bad writing scenario and can not get out. These jokes are weak and brighter, and can even take back any part of this movie without seeing Wilson's bare back. Special effects are not ...... I was looking forward to watching the hawk and wings of Uma's flying scenes. When people could not influence the flying and battlefields of the super hero at a speed that faster than speed, they hid the effects in a pretty good way. Wilson was just an excuse for a sidekicki person, and there was no chemistry with Wilson or Uma or an office worker. Sex scenes are not sexy and funny scenes are not funny. I think most of these actors are waiting for it. None of the heroes were really sympathetic, so I ended up despite the flying figure of none. Only memorable performances, Bedlam and G-Girl were children playing as teenagers - at least they had a few chemistry. Generally, a super stinko movie - I do not even recommend it as a rental - it will still be spent on the money!
