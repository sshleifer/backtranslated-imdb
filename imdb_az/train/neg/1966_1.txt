After reading a positive review from another website, I was forced to see this movie and the guy was p.o'd! I took at least 15 minutes to get a b / c cabinet that nobody wanted to see. then to use real money to build a community for 10 minutes and vice versa. I thought that my stress would pay when I came home and that when I watched the film, the research I was reading was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! After the first hour of the movie, you can succeed! b / c is not up to a horror of the movie. do not worry with this nation, watch it better "dankness falls"
