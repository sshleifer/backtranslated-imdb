I just sat at GenCon because it was calm and I could snooze it. When is the time lost? Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? <br /> <br /> Does Flo and Abe Vigoda deal with women? <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's a nasty piece of garbage. The heroes in my opinion were meaningless (I think ...) and were wooden, the majority seemed to be in the autopilot. <br /> <br /> "Hilarious" stories about the events that took place after a couple of days after my husband's marriage were crying for the writers. <br /> Seriously. I'll only give you 2 out of 3 because you have to be 2 or 1 for five hours or more to meet Kelly LeBrock.
