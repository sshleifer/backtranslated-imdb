An incredibly crazy, closed and extremely thrilling ("horses, oh my God, horses!") Thriller. Sometimes it is creepy, but has one of the worst scripts written for any fear film. In the last 10 minutes you can see exactly what everyone is doing to "magic" part of the "resolution". Typically, complicated speeches by eccentric results by Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real hack job, cutting half the scenes and making the film even more difficult. 4 out of 4 children.
