It is a good movie for children who love dogs. It works slower, but if it ends, De Vil goes to Vilayat. The main area is identical to the first film. For adults, the bright side of the film is a bird that feels that it is a dog. Bird speaks as a human being (Erik Monty Python Space) and a dog bark. The film needs more comedy. See the text in order to pay full price or wait for Disney to appear.
