The third part of the Carnosaur trilogy resembles a high quality military commandos of Keystone Kops, who tried to kill two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I resemble the four dinosaurs' profits and their proximity. The film is definitely not the worst trilogy ever taken seriously. But when I'm watching this movie, I'm not even more important, but I do not feel some interesting parallels between the trilogies "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first installment in both francs is a dark, uncomfortable film that has become a classic religion, the second is "foreign" ripoff, and the third is a tongue-cheek laughs almost on a slap on the earth. Also, like "Xtro" franchise, all the "Carnosaur" films are not completely interconnected. They are just "franchisees." It's clear that Carnosaur and Xtro have two different production groups here, but when you see three of the two franchises, you're back and forth between them.
