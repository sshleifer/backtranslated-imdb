San Francisco is a big city with great players. Filmmakers in this film did not try to use the city. They did not control the very foundation of real details. So I do not recommend anyone based on the San Francisco movie. Do not think, "Oh, I was there", "do you think the two-storey firetrap / stinky pear is a lobby of a quiet hotel?" Some areas used speech styles and influences on the East Coast. <br /> <br /> The arrests seemed at least in three different ways at first. The story of Chinatown was most impressive and interesting. The scene is a scene from a weak, classic Hong Kong action movie scene. Originals had more tensions and emotional resonance, they were framed and fell to a better place. But the toy is entertaining and we see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The white boy did not start the intro. In my opinion, the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they made a part of it and left it. His father is a harassment attempt on a Berkeley liberal - indeed, the nation knows everyone is not groovy to live in the ghetto - but its segments are the most sparrow. They did some good things. Educated and excited in the West Coast, where a slight jolt is a different kind of pressure than anything in New York. They are equally unbearable, but always different. It would be interesting; it was not. <br /> <br /> Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing. For this purpose, the most descendant and stylist was far from San Francisco. It has been seen before and seen better. Even the video game was even better! <br /> <br /> Despite the global non-locality and intentional scripts, these characters have the potential, the actors have talent, and an interesting thing, about 10 minutes before the latter, begins to force the way in an unusual way. Good understanding was placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, here's a missing minority, check who can guess.
