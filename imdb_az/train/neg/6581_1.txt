I rented the "New Best Friend", hoping for a movie similar to the unpleasant teenage thrillers like "Gossip" and "Curve". Instead, the "New Best Friend" is no more exciting than the "The Crowd", and the player is incredibly fake. The "New Best Friend" is boring and the events taking place in the movie are identical. Skip this movie ... time loss.
