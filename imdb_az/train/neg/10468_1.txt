I do not know what the film expects. Yes, I know now. It was a really terrible movie. Scenario, directorship and actions were equally bad. The story was meaningless and stupid. The director could have taken a smart and thoughtful film, but he did not. In the last half of the film, I was sorry for my seat because it was very bad. What was the focus on the film? Where's that movie? Instead of encouraging this movie, Christians should boycott this movie. She was a chest and my money was gone. Do not watch this movie.
