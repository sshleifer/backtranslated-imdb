For 15 years, I've been a fan of Bill Maher, but this movie was disappointing and sometimes disgusting. Of course, I have come from a Catholic, well-educated family, and go to the community with my own will, perhaps with some of Bill's ideas. <br /> <br /> Bill's problem is that religion is equally negative. It is right to document his sociological aspects, that is, faith connects one's own feasts and says that he has never looked at the positive side of religions (or rather, men's terrible appeals of God's last and undeniable reputation). Clearly, I think Bill never freezes Hell before making himself modest, and goes to the Kalkutta peak, which works with Ana Therese's poorest people. She was, of course, dead, but she could easily visit the Jesuit family in Barsta LA. They manage Homeboy Industries. He combines with young men, typically working with crime and detention, to combine career skills, raise their tattoos, or learn from the world's best theaters, diplomats, and investment bankers to integrate ethically the global capital markets into the world's poorest countries. and hence can apply to the USC Advanced Catholic Studies Institute to improve standards. Half of the world's people live less than $ 1 a day. Of course, he will not do it, because he requires a review of evidence that is inconsistent with his ideas about religion, and it is easier to maintain sniper and surface jokes. <br /> <br /> Bill's film is another big problem, and it's no better than anyone else, or better. In this film, Maher Kornell spends most of his time in Grad with a Dutch boy at a night club, a shop chamber minister, talking to truck drivers at a small Christian truck stop shop. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ is the reincarnation of Christ Playing with a player on the subject of a "Holy Land", which claims to be Miami and Jesus. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the Bill film, along with some superficial assumptions, is that the religion has changed as a chemical substance like religious medicine, and that religion has changed the tradition of the masses based on the philosophy of schools such as Grand Central Station Doctor, Notre Dame, BYU all kinds of serious and questioned interviews with theologian teacher. or Wheaton College, could easily handle it in a debate on this issue. C.S. Lewis, you will not see any serious discussion of GK's writings. Chesterton, or any Papal encyclicals and of course no one in Hebrew (Jewish, Christian, and Islam) can find any discussion of beliefs. Everything you get at the end of the day is a handy example of a flawless elite who is on the western side of LA, taking a film, and the other half of America does not have any absolutely no intestinal taste. <br /> <br /> I bought a lot of things from what Billin said, but for someone who has his intellect and influence, this movie is not disappointing. Anyone who is interested in intellectual enzymes, which is usually brought up by documentary films, can find more stimuli in the old Rerun of Teletubbies.
