I'm a great Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK, so I could always look forward to coming to the United States, really saving my money. What happens to Anne after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character was calm and elegant. He is not intolerant and strange. And Mary suffered from a disaster or something? His word was not normal and his normal course. There were no chemistry among the two main characters that made the entire "Romanticism" so incredible. In the final scene, Sally Hawkins from Amanda Rootu on the same stage was on the stage scene. The same clothes are not in the same film. In my opinion, he did not look at the version of 1995, which, despite his shortcomings, remained near the book. I do not think books, even books. It's like a Cliff's Notes Persuasion movie. Shoot all the high points without telling anything.
