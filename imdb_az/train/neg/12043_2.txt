I love Brad Pitt very much. Face, pectoral and actor with brain and mind, not to mention all the rest. It's an idea that I'm worried about seeing Thelma and Louise, whom reminds me? "Troy" did it for me. It's the new Brigitte Bardot. Of course, there are differences. Men, Americans, and so on. But Brigitte Bardot comes to mind again. He is so beautiful that he is the most effective player when he plays against him. "California" "12 Maymun" "Club Club" "Kopar" The humor that hits Himself makes it almost human. Fortunately, "Troya" will soon be forgotten. Only the pictures taken with Pitt, and the semi-naked sprint positions, will decorate the walls of the naked, salvant fans of the leiions. Strangely, "Dash Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing? Maybe it would be difficult to say nothing in the chances of working with the new Brigitte Bardot.
