<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> </ strong> "NATURAL BORN KILLS" (1994) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Naturally born Killers' is a risky, terrible, often-missed movie-making structure; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures. <br /> <br /> 'Birthdate Killers' has been largely promoted and promoted by two mass killers; There is a great scene where some interviewers ask Mickey and Mallory about an interview, and the teenage girl says, "Crime is wrong." But if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory. Mickey, it's Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein explains in a situation like this. Dr. Frankenstein is a media that has been turned into a horrible murderer. <br /> <br /> Most Oliver Stone movies are the country where the American director loves and adores. In my opinion, the "natural-born clays" influence media, technology, and Americans like Americans (and most of the world) on things like mass killings and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The killers executed by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are strikingly executed by two great players entering the lives of two exciting killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some of them deserve to be killed in the brutal theory of Social Darwinism's cruel theory - Mickey says in his prison interview that other species are committing a crime, we burn other types of humans and environments; The script is interesting, but the question is not how much the intensity of this 2 hour blood lake we see, but the more doubts that make us think about society and human behavior. <br /> The last hour of the film is held at the maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, he is a reporter who demonstrates a show about American Maniacs and is able to raise the rating for any time to catch the story of Mickey and Mallory. Another police officer, Scagnetti, an angel, perhaps a clergyman, fell in love with Mallory - his mother, Carl Whitman, was killed during the massacre in Waco, Texas, and was massacred by mass murderers. <br /> Kinematography is superior; different colors, shadows, styles, disorientation; The camera work is not crazy, but the green color that is most clear is green, like the killer's disease (looking for a rattlesnake antidote in a pharmacy). shaking, buzzy, requires some resolution to use and accept it. <br /> <br /> <strong> Naturally-born Killers does not glamorize the existence of human murders, it can ask questions and the public how to approach this feature ... <br /> <Although the above view was very positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the script for the first time, did not agree with the changed scenarios and asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. <br /> <br /> 4/10
