Why Follow It? There is only one reason, and this is for the size of John Saxon. I love his work. My most favorite images are in Kabus at Science Street 1,3, Nancy's father cop, Red Milk, police, Dusk Till Dawn, as a police officer. After taking a video through my local shopping center, I met the movie "Zombie Death House" and soon returned, but before moving on, I heard that John Saxon was not the only actor in this movie, and a director. It was of interest to me (Also the cheapest $ 9.00 price) and I and I were there. After coming home, I realized that this film could have been mixed up with his director's pressures, even though he did not succeed in his work until Saxony's other work. But other actors did not abuse. All this has been taken out of a recent porn movie and told the guys who are now able to act. Film reviews the pornographic quality of 80s. I will not be able to offer this movie to the audience in good faith, but if you are a dissatisfied admirer of the 80s then you have been born prematurely, or are more admirers of crap films than this movie. . And if you dig John Saxon like me.
