This movie was terrible. Okay, my favorite movie was 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always a little prejudiced. <br /> <br /> A spouse is skeptical of the key elements of the work, and the term 'reconstruction' is very doubtful. (He is not siblings but allergy to bees) WOW! There are many things that do not happen and are not explained, so Mr. LaBute does not give a horror movie. (How do two people appear to have been blown up in a good and good way when we happen to happen?) Cage looks sad and surprised and his character is "Rowan!" at least in noise. Original 'nods' are not an intelligent esteem, but irritate as they are sticky. For example, some of the events were reflected in the original (the girl who was thinking of being dead when looking for the same Woodward / Cage island) and several dialogs were pushed out of the original scenario of Anthony Schaffer and clutched together. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that others will do better and more thoroughly, and I can not worry about writing more about this movie. There is no substance. Scrap it in with all the other rewards (in this case, many mirrors) that are well-titled movies.
