As usual, I'm scared to see films that Oscars still do not expect. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it was on my street. In my life, I do not understand why this film does not know why. There is no story! A group of meander around Iraq. They bomb a bomb here one day. Tomorrow they work around the village, they are less and start sniper fire. Wait anywhere, they return to Baghdad. There is no cohesive story. The three main characters are so characteristic that they are simply cartoons. So you have a sweet kid who is afraid to die. There is a tough military man who wants to return in a true and simply safe way. And then we have a daredevil cowboy that has a gentle spot for a small Iraqi boy who is following the rules, but the soldier is trying to sell a small DVD boy. What do you think? And will the cowboy soldier, who does not follow the rules, buy a sweet child injured by his routine ways? Why So! Do you think that a Cowboy soldier will kill a Iraqi child with a soft spot and make it bare? Why So! There is no story here. Scenario can be youthful and predictable! Camera is shaken around many to look like "craftsmanship". And for anyone who thinks this is a great battlefield, use the "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon" rental. Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
