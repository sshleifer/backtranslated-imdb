The film is two stories: one is the political murder of a caller, and another is a top-level political party. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Al Paccino" is a public relations character. Because he is a witness of the crime and is the beginning of the night. <br /> <br /> If the script does not have a good dialogue and any drama drama, Get performance is memorable: how many people can look like a little servant (like The Godfather), a strong and scary person (see Donnie Brasco). /> <br /> In fact, the great young lion has become an old thing. <br /> <br /> But his shift is not just a make-up because he can take his energy back on the church scene. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film is a good thing to be afraid of, because it looks at Alin's talent!
