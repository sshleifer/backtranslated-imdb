After watching this trash, the first question is, Who gave the ignorant the right to use Omen in this movie? Continuing omen franchising is a shame, a shame, a pitiful thing. At the beginning of the film sounds like supporting a Bugs Bunny Cartoon, and then the film gets even worse! I did not know anyone who wrote the scenario, but they got an E for them when they got back to show their teachers. It is difficult after a while to explain whether this is a comedy, because the events that happened are so funny and believe that they believe in the original Omni. The player laughs especially at the lead lady Ms. Faye Grant. can make foolish faces or make it laugh? It is difficult to say. I had no difficulty witnessing the worst part. 10 to 1.
