I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and watched a Noyicicans. When I went to Puerto Rico, I did not see 50% of those living in poverty. When you see the battle, the Haitian, Dominican, and Cuban people usually approach the island. There is nothing like Spanglish ... either you speak Spanish or not ... and not what I hear. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a good man for those who want independence, which is 1%. The rest is like local Osama Bin Laden. A group of Puertoricans who want independence is stupid. If you need any evidence of the independent Puerto Rico dreamers, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all South and Central America, and Mexico. The miracles they are doing for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Narynists and their struggles. <br /> <br /> To the person who states that Africa is not enough, Puerto Rico is not Africa. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Denzel will just be ready for you. <br /> <br /> As a result, we want to learn how the prime minister works for all ignorant white men who think that we need green cards to come to the United States, is not a good document about Puertoric culture. Let your children pay attention to Geography and History. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." It was about the dead. He preached to us as we felt. It should have been titled ... "yo soy soyad ... lunch ... Spanish can not speak." PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, OR PRIVACY IN THIS NUYORICAN HISTORY PRICE. It prevents God from playing on the island.
