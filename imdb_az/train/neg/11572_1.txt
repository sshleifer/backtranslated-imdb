Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. There is no doubt that Weinstein did not take that. It is necessary to go out to McDonalds to eat and produce more when taking the Spurlock. There is no way to watch and enjoy it. Savior is a joke. All the ideas are not funny. This idea is a feature, not a 2-minute movie. I'm so sorry to rent this movie. I will not look at anything in the name of Spurlock. Completely litter. Filmmakers like this should be on YouTube and no distribution agreement should be provided. The film is accused of US depression, when consumers in America and their purchases are involved in shopping and purchasing products, when they are the basis of healthy economies when making money on the system.
