This strange adaptation with Borges' short story is typical. Its powerful vision, as a rule, was largely withdrawn by a terrific half cooked game. The film is definitely committed to the surface taste of the Mexican period of Bujel, and looks at a poor person as Lars Von Trier takes on the Criminal Elements. Cox's single shot, shoot-out, and environmental sound recording all work against the effectiveness of the film. It is worth the review but ultimately disappointing.
