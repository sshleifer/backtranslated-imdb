This movie should be loved. The actress is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie always seemed strange to me. the film gives the working class a low and cheap look .The fact that her daughter was embarrassed and that her daughter was not up there really made me a little worried. Barbara Stanwyck worships a girl like a mother, but she likes to find the happiness of her daughter's mothers to family. The other players who see this movie feel this way, I think the player should be very good and watch. I'm not really like a story line. is only a personal choice
