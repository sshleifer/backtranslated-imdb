I saw this movie at AFI Dallas Festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but it was not. These stars include Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, The Secret of Art School). The director, Matt Bissonnette, married Molly Parker. All three actors are doing a poor job in this movie about three friends, two marriages and the third one. All this happens in a lake house and looks great. The film was originally intended to cure a comedy and then a drama, and I thought it would be another way around it.
