In Alec Guinness's latest biography, I could not find much about Paris with Love. I'm sure Guinness made a movie for a free trip from Paris. There is no other reason for the existence of the film. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, is photographed by Guinness's and his son's background in the background, from the opening of the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysee's downhill drive. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry in Guinness with a young girl in Paris for a short time. According to Guinness's latest biography by Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like her daughter, she was unaware of her behavior. As no one is mentioned, as Adil Vernois thinks about his co-star. <br /> <br /> <strong> Guinness's movie has a good moment. When he climbed a tree that wanted to get a badminton strip, he was right on one of Ealing's comedies. <br /> <br /> Some of the films will not wait for the film to be filmed. <br /> <br /> At least Alec went to Paris from Paris.
