Boris Karloff Matthias Morteval, who lives in Morhenge Mansion, lives with some of his servants, is the only old casual matthias Morteval and his doctor friend, "Do not try to doctor doctor, do not disgust!" He says. He invites his sons and nephew to his home and warns that they can have a genetic disorder caused by "brain drain" (?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff is about to die and the "toys" prepared by his deadly brother are killing their dead relatives. A mini ball stabbles a Sheikh knife with a real bullet on a man's face, a knight and a dance lifetime in armor attacks with an ax. A drowning man makes some cheerful faces. In the end, Julissa and his wife, Carloff, were still alive and hid in the prison where steel doors were locked in the room. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <<<He plays recurring organ music (a death-shouting killing ), the soul of his brother speaks ("The whole house will be with me!") and the mosque goes up to the flames. /> This trivial confusion does not hear the very dark, boring and stupid lips of lips.
