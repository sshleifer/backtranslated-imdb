One question: Why? First, the premise is not funny or not involved. They use bandwidth and sound to sound alive with the animals talking to them. Firstly, the interviews are not funny or fun to get started, and even if they are not animated, I'm sure they'll be entertaining first of all. How does it add a surprise to it? The CBS's on Monday night sitcom line-up (it turned out to be a regular occurence for me to relax after stressful Monday business days) and discovered it. Of course, the sitcom line-up might have been re-written anyway, but it would be more fun to see those episodes again. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When I start, I'm figured out, maybe it's ridiculous. Nope. And then he continued. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was one-line clips, cut and really fasted together. It was a terrible frightening version of the Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken." I am not an admirer of the Class of the GIS abandoned site. That was, it was a half-hour struggle. But if I decide on the whole season of three or more episodes of the "Creatures" ... I say that I will take the "Class". Given that it was broadcast for several hours, I came here and came for the first time ... I think it's a good sign that no one is watching and will not last for a long time. Cartoon roadkill.
