Hello, maybe I'm not a big or advanced film watcher in a theater ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". <br /> <br /> Because of Charles Bronson, I hired this movie and hooded ... but when the boy is wasting ... just watching two children sitting in a safe and chatting ... <br /> <br /> The movie on the DVD was DARK ... <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is a 1968 film. However, they put it on a DVD and then some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> Also, I was totally surprised to see these high prices on the IMDb for this movie ... I said it was not complicated as the other nation commenting on this movie before.
