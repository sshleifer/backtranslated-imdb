When I went to 1986, I saw this "hot" movie. He had a x rating for a short staging of oral sex, but played in major cinemas (this was "art"). <br /> <br /> I saw a dull tale about a boy (Federico Pitzalis) in a middle school (apparently) with an elderly woman (Maruschka Detmers). Detmers showed a very good performance, as it is mentioned in the fact that a good body is very beautiful. Pitzalis (to put it softly) was quite poor. No miracle done by any other movie. Still, despite the obvious, but very short-sighted ghost, this is a slow-moving dark story that fools me. Better by Detmers, it helped just a certain point. Often I realized that my time was waiting patiently. If this sequence did not exist, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. Poor and slow. You can skip this one.
