Despite the fact that I love Bing Crosby in other films, I feel especially amazed at this movie. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but after a while Crosby first found good references to the Old US, and then finally my dear. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American - but the British seemed right and / or might need to be able to show these brave, oh so smart American guests. This is a story of "fish juice", but unlike most of these films, this time it is the "fish" from the top. <br /> <br /> I watched several times a couple of times several years to make myself and the film fair, and every time I was watching the same impression. <br /> <br /> (Yesterday I watched another Crosby movie - The Emperor's Waltz - And I gave the same reaction, and even irritated my husband's - American Crosby's "face". <br /> <br /> The film's beginning it is quite unique today and the supporting castle is certainly very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Bing Crosby's behavior would be much more unpleasant for me, but it was not difficult to sit in this movie.
