I thought it was a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and I hoped that my time would be meaningful throughout the film, and yes, I'm Dimple Kapadia and the Deepti Navy are really proud of it, but in spite of the best efforts, this movie seems to have shown what Somnath is trying to do. effectively delivering meaningful message. The last point was short and seemed unpleasant after all; In contrast to reality, the film is about 2 hours long, and the end of the film should leave the audience happy. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that troubled me was the national stereo writing of American characters. All of them are the same block. It seems to me that the most American American characters in English films in India are based on how Indians have adopted Americans and that no effort has been made to create any depth and complexity for any American film. /> <br /> These two aspects are united by a frustration.
