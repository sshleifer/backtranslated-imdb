What do we need? Eddie Murphy, another remake of the vintage Hollywood movie again with the miscast again for the second time after NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows that we run away from speculation to make a good movie, ladies and gentlemen! There are hopes for pleasant and surprising images of animals able to move and talk with people. Things can, unfortunately, only deteriorate. Hammam jokes and sexual references immediately kill this "family" function. Even when parents and children saw trailer ads on the Family Channel, they were unhappy and hated in the movie theater. It is merely to tell the millennium-era period, but just enjoy it while things go wrong only in time. Much wrong with the new DR. DOLITTLE. It feels very flat, absolutely limitless. And I hate Chris Rock's disturbing sound! We need more talented voices than most paid celebs who do not want to announce a bankruptcy. I have to agree that my local newspaper is among the five worst films in 1998. Then the original version was also good. Murphy's next project can be PATTON, if he is not careful!
