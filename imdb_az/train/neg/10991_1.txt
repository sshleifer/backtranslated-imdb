My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took a look at one of the covers (two models in the toilet) and added it to his collection. I was left with the best movie I've stayed with (I use this word freely) and have to sit down. I dared not wait for my brother, and it is clear that he was cursed after he was fired. The biggest film of the whole film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears on stage at the decision to make a total of four films (about four). In fact, the whole film follows this suit. The DVD had a shocking image that was shocked. (Although I went to bed without bedtime). One week later, I found this disc behind the television in order not to be surprised.
