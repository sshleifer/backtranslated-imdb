A silly show that can be completely predicted by a man who killed his wife by killing her husband and claiming to be in darkness. Why was he still driving the car? Why could he still manage a car that killed his wife with a wife? This question does not belong to the writers. After the story, a psychologist and his wife witters about the incomplete marriage that links to the fatal marriage of the deadly mixed driver. It is thrown out for a good measure of a homogenous mother and one-dimensional child, and all the predictable penalties and finals. Are police psychologists so easily taken? Deadly writings that actors do their best, but are unsuccessful. It is parallel with the Harlequin Romantic. Do not waste your time watching if you set this goal.
