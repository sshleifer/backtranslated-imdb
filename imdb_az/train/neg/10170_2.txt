The championship game is only a few days, but things do not happen in New Orleans. The players with the problem of marriage should have a great time to memorize, overuse dosages of drugs, defective killer, life, against nutrition problems. Can things be put in place and stop a killer before the great game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite the idea that you read about Superdome for the first time, this is not a football movie. In fact, soccer is more than just a plot and a thought. Instead, Superdome is transformed into a 70 of soap operas, made up of films for Hollywood-filled and never-ending creators. Drowning sleep goes well with something that nobody really looks good. The best (or worst) example is playing a very small role in Van Johnson and generally has a reason to lose. The area is elegant, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills is like a "person"? Yes, it's true! It believes David is involved with Jansen's drink. There is also no tempo in the film. No matter what Superdome is trying to get all four or five story lines into the movie. Without any drama or perseverance, Superdome is a very bad example of the 70s designed for television. The one-to-one voice for me was a voice from an athlete listening to late Charlie Jones. <br /> <br /> Like many people who have seen Superdome, I have been dealing with the Mystery Science Theater 3000's indifference. "New Orleans" This can be one of the public episodes of KTMA, but this is one of the best examples of early start. So, despite giving Superdome just 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 in the MST3K rating chart.
