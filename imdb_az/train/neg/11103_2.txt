Okay, so last year I saw the movie ... I thought it was foolish and terrible that it was generally a good movie, except for the story ... First of all, we do not know anything they create, why they come from, work in the world and were they really there before they were or where they were from the earth? Secondly, the role of the butcher to fulfill the orders was simply created ... How could the underground passage for substation be so great? There were many creatures, so instead of killing innocent people, some tactical bombs could have been built or perhaps healed and would do a Nuke job. I know it sounds funny, but this is not what I think it is necessary to kill people ... Thirdly, Leon Superman fights Vinni Jones on the train and is tall and bigger. Nevertheless, when dealing with the conductor, he does nothing and looks at all kinds of disgusting things. Okay, the conductor was a creepy (lol), but if Leon had such a courage, he would have gone through all the way ... That is, he was putting his life in danger, and then he did nothing. He could have died as a hero, but he lived like a fright ... it may be, but not after strangely enough to show before ... Then the police are coming! It was a city with a subway, and I bet that another woman should have cops, except for the other police stations, it was really silly ... Generally, Vinnie Jones was greatly functioning, really not set up ... Meanwhile, what the symptoms of the chest What does it mean? Vinnie Jones can not prepare for the rest ...
