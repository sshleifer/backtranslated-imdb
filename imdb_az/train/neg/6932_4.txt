I waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON, and after watching it, I was really disappointed. It's not the Baroque movie I've been waiting for. Fragman (I've seen that on an astonishing DVD) is much better than the whole movie, and that's very unforgettable. Life is different from scenes and is interesting in appearance and sensation, but not close to Baroque-styled films, except for Fellini or Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> THE TORTURE OF THE TRANSLATION The main problem with DUNGEON was a debate that was a debate - the heroes are hard and almost dramatic. - more than anything else. The book was not as it was read. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to have the movie in silence or mood or something. <br /> <br /> It is an open opportunity.
