I saw this movie under the heading "Tied Up". Generally I enjoyed Dolph movies, so I gave it a try. It was not worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the audience in the box. Do not be fooled. This is the best film. No players. There is very little, much predictable. In places, the film is cut in one place. This is a place where the place is. Even a cheap night's worth the rental price. As part of the dolphin fan, I had to wait to see him on the move. At the end of the movie you are still waiting. It's best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching something else.
