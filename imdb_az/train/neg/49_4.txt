Hip and modern, a very humble and dull road movie, reflected in a straightforward way, and some strange camera angles only result in insomnia. <br /> <br /> The cast is frustrated, the writing is foolish and ambitious. Lalo Schifri's noise, really cool and separate sequence, is a very original and interesting thing. <br /> <br /> If you work, bad ideas and comments on this flick are absolutely worthy; really clean garbage. No doubt, this is a charm, but not everyone is afraid to watch a movie that does not fall into a beer bottle, but you can keep it for a stormy day, which is completely different.
