From the moment the film started, there is already a difference. This film is expected to describe the correct accents as well as an international film, as in the Normandy and Middle East borders. This voice is not like the majority of Americans. Also, find the best way to rehears the player, the storyline is a little hard to watch from the beginning. Who's Who? Otherwise, the movie is very true about suit and decoration. If you'd like to see a movie to get some part of this movie (though there's no emphasis on the past), then this movie is worth the rent. If you're looking for a movie like an episode like a Kingdom of Heaven, look somewhere else.
