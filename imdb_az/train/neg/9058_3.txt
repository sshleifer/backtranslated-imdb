When this movie is played on television, you can save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel. There is nothing you can see here. The story comes with Reno and two married couples from Arkansas. Lonnie Earl Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton), a car dealership number one, has problems with his marriage. His wife Darlene (Natasha Richardson) and himself were very downplayed and did not last long. Lonnie slept with his best friend Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze), his wife, Charlie Theron. All of them will go to Reno and four will have a luxury suite. Roy and Candy try to be a baby and finally see that the Candy is pregnant. However, Roy finds her doctor on the phone as freelance. Sweet and Lonnie admits their work, and now all is in chaos. This film was directed by Jordan Brady and he has made several other low-budget movies, but this is the first with an impressive player. Unfortunately, Brady does not show much comedy ability, but you can not blame him for it. This script is not only funny, and one of the glare problems is that the characters are written on the sitcom level. All of this does not mean that they are naive and magical because they come from the south. Thornton's character is not worth it for more than a dollar. And Swayze's character comes from rare good moments when everyone says it's stupid and dumb by the movie and asks everyone to at least remove it for one day. Penelope Cruz is a prostitute and is a completely empty and meaningless community. He speaks more than 3 or 4 lines! In my opinion, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, executive producers for this film. Really bad, the only man Richardson. We watch him become more confident, but in the movie this cartoon is very clear and clich√©. All of these actors should know well and read all of the script and liked it so hard to understand. This is a full-time loss for actors, but at least they have been paid. As far as viewers are concerned, skip so much for not paying!
