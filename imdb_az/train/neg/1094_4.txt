It is difficult to describe - if you were in Russ Meyer's day, you would be pleased to see Haji still looking really hot, though Forry Ackerman did not go well (what can you do with these movies anyway? It was a pretty entertaining premise - a super hero who has his secret weapon in his giant mammals - but sometimes it did not create a whole lengthy failure and the jokes were basically just bad puns (or if you have anything to do with Abbott and Costello) with the comedy Joe E. Brown. Still, I was interested in watching this movie and found it to be more than 2 reasons. Good work, but still a ugly production.
