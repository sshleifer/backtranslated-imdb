As it is well-known in the UK, the Blue Monkey (1987) or the 'BodySuckers' Occupation' was a pretty boring movie about an old man bitten by a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant! As a human creature ran away from the worm's mouth to the hospital, of course, it turns into the beast of insects and continues to sidetrack! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the movie, I've found a straightforward story, un-fascinating characters, cheap special effects, and lack of mobility! Horror supporters do not really need to watch this rare movie, you do not trust me very much! I'm giving this movie 2/10.
