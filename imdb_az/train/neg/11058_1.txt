A dreamy and undoubtedly boring real crime movie shows that he is strangely proud of the legendary actor Jeremy Renner's role as Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the most recognizable variables / serial killer of the last century. At the beginning of 2003, the video was released, and Dahmer was a clear-cut, dramatic, nasty, and finally bleeding chore-fest. It had a great potential to do so! Nevertheless, something that is unknown to me, does not make any effort to reveal a kind of sincerity in the audience, resulting in an unusual homosexual loss of individual, arrogant, and heavily socially disadvantaged, and, in contrast to cold, love, calculation and said the patient and the horror who accused him of committing a crime! Generally, since 2003, Dahmer is something that can really jump off all buffs that commit crimes. Because I'm not saying it is one of the worst serial killer biopsy! Better than the other luxury and unprepared flat-to-video trash like Gacy, Bundy, Ed Gein and The Night Stalker! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
