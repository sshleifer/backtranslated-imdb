Watching the classroom in English was a bad idea. Serious and more educational films can affect, but this does not have any effect in the classroom - when the teacher drops out, conversations have begun quickly and I use the "Shakespeare" or "Tempest". And it's not so easy to see why you look at it. The actor is not something special - everyone looks bored for the plant, reads from the page without the care of the world. Shakespeare always had an open dialogue with action and death, but I did not understand a single word. Costumes are not too bad and what are special effects - the movie may not have been liked by the movie, but they did not exactly get p * s. But it is difficult to joke in a movie that is deprived of any inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the start of the film are not too bad - although the rain did not look so real, everything worked fine and well. But where were the cuts and the explosive tables? Where is my death? Where was God? Ariel's character would have been more attractive to wear that dress - but the whole show was another excuse for a joke. This film does not care about sexual desires. Women and girls will not enjoy any romantic or comedy, and the abundance of naked men and the absence of action or death that will put most male and female. Tempest is not bad, but it's something that manufacturers have not wanted to do. And it shows a lack of general boredom and inspiration. 3/10
