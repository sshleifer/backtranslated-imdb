Disappointing. When the director comes to work, it happens because someone else is paying for it. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great places and settings for an epic proportion. But performance, damn! Remember, in some shootings, when looking at the camera in the background, or seeing the actors, no one should say what they should do when saying "Action." Battle scenes are as bad as you are surprised - are these people real? They were hurt by hugging one another. On slow-motion scenes you can see people strolling on the battlefield or standing at their feet. <br /> <br /> Movement in the foreground is emphasized in a single way. Why? The story looks so unreasonable and not as distant as chronological, but sometimes it is not. Dialogs are dumb, the plot of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than the Hong Kong action films. <br /> <br /> With $ 40 million you can see every dollar you invest in on the screen, in the best case scenario, the ultimate result of all this great job is a sparkling round laser disk that is placed in a shelf video store.
