This is the worst Ridley Scott movie ever. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this is a black spot in his film career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen were completely mistaken in an extreme extreme film about a girl going to the army. It's stupid. There is no scene that is not convincing. It's not really difficult to shoot such a movie. The crew could have been the only thing everyone could think of. The writers did not receive much inspiration; a very stupid dialogue that does not make any sense; and some brain movements. I advise you to stay away from this rubbish. I hope that many talented people who are involved in this project do not properly follow such films, and in the future they will not work on more decent and smart films.
