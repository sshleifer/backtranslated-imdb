This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! They can move from random streets to 5 people and they can move better than anyone else in this movie. It's a waste of time watching it. I only love 2 movies, but it's just garbage. The player (and I use it for a long time) is terrible, and I ask one of these five main actors to make their first film? Do not waste time following this. The hostel was somewhat better. I do not believe someone earns money. I hope the producers spend just about $ 50,000 - this is like a school project developed by children without a hint. Has this even brought a movie?
