After the success of Scooby-Doo, Haradasan, they decided to give their show to Scooby and Shaggy. But, unfortunately, Scooby-Doo has added a new character that breaks its success forever. They invented a new show with a Scooby and Scrappy-Doo show. This show was a complete failure, probably Scrappy-Doo for both adults and children. Scrappy was a stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggy were afraid of disgust and tried to stop him. Scooby Doo does not need any little annoying bastard puppy sister. Scooby Doo wanted to be more successful, either killed or scrappy. It's just poverty, maybe kids will do it!
