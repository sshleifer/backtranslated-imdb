This film is a shame for the Major League Franchise. I'm living in Minnesota and I do not even believe he jumped from Cleveland. (Yes, the real Indians were pretty good, and Twins took their place at the bottom of the American League, but it was still able to be consistent). Anyway, I liked the first great League, and I loved the latter, and the Indians always looked at the third, which would finally go all the way to the series. You can not say that there is no plan after the second film is over. What's going on? In any case, if the true admirer of the original Great League gives you a favor and you do not watch this trail.
