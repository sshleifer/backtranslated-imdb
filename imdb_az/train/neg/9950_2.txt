As the original cast idea (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T) was stored, this movie might have worked. Unfortunately, racism was forced into the image (word) and forced it. Generally, black production did not allow the antagonist to be black, so they changed the role of Rutger and Ice-T. It was just the beginning of the lower spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach for "directing" is just another positive job assignment. The master shot, approached, approached. Gads, 'Everyone's Difficult Anything' uses even more creative camera work. Eric's 'Most Dangerous Game' is at least an attempt to modernize the classic tale, but the characters do not give us the motivation to do so. After saying that we will never miss these people, the reasons for others (rewritten as Rutger) do not give it to others. Do not worry about it except John McGinley's performance and Charles Dutton's honest work. A little trivia, F.Murray Ibrahim was a real drunken speed accident during the shooting that resulted in the death of a drunken young driver who was injured and caused an accident.
