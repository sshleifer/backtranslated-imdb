I saw this movie a few years ago. I went to sleep and had nothing. So I was waiting for it. What really happens to me, does it make no sense, and why worry about it? Richard was locked in the chicken wire and Jarvis went unconscious to Richard's daughter. Then he plays some foolish songs on Jarvis's friend Troubador's guitar. She talks to Richard's daughter Jarvis and Trouby the next morning, then goes to Richard and looks at her when she tied. Then they play a happy music and the movie ends. So what happened? Did they bend? And what about two children (Trouby and Jarvis)? Frightened and poor. I do not care about films that are unsettled and unreasonable. This was the worst movie ever seen since the 90th edition of the Flies Lord.
