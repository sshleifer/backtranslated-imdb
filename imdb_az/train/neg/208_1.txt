A horrible movie shot with the Ramones bits. More than 80 comedies of the early 1970's are worse than the average. This movie is terrible. Difficulty consists of a girl who loves Ramon and a school is fighting against their oppressive leadership. If you like an entertaining B movie, forget this movie and see something that is played by Guitar Wolf like Wild Zero. With a terrifying player, a terrible post, a spectacular venue, Ramones has probably needed some money, and that's what they talked about. This is just a logical thing I can think of, because this movie is a blow.
