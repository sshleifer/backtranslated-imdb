Although it has been prepared for television production, there is no excuse for the results of the finished product rock. This movie has a budget and there is a casting department, as I will shoot a movie about a true story of life, and if you put in the title of "real story," do some effort to try and get some realism? Above all, this film is absurd. These actors refer to daytime television soaps, or these ridiculous lifetime movies, and are not a real gangster / crime scene. Everything about them, from their looks to their behavior, sounds to the shopping, shopping, and listeners of the 90s. What's the Scenario? The two words describe it - foolishness and injustice, yet it is the 90th class way. I do not think exactly Clyde Barrow's saying "I am here". As fans of the "New Kids in Block" came together and decided to make really "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know it will be completely rejected and disappointed. Yes, this sticker does not come across the rad and the scale of the rock. Everything that can be wrong with any movie is here, casting, and editing and playing music. Everything is terribly wrong ... and it is angered by the fact that those responsible for this ugly turkey are nervous to put a "real story" on the headline. Of course, it is not a real story, even worse, even a smart popcorn faded away by itself is not as fun. As I mentioned in my headline, it can be imagined at every level beyond words. Follow me on top or at your own risk.
