I went to see it without much anticipation. Unfortunately, dialogue is totally stupid, and in general, the film is far from the thrill of fear or interest. Even a child can see the logic of missing character behavior. Today's children need creative stories that are supposed to be 'day-by-day' on events. Indeed E.T. This is what happens with movies. and a decade ago Star Wars. (How many children think Jedi Knights and light their lamps?) Do not waste your time and money seriously.
