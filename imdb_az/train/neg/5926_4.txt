Access to a third low peak, "Is there a truth?" Nevertheless, at least one main element of the plot is very different and is as interesting as Spock said. The main character is a stranger that needs to be worn around the black box because the view is scary, making people insane. The episode is so bad that it can not fit into these incredible moments. Undoubtedly, I think that in no way anyhow the true view was a mistake to "go away" because it was approaching such a terrible combination; the standard Star Trek psychedelic light screen used in any standard episodes we've acquired, usually when the ship passes through a magnet storm or something similar. In any case, Kollos's appearance can be punished at least by Spock and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For a long time I thought of buying "Carlos", but I found it angry, but I left it). In order to ensure that the Spokesman returns to security with Collos, it is necessary to agree with Colos at some point. This is done, but when Spock / Kollos returns to cure mentality, Spock forgets his vision. Uh oh He goes crazy, but in the end, Kollos's assistant is resumed with a blind man with mental powers. It could have been a strange, excellent episode, but it was poorly focused and a series of past performances of the past season.
