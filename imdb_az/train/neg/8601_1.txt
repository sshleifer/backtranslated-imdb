Okay, where should we start this small ship? Mutant slugs begin to seize a small New England (?) City. Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... Mike Brady! <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, the slugs are displayed in the same way as the attacker or whatever they are, regardless of where they are. <br /> <br /> The actor was kidnapped, dragged, stole his wallet, shot her daughter, killed her dog, BAD. I'm sure it's worse, but you'll find it hard to find it. It was just a gem ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! <br /> <br /> In horror, he had to take several nights at YMCA. This movie should not be taken seriously. No horrors! They cry aloud. All rising moves would be avoided by a salt shaker or two. Only you can watch this movie in an environment like MST3K, but on the contrary, I can see some major damage to the brain.
