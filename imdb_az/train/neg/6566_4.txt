I watched this movie quickly after downloading it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Parinda is a great story, but fails to meet the standards set by other Indian filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from the United States. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying any of these scripts are Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm not 100 at Parinda. It was not just good enough.
