Recently, I decided to repeat the Oman trilogy, which is the fourth (enter the devil music) here. I did not expect much from him, and in this respect he was up to my expectations. If you are watching bad movies for a laugh, this can only be a movie for you. Oh, where should we start? <br /> <br /> From the outset, the film's appearance and feelings were "made for TV." Music often did not fit in exactly with the events in the film and, therefore, (in the best way) was fun. Scenario Where is the 8-year-old woman's fantasy work? However, one thing to say is that the missing scenario is very well adapted to the terrible player. Many scenes did not seem to me to be scenarios or ridiculous movements. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty gentle, Damien Thorn's daughter is paying attention to all her naked antiques, mistakenly and badly-practiced monks. There are a lot of mysterious and rude deaths that I have personally created as a "drama" and that I have been working as an ordinary third party investigator. Later, Damien Thorn Jnr was born with some medical treatments. And that completes pretty much the plot. All this has been done very badly from the very beginning, creating a monotonous and / or laughing scene after each other. <br /> <br /> Was there many WTFs?!? Moments also provide freedom of unwanted comedy. For example, what is the big reaction in the head of the movie when the baby's cheek is blown? It's a tricky 360 degrees head. When I was baptized I laughed at the reaction. The baby cries and everyone looks very uncomfortable. The troubled mother goes out of the church, and the priest looks very excited when passing through. Huh? There is a nanny at the new age that appears to be cartel blanket to be exposed to an 8-year-old alternative source. The argument brought a problematic Delia into a psychological exhibition to meet with the hippies of the day, and her mother laughed and allowed her shoulder to shoulder. "Yes, fill this charming, dull 8-year-old daughter with all these illustrated things, of course, this should be expected of a mother, who allows her to accept that her daughter can feed her full-grown Rottweiler, who is facing her daughter on the street. <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole scene in the psychic exhibition is quite funny in the form of a nail, from the terrible reactions of psychic to Delia until the infernance. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at how the death of a woman's death was a "weird accident." There is a religious devout (propagated as a religious part) propagandizing the horror of a confused hole in order to prove how God can protect His Glory, and he confused them with the slogans and SOMEHOWA several times over. A very tragic accident. as a suicide attempt. <br /> < The scene of memory-vs was not just funny, but a slow car crash that resulted in a school park, followed by a slow-moving demolition head for a flat detective. I believe that slowly started when it came back to see the demolition ball straight up to the "uncomfortable" detective for the move and could have made a coffee. After that, who was shot with a gun and both died in a few seconds, who acted as a substitute for horrible ghosts and who struck who shot. Then, the stairs, which describe who the real victim are, fall down. Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit strange and meaningless to me. He looks at church architecture. Obviously, this is a great deal of trouble, and it eventually crashes and dies with its breasts. As you can see, something devious happened because it offers music. Umm. OK. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the fact that others were watching this movie and, in particular, as a "decent result". It's hard to figure out the non-sensitive scenario, the incomparable movement and the inappropriate music account. After a short time in the film, Delia's "satanic confusion" is not there, and there is no decline in order to provide a feeling of horror. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: This is a bad film with the only payout feature that is the undesirable potential of being a comedy.
