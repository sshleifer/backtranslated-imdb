This movie is just nude. Total time and money spent. Jokes are predictable, the characters are not funny so the way clich√© and RPG players negotiate. Writers of the problem seem to be working on how the RPG game works, and most importantly, it does not know how to play jokes about this game. Of course, there are many victims who play RPG as players and generally missing ones. But for me, making jokes about this game is not the most fun way. The story does not make any sense. Who sees when a game is played? The biggest problem in the film is that writers and actors do not know what RPG wants to joke about. I'm ashamed of watching this stupid movie.
