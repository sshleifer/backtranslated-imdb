This film is not so bad that it just reflects the reality. Filming is the best classroom material, the actor is miserable and the director is dependent on filming in any form. It's so bad that even Showgirls can not be viewed as something like a comedy along the line. The only thing that was going to this DVD was the artwork covered. <br /> <br /> Because it is possible to write to all those who fail to bear witness to the fact that you give yourself a decent blessing, and this is the waste of time or money. If you want to see a movie in a comedy, it is much more deserving of such a kind than in the rubbish.
