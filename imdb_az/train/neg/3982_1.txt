For God's sake, do not see this movie! As with romance scenes, its time loss, the plot can be predicted. Trying to build too little, this movie and its evil predictable nude are just bare. Characters do not develop, and most of the film is full of Roman shootings that are more interesting than the actual movie. To overcome all of this, the player is a disgrace. I know that everyone is trying to find the place, but that's really a disaster. I do not believe someone paid millions of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Do not spend money or time in this movie, instead of your granddaughter or something worthwhile.
