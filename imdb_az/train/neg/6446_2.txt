Western society was feeding on India as a poor country. Such films only strengthen these beliefs.

It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. People asked me: "Can we get an elephant on the edge of the airport when we go to India, so we have to go through dirt and snake?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion about the modern Indian society should watch the Monsoon Wedding.
