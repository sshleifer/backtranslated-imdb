In my opinion, this silent version of Merry Dulun is the worst version ever. This version does not have sensitivity, love or morals, all these are hearty, German, and bad. It reminded me of my grandmother's love; <br /> <br /> This silent version of Von Stroxim is not a true fitting of the original story. Nevertheless, we love John Gilbert and his close brother, after this unreasonable American actress, played by Mae Murray, a modern permed hairstyle and a magnificent feminist style that I once again dubbed. I love my romances light and beautiful, slower combinations; It's not as hard and sadistic as that. And come, these bees stretch out their lips, rescue them, girl! <br /> <br /> If you want to get a true idea of ​​the original operetta's sweetness by Franz, see the live performance of the show, Lehar. Wait for TCM Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier will not show the sound version. Better.
