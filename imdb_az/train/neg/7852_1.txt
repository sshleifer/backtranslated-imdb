I'm not a movie movie, but my husband has children and nephews. So I saw the first movie. It was strange and tense, but not my taste. Even though it's still fine. For similar reasons, I'm currently pursuing. <br /> <br /> The goal itself is absurd. I can experience disasters in the desert. I can get these mutants. We can even imagine that the events can be so strange and strange that they can decide on military unification. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the US embassy in Azerbaijan said mutants. If you are a member of the United States Army, I'm sure if new employers do not have eye-catching eyes and the experience of warriors, such attitudes will be skillfully recruited <br /> <br /> An armed team The soldiers do not want to be removed by a few mutants with a knife. This is just the way it works. Squad movements, pretty high shooting energy and, of course, radio support can provide less than the overall win. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> If the region is found to be full of enemies that can not control the threat, they would give a radio for the backup. And I believe that if there was a chance that the normal radios would not do, the radio would not be compressed by the radios that radios would fit in with a military matter. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, you must admit that the soldiers are unacceptable to the unfortunate leaders of the soldiers, uneducated leaders. unqualified command chain. Even though the most dangerous thing in the world is still a map and a compass Lieutenant, our military forces are full of intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. <br /> <br /> Knife mutants are under our ability to engage with us. <br /> <br /> The whole film is not possible, it is impossible to imagine, the film is being transmitted. Instead, we do not believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airwaves will even engage in the most serious threats. <br /> <br /> I am insulting the film as a war veteran.
