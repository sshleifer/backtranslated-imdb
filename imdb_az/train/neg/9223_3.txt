Another nasty flick in the world of the nepotism capitol comes from a fancy lane. "CQ" is a bare, fragmented mess of a story, which is a little bit more of running cartoons, a baby and a plain man Davies trying to make a foolish science-flick flick. I do not think of a reason why the filmmaker does not want to spend time with this funny attempt. (D)
