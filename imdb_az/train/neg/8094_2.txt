I read the novel as well as the one who was watching the film, so I took it in a different way. First, any comparison between novel and movie is completely surface. These are two different animals. <br /> <br /> Romance is probably meant to be a satire, but instead comes as a cross between the tragedy and the polemic. Then any comedy elements that form the basis of the style of the movie version only coincide with the single cynical hinge of the author. Think again of another Mark Twain, in order not to cheat you on thinking about the white suit he designed everywhere. An example of most literature is the distribution of Ambrose Bierce in the top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is a mockery and hacker on equal parts, more famous than a writer, and always looking for a new pepper for a milling mill. <br /> <br /> Thus, the superior production capability and oriented direction in film production were deprived of the start. Unlike the true satirist who translates the film very well, polemics are not based on universal observations of some form of human behavior, but the particular or the so-called straw men - in the same way the author's anger. <br /> <br /> Any effort to create a story or narrative that has made a successful film from such a start should be a pure beginning to be free from the writer's influence and intervention. <br /> <br /> I said that I was also guilty of casting. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Only Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith did not measure the defects, Tom Hanks, F. Murray Ibrahim and Morgan Freeman such real talents have either been completely wasted and given only cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here's a really big movie material for satire, but it's not possible to get closer.
