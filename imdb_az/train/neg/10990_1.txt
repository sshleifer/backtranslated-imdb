I ended up watching all this (very long) movie, because I was surprised by similar foolishness and loyalty. Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) It is difficult to believe that it will be enthusiastically involved in this assumption. Maybe in 1968 were people really sad? The event was written by some of the complicated Latin American Marxist priests. Moreover, there is a strong confrontation and the Russians are really good guys, the Communist Party Secretary General, a priest of the Siberian gloves, who has been lightning for more than 20 years and is a good and spiritual man, who is forced to ease his conscience while a prisoner is released. Then the priest becomes a pope with a series of coincidences. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Chinese communists have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of half their own. death of the country. They want to start a nuclear war (to distribute Western capitalist wealth to Chinese workers fairly) to solve this little hiccup of aggressive shooting on communism. <br /> <br /> Our good old secretary, Catherine, is a little worried and calls on the Pope to seek a peaceful mediation before her harassment. They meet with the Chinese leader, Peng, who appears and acts as a 15-year-old boy. He laughs about the things Chinese think about in 1968. Comrade Peng requires western capitalists to pay (this is totally illogical, do not capitalists always pay for the evidence of socialists?) And the Pope must sacrifice something else, that is, equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> Pope is promising to feed all our wealthy Chinese brothers in Christ in the Catholic Church while riding in Rome. So he rescues the world from the nuclear genocide. <br /> <br /> Along with this, there is a small area to avoid this unusual film. <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn may seem very difficult, like the Pope. It is more acceptable than Greece's Zorba.
