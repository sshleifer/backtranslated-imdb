I thought this was a great idea, but the boy was poorly executed. We can get a broad sense of how difficult and tough the back street operations of a show are, but in fact there is no information about anything. Manufacturers did not find a way to tell a story or give a follower a "line-line". (They say they did not try, but those who are on the stage link it with a copy of the Ring era, because there is nothing in the program's story about the physical construction of an opera). <br /> <br /> We see a lot of things going on, but people say what they are doing and why. It is very little to know who owns or how different production departments sit and work. For example, we hear a problem several times - expect a problem and its consequences and / or how it will be resolved. But filmmakers generally cut off something quite different (generally quite exciting or commonly seen in the headphones). <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the film is not worth watching for your dignity, but you're running under the final credits of a show.
