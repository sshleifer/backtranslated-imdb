This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the latter. This time, rings, signs and 8 miles are all strange for a reason. In my opinion, this movie is very trivial and unnecessary and not even funny. Maybe three times he laughed and not enough for a comedy. I enjoyed the first truth, but it was simply mute. Your jokes are beaten up from the corpses and the movies are for you if people are constantly throwing things together. In my opinion, if you are smart enough in your home and keep your money and ask them to leave such films, they only continue to deteriorate. 3/10.
