It's not entirely stupid, not just in a beautiful way. The "Killer Language" is an awkward blend of fantastical, horrible, and predictable comedy. This is an unbalanced thing, and it's a totally inappropriate movie. Basically, if you have, there is very little information about the fact that the violin is a "puddle of evil." I'm even strange, it's more like a "general nonsense." This movie is disappointing and you have been warned. There is no reason to waste time on this, and if so, the scent will remain as rotten fish .......................... .... ................................. MERK
