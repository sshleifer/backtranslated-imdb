The Germans are all open and fall by a machine gun. Good guys will never die except for dramatic purposes. The "assassination" also has its very funny holes. (How did German soldiers fill fuel at the train? Erik Estrada?) And all the ideas were missed by train? How moronic! The Germans Do not go, do not go like it, go away and get away! Which is a waste. I would like to knock my head 10 times with a hammer hammer, and then sit back. I do not mean that seriously, as in the 60s, FELT, but produced in 88! 1988 !! A-Team is more convincing than a bad story for a movie. If you need a good laugh, just look at it. This film is what Tele Sevalas for Green Beret is for John Wayne.
