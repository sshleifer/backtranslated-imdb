I'm just the one who really hates Robert De Niro. This horrible move (of course De Niro) is a foolish film. Brian De Palma should always do the mafia films like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). De Palma's Mission: Liked (1996). De Niro worked with Salutes and Wedding Party twice, with Palma twice. Although I was good at the Wedding Party (I did not watch her greetings). <br /> <br /> The scenario is really bad and unfunny. There is not even a scene when you smile once. The film lost its chance to become a funny style on the "Be Black baby" scene, and I did not like the scene where a man's body was seen. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen! just bad. This is my fault.
