I love it for the joyous horrors. I do not think the player is sub-par, or whether the monsters are mixed. Until the very beginning of the film, I liked this movie except the feeling of joy. Look, there is no need for a 10-point dissertation, and a sign that has a great deal of letters to tell me about a plot. However, Dark Floors "What is this movie?" a new thing to do. What's this movie? <br /> <br /> This is not extremely scary or exciting, but if you want to feel hurt and mixed feelings for about an hour and / or half a day, lease this winner.
