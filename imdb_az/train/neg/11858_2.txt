I'm an admirer of Matthew Modine, but this movie - I poured on the cables - it's totally illogical. I see that the screenwriter and director are one and the same, so there was no one around to check their worst instincts. No surprises, no original line, and no original characters. The redhead was basically the most sympathetic character. All this is how much loss of actual ability. Given the cost of filmmaking in New York these days, I have to wonder how it was built first. And if you're wondering why you're watching me, I came up after a movie I love on the cable and left it on the computer. It's a very difficult picture!
