Pretty bad movie offers something new. Usual mugs and hearts are trying to make an ugly but subtle story. The actor is simply miserable. For this reason, signing Liam Neeson is a guess. Owen Wilson is actually one of the worst performances in the history of the film. Catherine Zeta Jones, despite having Lili Tayor's upstairs work, likes to look at. The special effects were remarkably memorable and the house was breathtaking and excited. But they can not make the makeup for the poor and the story to appear as if they were thrown at the last minute. Please do not worry.
