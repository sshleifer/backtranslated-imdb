I have to see this movie, which has long been known for Enki Bilal's comics. I thought the artist was a good way to spread Bilal's art and ideas to a large audience. I thought it would be a good movie to recommend and I thought I would watch it ... It was wrong! Film was a real torture to watch. The idea has the potential ... but the film goes out of the way, and everyone who sees this movie is left with the impression that he can do it better. I'm not going to suggest you do not see this movie and do it. If you have many chances, you read your pages already or you will see it - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes.
