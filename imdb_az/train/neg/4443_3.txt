Eddie (Derek Phillips) is delighted to learn that his father, Richard (Dennis O'Neill) and his cousin Eddie (David H. Hickey), were admitted to a medical school to continue their family tradition, but Eddie was involved in an accident and managed by a vehicle it is possible that joy will remain as soon as it is done. This poor poor Eddie does not look good to his nearest hospital, and his cousin Eddie agrees to save her brother, Richard Eddie, with the serum he develops, a serum or disease that gives the recipient the power to heal any wound healing. He is desperate because of his son's life, but there are unwanted side effects that make Eddie the only way to transform Eddie into a brain-eaten zombie ... <br /> <br /> Executive, Steve Franke Serum is a perfect thing for me and I say that Serum is one of all horror movies that you do not want to delete in any other way, and that the nails have less entertainment than your retirement. The Scenario is horrible, all Re-Animator (1985) feels with the seniors who are dealing with major syringes trying to eliminate death, but this is just a really dull soap opera for the first 40 minutes. After a while away from Eddie, she did not expect anything to find her friend with her other, finding her arguments with her mother and being drunk with her spouse and that the audience was tougher. So when the first forty-minute tackling ends, and while watching her again, Eddie takes another twenty minutes to get the animation again, and then she kills a few, the police hits her and shoots her. Thank God. Anxiety, blood, gore, or anxiety, that the serum does not have any of its characteristic features, that it relates to a good film, suits the character, the dialogue is poor, it is very serious, weak, slow, and unforgettable, there is. I did not recommend, Did I say that the serum was missing? I thought so. <br /> <br /> Director Franke does nothing to revive this work, although there is not enough style in it. There are no Gore levels, some leaking blood, an exhausted neck, several wounds on the face of a dead woman, and several spots on the needle skin, and that's it. Do not wait for a Re-Animator in the Gore department, because if I were very disappointed with you, it was like me. When we look at a house, a restaurant, and a movie similar to a laboratory, there is no sort of movie and it's just cheap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align : justify; Because they are special effects, they do not talk at all, but speaking in general, the Serum looks quite professional. It was apparent that he was shot in Texas or apparently Texas was shot if needed. <br /> <br /> Serum film is a difficult, slow, dull, terrible thing and feels like a terrible soap. the first forty minutes opera. But I do not understand why, I do not feel that everyone should watch it to follow Re-Animator or its direct followers, and I strongly advise Serum to miss it. You can thank me after I've wasted 90 minutes of your life.
