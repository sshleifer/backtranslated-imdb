<br /> <br /> When I rented Amanda Peet recently for the All Nine Yards, I was looking forward to another good role - it was easily hired, but it was not. <br /> <br /> Trailer for "Whipped" was somewhat entertaining and it was worth drawing about twenty things about New Yorker, the three oversight, because of the charming Ms Peetin manipulation. So two friends were sure to see this movie with me in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> At first glance, we have three baskets, explaining conquest at dinner. It should be funny or at least say something very sad. <br /> <br /> [In spite of calming my longing for films, why not disappoint anyone?] returned to the studio while talking loudly about sex and numerical details. Do they do this same meal every week? You would think that someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: the warning of the other two listeners on one stage. But this is a structure for a punchline. <br /> <br /> The second actor has three studios that fall for Mia and then do not even think about each other and do not think about what really happened between the fourth. . And I asked myself, what quality of quality do the studs have for them to stay longer for a date, as they have been to them? Does it start with brain decay? I was hoping for the character of Erikin, a married friend, to be nothing more than a shabby blow bag. It is clear to her that her role is married. But why is it worrying to talk to him before talking to each other? And his advice? Shit! <br /> <br /> The third act corrects the plan, but this time it was looking at my watch. My friends were still waiting for something really happening, and I had to agree. The scene that was all about enough was enough to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogues throughout the film, but we were examining them from a list. ("Okay, this is Brad, it's happening, and Jonathan says that and ...") <br /> <br /> The laughs we made was something far better than anything fun. Even the outcomes of the loans were not funny. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, I have nothing but this desire to make people aware of this movie
