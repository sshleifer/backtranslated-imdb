This film could have been 15 minutes if it was not for all the debate between the son and the father. Very Expectant. And a good slap on the face of the Men's "Stars"! Would you like a "bone" with some cheese? Two giggle ... headaches. I can understand that my mother left her baby after 47 years ... I do not know how long it has been! In the first 5 minutes, I wanted to turn the movie that I did not pay 3.99 dollars to watch! The film was well flowing and painful. He would have to be quick to watch my watch watch ... He repeated that the script should be easy for the writer to fill. In a positive note ... the scenery was beautiful, it's my favorite season. The car, 40 Ford was also pretty nice. This movie is close to F.
