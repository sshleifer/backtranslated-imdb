Jeux d'enfants or the movie's incorrectly translated into English is a movie made up of me, stupid people and stupid people. I do not know how I can just wait for something to look at in a movie with such a scenario: Two foolish ignorant guys will do something (of course, extremely terrible) to prove to each other. They are "cool dudes". I know that I'm exaggerating some issues, but that's all about the movie. <br /> <br /> Because they are alike, but France? <br /> <br /> It was even more insulting to watch the film from Amelie's country a few years ago, yet the film tries to look like this, but it's too far away. <br /> <br /> Run away. Avoid it. Avoid it.
