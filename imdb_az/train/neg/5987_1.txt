I really did not like this movie. The area was very unpredictable. Typical American area, I'm sorry. Guy finally gets to the girl. Is there a monorail in London? Bank of London ??? What's the Bank of England really? - But I liked the likes of Tracy Island and Thunderbirds. And the Brits were baddies? How much was it (outside Parker and Lady Penelope)? Oh and they kept saying things like "Come on Thunderbirds" - but not as "Scenarios" series, why? For more than 20 years, I would like to see that it has been redesigned with more British casting. I preferred the original series. Sorry!
