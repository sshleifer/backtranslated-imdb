Indeed, it is a strange way to listen to a large portion of the film. And long before the release of the film, it seems to be a suicide in the studio (1). (2) Conflict between producer Robert Fryer and Michael Sarne was general information. <br /> <br /> (3) The film has not been concealed from respect for the film and has publicly announced it at every opportunity.
