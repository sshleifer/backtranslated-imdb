SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> It's not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind ... the filmmakers had to work with what seemed very good, considering the small budget. The film is an episode of a live Japanese reality show that has sent several competitions to a sealed "danger zone" and has three costume reptiles sent to kill them. The survivor, if any, gains fame and victory ... everyone will only die and fall ashes. The main drawback of this film is that the player is pretty bad. None of the "real" people actually do not appear. Actors who play cranes are entertaining, because they describe the cheerless and multicolourary cartoon types of popular modern horror movies ... and it is clear how to do it if there is a real show. The film is alleged to be seen in one reception ... There is a cameraman watching the races around the "danger zone" and everything is viewed from the camera ... but the lights shake and turn off constantly (I'll imagine the "shots" to hide from one another).
