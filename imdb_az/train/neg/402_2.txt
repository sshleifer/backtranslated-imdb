It is unfair to describe this film as trash. At least trash can be a suction hobby. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon, despite this luck, can work very well, as there was an IRS bill to agree on the adoption of this fear scenario. <br /> <br /> The Hollow Man's crazy scientist was told in advance, was described in a better way and was said without resorting to many expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects, Transparent anatomic babies of men, women and dogs, can be purchased in the early seventies. They were sold as "Transparent Adam (/ Woman / Dog)" in the UK, possibly the name of this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, strange writing, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
