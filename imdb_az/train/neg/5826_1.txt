Slow and beautiful images have changed the way for the first 75% of the movie sometimes with awesome music (you know Bjork). If you do not have enough sleep, it's a good time. However, with the rebirth, re-incarnation or S & M images in the last 20% of the film director, "spiritual lovers" cut each other with a knife. For me it was very unsettled and actually changed the overall impression of contemporary art and the mix of modern Japanese mystical images. <br /> <br /> Operator and director are great, but strange. <br /> <br /> No one enjoyed it.
