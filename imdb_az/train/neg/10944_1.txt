Now I've seen very bad movies. I love bad movies. Especially bad moving movies. I saw (and loved) all of Jean-Claude Van Damm's movies, including his own clone, where he was twin and where all three were a cyborg. I really have one fashion designer and one has a fight with a full truck of the durians. (Hey, if it's nothing else, it's a big episode and you almost always have to see it, it's possible to pause and grow with the DVD!) You can rely on me for saying this movie is too bad. <br /> <br /> Plan 9 looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. Area is bad. The scenario is bad. Sets are bad. The battles are bad. Nails are bad. FX is bad. The player demonstrates the worst performance of players, including Lorenzo Lamas, and really says something. And I would like to be ready for everyone involved with this film. Passionate Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It is unusual to be laughable, so there is no general loss. However, I recommend that you only look for this movie just for the sake of it or be too stoned. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing.
