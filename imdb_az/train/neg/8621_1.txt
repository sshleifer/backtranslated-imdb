Previous poster worked clearly in the film. This is a bad joke, and it's a joke that no one can ever see. I recall all the actors' names and their priorities that they have to do with it. <br /> Cinemax is now and I am convinced that this movie is a porn star (a beautiful and well-furnished Ava named) had to do something for some nude tax reasons. <br /> <<When I first saw it, I was convinced that it was made in 1986 and I was born on 73, so I thought I knew I was talking ... but nothing happened in 1993! Incredible! <br /> <br /> Although I call it a bad guy, it's a good movie. Like watching a train crash.
