Sixteen years later, it was a very sensitive film about a man who fought and abandoned the hippie religious cult of the 1960s. The man has a child who is hiding by the police and taken by another person and is named Sahin, who lives in a small container on the edge of the river. The cult kills some followers or some people in the city. It's hard to watch who's watching the characters, and when to watch the scenes. Leader, sixteen years later, got into the password (I came from the box - I missed the time in the movie). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One man is killed with a large circular drum, others with a knife or a cross. <br /> <br /> I did not hear the film shooting, the name of the title character in the movie, but to explain what happened. Some sound effects were pretty bad. A man throws a fist and we hear a whip cracking. A woman burns a weapon, and we do not hear it, but we've heard a ricochet instead! It was seen to have a funny effect.
