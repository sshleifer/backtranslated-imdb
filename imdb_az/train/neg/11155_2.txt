Even though I was looking for it in my local public library (and I would be brutally accusing the public of losing money), the only reason I followed this was despite my herbs and donkeys. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, suddenly bad-to-move, moving effects and I've seen that one of the worst scenarios of my dissatisfaction (for example, exciting and damaged) is a long, long time. The best laughs are really forgotten in the coming weeks, "Making ...", where the poor, who are dealing with this HDV deficit, have been trying to justify their efforts as if they had worked on something special instead of anything else. Wait! Someone else has Tippi "Birds" Hedren, with everyone, with Kane "Friday 13th Xodder!" How it happened, I never know, and I have to be honest that I really do not care about it, do not tell your own risk and not be warned This is the most ambitious, charming film, and some pretty nude women, and even then, just 2 people for me.
