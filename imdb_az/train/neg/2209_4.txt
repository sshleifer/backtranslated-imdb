As you read SyFy's review of Dinoshark, I know that you can appreciate the low budget shock that this movie can provide for movies. They are fools ... they are wise ... but still very happy to say "very bad, good". So, undoubtedly, I'm faced with innocence to love (and recommend) the "Dinoshark", "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy," sitting down to watch a SyFy Original movie about half a man; . How wrong can it be with the SyFy Channel's trustworthy recipe for creating a cast of B-film creations and William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo? Yes, I'm not surprised, really misses the brand ... not much, but I do not advise. Why? Well, first of all, the titul monster, the terrifying hammer-human hybrid, really comes back to a bunch of military-helicopters who have become the main murderer of the film. As the hammer increases the number of bodies, it (or everything you call) comes before only one is directly munched and immediately comes out. The rest of the film is full of heroines against the above-mentioned soldiers. It's not for me, attractive people just like watching a picnic hammerhead! <br /> <br /> Read full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
