I wanted to finish this movie because it was painful for at least 10 minutes. All this "horror" was a group of stupid bitches, debating, debating, screaming and screaming for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The structure of the film had a great potential, but it did not happen. A group of five "young" girls go home when they are persecuted by a caded female driver who wants to kill them one night. The film is about two minutes and symbols, and it does not stop. Everything in our 90 minutes is a girl who is crying, screaming, "acting" and disputing. None of the dialogues are so fascinating, because you really do not know these characters or love them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < None of these women looked at a date less than 20 years, and one of them was about 30 years old. At least those who look at age. None of them had given far-reaching speeches and seemed to be just as they were on the street or the director's friend. <br /> <br /> The actress who slaughtered her would slip her out, but at least she showed something other than girls - a little talent. <br /> <br /> The heroes do not help everything, because these girls are a bird mosquito, stupid bitches. Indeed, I can really say about them and did not help them survive the ALL. More precisely, at one stage, girls are persecuted by the killer and beat their car. A girl hurt herself and talked about it ... four of them are not seat belts ... What are you waiting for? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by a killer ... and can easily be a "great blow" to help you all? No matter what. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking is totally scary. I do not think the budget of this movie is the size of a pistachio, the shooting film was terrible and it was like watching a pirate version of a movie. The cameraman was in the car with the girl, pushing her with a window and the camera was damaged, shaken, and brushed against a "actress". <br /> <br /> Someone who was detained said that one person was killed and one was killed. although I have just heard the accident) are actually real life managers. It is no surprise that they did not show the car hit! This movie can not display a very cheap, even a little scratched car. Oh, I should mention the sound ... if it was. He was frightened ... for a second he was sad, and then rock was merged. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, only one night in the Beatles is a horrible home movie, which argues for 90 minutes by shouting a bitter strange girl in the middle of the road. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <font color = red> br /> This was a terrific low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
