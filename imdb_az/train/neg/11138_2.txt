Before I lease this movie, I would like to read some reviews and start with what I know for sure. Still, I was surprised, though poor. <br /> <br /> I am a great werewolf fan, and I am used to pardoning a lot while watching one. Most of them are sub-par effects, weak functioning and weak witches (before the best films). <br /> <br /> It's the worst thing ever, except some of the Howling series movies. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the story. This site has been reviewed several times, so I will not be featured. At the same time, it is clear that the writers (s) are not entirely close to lycantropic monsters. The horror movie often happens when it is given to a writer who considers himself to be such a "superfather", and they have tried to create a new spin in their wizard myth. It's fine, but an awful fan, trying to do so, does not take into account the disappointment and ignorance of the sad audience, and ends writing them. The field feels like a parody of liberation films, and the events have shown that I only feel the insult of my wealth. Television news, for example, is moving away from the correspondent to approach one of the crowd behind. Give Simons and viewers credit for the bad man's badge on the stage. <br /> <br /> According to my husband, this was just the end of the iceberg. I would be happy with the pepper hair with Lon Chaney Jr. The monsters they use may look very good ... like a boy in a good, cheap rubber suit, some hair stuck and some really terrible animatronics. And I know that many people have already criticized CG, but my God was terrible. One scene changes in a woman and the actress begins with a completely CG version, bare, but without nipples without it. My first thought is, "Hey, why one of the characters from ReBoot turns into a foolish look?" <br /> Anyway, looking for a positive movie in a movie and a few. Cinematography has been violated (all digital filmmaking is interesting) and some speeches were terrible. Tippi Hedro was interested in seeing the world's best homeless women and Kane Hodder as bad guys. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger grew up all and ... well, damn. And if you are looking for skin, there are some delicious examples. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are "The Wing", "The Dog," "The Dog," or even "Wolfen" (although there are more monsters), if you have a lycantrop, a gander, otherwise give it a miss.
