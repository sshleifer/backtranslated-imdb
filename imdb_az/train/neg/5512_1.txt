This flick at a time capsule is a perfect example of putting a DVD and providing a minimal 1-to-10-star scale for future generations. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been in the top rankings and with tens of millions of annual earnings - a television series. However, each one did not succeed in large screenshots. This is also true for other television personalities - maybe 10 minutes or one 22-hour or twenty-four-hour drama half-hour program in one of the two hours or more presented stories. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have an element that will give MAD TV, SNL or two or three minutes in anywhere on the screen or stage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, Rodney Dangerfield was shot before his death, probably because of his recurring value. <br /> <br /> A nation living in the Caucasus has died, some movies are really terrible, but have a number of high ratings - the dial is as bad as you can move backward to 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from outer space" is the best example and Bruce Jenner / Village People Opus, "Music Stopping" is something else. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this flicker falls short. Rodney's previous work (as well as several other partner members) had many "humorous moments" and stories, even though he remained as Citizen Kane or Casablanca. <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not have a minute or two value of such a material.
