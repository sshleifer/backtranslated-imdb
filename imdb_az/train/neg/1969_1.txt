<br/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Just saw this movie and it should be said that at the outset the effort to make a decent film although it was absolutely terrible, but I'm sure> It's like a child's insulting intelligence that all viewers are immoral or have a very difficult time with fun. I can not imagine the type of viewer taking into account the producer's production. I do not mean that though the actors are serious but difficult, there is a script that you cried to write .... I can not say it anymore. If Harlequin Romance decides to make a horror movie, this will be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you make this movie fun, I strongly recommend you to appeal to a management like the purpose of the films. There is much better there. Join the club, REVIEWS, but above all, do not look like this.
