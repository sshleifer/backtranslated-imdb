Over the past few years, it has been a fashion for frequent, but not limited to, ironic zombie films, as well as other media outlets who died in the body's death. The movie Fido is merely an attempt to cash out its manifestation or both, and this is generally the category of mock zombies. The joke here is a version of the environment of the 1950s, in contrast to a wide range of stereotypes, squeaky-clean, alternative history (we are after a great Zombie war and the creatures are now married as slaves). <br /> <br /> This is a funny concept in the medium enough enough to sketch perhaps five minutes of comedy, but itself can not catch a feature film. The joke, which is the decay of corpses for slaves, is repeated and duplicated with this idealized version of a small city and loses all its effectiveness. While the zombies cannibalize the surroundings, the soundtrack plays relentlessly sunny melodies. The word "zombie" is included in a home line, which is always a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The greatness and peculiarity of the "nineteenth year" representation here can not help me, but it irritates me. This is clear from what is happening between the 1950s and 1950s, as compared to the events of the 1950s and 1950s, which is more inspired by Pleasantville. is proud to have been unconscionable about the film, how open, low, and superior it was in the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Because of the wide range of pop culture in the 1950s, the "species" is hard to develop with a very emotional investment. Each of them has a number of character traits thrown to himself - Helen is cautious with images, and Bill loves golf and can not kill his father - but they are quite two-dimensional. The speeches within the limits of these bad writings are good. Best of all, like Fido, Fido is like a zombie character and loyalty to an elder monster who simply can not talk to Frankenstein's tradition of Boris Carloff. <br /> <br /> Commodities of fetishism, racism, classicism, war paranoid and protests, but none really work on a truly extensive level, and filmmakers really stay with something. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is really a "good hour and a half" for "Look Zombies in" Beaver!
