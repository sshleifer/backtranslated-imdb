It is a film that has been cut and renamed at a difficult time. It does not work. Initially dramaturgical is all wrong. First, it moves very slowly, then goes through a rush and endless end. But there is anxiety among the genres (and may be related to the breakdown). It becomes a farce that begins after a moment of excitement, and then does not sell it. the latter might be funny, but I feel I have insulted my intelligence (very few). So the film tries to be everything, but it really does not succeed at any level. You can see this in the development of a very unstable character. Almost Connery plays three more roles.
