Boring, long, ambitious, repetitive, self-involving? This movement was felt like a bad date. The worsening, elegant art school direction - with the use of the stormy shots that were so unbearable - almost forced me to throw it - screaming for a while to celebrate. Add the most sophisticated and virtually no dialogue, and the film begins to feel like a four-hour epic about 30 minutes. The worse is the bad humor and the drawings and the songs that make it clear, instead of dialogue. Actually, high opera music. Charge all directors. <br /> <br /> All players are very good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for film stardom. He and other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even after this 5 minutes begins to dig and director Bel Ami is a pre-election miracle for pornography. Stunning college campus architecture inspires a place in Mexico. How are universities so soft in the US (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD in this movie. Want to use the speed-dial button? Many.
