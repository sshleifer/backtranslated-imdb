You are shamed about Aditya Chopra, who has lost her own intelligence and has been a part of this cinematic shit for years and even you are not worthy of Tube standards. Throughout my fist, I began to cure my teeth with an endless line of schizophrenia, and in the final stage, my country and its crorepati were ashamed of protecting the filmmakers from being ashamed of being foolish. Regrettably, actors in the process have to do some work, and some even comment on it as a matter of concern. Saif Ali Khan - was disappointed when you selected the movie completely. Kareen shows enough skin for her lack of adolescence, and Akshay comes as an indifference. Anil once again with a magical charm for English. His cronies were commendable in their performance, with strange cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, enough to pop a blood vessel. Do not damage any brain cells, energy, or money to see it - AME is a wonderful part of an independent film from India, instead of AMU-Konkana Sensharma. Intelligent, monster and beautiful story will touch everyone with smart actors and I hope that everything in cinema is missing in India.
