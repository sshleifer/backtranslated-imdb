This movie is really boring. I was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. It's not just because the Communist regime is criticized, it's not just because of the quality of the film. I do not want to pay for watching. I love Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and hope that such a poor film will come out of China. It looks completely invisible to the audience and it seems that the filmmaker is preparing a movie for himself. It is joyful that a person standing there does nothing for a minute or so, and many have. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie on Net and people seem to like this movie. One explanation for this is that some of these films are automatically considered good if they are not in a movie in English. People can not see why they want it. This is not a movie that resembles a celluloid loss. (Actually, they are not actually filmed)
