It should be noted that most of the people who tell the truth are not old enough to assess or evaluate them before the fall of the moon (1969-1972). <br /> <br /> I was a young man in the Apollo era, but I am old enough to understand what is happening. The whole world watched the moon fall. Our family gathered around the TV to watch the start. Newspaper headlines set off every day, from moon to month to month, from month to month, to compress many languages. Some lessons at school have been canceled, so we can watch major events on television. At Apollo 13, the world has been praying and collectively breathing because men have entered a certain fate. He did not go anywhere without asking what was the most recent. The world was really a society. <br /> <br /> Now, after the fact, it is easy to argue with a 30-year buffer scam, because world-wide enthusiasm and interest have diminished. Together with our history books, everyone can claim that history is wrong, and while trying to prove it with many false and corrected facts, instead of ignoring the superiority of the evidence, it lives in the souls and memories of those who live in these beautiful, flawless and fantastic days.
