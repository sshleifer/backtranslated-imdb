This is the biggest offense for TMNT. Fortunately, the Venus Canon TMNT is officially not available. A woman would not have a turtle, and once in 4 times she did not have her own family, she had avoided the tragic tale of rare mutants. The biggest mistake was the episode of Power Rangers to TMNT; The turtle's voice was WRONG, and all of it came from the character. They could have been better job, better designs, and animatronic and NO VENUS. <br /> Do not worry about these people ... that's a decent thing. The lip wing was slow and unnatural. They are totally disrespectful shredder. the main badger, some dragonlord dude horned. The turtles looked at their bodies with their closed eyes, and what was the raphy bush? stupid-looking sculpture plasters! <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, had been dropped out and got rid of Venus, they'd get rid of the foolish kiddie cartoon sounds ... and better to write better.
