First, Zorie Barber (Zeke) can be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character to be hip, the village writer of martial arts is proud to be mysterious, why so hyper, very dramatic and plain horrible? Did he know anything about his character before he started filming? Director? Do not teach warfare discipline? In addition, this film has lost its target with jokes from itself and it's already a humor. Hand over the toilet? <i> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm. Fast Times in <i> Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on .. Maritime dialogue: Eric is a sequel to "this is my job <i> / i> ... "and 30 seconds later, Mia says," What's your job here? " Bad edit: At least five minutes worth of movie is wasting on NYC traffic. <hr> It is also impossible to believe that the four main characters will be a friendship group in any world. I can not comment on everyone's laugh, but if you enjoy the humor and humiliation of the downstream bass, the main bath, enjoy it. If you're a little smart but want something in the same line, look for <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want something to go for romantic comedy, go to <i> Tao Of Steve </ i>. But <i> whipped> </ i> is a good idea to describe a well-deserved and accurate picture of everyone who can not agree.
