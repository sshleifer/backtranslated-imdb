Oh my ... bad clothes, bad synth music and worst: David Hasselhoff. In the 1980s, he was beaten by Fabrizio Laurenti, a producer of the American-Italian joint venture in Wittery, on the production side by the bold Joe D'Amato and a short-sighted director (thanking heaven for small miracles). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Things and magic, the actress and cheerful night and day mixes, some of which slowed down the unexpected ending, with some serious WTF surprise oversteps from the scene. (I just love to look at his face ...) Surprisingly Laurenti tries to pick up a few mistakes and a bit of air in the air - very few - scenes; <br /> <br /> This section is highly effective and the 80s Italo-gore is a shock and creature that can entertain fun, 100% hand-made and modest budgets in classic latex and red color. Only sadist glee and a few irregularities, the non-overlapping characters (and actors) were mixed up and outdated. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Not just sad Linda Blair, as you can see, did not let any attempt to try another good old girl / The role of a woman in her career, or it seems like her filmography. /> Well, nation - talk more and say less about the home. Do not wait so much for some rainy afternoon and maybe at least have some fun. Helps if the 80's afraid of the fear of euro is a bad hearted nuts. And while talking about the heart - every film with David W. Hasselhoff's skeleton with a large metal object and bleeding wings around the room and corridors must have the right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. for you
