Yes, everything is said about this movie, and I hate writing everything that has already been said. But, I've seen zillion of films and try to write on all the movies I've seen.

Nun is a professional helper who cares for the baby though it's fine. The three main killings in the film surprised you how you could make the creators of this movie. Even demolitions do not know that they can still be scary. We do not see how the grunge is dead. The dentist and his assistant felt that I was right to die, but you would not hurt them. In the garage, uncle's tony dies in a better way. We only hear the cry and do not see anything!
