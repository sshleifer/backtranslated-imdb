<br /> <br /> Being a comic movie would be a movie star with a famous comedian. There is no such situation here. I laughed at once with the noise throughout the entire movie, and even at the final comedy scene (which would also be expected to be funniest). As for television, it's something you can watch, and you do not spend it on rent.
