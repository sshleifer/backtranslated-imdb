Why is Colin Firth in this inappropriate movie? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> <br /> <br /> On the beach, There are trivial episodes in churches, busy roads, but it is not clear who is or what to care for. <br /> <br /> There was a lady in the movie. It was not clear what the case was, but it just seemed to be there to interpret the girl honorable, inappropriate, and maudlin. <br /> <br /> <strong> I gave it to 1 because it was not a charm of a terrible movie.
