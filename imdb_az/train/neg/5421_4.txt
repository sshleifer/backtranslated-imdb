As I hate it, I can somehow associate more of the majority of people and have no idea how people in the big cities, especially in New York, will fall asleep. People can stop all the noises these days. The main theme of the film is an interesting topic. This is very bad. Tim Robbbins deserves the exception, except for several scenes (in particular with the supermodel Margarita Leiveva). The biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see Margarita Levieva, an absolutely stunning and talented actress for shooting. It does not do much, but it is super-modal. Even if the next door is trying to look more and more girls. This is the world of advanced skills and talents, such as Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian, for people to gain more fame and success than this talented beauty. The majority of this movie did not affect me because the script is not very good, but I'm glad to see some new talents. I hope that producers and directors think when Margarita needs a nice new actress to be in the budget movie. If they were able to shoot a movie on Megan Fox (c'mon is not hot and his acting is worse than the "talent" for the television show, Disney Channel), it's amazing and talent! We'll recommend you to rename it, so we can pronounce it and make it more efficient. Here is the hope of this career and if there is any justice, it can be opened in the next few years in several big movie or two.
