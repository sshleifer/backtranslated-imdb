I thought any fear movie with Orson Welles would be strange. Necromancy was convinced, but for his own goodness was a bit strange. The film is really a shameless feeling for satanists / witches in a small town and for engaging in a young woman's initiative to rescue them. The author, though intentionally, intentionally misleads and blends with sleep sequences. There are many questions for the finals. The story is worse than so much, it is difficult to root for any character. It is striking that Velles will agree on this film, especially because it does not do much. Maybe one day this movie will be off and bloopers will turn off a tape. Now it would be really fun!
