I left this movie in the movie, but I had an idea behind my head when I saw it on the shelves of the DVD, thinking of "time to watch". Great mistake! <br /> <br /> The long list of stars can not save this Turkey, of course, one of the worst films. An understandable area is poorly delivered and poorly presented. I will read Robins' novel, but if the novel was totally different from the novel and helped Robbins with the scenario, I would not doubt that the novel should be an exciting one. I hope the actors were embarrassed to be in good taste in the celluloid and the subsequent DVD blankets, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman sometimes has the grace to be disturbed <br /> <br /> Get yourself saved as something worthwhile for about 98 minutes of your life, straighten your legs or pull the socks out of the drawers. Even if you look at the drop-down box at your local store, stop calling!
