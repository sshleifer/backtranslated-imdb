The Little Mermaid is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies. But I'm sorry to say that Disney was getting worse when they did this. I will admit there is a good point to him. Songs are not bad, and the animation is clear and clear. There are some humor, I'm sure - I do not remember it, because I watch it and I immediately stop looking at my eyes. This is the worst point in the film. Ariel's father is in this movie. She forbade her to go to the sea, just as she was forbidden to go near her daughter. I personally think that Ariel treated her with her own past, and treated her as a cure for her. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Ursula is a kind of sea witch (missing, forgotten sister), which is more funny than irreverent, pitiful scare. She also has a little cheating to offer her - but Ursula is not afraid or worse. Ursula was able to protect us through her persistence. <br /> <br /> There are those who want to meet with their spouse and relatives. The only actor (always a remake / something that disturbs me later). (The difference was clear to me!) One reason for this film is that Disney's a few quick I really hate to think of a company that I truly love, I feel that this imagination does not have an idea, I know that this is the act of being a parent, but Ariel is different. <br /> <br /> I know some guys who love this movie, but he's falling asleep, he's in love with, and he's been dreaming until he's in the movie. and I know some adults who do not admit it, but for everyone who has the best of love for me and for Ariel, do not see this movie, we know Ariel, only one song or two for the final scene, and not really bad (again in the place where it took water) - although it eventually gets very few.
