This is part of the biggest crap. As you can see, they spend much of their time, effort and money on doing the DVD movie in a real movie. I really thought one of the DVDs was being done in conjunction with home porn and I knew one of the captain's actors. This film was packed into one hundred dollars and one camera and spent half of the rats. The picture is really clear, but in addition to very unsuccessful illumination, along with cinematography, you can produce, act, and actually do it, and see if it's a script, it's worse than old pornography. At least there is a point in old porn. Some PETA members met and decided to make a really bothered, meaningless PSA about the rights and feelings of the animals. It's not worth the money or the time. There is nothing to do with the actual BTK serial killer, except the name of this killer and some victims. People who shoot this movie must be glad to be free, or they may have come after them to worsen this film.
