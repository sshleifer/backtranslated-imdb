A woman nicknamed "Big T" is serious about the country's singer - so they say - a musician carries his life and career and falls into a dark drunk (Busey) who wants to be his manager. His mother committed suicide, his father was alcoholized and suffered severe. You can imagine the reason. In the meantime, like Parton, he has musical poems with his fluid vocal talents, singing songs from songs (at least half a dozen of Texas). Avoid this confusion and check it at NINE at Five or Steel MAGNOLIAS.
