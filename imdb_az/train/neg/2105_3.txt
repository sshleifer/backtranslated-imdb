Bela Lugosi is a creepy human scientist who uses an orchid for orphans to steal the substance of an old woman. The places in this movie are delighted! Many freaks, plus many padding and no plot, make this movie a nightmare. I like how typical of Hollywood fell to each other at the end of all the works. The story is never exciting and you feel awkward when you are watching. <br /> <br /> Usually I would like to sink like this, but midget added enough heart and fun to earn a few more points.
