NOTE to ALL DIRECTORS: It is not necessarily good for a long time. This movie is incredible long. But it's not good. The scenes are way too long, road, road, road. Sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Now it can be up to 2 hours and 10 minutes, or maybe exceptional, but it was so tough that only 2 out of 2 I can give it to 10. There are other problems in this marathon. 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the whole family tree. The grandfather is similar to him, but the father, the father and our son (who constantly silently vote for us) are Ralph Fiennes, the different facial hair and the same basic nonsense personality. No one looks like a clone of the last, although photographs of each of these kids are snapped every turn. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > </ Strong> </ strong> </ span> <br /> <br /> 2) The Jews are rounded and sent, laughable. Some words would have taken them and the thought of trying to escape was supposed. <br /> <br /> French uncle, of course, sent a warning to try to leave them. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong. It is very brief when explaining this thing and developing relations between the main characters. Suddenly ... people are full of love and almost instantly ... married. Then there are children. Then we work for the 6th century and forget about developing relationships. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On a weekly basis, I mean infinite bend, oops they are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Robert Redford is doing something for this movie, so I think that Istvan Szabo should model his directorship career after himself. A long-drawn film that completely destroys any substance in the film. <br /> <br /> The Sun is a perfect address. A brief description of 'The Horse Whisperer' and Sunshine. If you start watching the sun shine, it may be good after dark when you leave.
