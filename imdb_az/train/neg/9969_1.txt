People have joined this site to see what the film will say about this absolute catastrophe. I had not even been for a second. All the characters were of one size. They threw every topic they might think of something they hope to be. I bet (and hope) that everyone involved with teachers will be embarrassed. Here are some great actors, but you will not know it. Fortunately, Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern did not destroy their career. There was no sight, no love, only a terrible attempt was wrong. BTW I do not think the writer has ever hit a real school.
