This film is available on t.v. this afternoon I can not see how everyone can sit on this trash. It's not funny, and it takes you to IQ. down a few hooks. I know that this movie is for children, but this does not mean that the writer's worth is worth it. I think the writers are sitting around a large wooden table, and a) the word "poop" is a big laugh. b) A child with a four-foot-long stroke may have a ten-foot tall basketball net. c) Children should always fight with armed arms, because the abductors will fall into the same trap and d) need to defeat the so-called "ninjas" with a 3-month karate training sword. One good thing I can say about this movie is the weakest suburban "gang" in the world that does not fear anyone. Maybe children in MST3K can use this movie to make a good laugh. Do not face this stupid love for a movie.
