Oh my. I decided to go to the cinema with some friends, and I wanted to watch one of these wonderful, cool, Christmas movies and I was unhappy. The movie failed. Stops. Paul Giamatti, who is considered a good actor, has played his character and is always creepy along with my personal favorite Vince Vaughn. Some new styles want to transform and transform the Christmas movie. Bad sort, good mix, but all very wrong. The first ten or this minute was not too bad, but after seeing Santa ended up. He did not get anything better, his degree was the same, there was no character development, and of course one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Whatever you do, do not watch.
