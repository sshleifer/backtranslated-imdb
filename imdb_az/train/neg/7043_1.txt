I was prepared to laugh as a trial of a Mystery Science Theater during this movie, but it was just boring. Apparently, many biker lovers have friends and they decided to shoot a movie accidentally there. <br /> <br /> It is often dirty. Multiple imagery of bikers on the way to a landscape, often performed by the same music. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon has difficulty in the film. Harmon probably would have created everything. <br /> <br /> Of course, cyclists are attacking a small city. <br /> <br /> Some bikers are always a weak attempt to separate a soccer helmet from all wars. <br /> <br /> The scenario does not offer anything. . At one scene, a biker, who attacked a woman, shouted, "You are all just!" He says. A minute later we returned to the scene and again said, "You are the same!" He says. Does the writer think something more creative? <br /> <br /> In the end, good guys killed bad guys. We also learn that a marriage between medieval mechanics Joe and young Susie has been abolished. Susie goes to college and we learn that at one point Joe's is still there (but with a different bride). Last.
