I read all the time 'a wrinkle of the book' and then I saw the movie. The film had all the elements of the book, but the book consisted of 190 pages, and the film was 2 hours, really concentrated on many effects and bad actions. <br /> <br /> Meg's, Charles Wallace and Calvin's girlfriend Megin must come together to find his father and get out of Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really stinker. The player is terrific in the direction of laugh and so far there are no situations. I really had to see Madeleine Engle, the same person who wrote a book and created a great film and a terrifying film. Acting is worse than any plain-to-video activity. Yes, I have acknowledged that it's a cool effect. But all that they took seriously could not have been serial in any way. When you read a book, you will be split by the movie. I wish I could give it 0, but unfortunately I can only give it. Half could be useful.
