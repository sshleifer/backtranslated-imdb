I love the sexy acts and fantasy films of the Sixties and the actress who appears in them. They found the most attractive women in these films and they did not have anything to do with it (remember "Sweetie"?). This movie was disappointing for me because it was not nostalgic. The story here is a European movie, called "Dragonfly", and the director's dismissal. Thus, producers decide to allow the young talented director (Jeremy Davies) to complete the pictures. They are a real nice woman in the movie that Dragonfly plays, but she's just there. The film was written and directed by Roman Coppola, who used some of his ancestors' use in his early days. I want the film to respect these early films. Many actors emerged in them. This film features an actor known for the sixties and John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. As we know, I will continue to expect the director to respect the films of the sixties. If someone reads it, "be as sexy as possible"! I am waiting!
