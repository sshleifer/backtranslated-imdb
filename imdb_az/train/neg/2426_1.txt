Trust me, this is a movie that you want to avoid, and it comes from a great Denzel Washington fan. Part of the disappointment is 1/3 of ALL movie. The first part of this film is an exceptional job of creating a new relationship between the girl paid to protect with Creity. He notes that all those attending this film were abducted. So, when I say that the film has been abandoned, it's almost unexpected, and I say nothing. If the director is able to succeed, he or she will make the audience feel as if it is making it awkward. After half an hour and a half, Creasy's faults follow, as fast, strange and scattered. These shots are unnatural and irritating, and all that they do is to get you out of the story. The author said that this was a change in Creasy's character in a way that was not disturbing to present this story, and that he followed a different film. Yes, he was right. The following movie was full and unpleasantly drowned. As a result, the film's forty-minute quality is so damaging that it's a tragic end.
