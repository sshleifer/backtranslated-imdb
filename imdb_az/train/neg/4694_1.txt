When I was attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX, I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig. But after the Big Rig ended, I wanted to get out of the seat. Big Rig consists of several "big devices" driven out to deliver goods that are managed in the United States. Heroes are all nice people, but filmmakers have never deepened the complexity of people. Instead, the story involves the management of the film, but nothing else. Most lost. We - the viewer - will not go anywhere and the story ends without a place, but with no direction, space or space. Why are we here? Where we are? How come here? Stories are open, and a group of directors who consider the "humanist" intentions to be "unseen" and "invisible" is perceived as unconscious and irritable. The problem here is in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck driver. The directors have their loyalty assumptions about the progress of the loaders, and then they just make the movie to confirm these assumptions. Generally speaking, the story is not deprived of any tension; the film is not entirely long-lasting (it should be a 15-minute sketch), the question of "What's the matter" and the whole movie is a direct propaganda that nothing more to clarify as the directors claim.)
