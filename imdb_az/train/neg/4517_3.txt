There is plenty to thank here: spectacular places and flying sequences; period suits, props and sets; and writing and moving writing. However, at least one author needs some or all of the features we can enjoy to enjoy a drama. This gang catty snobs, we found only one character which is all likable? an impatient man who has an inevitable peripheral role as a helpless victim. It is clear that we are completely in the process of analyzes, but we did not find them harmful and fun schooling fun. Even dog charges. We rolled into a sheet after two of the six episodes, so we should definitely lower these observations, but what I wrote about this mini-series did not give us any reason to wait for the character to change or retrieve.
