I did not know anything about this movie, but did not agree to see a friend who heard that it was an "epic battle scene from beginning to end." It could not be more than the truth. It was one of the most delicate, badly written, amateur-directed, terrifying films. I was sorting out the movie I thought was the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. In fact, there is no story, it is difficult to believe that the creators of this film think that the genuine genre of the soap opera is a true fact. Also, like this little ship ... the worst dialogue I've heard ... Guy says to the girl, "You smell like a moon." The girl answers "Do you smell like a moon?" OH, MY GOD! Do not deceive me! After the man shot and a quarter of the audience had a good laugh, it was so ridiculously cheap, and the voice of the man who was rattling at one another reminded one who was singing with the FX mouth. If you play in a nearby theater, do not waste any kind of money. This movie is so bad that in fact I decided to take 45 minutes to get to my dream ... and I did. Terrible.
