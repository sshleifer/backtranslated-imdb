The theme looks pretty dated today. Adapted for television from Rona Jaffe's book; we stroll and stumble with a fantasy presence. Four college students engage in deeper playing on the live version of board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, goes deep into the fantasy world. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace hit the fourth part of the game. <br /> <br /> It looks lumbering and fictitious on this date. But Tom Hanks is watching "Bosom Buddies" on the salad days and the big breakthroughs on the silver screen at SPLASH. The youngest part of the audience will use the most.
