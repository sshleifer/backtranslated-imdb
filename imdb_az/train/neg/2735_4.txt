I thought it was not the best cover episode I've ever seen (although my review partner, Brendan Fraser presented me with an instant tissue ... * * *). As with these days, it's nice to be able to see outside the Coxism State for a short while. I was also trying to place the episode of the character's hair length (or height in the case of JD) and the earliest episode of youth. And how can I see how Zach may be on the Chevy Chase or Matthew Perry? prat-falling chemical slide (so far approved by Conan). A little bit of note, the song from dance montage created by the song (now in my head) was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
