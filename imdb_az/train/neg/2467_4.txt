This movie also earns 6/10 and 9/10 out of me. That is why: As a standard film of fear for the standard of fear, this film will bring you into action, where the action and the fears and fears are taken into account. This is a family drama similar to what you see in a lifetime channel, but it is put into a horror universe. The story and formulas are centuries, retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the solution structure or minimal conflict, you will be disappointed. Remove the zombie and you will have something like melodrama, a nice mind, with cheese. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the main discussion and idea is quite original and top. Probably something that will joke when you and your friends are half intoxicated. . . but this joke really had the freedom of theater. The idea is 9/10 from me. The only reason they are not perfect is because they are farther away from it, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The mixture of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but it was not funny, as with all the comedies. My mother and younger brother were watching me, and the jokes we talked about were more fun than jokes. <br /> <br /> There was a very happy moment for me, but there were moments of apparent weakness. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films get such high risk and original ideas. <br /> <br /> BIG family movie. </ Strong> <br /> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; a great movie to watch with a bunch of kids (or girls). A great movie to watch with everyone ... but if you follow it one by one, it will be a bit boring. <br /> <br /> 4/10
