I can not say a lot about this movie. I think he speaks for himself (just like the ones available here). I rented about two years ago and I regretted it. I even tried it twice, but I could not. I say safely that I never want to see this loss of time. And I am not in a movie, but I really believe this is terrible. The smallest thing was not even funny. There were several scenes with Christopher Walken in my single moments. In my opinion, this film was destroyed both by Jack Black and Ben Stiller. Now, when I see one of their films, all the days I can think of is a horrible film and reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> In general, I think I have an idea. Roads are also for Walken.
