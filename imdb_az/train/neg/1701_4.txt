David Lynch's harsh and harsh style in the South Park presents us with a nightmare of clich√©s that worry about suburban middle-class families. The father is a lifestyle that has three gears and the biggest horrible noises, and unusual creatures that are constantly horrified by his mother are a lifestyle for terror. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie Airborne, Wild People in the Country), and I am not worthy of general comedies. . But there were several scenes in Dumbland, which made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Unlike Lynch's symbolic arrangement, there are some clever bitmaps of animated cinematography, which, in contrast to face-to-face expressions (which does not really change in Dumbland), provide a wide spectrum of reactions in symbols. <br /> <br /> If Lynch truly had an exciting, animated comedy here, he would try to get his audience straight ahead. It is remarkable that he chose to follow the footsteps of the ultra-low brown humor (most of Will Farrell's films), even adding a bad public criticism and classic cartoon intensity and global humor elements. If the mixture does not really work well here, it's nothing like Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Value worthy of Lynch fans.
