I gave this movie on 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, I find it hard to take this movie seriously. It was a night at AMC and I saw it for free. This movie is good for a few laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not average for the season - not terrible, but also great. Of course, we know more about Mars now, but we can not really hold it against that movie. The reason I'm not fond of this movie is the story. <br /> <br /> Some parts of this film are a bit more detailed - the cosmonaut's injury / condition would be investigated. Mars on Mars, creatures on the lake, and so on. Generally, the film resembles a long episode of The Outer Limits' version of the 1960s, which has been completed with a delightful ending.
