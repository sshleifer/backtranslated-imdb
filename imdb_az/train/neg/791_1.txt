Take the stage scenario where writers are sitting around a table and ask, "Ask a black woman to get closer to a non-community member (or black) in the community, and then go and go." Other writers hysterically laugh before they propose to repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now you think that the place is funny and there are so many similarities in the show, and you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zipper and find something more fun like dye. Those who write brilliant stories about this show should have to go out or watch television comedies that are really funny. A girl with another example of humor in the show is trying to hypnotize a cash register and trying to get out of a supermarket. Marginally funny for the first time, but why not repeat different shows with different cashiers? I can give other examples, but these can only be considered as spoiler declaring that this comedy is not just funny.
