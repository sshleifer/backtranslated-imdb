Firstly, the warning I saw with this TV on television and English - could be totally disruptive of the atmosphere. But I will appreciate what I have seen and hope that this version will govern people. I found this movie extremely boring. The atmosphere of the whole movie disappeared dubbed by leaving the stalker film slowly disappointed. Sorry, but the worst movie in my book is not an exception to film about the guilt of philosophy. I did not see deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I had left something, but I did not see it. I called it "1". Maybe, what can I say about the pleasures of the United States?
