Thus, the Prom Night should have been a fear and a tension movie. <br /> <br /> I was afraid to see this movie first, but if you see it, it's neither fear nor triller. so predicted. You can guess what will happen. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it was good to play the heroes of young players, but I had to say that the killer was definitely on the game. it was good, but not exciting and not intimidating. Almost zero "skip to the ground" scenes. So do not waste ten dollars in theaters and wait for DVDs to come.
