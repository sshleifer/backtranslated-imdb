In Time Chronicles, I was pushed through the stories similar to that of Wrath. My dream was to read one day at Winkle in Time when a screenwriter's child was sitting on a big sofa, and he thought he would do a great movie. Unfortunately, the failure of the screenwriter, the change of characters, the naked humor and the destruction of the whole structure. It's a tough task to turn a well-loved novel into a movie. But why do not you keep the truth in the book? Why do you need to think and act on the characters? For those who have not read the book, take it, find a soft sofa and throw your imagination wild.
