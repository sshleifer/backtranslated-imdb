My husband and I saw the front view of this movie while watching another DVD and thought, "John Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach, should be better in the summer reruns, so I order him local library." Lawrence Welk " "I'm sorry for the actors to read the mystery of their home, and I did not think it was going to happen to them." They say the lines in front of a camera maybe at least, maybe next time a movie is presented , they say, "Just Say No!"
