Others can review Bilal's other works by claiming that this film is better appreciated and fails in the least. It does not depend on yourself. The plot is a mishmash that blends symbolism with matter. Here is an idea starting with a certain story. Then around the symbolism mastery. We start with two different narratives: this woman, who turns people in some way, is not a "god" for some reason, but will be pushed to the next earth and this kind of "mystery" is beyond the city's boundaries. There is no development to want us to follow any character in the story, we get closer to Jill, and then the development is the best thing to do. Unfortunately, the film is all visionary (but) motivated, I would like to see someone who can move away from a bit of material and re-write someone who does not feel that every person should be in the picture.
