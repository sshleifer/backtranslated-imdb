Some people really like it. However, they still call themselves Batman fans. It even goes to say that it is better than BTAS. Which is not. The name Batman should be plagiarized to use for this crap. <br /> <br /> <strong> Not Batman. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> Batman is not related to weapons. He uses a baton and a runaway hook and Batmobile. He does not have a new masterpiece every time he's hitting it. I know where the hell is, they've got ideas for Batbot. or whatever. They destroyed all the plot. Mr Freeze came to a small criminal with a bit of a fraudster than a sympathetic scientist. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with silence suit. Penguin is now a 50 ft long top-necked ninja. The Ventriloquist is now called the Scarface, the Dummy is all centered for the character. There is even a dumb idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character change Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler to a Gothic / Retro teenage freaka. and sends an acrobat to Joker with fear. She looks like Bob Marley wannabe. The B & R has completely and completely destroyed the bates, even moreso! I can see the creator or writers and animators of this show, so I can throw them through a metal baseball racing.
