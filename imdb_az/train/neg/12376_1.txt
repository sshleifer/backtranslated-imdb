<br /> <br /> From today, Human sucked it! Very gracious cuts, an extremely annoying spokesman and fights against them were heavily modified and shortened (especially from the legendary Fists and Jackie Chan's drunken master 2 fight, Jet Li fight). <Br /> And what is the deal with these rebellious street fighters? What is "cool" about this? <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never take this movie! <br /> <br /> Do not encourage those who encourage this hell to do more than this shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, buy the battles and their fierce battles!
