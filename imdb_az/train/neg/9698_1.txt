There are many talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. None of these are related to this movie. <br /> <br /> Why do the world's producers spend money on something like this? You could build up to 10 good movies with this trash bud! This mature adult looks like a dwarf, not fun, but funny. <br /> <br /> The director of the movie (the oldest man in the band) plays the youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> You need to laugh now for the film's shooting! "<br /> <br /> Many people have really stood up and left in the movie for a 30-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Pain!
