I would not like to get a piece of GARBAGE to zero, unfortunately, so I gave you a warning cartoon to warn you how awful this horrible thing is! The heroes seem to be drawn by pre-schoolers, but wait, I've seen that preschoolers are better! I prefer this terrible pretext "Flapjack misadventures" for a cartoon! Maybe I say what others have said, two words: RIP OFF! Remember that you download Dexter's laboratory from this volcano. Yes, Mister Fellows even betrayed this idea and failed! They even compressed Shadow Lugia in an episode that parodies Parody! (He even fallen on this franchise!) This one was a cheapest hit from Dexter's Labard to Mandark! Mister Fellows should be allegedly infringed for the crap! Everyone has their own ideas, but those who love the Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test are just lying to you. Do yourself a favor and change the channel while trying to deflect this demolition screen!
