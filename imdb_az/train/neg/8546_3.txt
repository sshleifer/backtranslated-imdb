Very modest, incredible and not dependent on Spanish production ... well, let's see how close I am. The film opens with a woman killed by a young girl in a cat. She calls her lover to take her vacation. He called for the job and demanded that he leave the vacation and pay for it. What is the idea of ​​this person at the end of the movie? Because the heartwarming photographer, a beautiful Patty Shepard boy, is a queen of Spanish horror movies, can take a picture to wipe the bikini top at once. He led him to dinner and then to the task of the Witch Mountain - never again want us. Before they leave, Patty sounds "eerie" in our house and with a loud voice in the hero's ears. Again, this has never been disclosed. The film goes through the two halves, going to the mountains, and finally recognizing that the mountain is called Mount Witches. You know, there are many features that make this movie better than a bad movie. There are some atmosphere, some character actors are really good (especially the deaf and the aged woman), the results are at least adequate, and everything does not mean absolutely no good choreography (with intelligent brassieres and long black hair witches). It does not mean just one sense, and it's a big disaster for me. I could watch the movie ten times and did not get much information from the first sight. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a long, interesting film from the cheap, atmospheric European fears filmed for decades. Better power if you can get more than me.
