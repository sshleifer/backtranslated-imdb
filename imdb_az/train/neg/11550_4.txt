I knew I would see a low budget movie, but I expected more from Alex Cox. The two leading men were terrified, especially the white man. The girl should have won an Oscar for the two of them. This film filled with what I thought was going to be jokes for movie industry guys and that I thought I would be in a few other jokes I really understood and laughed at the rare one. Without these laugh-out-loud moments I would have given this movie 2/10. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Why did a Mexican man go to the other boy's house at the head? 100 people because of her daughter's last job? Why did he break himself when he beat himself? I think I should not go to Q & A after the movie, but I did not want to stay at 10.
