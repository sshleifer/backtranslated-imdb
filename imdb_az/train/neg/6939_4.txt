R Balki is trying to tell you a story that was previously described by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has an Indian cuisine in London. He is very proud and arrogant and respects his work as another. According to him, Cooking is an art. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hyderabadi Biryani can not be set up correctly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Taboo sends the appropriate Hyderabadi Biryani by him, and begins to meet soon and fall in love with each other? Amitabh 65 is Tabu 35. No probs! But a Hitch! Tabesh's father, Paresh Rawal !! Couples decide to meet their father for the marriage. But Amitabh knows Taboo's father is smaller. And the complications begin? The performance of all three actors is clever. The movie script is very intense and interesting. The film's dialogues are appealing. However, you feel that the stomach is not properly filled. The comedy is sometimes misunderstood. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The camera is good. Manager R Balki could have done better than this script. But in the second half, it seems confused. There was irritation on the "Satyagra" scene of his father. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Chechen sand had more sugar.
