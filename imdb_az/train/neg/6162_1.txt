"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but no one wanted it. This boot was a rifle, but there was a brain. There was a very intelligent script with a characteristic and entertaining level to be defined. Smiling people came out of the theater. "Hooper" does not provide any of these. There is no reason to smile. If Hollywood Stuntman is likely to be respected, it forces them to be so frustrated with the scenes of bad-choreographic struggles and nothing more than the most unconvincing car leaps I've ever seen. All of them are fairly usual with fake, bad pictures. The weakest Sally Field (like a girlfriend in the hands of her exterior) is given her weakest role, not a comic or clever line ("do this jump, I will not be here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds looks at the camera and keeps tears, but the joke is on every audience sitting on Hooper. * from ****
