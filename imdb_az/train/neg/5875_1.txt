The film co-ordinates two old football players, Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), and works as private eyes and welcomes all ladies and men with bad roots. Mack Derringer is approaching by former wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who has been able to speak sexually. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do terrible things and wants some help with her. Mack & Lenny have more time in their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. in a golf course or in a Sports Bar where all kinds of things are going on. There are many blows, murders and many meanings that bring this movie to a great ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me 50 cents a lot.
