The German nut is in the position of JÃ¶rg Buttgereit - but I do not know why I am one of them! The only Buttgereit I've seen before was Nekromantik and I hated every minute, but it does not shock - this is worse than a movie! Der Todesking is nonsensical in the same way as Nekromantik, but this is worse than a movie because it does not control a few movies (this Blair Witch Project is not far). Some people say that this film is "sick" and "shocked", but not really. The director may be related to death, but he knows what it is. Everyone can watch this movie and there is nothing else to compress with. The film takes place around the subject of suicide and causes the death of seven different people within a week. Yes, this is a meaningless and boring episode for Monday, a meaningless and boring episode for Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on. There is a meaningless and boring episode for you. This movie gets duller than my average weekend! <br /> <br /> Der Todesking is a 'art' movie, although it does not refer to a film that looks like 'art' but is not very meaningful. Each segment of the movie means telling a different story - but that's not it! We're just getting a quick thumbnail of suicide, and that's just what it's all about. The film feels like it should be deep, but there is a huge gap that there is no intelligence, and there is nothing to fill it up. Buttgereit uses several evocative images; but it is impossible to remember one or more of a movie because this movie is not only memorable. There is a stroke that reflects the body of a tough man, but the old one is pretty fast, and the whole film is the rest of the film. I had to fight to tell good things about this crap, all I can think of; the title sounds. I said that Nekromantik was the only film I saw from this amateur director; I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2, and now I am not in a hurry to watch. Der Todesking is a dull movie with no point and everyone who says 'art' is very wrong. Give it a miss.
