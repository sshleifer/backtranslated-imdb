I was the 11th grade pupil in the high school. A classmate in my classroom working in the current world watched this video and offered to watch us. So we did. I believe we go to the moon, but my dad works for NASA. Though I think this movie is the biggest part I have ever watched, the creator of it has a serious ball. First, had to show JFK's shooting? And how dare you use all the biblical quotes. The only good thing about this film is the sparks of discussions, and there are weekly discussions in my class that are good. This movie did not do anything to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore could be called "a funny thing happening on Thursday" or "a funny thing happening on the road to the White House."
