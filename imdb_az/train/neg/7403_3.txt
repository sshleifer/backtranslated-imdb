This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's a lot of talk about it. It starts with some good atmosphere; the hospital is sterile and alienated, the mood becomes "excited". And then ... nothing. Yes, something. No effort is made to clarify the relationship between the stunning and still not intimidating bodies and the hospital they have taken. So come, biker duds? <br /> <br /> Some groups were watching Gwar a little. <br /> <br /> My personal darling was the protagonist, trying to look at many dangers like an average-aged truck, to sit on a sofa couch, strap his belt, watch a game of cheap beer (likely Schlitz) and play . Honestly, I saw many scary dealers. On trucks. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are more cartoon and less scary. At least, on DVD, the videos describe their presence in the hospital ... As you can see, it only opens at random, plays bippy "metal" and causes people to die a little. A few good special effects are not entirely horrible, given that there is no barrier and no proper writing, so there's only one thing here. It's just a background noise movie.
