Magnolia presents hysterical twits like a wall wall walled by self-aggravating, stinging, angry, regrettable, guilty, and painful. <br /> <br /> PT Anderson is, of course, a talented film director, but maybe he should leave the writing to someone else or tell him to fix this difficulty to find at least one ball. <br /> <br /> Say that the performances are perfect and they were. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out that every scene does not cause the past sins or the pain caused by the longest match. <br /> I also think that Anderson is creating a story parallel to strange tables that open the film. It is remarkable that the sequence of sequence can bring together the people and the conditions of destiny, and that the most optimistic believer betrays the cosmic puppeteer who pulls our belts. But then the developing story is that there is nothing to show these opening lines. I was expecting some cosmic rapprochement to show myself, but instead, we are sorry for the characters that we see in the past and are now morally challenged by the quest for absolution. <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ span> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; Aimee Mann says that music is very good and I'm looking for a Soundtrack CD, in short, watching and listening to a good movie that the actors were tied up or tasted (music, that is, a good movie)
