Not a woman's movie, it's a network movie. One of the worst movies by a woman on the woman. Director Andy McKay just does not know the woman. Poor tasting peaks, humorous style of the American Peygamber, imaginary story, no meaning, unfounded story, denied characters. Vulgar fantasies came on the screen in the yard. It's insulting and not necessarily funny. I do not know, there were three good actresses.
