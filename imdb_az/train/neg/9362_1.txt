It sounded like the word of the field. To be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie, I had to make a decision. Is it worth watching until the end of this movie? The answer was clear! The human body was unable to transplant it with a different kind of rejection. The main reason why they are being persecuted by secret government agencies for human / wolf transplants. Because the movie was written in a bad way, there were no emotions, and I dropped some sleep sequences with wolves and did not understand with the buffalos. When I go to the zoo with a dog kit and put it in front of the zoo gate, I say, "I can not escape with big dogs, do not leave my donkey." Take your time and skip this movie. If you have the courage to tell me, I'll give you a guarantee, but I wondered if the American movies were money, time, energy, and effort to betray these insults.
