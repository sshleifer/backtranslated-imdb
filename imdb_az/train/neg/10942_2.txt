Lorenzo Lamas remains an old Vietnamese veterier and a rescue police officer, bringing together Kelly and Jack Solidar, who performs a search and destruction mission to rescue her brother from returning home. The Atrocious film, Ron Palilo, is cheap and very bad for the third time being billed, and still has a 3-minute screen, and even this is not good. A common terrible film, but the scenes closing down with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell deserve a few (unintentional) laughs. Continued with an upgraded resume.
