This is the worst case of a classic story I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Poems are rarely reflected in the story. They appear randomly discarded. <br /> <br /> The flying scene with Marley is meaningless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the worst films I've ever seen, but it's the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br> Probably only one classic, because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. Not just the original story is a classic, it does not mean some cheap adaptation.
