Man is one of the most distant places of the earth and now travels to the new world. But with the new worlds comes old evil things ... the vampires of the earth. Not just a handful of all tribes. <br /> <br /> I see what happens when we encounter imperialist vampires in the imperialist worlds in this film (like the Bloodsuckers, but I am also going to Vampire Wars). <br /> Because it is not worthy of a good review. For the film, we can say the best thing is that the b-list and the future stars have a good shape. Natassia was Malthe Quintana and was more attractive here than "Bloodrayne 2". Michael Ironside Muco and always a fan favorite (I mean, he is poor man Jack Nicholson). We also have Carrie-Ann Fleming, who is the "Damian's Wife", whom Dora Argento's "Jennifer" is now known as Jennifer. So this movie, as it's bad, has not been added to some names ... but it can also be related to Uwe Boll's case. <br /> <br /> The concept of killing vampires in space and space is not necessarily a bad idea, but it easily falls into the "cheese" world, and this film is difficult. Especially the player from the vampire is above the top, and I'm not convinced of the explanation of their existence. The worst vampire tribes have Voorhess and Leatherfaces names. I understood that it should have been a clever reference to the fans of fear, but it was not smart. <br /> <br /> It's just horrible and out of place (in contrast to the more sophisticated references to James Gunn's "Slither", the names of shops after less well-known horror directors). <br /> <br /> I want to say that. If you have a lot of cheese (today I could not do) and you can stop very long, and if you want to fight with vampires in the space where there are space actors with space costumes ("the place" looks like any other forest on earth), check it if you can find it. I do not recommend it when you can watch other stunning vampire films (John Carpenter's Vampires) or other cheerful movies. Or maybe even some good ones. But, hey, your business.
