<br /> <br /> I rented this movie last night, because my girlfriend or I never saw it, although it was "how big" it was from a friend. but I thought, but who would manage it would be quite liberal. Before the movie began, I thought Michael Douglas would play a beloved popular liberal, loved by the masses, and would be a conservative opponent, like his antagonist. But I thought that the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> Okay, the body was generous: there is a single president lobbyist. Okay, that's my potential, it was pretty fun. But then the film turned into a liberal infomercial. The film talked more about arms control and environmental issues than the relationship between President and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several funny buildings in this movie: 1) The six-figure lobby "closer". Is it more brilliant? He had not been dispersed and seemed to be afraid of everything. A tough "close". <br /> <br /> 2) Is there something more fun that something Richard Dreyfuss plays fanatically from the right wing? He is Hollywood's most liberal man and plays his right wing ideology. Give me some time. <br /> <br /> 3) In the end, talking was just funny. The line on "I'm a member of ACLU's My Honor" was a joke. First, no president did not accept such a thing, became an active member of an ultra-fringe group. Secondly, why can we do that? <br /> <br /> I'm talking about events in the Caucasus. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. "<br /> <br /> The film's left-wing political statement turned out to be a movie, and that's why the film's failure. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that seeks a large area that has forced Hollywood's political views
