My genre is a friend who puts it when we get to know a few beers when we get to know a street fight up until that flat DVD. <br /> <br /> <strong> Accident in the Caucasus </ b> <br /> <br /> A fighter for uncertain reasons as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> <strong> I understand that films like this do not believe in the plot, but do they have something in this ridiculous, predictable and heartwarming storyline? It may not be important, but the pencil is gently disturbed by me. No plot and cleaner movement than a confused story of a story. It is totally unfounded and unfounded, it is kinematic equivalence of Turkey with thin skin filled with rotten bowel. Perhaps, at this point, of course, I must point out the film's shooting point. Even the war itself is very weak. A tough guy who is well-built in bones alone blows street fighters (a great hearing or laughworthy attempt to correct this mismatch of two film makers); Warriors who do not seem to attack anybody are a foolish trick. <br /> <br /> Behold, it is repetitive and stupid, broken arms and faces have begun with a lasting vigor to see the time and the time again. <br /> <br /> Mill mill is a completely straightforward DVD status, something we do not do anything and everything we see in time and time. And not particularly good.
