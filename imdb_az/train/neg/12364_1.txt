God, I'm shocked by the shit from America called "Cartoon Movies"! <br /> <br /> After the popularity of Anime, US animators produce a cartoon with a 5 year old lazy donkey (Kappa Mikey) or some strange Japanese animated designs. (Usually mix classic characters) Anime does not have to beat American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They are even working now! <br /> <br /> Because I heard this last night; I live in the UK and when I went to this show for the first time in 2005, I knew well that it was never full of British demonstrations.
