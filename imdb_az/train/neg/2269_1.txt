Making a movie about an already existing talk show and letting you do everything in the show! If it does not worry you should not worry, it should not do it, keep away from the ringmaster. I was dissatisfied with seeing this in the theater and actually managed to get into this confusion of the movie. Undoubtedly, Jerry Springer does not play himself as he shows for his show of cheap props (which is cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and is known only as jerry in the movie. While living with her mother, the wife (if you can say that) begins to sleep with her mother, the mother on the main road. So, the brilliant idea of ​​her mother, as well as agreeing with her daughter's wife, is to invite Jerry Springer to the show. (A coincidence they live in a trailer park). At the same time, a woman in America finds a man who finds a wife in bed with her in another place. Of course, call American therapist Jerry Springer! I'm talking about the rest of the movie, but I think about the movie now gives me headache. Jamie Pressly, her daughter, does not appear to be totally attractive in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff the stroke ass carate maker from the American ninja series? Now look at him as a white debris. It is undoubtedly a very terrible and invisible thing to "keep in touch with his character." But if you see fun idea of ​​Jerry Springer singing a country song about children that connects with their show or transvestites ... well ... JUST SHOW SHOW IN WATCH! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay in this flick.
