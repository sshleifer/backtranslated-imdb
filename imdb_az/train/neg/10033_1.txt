I was very worried about this action. Everything was scared. The comedy was teary, the action was over, the melodies were silent. Even the volume of the story was unbridled. From a writer who wrote successful scripts such as Guru and Dhoom, I had a high expectation. Actors acted very hard and did not help the movie. Of course, the Kareena screen has been put in a bikini, but in two seconds. I think I need to investigate how Hindi movie directors have been doing. They have to overcome many ways. In Chinese movies, this style works because it is their signature. But the Indian cinema's signature is songs. A good action film should not be more than two hours and should not look real. But in the future, I'm sure these action films will be more stringent. It should be noted that: Comedy and action movies are not mixed if not properly seen. Next time happiness.
