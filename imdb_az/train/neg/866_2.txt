"B plan" is paid by numbers, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Unfortunately, it is very offensive. <br /> <br /> Can Cryer is really popular in this "star" and "Pretty In Pink", and we're not as entertaining as ever. Grating does not even begin to describe its performance. Ricky (Mark Matheisen), a muscular, blonde, struggling actor (ridiculous!) Wants only to get worried and to pull off his hair. Talk about the nature of a stock ... ugh. At least three other characters are a little involved. Lisa Darr and Lance Guest plays a basic, optimistic, caring couple who are struggling to look after them. However, they are not dramatic, because their role is seemingly outdated, and they are not given enough screen time. Sara Mornell plays Gina, a beautiful and beautiful looking young woman who does not have to find the right friend of your lover. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie a million times before, but at least its condition eliminates some of the shortcomings caused by its predictability. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at this movie about his juvenile stereotypes. They just recognized Russia for something to force it to and force it to speak. He is described as being wild, ignorant and strange. They were just heated, though they were ordinary nonsense about gay. Gina decides to be gay for a while so she can not succeed with the children. Honestly. Gina was not a bad person because they were really taking the boat after delivering the lesbians when they threw Christmas at Christmas. In his delightful history, there was very short hair (I'm sure all lesbians are). Gina was very upset when she got the nerve to put on my lipstick (as I was dependent on the labor of all lesbians). Finally, her history, when Gina expressed her disappointment, is going around the party by hitting every woman and her mouth there. Of course, everybody knows that gays can stay loyal to less than a few hours or even years? <br /> <br /> Based on a tired and predictable premise for the start of this film, but with Cryer's challenging performance, this film, along with flowing stereotyping, squeezes the film down to the depth of the cinematography. 2/10
