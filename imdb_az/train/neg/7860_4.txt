Martin Weisz, the director of the solid "Rohtenburg", will be warm with Wes Craven, another shirt "The Hills Have Eyes 2". A legendary original, an incredible story and a cheery dog ​​boasting will be erased with a more technically polished remake (only name). A group of National Guard (and women) is sent to the field of research which covers the hills full of mutants. During the week, each soldier is selected. This is so. There is some scene of severe violence and reasonable brutality, but it's too little to excite. The film's "heroes" are clichés and mutants that are farther away from Craven's original "family" than Brian Thompson, "Cobra". Some creatures took Stan Winston from the "Wrong Turn". Most of the activity was well-painted by caves, The Descent, and Sam McCurdy. A funny aspect is the addition of a sympathetic mutant waving around Wes and Jonathan Craven's Hoather's Leatherface-like cave in the original Chainsaw. Weisz will be responsible for this dull mistake, but it is not really a fault, because he does all he can to preserve perfection and squeeze a bit of freshness from defective situations. Unfortunately, it's not a fan.
