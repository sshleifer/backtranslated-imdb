I love westerners. I could watch them all day. "Well, bad and ugly" loves my whole time. I've been watching "Silverado" for about 8 days as I have been featured on the CMT. However, in this film, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst West I have ever watched. Everything around the player was horrible. They will not explain anything at the end of something visible in the mysterious compass. The best part I think is a pretty canteen girl. Significant long pauses between the dialogue seemed deliberate to take the time to film the reasonable length. This movie did not even value the new rent paid in our local movie rentals shop. If I had such a thing, I felt like robbery and a renunciation. I realized that I hated seeing a movie just to finish one reason. It was so bad that I let it go half way. When you decide to do something else, please do a better job. Here is a kind of movie that has the potential to transform people into the West.
