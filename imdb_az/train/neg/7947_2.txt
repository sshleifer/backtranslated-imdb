When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Not as it seems. I have no idea if this movie is not allowed to appear on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> Acting is great for all players. I hated the story. The story was foolish. The film begins with a man with a seal on it. The seal breaks down and certain disasters occur. Water turns blood, oceans die, moon red, and so on. Conversion. <br /> <br /> The character of the woman was also heartwarming. He did not mean many things. As you can see a piece of paper with a date. By chance, she is the date she is about to give birth to her baby, and she begins to freaking about it and begins to explore it and asks what is all about religious people. <br /> Spoiler Alert * The worst two things happening in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claims he wants to kill God's parents and Demi Moore said that she was born after she gave birth to her baby and died. <br /> What happens here. A person who is mentally weak is shot and killed and begins apocalypse. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the middle of a major earthquake and causes childbirth. She touches her head, transmits her soul to the child, and then dies. Then the apocalypse stands. <br /> <br /> Why does God at one moment have a heart change? When the governor permits the execution of a mentally retarded man, is it all strange that a woman alone has the gift of forgiveness after transferring her soul to her baby? <br /> <br /> Last Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very stupid. Another religious end of the world propaganda piece. Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 2 stars from 10 years old. Good luck with many unhappiness!
