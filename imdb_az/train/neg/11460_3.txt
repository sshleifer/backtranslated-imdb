While trying to show how clever Orcas is, but at the moment (and quite indifferent), the audience makes the mistake of making the most silly movie. Richard Harris Quint plays .. Sorry, it's not a mistake, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who holds a shark for a living, but tries to catch ginance and a killer whale by the great mattress. When a female killer whale is caught (asking) a comrade (does not ask) goes to a roar and begins Captain Nolan (Do not Ask). Soon, Captain Nolan has something in common (he does not understand). Here's an amazingly beautiful movie. I was told that the start (whale noise and nothing else) is terrible and the last cranes (the most loved song) are quite fun.
