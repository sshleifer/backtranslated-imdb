I've seen and loved the first two truths. Especially the second reason is not just an attempt to do something good as the first one. And a stand-alone story. You do not need to know the first movie. I also enjoyed the "Free Willy". <br /> <br /> But third, here's absolutely useless! I tested him with a friend because we both loved the first two. We decided to stop after a half hour. The film is okay, there are funny parts inside it. But why? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. Arslan King's 1 1/2 What's Hot for me: Although the first movie is more entertaining, try to tell the story from its perspective. But why? I really want to know. You know that the views of the two who are watching the movie theater are really good. But what comes after is unnecessary. Many people like Timon and Pumba, and that's why they really exist. But many parts of me tried to be very funny. There is no luck, most not ridiculous, at least for me. Btw. What was the movie about? Did this mean that a) Timon and Pumba or b) was more fun than the first movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> Tim Stoppard with Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really funny and does not try to get out of Hamlet anymore.
