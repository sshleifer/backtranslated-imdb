Sometimes a new entrée from foreign films is served. This is their great attraction. They take away life and serve as much as they can. American films are rarely courageous to touch upon issues that society has forbidden. A fear that is too boring and fears of financial failure. The mighty dollar identifies their options. Something that invites European directors. In addition, the world's population is particularly vulnerable to "different" films, offering a great pleasure, especially from the unhappy and troublesome organs of mankind. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many viewers are fond of beauty, poetry, and lifestyle. The film "On the left side of the Father" offers an interesting audience. The family has been locked in the belief that the family is a union of obedience. However, when a patriarch of a family forgets his members, blood and humanity, full of flawless dreams and dark passions, are in opposition to themselves. Selton Mello plays his son André, who wants to control his inner passions with his father's philosophy of evidence. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is a young woman who wants to quench the thirst forbidden from the main water. Leonardo Medeiros, elder brother Pedro. The film offers a lot, but it takes a lot of time to say it. ***
