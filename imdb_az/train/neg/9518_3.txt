Bad performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Totally reduced support symbols. Unpleasant conversation as long as there is no real trick. An ending pancake finishes more flattering leaves, and you can close four circuits (that is, if you care about these wooden characters) since you have four more spaces. MacLaine is the only asset available. The next sequence of "Chicago title" calling for the character of Sinatra laughs. Music in that sequence is also weak. And on the final stage, when Martine's character was named a "pig" for a woman, she would almost go out and find a stone thrown on my television screen.
