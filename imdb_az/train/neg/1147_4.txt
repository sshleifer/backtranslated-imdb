This film belongs to the history of FBI because Knott Berry Farm is in the ancient West. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a sanctioned version of corruption. Teevee's Hoover's heavy hands along with quality script-reading actors, cheese sets, cheap sound effects and lighting (there was another kind of?) 101. Jimmy Stewart chewed Vera Miles decor in 20% of the dramatic potential, any noisy and gentle sign from the 'Amazon Forest' to the 'back yard barbecue' in every c-lister known in the mid-50's. Even weapons can be preserved and familiar. I think Mervyn Leroy is drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) exciting outsiders, nothing here is on a curio edge.
