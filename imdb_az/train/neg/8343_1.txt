Salvage is the worst horrible movie I've ever seen. There is nothing terrible about this. There is no right to be a good genre. First of all, I do not see how many people can think of such a great movie. If I had written anything, I would have been laughing and would be too embarrassed to follow others. Secondly, the player is strange and the leading actress is extremely upset. Thirdly, the story sucks, it's an excuse to use it before and make an inexpensive movie. Read the article behind the story and reveal the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you're spending 80 minutes looking at something that you're sorry. It's really bad for the Crooks and their name is ironic. All filled Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
