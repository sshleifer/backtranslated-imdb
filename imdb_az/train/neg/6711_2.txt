It was 1993. It was long before Phillip Seymour won Thomas's Oscars. Who knows who will be something extra in a movie with him? I've really been a paid addition to the "My Boyfriend's Back," a suburban city called Georgetown, TX in Austin. His original name was "Johnny Zombie" (heart changes to producers Thank God!) I've been on stage. I ran to watch the movie of the day released in the theater. More than a comedy than a fear movie. But for a good laugh, you may want to check it out. Cheese factors are good, not just something close to the quality of the "dawn of the dead" or the quality of the "dead shadows". ciao
