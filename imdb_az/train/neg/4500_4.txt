This movie is not really afraid. Some say that Mo is a shocking American of Europe. But not Anglo-Saxon dogs who are not careful of French, they also exist; <br /> <br /> <strong> Xavier does not want to touch them. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the features of his stereotypical French language: <br /> 1). Cynical - very kin. <br /> <br /> 2). <br /> <br /> 3). High appraisal of the kitchen. <br /> <br /> 4). Lukewarm business ethics. Check it out. (In fact, remember that he is a wealthy stockbroker, he watched it in a movie watching a ten-hour film.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Nevertheless: <br /> <br /> 6). An empty comment on marriage promises. <br /> <br /> 7). A big sex ego says that if you buy an American girl, she lends money to her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I like to see Karen Allen's lovely, rude body. I will give the movie four stars; Two of them are for this.
