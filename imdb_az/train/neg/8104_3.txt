Yes, I know cheap movies but this is a great example of how this film can be combined with a major critique of "depth" (political turmoil, love / lust) indicators (see 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie often runs amok on film plods and state images with interspersed (with one scene, three different "common European actors") and discipline sex scenes, often with painful dialogue followers, but offered a combination of meditation to Gunder. and over the course of more than three hours, Franz, the fourth man missing in the triangle of love, has shrunk to the central mechanism of the novel's emotions, and the power relationships that endure love. The novel uses some of the political points used to illustrate the example of the Sun does not give the wire screen time of his son. these defects make the movie three hours worse and still make it light.
