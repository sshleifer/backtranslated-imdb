I can see that the filmmakers are going to this place. But in fact they do not reach anywhere. Although some of the western spaghetti mythical philosophy has been identified in the modern era, it is, unfortunately, its attempt at a short time. There is no strange realism known by the Spaghetti West. and Italian hopelessly hopeless as Western partners and these two points fail, there is no successful parody humor. In fact, they seem to intend to make a serious film, but when they are finished, they have missed the brand so far, and, alas, they also missed a humorous track. The worst movie in all the lot!
