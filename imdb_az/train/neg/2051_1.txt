Write topic and so on. This is not a serial fantasy or a way to no imagination because there is nothing wrong with it. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see March's human hunter. No matter what happens in the midst of the 6th series, it's not true, and it really does not bring anything to the story of the March, except that Martian man does not want to meet with the hunter and spends 30 minutes. There is another bad article in Miniclip's soap opera. I love the show, but mostly cast and every year, due to 3 or better episodes, but it is necessary to conserve those used or written in soaps. This was one of the worst. In the first 4 minutes, you know what you know is fraudulent and everything is happening, a dream that is based on Clark's kick, which causes a character of character and will win when it wakes up, and the writers will not be aware of it. you really need to create a villain that will develop this week's story line. In the last episode, he added another villain to die, the martyred man was in his hunter, flew back or returned, and forgot to sneak out of his sunglasses and call one day to Clark to get a closer look in this episode.
