The old private security guard takes his last droning job and immediately offers a chance to return to his previous profession. Her assignment was to tail a mysterious French woman who came to California ... and, of course, wanted by the suit-racketeers. No attempt to update the movie's non-genre, without sufficient sufferings in the scenario, or without the delicacy (or plot dynamics). The author and co-writer Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was made without his presence) gave no impression that he rated the 40th film called 'Chandler'; his nostalgia fitted properly, but it was painful and somewhat indifferent. The use of the film is somewhat frivolous and humble, and Warren Oates is a good option over the "custom steep" archetype in the '70s, but the film has no effect. It is great to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame outdoors, though Caron's warm and cold character is awesome, with Alan Stenswold's outstanding cinematography, beautiful layout, but not coming from any source. * 1/2
