As others have mentioned, a kissing kiss begins with a strange prologue about a little blonde girl. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) accidentally met and walk in the mountains. First, a late-night entrepreneur carries out a nightmare by Gaffar in a ritual of irritation. They will once again seek refuge in the mountains and be invited by a good old lady who is very hospitable (Hansel and Gretel, who?) Then I'll go to a brave audience, t. Now I love Eurohorror, and only Artigot (writer and director) tried to explain the illogical story. Background (Pyrenees?) Holds an excellent and interesting place for mysterious and hidden events. Verdant peaks could easily protect supernatural forces and commanders. Photography is beautiful. I just want everything in the sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
