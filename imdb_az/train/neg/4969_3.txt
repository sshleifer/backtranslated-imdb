First, this Sci-Fi channel is not as bad as some of the other garbage produced; Grendel is not a good movie, in fact it is very bad, but it has the potential to be much better. <br /> <br /> The film's shortcomings come from character design, character, story absurd additions, visual effects, music and, in most cases, actorism. <br /> <br /> Speaking of character design, of course, means the appearance of our heroes and robbers. If Beowulf and other Danes look like ridiculous Vikings, they are not the strongest fighters of the protagonist - the helmet of our protagonist is very foolish. Grendel looks like Hulk, but there are strange tentacle additions to his elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. <br /> <br /> Beowulf is beginning to end, but Finn - a useless sidekick - thanks to his romantic subplot, thanks to a number of two-dimensional series and Unferth is also less modest, some ideas becomes. <br /> <br /> Like most Finnish, this story has unnecessary additions, and it still holds the source material to do so. The talent for Beowulf, the crossbow is not too ridiculous, I was surprised not to walk in the surprise set. Along with the annexes, there are mistakes as the main subject of Christianity and paganism, as a result of falsehood. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very strange. <br /> <br /> Grendel and her mother, Hag, have been thought weak, and thus, they are pictured on the screen, not convincing. <br /> <br /> Music,> All this, so far Sci-Fi is not the worst movie ever. Although it is one of the best films, the garbage is still a good garbage, the best sinful pleasure. The only thing he has to do is to have a throne in there and there. <br /> <br /> I think that Robert Zemeckis accepted the ancient story of Beowulf and simply this film, Grendel, is only half of the movie, and it's not a three star review.
