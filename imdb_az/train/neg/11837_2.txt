Can anyone make good CGI movies except Pixar? It's almost an animated version of the animation 2006 standards and even Toy Story standards of 1995. Or maybe they spent all their budgets on Hugh Jackman. <br /> <br /> Hyu Jackman is a mouse - a rat that washed on a toilet. I know, it looks stereotypical. But then the sewer has mimicked some of London's paths. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Maybe we're in a movie? Or maybe after a happy relationship. But nothing happened. There was talent, but it did. D-
