It's funny to watch "Beretta Island" as a natural debris movie. This is Jess Frankoun's response to the b-film type. Artistic builders push (! Face to face!) Hits what they are hitting. Very stupid strike! : look incredibly bad management shooting (shooting) scenes look better in hand fighting. scenes are ridiculous. Chiring beautiful scenes are incredibly stupid.The main successes of the erotic scenes are very scenic and festival scenes. The 'joke' Arnold Schwarzenegger is the joke of the beginning of the film and Franco Columbu's relatives list. Special attraction: naked mushrooms. Forget the applause - Franco sings!
