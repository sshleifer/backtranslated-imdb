Okay, it's very rare that I complained about something I bought for FREE. Here's what this movie has done to me. I saw the Hollywood Cemetery FREE and it was very disappointing. The fact that the director uses local American references as a "bookends" instead of a better touch on the film tells us everything that does not happen in this movie. Native American REFERENCES --- Local American references really went out of place and were attractive. Obviously, this director and writer tried to fight any arena that had never been played before. They must have joined the old name "write about something you know." In fact, although they were knowledgeable about it, they did not show the film and the beauty of this unique culture was not justified. <br /> <br /> Clichés and space --- I agree because this film is an indie. That is why I put him to higher expectations. The "Little Miss Sunshine" was indie and I saw it before the popularity. Before I was released, I was not embarrassed to be a hit. I could not say the same about the term "expiration date". Sunshine took us to cliché events, but filmmakers thought their outcome would lead us away from the trap of being a "cliché". On the other hand, there was no way to trap this movie because it was already TRAPPED from the start. <br /> <br /> <strong> An antics of a professional mother, a Hendrix couple, and so on. <br /> <br /> I hate to say this, but this year's best and worst movie I've ever seen was indy. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this film is the worst. I wish I could say something else. <br /> <br /> I congratulate filmmakers for leaving the family in a cemetery well.
