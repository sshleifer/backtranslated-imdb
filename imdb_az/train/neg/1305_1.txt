"The Demons III: The Ogre" is a classic hip horror of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2" in the pre-sequel. Demons III: Ogre is a very stupid, bored, inexperienced monster Writer confusion "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writers and vulnerable William Shakespeare ghost or Spider's website from the devil's egg or Huhuhuhuhu girl I'm sorry to hear that a special DVD box called "Demons" has been closed in three different films called "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" and has no subtitles costing $ 14.99 at the Best Buy store in Downey Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a poor quality writer who is almost as "Halloween III", but Michael Myer does not have a monster, but people wear Halloween. "I love" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 dull fool better than "D Emons III: The Ogre" is not the same as "Demons" and "The Demons 2". <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
