From the middle of the 80's, Reaganism and virulant anti-red feel of the right wing seemed to catch the US mood in the middle of the 80s, FIRST KAN SECTION II, an attack top-up action adventure, The emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of Moscow's "Evil Empire" would soon show such films unnecessary, even Reagan himself accepted this truth. <br /> In this sense, thank the "Gorby" for the US disarmament treaties, the Glasnost policy and even its support, which is being restored to the Eastern European countries in the backyard of the Soviet Union. such foolish, jingoist, swollen cold war adventures have diminished. The first RAMBO film was at least a very bad storyline, although at least it was a sufficiently competent and fairly moving tension, though it was perfect. After this, the conviction is immediately foolish, for the senses <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The success of a film's big box office could have left a war for many Americans, but they had an unfinished job and the heroic heroes with a hero robot <br /> <br / > It could have been fun at a SUPERMAN / SPIDERMAN level, but it's all just okay. It is impossible to say that there is no humor in the film, unfortunately, it is almost entirely unwanted. Experienced scenes, though technically enough, have never been convinced or convincing because they are always the most spectacular <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Stalin writes with James Cameron (a long way from the previous thrilling TERMINATOR), deliberately, Rambo comes with an almost understandable English character and merely moronic laughs, almost certainly his only patois it is also understood as he invented his own brand. For example, colleagues Cameron was thinking of Terminator again. lead character! In this sense, fewer people are found in Rambo Terminator! The rest of the cast is less good with good players such as Charles Napier and Richard Crenna, they appreciate the best of their hackneyed dialogue and Steven Berkoff is again insulted by another criminal role of the Russian KGB / Red Army. Berkoff's overplaying is soft, but not far from dangerous. How could Sly Berkoff survive the shock of electric shock, to kill more than the Red Commie pigeons? Well, this incredible movie is not a strong point. This is a fantasy job. It can be compared to OZ's Wizard. At least it turned out to be a fantasy and an immortal classic. It's just a classic, the most hateful and really sensitive, kind. Like Sly's civilization, after killing all these people, is hypocritical? By the way, in the same year ROCKY IV .......... made RATING: from 10 to 3.
