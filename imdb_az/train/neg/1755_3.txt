This movie is not deprived of its charm and shows a little heat, but ultimately this effort is not too loose and it is very powerful. <br /> <br /> Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all the screenshots, but she gets more attention from the rest of the screen. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the cliches of the script. Her secret daughter, who left the college, is a woman who has difficulty finding a good job (and, first of all, ends with a fair reductive job), small network administrators, toy players, their beliefs and so on. There is nothing to do. That is, all of them are actually rooted in reality, but in the same place they are very numerous and leave us with lots of deja-vu and very little surprises.
