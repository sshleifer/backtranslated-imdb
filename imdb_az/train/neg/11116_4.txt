A woman who works as a trainee for a photographer goes home and gets a bath where she finds the hole in the ceiling. So he learns that his neighbor is a photographer. This film might have come in a big area, but then it was followed by any hopes. The problem with this film is that the heroin is irritating every 10 seconds. It would be a pretty good movie if some of the erosion erotic irritations were produced. I thought everywhere that the scene was going somewhere, someone poured white powder. The use of such drugs in a film was really bare. This is a major illustration and drew a great story about a photographer. Lesbian stuff did not bother me. We were looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about the use of drugs.
