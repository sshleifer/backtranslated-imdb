Meet with Kubrick King. In the spring of 1980 he promised such a promise. Then the movie came out and the Kubrick clerics were facing the royal miners from that time. King Stanley Kubrick made a great horror story and destroyed it. The Kubrick devotees do not curse the king's story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles. This is a movie, they insist: This should be the essence. As is true, both camps are right. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If one simply accepts as King novel adaptation of "The Shining" is really a failure, wasted opportunity, a botched gambitidir story. <br /> <br /> I accused Kubrick's scenario. Writer Diane Johnson (Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) is known as a social behavior novelist. Perhaps he was selected to be closer to relationships or family dynamics. But in the little blue-colored city of Sidewinder, there is no map in the Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick Anglophile, apparently, found her rich. He is, of course, a real auteur. <br /> <br /> His miracles, "The Shining", a scenario - abnormal psychology, rationalism, and intended to reincarnation supernaturalizm mishmash - it just does not stand up to logical analysis. I'm ready to look at Kubrick's "Glitter" on their own terms. I'm even ready to accept something other than a traditional horror genre. But isolation, lying, and madness are not as successful as a natural work. <br /> <br /> I also want to mention that, is it only in mind? - First, is it frightened by Danny Torrance, then frightened by his father's heroism? How Jack tells Torren that he actually looks at a mirror when talking to a "soul". A frozen top-hedge of a hotel notes how the maze looks like Jack's twisted, rough psychological symbol. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if the "Running Blind" and "dreams" growing evidence Torrensin only təzahurudursə Jack, who had been trapped in the hotel's cuisine dead Jacki allow to produce striped closet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br> <BR > <BR> <BR> Və hər kəs izah edə bilər, bir düz üz ilə, qara-ağ fotoşəkili (faydalı bir şəkildə etiketli "1921") Nicholson bir smokin filmin bağlanma saniyəsi əsnasında sol sahədən çıxan və otelin balonu divarına çıxan kimdir? Do we seriously judge that Jack Torren's experience of "past life" is bad Craziness? <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick was not interested in his story line. Maybe it was just a fever. No matter what, the film is trying to protect itself from its talent bets - to have both ways, rationality and nature. As a result, the story is a mess. This film does not improve with age, and this does not necessarily improve with repeat views. <br /> <br /> For a long time, I have not denied the long film, fear, claustrophobia, and cardiac rebellion. However, those who have been repeatedly seen in Danny's vision are those who are nicknamed "Blood" with impeccable laugh. And Jack Torrens' humiliating tags ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Violate the dramatic tension of the film and distract her narrative energy. (I know that I was in the theater and laughing at the audience in a comic relief: "Of course, we should not take these things seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - Wendy strives to mask her husband's pupa during scenes around the loose hotel. There is a foyet full of mammed guests, and all the party hats are dead? Yikes, I'm really scared now. <br /> <br /> In a few years, given the brightness of Jack Nicholsonun the only visible-writhing, wink confusion, in the case of scenery producer, asked. Shelley Duvall's performance as a female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" was the best in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not succeed. not in their own circumstances, but in an adaptation. This is probably 10 to 3, but this forum has been rated at more than one rank.
