Imagine this pilot as "Hawaii Five-O Lite". In Hawaii, an action / adventure crime drama, scenic features sources, palm trees and polyester fabrics and torn shirts ... even starring with a supporting role-playing actor "Zulu". Oh, there are some minor differences - Roy Thinnes should have some front line secret agent and less supportive cast (and less interesting), but basically the atmosphere is still the same. The problem, "Hawaii Five-O" (another QM product) already existed and lasted for many years. It filled enough market demand for Hawaii based crime dramas. Code Name: The Diamond Head may have been meant to be H50's hierarchy, because the next series is finally moving away ... but it is regarded as a 2 nd copy. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Thinnes an old pro and he is the best shot and he is not bad, but Thinnes is as good as his materialist and director Ian McShane is here as a bad spy master, "Tree", and McShane is the most exciting player on any scene he sees Frances Ngyuen is quite exotic, but his stunning skin, opaque features, thick accent and wooden dreams are not the things that he believes to provide "romantic interest" for Thinnes, perhaps the biggest mistake of the series, at least, For a number of targeted audiences with Marsha Brady and Peggy Lee, give it another 30 lbs and give it a year with a dialogue / voice coach, Zulu, of course, a normal part of her feelings of pleasure. but it is not a person who has a feature. <br /> <br /> In addition, evidence and dialogue have nothing to separate from any Quinn Martin production. And at this point, American television viewers have seen most QM production .... I think "CN: DH" was a lot and sank without a trace. This is not really a defect of actors, and I hope they have a decent salary and once again, C.V. <br /> <br /> The MST3000 has animated them for treatment in the sixth season and has had a good fun with them. If you enjoy the MST approach for the movie version and the lamp, I would love to look at this version, but I can not imagine that this pilot is due to any reason.
