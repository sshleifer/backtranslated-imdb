This movie is really bad, so Christopher Lee can not even keep it. A weak story is a more fragile script and simply a bad aspect of this is a really frightening film, the only part I can only frighten is the movie I can honestly say I can never watch. This trash resembles an oscill on the edge of the 9th plan.
