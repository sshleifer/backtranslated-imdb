This is a pretty bad movie. But glory is not as bad as it is. Production values ​​are not bad and there is only one effect scene. And with the 80's cheezoid veneer, this is always an entertaining species. Take a look at Jimmy Nail's brief look - the emphasis in the emphasis on the American emphasis is so striking that it's fantastic. There are fantastic Sybil Danning's breasts - they give a short look in the film, but the scene is repeated in the last credits that can only be described as 12 remixes of Sybil Danning's body. As a horror film, it's not scary but its effect is clever and Christopher Lee is falling asleep. I think he bought a new home and needed some money for the deposit. women - very few, I almost forgot about them and only watched this movie this evening. Werewolfs are less impressive than the original movie, in fact they are strange, sometimes even worse than the badly burned monkeys. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> The European setting is pretty good and the music is provided by Babel, the new bandwidth is terribly at least the film does not give.
