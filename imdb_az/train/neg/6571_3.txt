I'm totally dissatisfied with a reviewer who describes Charley Chase as unfunny, of course in this movie. The other reviewer is only a few shameless suspects about seeing a couple of Charley Chase duds and the boy's not funny. Movies, MAGIC FIGHT, and PRICE PRICES like? Difficult movies are very good, so it can be really fun when given good material. Unfortunately, he did not do anything in this movie. Normally, Oliver Hardy does not have any assistant as a foil, since the basic foundation is that the gags are very poor, even though the boy wants to marry the girl. <br /> <br /> We will be surprised to see this movie used to look at Charlie in the mid-1920s. The chase sport is goggles or barefoot - and it looks like you've been waiting too little.
