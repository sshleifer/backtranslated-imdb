The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a Sneakpreview. Not even in the premiere. I remember there is a director there, and even who remembers. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so it was absolutely neutral without knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and holds the front of the whole castle. She plays an actor who has long star left. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> There is nothing against the word. But it was frustrating. Rourke comes naturally when using the word F *** to express something. <br /> <br /> In some cases, when one person f uses F **** or S ***, speaking non-English, it is arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We have often used the words F and S several times. Everyone was happy only in the theater. And we were forced to vote, but this was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10 and we were looking for -10.
