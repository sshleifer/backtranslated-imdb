If you're really an admirer of the bad movies and think that's fun there, you'll be the best player in Shagin. First, it's not hard to put pro players in movies. Shag was the worst actor I've ever seen with several bad movies, Dennis Rodman. In any way this movie is bad for an ugly kid. I would give it zero, but that's impossible.
