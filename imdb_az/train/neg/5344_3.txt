You remember the movie Spice Girls (apart from the songs), their director, Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) S Club (other favorite groups) makes the same mistake in his movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, John Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt, and Rachel Stevens (What's the Seventh member of Paul Cattermole?) They are basically going to break their boss and watch themselves on television! Three of them change, on the contrary, half clown made by a greedy scientist, and the other half worry about themselves. Gareth Gates himself played as a clone. This movie may have more space than Spice Girls, but it's no goo because this is the song "Get It All Back", "Move Movin" and "Never Already Exceeded". The group is very long after good separation. Enough!
