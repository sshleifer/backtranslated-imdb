It was a disappointment to look at this DVD after many years. The main problem for me is an uneven script. <br /> <br /> Some are sensitive and hip, though many are solid, incomplete and lifeless. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mae West and Rachel Welch are coming well. Roger Herren plays Rusty in brightness (not very bad movies). But for my money, John Huston has so much and poor Rex Reed is not given a challenging battlefield. <br /> <br /> What interests you in this movie? <br /> <br /> Low user rating should give an idea of ​​public opinion. The vidal's originality provided a great deal of spending. Even 'classic' movie clips did not do much. All of them have to do a little effort, and it is not likely to be better in time.
