Maybe you should compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are the original Hip Hop. Beat Street has a lot of early hip hop original artists, but it turned out clearly that they could have a great break. But you see it as a true Hip Hop culture that you make mistakes. Generally there are plenty of production and Hollywood sauce. On the contrary, watch the first two films I mentioned. The ghetto conveyed the strangeness that came to life inside. Yes, this movie's rating is low, but ratings are mostly positive or even nude. It's likely that the story, the moving, the dialogue and the direction are all dangerous, music and dance are the people's favorite theme. I love to dance, but then I am in the death of electro Hip Hop (I thought that in 1986, a new generation of classical Hip Hop artists, 'Krs One', Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie) and I still I do not like most of the shoots in this movie, and therefore it does not work for me. So Wild Style is not a story, music is great and original. Of course, the taste differs, and that's good. But since I am concerned, this movie is a jacket, except dance dances and some music, and I can not estimate it more than 4.
