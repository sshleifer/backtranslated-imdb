This series is only available to Dickens in some of Bleak House's films, and perhaps only a 2 star gets someone reading a book. Perhaps, contrary to what can be thought, Diana Rigg was bad as Lady Dedlock. He was polished and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character, not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong for Mr Jarndice. That's why I'm going to answer everyone who says, "I did not read a book, so I should not take the opinion of this man because he takes the groundwork in the book." It's true and right. Of course, Diana Rigg is worse than a bad guy who thinks he's reading a book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passive Jarndyce (though very old). Serial book comparison is not fair because it does not combine different lines and symbols to make dramatic, mysterious and attractive fun that does not match each other. Gentle and straightforward. If you want to make the best Bleak House in a difficult situation, you have to spend 20 hours on the 10-hour episode. But manufacturers and so on. They leave Dixies alone (even a Christmas Carol). Television destroys Dickens's genius as it appears in its unlucky field and unforgettable characters.
