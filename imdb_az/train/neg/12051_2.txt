This film is a "crushed stone", but in the same way a car crash. It's hard to see. Generally, this movie is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social research, and it is a biased and biased experience. Cinematographers are manipulating and do not have any problems with the least possible denominator. The way money is paid is pure abuse. Steps that are crucial for Tedin's participation (interview with Ted's experts) were empty, and he tried to contact Ted. Instead, it is a painful thing that they should cover the poster of the filmmaker and serve the Ted situation further. The worst part is that filmmakers stop Ted after 6 months; and, as we can see, was completely cut off from the issue that they had pursued many months ago. If they care, Ted would have found better "experts" to help. If they really want to see what Ted will do, then they should not waste money without interfering. This movie is not the best brown Jackass stunt, but a documentary. It was very sad to think how much he had changed after putting his life in the hands of a homeless man worth $ 100,000.
