This movie was extremely boring. Must be at least 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not comment, but it was so bad that it was very good and excellent comments. <br /> <br /> In this case, we were just a step closer to the valuation of this name. <br /> What else could I say? I fell asleep three times in this movie. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from the 8 hour sleep cycle. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Retract and hold back for going back to sleep.
