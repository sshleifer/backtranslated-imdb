This movie was previously written by Charlie Higson, who gave his own show based on one of the legendary Fast Show and one of the characters of the Fast Show (Tony Car Dealer). <br /> <br /> In fact, I've seen it just before Gordon's Lovecraft's stories, and each one is beautiful. Here Gordon is trying to do something different. The style is completely "modern", which means a vibrating camera, fast and strange cutting, cool music in the background. It works very well here, I think, but it's still trivial and cheap. It often thinks of the cameraman that I am trying to make movements in the pictures, which often shakes the dvd camera in front of actors / actresses (hoping to get something hopeful). Casting is good and there is an atmosphere of good leadership. I think the main character, the "zero" young boy, is quite incredibly interested in his "zeroness". The sweet man is also good. And like Alec Baldwin, it's not him. However, the film is not very interesting when it comes to the film's start-up: it is an infinite line of sadism and illness in this case. This movie / story does not have much humanity: It's totally pessimistic and everyone in this movie is disgusting, desperate, or dead. It is not necessary to say that there is no humor. At 1h40 long vomiting without any relief at any moment. Anyway, Gordon remains one of the most exciting movie producers I've ever had, and I think this movie as a trial, and I think it's a failure. Everyone should learn to be missing sometimes, only to learn and to find ways to go. It can be Gordon's most uninteresting and hollow job.
