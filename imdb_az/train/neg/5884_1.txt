I am a great movie fan. I love all kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> This is how I can get a closer look at the book that reveals a point that everything should not turn into a movie. <br /> <br /> These heroes are not interested, they are mentally ill. What you started is not funny; <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> I will never get these hours back. After watching, I wanted to wash my brain.
