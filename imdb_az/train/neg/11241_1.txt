If you're looking for eye candy, you can use Sky Captain. Sky Captain is a video game with only live performers. Vision is good and interesting to watch in the whole film. <br /> <br /> After eighteen minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst films of all time. I hope this film will be better, but it is not interested in anything. Those who want to go after thirty minutes are growing up and growing. Now I have more than 2000 movies, and I've seen five times that number. <br /> <br /> For some of the movies, this is the second film that comes out of my life. Three main performers are miserable. Jude Law (in another movie I want to go out) is just a freak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Following this speech, we welcomed this decision. <br /> <br /> Story - Soap opera is better written. <br /> <br /> The story behind the Sky Captain begins badly and continuously deteriorates as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Direction --- no one. Everything has been particularly affected by the story, the act of acting and directing it is great. <br /> <br /> You can give this movie "10" to "0". Do not pay for theater prices and wait for video to free.
