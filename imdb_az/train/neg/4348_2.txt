It was just a movie. It's frustrating to watch it. In the context of the film, almost every activity was incompetent (the actress was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor who really said something about the movie) and the area could have been predicted.Carlito Road had some good relationships, for example one day The dream to Carribian was generally weak, but it was a mistake, but it was controversial, but I did not expect much from watching the film, and I can say that these expectations are not met.I feel bad for Jay Hernandez, because he is a really decent actor (Friday night lights), he is lucky, but I'm sure there will not be many people watching this movie, and I usually give a movie that is worthy of my interest, so I will continue to do so and I'll give it two stars, and next time you get better luck.Yes, Carlito's Path I got it.
