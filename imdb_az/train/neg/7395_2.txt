As far as I know, TIW WATCHER is the youngest director's first job. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this is the work of a regular person who loves movies, or if he was a student of this film because there is a reference to the recent credits of the oporto school. <br /> Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates that some of the key ideas about cinema are not common. What is a movie? How can one story be explained? There is no need for an experienced director. When you read movies, one of the first things you read at school is to tell a story. As you know, in movies as in the novels, you need to build your story in three sections: introduction, development, and outcome. You will find that your story is a hero and antagonist and must be a peak. It's a 3 hour epic, regular movie for a 30-hour ad, for a short movie, and even if you believe it or not. You may also find that the degree of sensitivity may be the same as you approach the academic structure, and you can eventually correct it. <br /> <br /> From a rough point of view, TIM WATCHER presents us with the main character, and then the end of the movie - the whole movie sounds like a presentation of characters in Jeunet's AMÃ‰LIE. There are no second or third acts at TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art movie, so you can not try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. We look forward to a story and it does not happen. Worse than this, the TIM WATCHER designates itself as a warning; and there is no real purpose. At one point, or at least, it does not make a valid thing. His purpose is childhood with revenge. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more from this short time. The film opens with a pretty good looking credit sequence, and you'll quickly see that you're watching something better with regular production costs than a regular Portuguese short movie. I do not know the budget of this movie, but it should enter the production team for such good relationships in a country that is difficult to evaluate for the list of gratitude in the latest reports and difficult to open the doors for the perfect young filmmakers. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> TIM WATCHER looks like a workout that combines style, color, and carefully selected plans with a great score. All this. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And it generally feels like the loss of production values. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there are many available additions to Portugal to regularly enrich in different locations and one story. <br /> <br /> Compared to comparisons, it can be called absurd, as a good example of the BMW shorts, you can describe a good story in a very short film that is seriously involved in product placement and overlapping stylish cinematography.
