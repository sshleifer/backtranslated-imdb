While watching the movie, I'm not sure what I want to do. A writer should not focus on a job or even move it, you can not do all of this. The story has really been felt in this movie because the director is wearing a lot of hat. Female McTeer movie. She was the reason she was engaged to add her talent. An English actress who can do something here. In my opinion, the conflict is drama and a great story. I did not feel it was a movie. Everything was simpler for the characters, and there were no real obstacles preventing the martyrs from gaining what they wanted. Look at the sweetness of the film, but for Mrs. McTeer's brilliant performance.
