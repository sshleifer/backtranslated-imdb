Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, then you are a better person than me! Although this film is a great attraction to Laurel and Hardy's appearance, sound, and regular "imitation", disrespect for them or even being a movie of any kind becomes flawed. I blame Larry Harmony. Dialogue rattles from the old L + H films and is unwittingly sown, combined with the useless nature of other unnecessary co-stars, Pinchot's emphasis is odd to Stan and Sartain has done an excellent job with the emphasis of "Ollie", Mr Hardy, it is difficult to create a good mix. Where was one (good) music number? It's hard to edit, hard to operate, lines are weird, and physics are indispensable (though they are trying to make sense of the cheapest thing), it's a terrible thing to be a witness at all. It was more painful to watch the legendary duo than ATOLL K, the last film he wrote and shot in the 1950s. Give yourself a blessing and watch the most of ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies, and see what your work is. Do you know what MAGNATE is? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> CLASSICAL MUSIC song where is it ?! Why Destroy? Why "skip any wise"? Why did co-stars have a meaningless confusion? WHY IS THE MISS LAKE OF OZ PASSWORD? WHY IS A USE? WHY BOZO!? <br /> <br /> DOES THE SELF-DETECTION help you fund this? <br /> <br /> I really want to say. Fart jokes for God's lady. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
