I watched this movie 3 times. Naturally, this is Shakespeare, and whether it is interesting or not, it takes a certain mentality. But this movie can overcome any obstacle in long soliloquies, and many, many do not take care of a Shakespeare-based story. <br /> <br /> This is the full plain of the largest roadblock characters in production. Often, it is difficult to distinguish between the lines of the character in the interaction of the character. I believe that this movie is dubbed in English. Of course, they could get some of the actors who could add a little more drama to these classic, literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to estimate this movie more than 1, maybe it is likely that the prejudices may look smaller than the age and budget. Still, it's completely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, give yourself a favor and read it again. 1/10
