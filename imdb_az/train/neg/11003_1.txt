How can I start? This movie is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen .There are no unsuccessful attributes .I just sat with this movie and it was a fight. I could not get a single smile on my face. Everyone would spread this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failure in a dull humor. The only thing worth seeing about this movie was the soundtrack, and I'm pretty sure why I want to see this movie first. I'm going to try and forget about the moment that's just a waste of time. I'll leave you with this warning. WANT TO THIS FILM.
