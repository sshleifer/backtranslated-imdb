The second attempt of the New York intellectual to create a Swedish film for less than 10 years is the result of Susan Sontag's "Brother Snow" (in Sweden, with Swedish actors, few)! Based on Oscar Wilde Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop, he said, "After Little Nell's death, it's time to raise a stone to laugh out loud." It's the same thing here. "Interiors" are full of triumphant combinations. ("I'm afraid of my anger"). When looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am". Direct words from Bergman (careful use) are parody close. In an incredible way, the self-helping family reminded us of how brilliant and talented we were to the point of drowning. ("I read a poem of the day, I did not know - The New Yorker," "Oh, that was an old poem, I reworked it.") It's not about people, but I found them pretty cheerful. Most of the dialogue is funny from the previous movies of Allen. Only he is directed to play players straight lines. <br /> <br /> The poor Mary Beth Hurt copes with his chef, intonation and neurotic habits and turns him into a shameful image (like Kenneth Branag in "Famous"). The main area - seemed to have been lifted more or less from the restless mother and the unemployed family - Bergman's "Winter Light", many melodramas of the family deceived with the existential reservoir. All of these are presented in shops by entertaining and entertaining tricks: a pencil scratch on the paper, a powerful surf that pulls people on the beach. and so on. <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" movies are less embarrassed, but less fun. I take "Interiors". Woody rarely made a funnier movie.
