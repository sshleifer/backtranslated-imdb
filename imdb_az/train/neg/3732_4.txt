Perhaps I was too young, innocent, and when I saw him, this movie was the cause of my sleepless nights. I did not see it since I was in the seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure how much it would affect now. But I said that I had an impression on me ... and I have many friends. At least, he was old enough and served his purpose until we had enough knowledge to analyze and create our own ideas. I was afraid of being forced to endure, especially when newly converted post-foreigners did not receive the mark of the animal. For those who do not watch the movie, I do not want to spoil the film, I will not record the details of the scenes, but it can still show me ... and 19 years.
