From beginning to end, this is the most emotional captivating movie I've ever seen. Characteristics and relationships between the character of Marthe Kler and the nature of the character are pure torture. As the metaphor gymnastics rack is limited to clich√©, the director Pollack perceives each weave circuit as something of great importance. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some of the scenes that MSFT3000 communicates with some internal Pacino-like women, for the value of value. But even in such a casual humor, it is difficult to find in Turkey.
