I do not know, it was a silent movie with the story. Silent films do not care about it - cornish humor, illumination and illumination of the movie, etc. I am convinced that the attributes that I designated him at a low price. Before I showed interest in this story, I was in Chapter 8 and popcorn I could have missed on the screen. Maybe he appeals to this scientist? The only missing thing was the zombie scene and a brain transplant. On Friday night I went with two people and there were six people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselin narrated this film - a good part of the film. No one has commented on how much this ghost has been used, and evaluated an unusual approach to describing this story. I can not recommend this movie.
