I'm starting to see an example in movies I've given. They are almost all my films that my wife looked at me. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in the film. In any case, this is a typical drivel designed for pre-teen girls but is much worse than ordinary. Once again, the writer broke the basic principle of any film. He did not make the main character difficult. Initially, a friend begins with a complete bluff, and then when he is 30 he knows that he is a person (work, etc.). Why would we give this person a feeling of F? Perhaps we can get past. Jennifer Garner is so attractive that you can get some sort of deformation. I do not know if he or she is guilty of it, but his character is on the eve of his troubles. There is a clue for future film industry professionals: 13-year-olds are not entertaining, they are frustrating. The most embarrassing moment of the film was the dance to the Thriller. The painful bible crap. She first danced. Why he knows, but a full club full of people? Argh! Macarena would be more convincing! At one point is absolutely flawless and there is no clue how to do it, and nobody tells you? At least Tom Hanks's character on the "Great" gave a child a meaningful job. Changing this corpse / being a kid's adult night movie really misses, and it's still the worst.
