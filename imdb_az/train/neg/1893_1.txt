What happens when this movie is happening is very stupid. I could not care less about any characters; Susan Walters was very bored and I was upset by the leading actor (forgetting his name). How it ends and looks like it, but all the foreigners who have the human body and the things that appear to be stupid in this movie are inevitable. I told my dad was a stupid movie ... I listened to him.
