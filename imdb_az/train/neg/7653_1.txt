First, I would say that if I had to evaluate this movie from 1 to 10 honestly, then I'd give it -4. I'm not a hard critic, only this movie is bad. Everything frightens the story, directive, correction. The story is not even half-worthwhile (it's not something you do not know much about being a video based on the game, but the directive and editing have worsened. The film is cut by extraordinary points and goes to scenes that are completely incompatible with the previous one; Some people do not realize that as soon as they have a sex scene, they are not put on a story that looks like it does not seem to be feeling anymore. You will not be in this movie waiting to see a heap on the screen for about an hour and a half, and you're still upset. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you waste your money, and if you do not pay anything, you still waste one and half hours of your life. So give yourself a blessing and do not watch it.
