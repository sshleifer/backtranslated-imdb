All Hype! What is a better way to describe a movie about people who are worried that they can not release the movie through their main distributors? As a result they themselves do it. Otherwise, the form of the film does not justify the content of the film. There is no story and can be short. Acting is weak, but animation and music are very good. Otherwise do not waste time - do not believe sweets! However, if you have the opportunity to watch the movie free, do so. Then you do not need to spend money. Still, film artists are doing their best to create a cliff with their mini-series cheering their own stories. Otherwise, they make a hit miracle that did not hit a single hit.
