If you want to see Welles and see how far he is after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse for explaining how the hero could fall into a half-cooked scheme like a puppy she perceives is not the explanation of the later absurd courtroom theater and ridiculous clauses. The high rating of this movie should not be taken to me at PD; we can say that there are many old Welles and Hayworth supporters there.
