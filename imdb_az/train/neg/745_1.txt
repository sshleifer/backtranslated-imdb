I am not sure how this film will begin to describe how bad it is. I love very bad movies because they are often entertaining. I love bad personal effects, bad behavior, bad music and discipline. Except for music (better than I expected), this movie had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> Special effects were pretty bad. The worst thing I've ever seen since my Nintendo 64. Includes some scenes to watch for the Auburn to enter, the woman's body foot, the Big Ben scene, crashed by train crashes ... Wow, there are very bad effects! Certainly, SOME scenes from the BEST WORKERS have done a good job. <br /> <br /> The player was so bad that he could be based on the HG Wells book. To get such good source material, actors are as if they are trying to be so funny. And then have mustache ... a lot of absurd hair that I have seen for a long time. Of course, only half of the film works. <br /> <br /> The spouse is a character who has been ruthless and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> His wife Timoti Hines says he is not a general director. When using different colored filters for shooting for some reason, even the use of bad looking backgrounds in the scene, poor green scanning, has confirmed how this guy will direct a movie for me. I will not think that it would be possible to turn a bright book into a dirty film. Bravo, esteemed Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wants to see this movie is doing what I do: watching, drinking, playing poker while watching, drinking, and maybe you all go. It's a great movie, so make fun and laugh with this disaster.
