The anemic comedy-drama, though, is associated with Cher as a married housewife, who slowly associates her husband with a hired business man to kill her husband. Chazz Palminter, a challenging rendezvous, made the scenario from his own game, stagy set-up, and a quick look and an ear with the back and forth dialogue. The whole project depends on the dark air and the director Paul Mazursky can not remove Cher from his continuing funk (without list). Despite the best talent (including one of the producers, Robert De Niro), "Loyal" simply does not bring any substance to the rare stories and characters. * From 1/2
