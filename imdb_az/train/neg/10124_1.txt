there is no tension in this array! After a single episode is over, the player is very weak, the effects are very weak and the script is so afraid that the last thing you think will save Batman and Robin's day. No, in fact, the last thing in your mind is watching the next episode! This show is very boring, what can we say about DVDs? Obviously, the effects are not parallel to modern Batman movies, even the script is horrible. I'm very conscious of some mixed mix of some bad professor and a head rifle or something similar, because it's too bad to follow too much. Watch out for this version when starting the 60s version or the 90s, even when Batman starts!
