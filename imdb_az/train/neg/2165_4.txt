This film was a pretty strange sighting experience. The film is based on an obvious game. Now, I'm sure that in this movie everything works in a single game, but it's not enough to just watch it in the movie. The film is a very 'stagey' way and has not even bothered to modify some of the dialogue to adapt to a movie. Instead, it is almost entirely accomplished by performing a scene game with top-level characters and staged dialogue. <br /> <br /> According to some movies, this is a movie. <br /> <br /> This is just a moment before you realize that it's a comedy. Tracking. From the very beginning you think of a drama you are watching, there is an interesting character, but as the film progresses, you see that the film is more tragicomedy, which is more spreading than the dramatic genre to the comedy genre. <br /> <br /> Heroes and dialogue are things that really make it a quirky and over-the-top that is really unwatchable for this movie. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, and among others, the film will not rise to a 'watchable' level. <br /> <br /> The story is completely erroneous. Basically, the story is nothing, and mainly focuses on the characters of Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, the brotherhood / brotherhood. But what exactly is this story? The film feels like a trivial and outdated offering very little. As I said earlier; <br /> <br /> It is good and interesting to watch the story on the stage, but it's not as realistic as the movie, and it just does not work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Editing is merely a terrible and timeless, Of course, film director J. Lee Thompson was looking for better films than the scene, which turned out to be a good movie screen, turned into a project. <br /> <br /> 4/10
