The story is about the struggle of two small towns and their family. David Morse is responsible, rectangular policeman and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen is a "bad guy", a former soldier and an old prisoner. As an actor (especially at the age of first), Sean Penn modeled his speech on the basis of the Method. For the first time, the writer and director slows down the sliding by moving the script and symbols through the same methodic process, transforming this arty into a spectacular drama (apparently, we can hold every nuance and twitch). Although this approach may be of interest to pay attention to three-dimensional characters, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen really are not as convincing as a brother. Let's remind, we look forward to more than Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who have earned the honorary Kazakh award. The picture is unique in its sequence, a stingy story and confusing adjustments (always bent to overcome the artistic limit). Camera and Penn's tricks demonstrate a talent, but it's more irritating. * From 1/2
