I'm a great Charlton Heston fan. Of course, he is one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he thought when creating this movie. Normally, if I were to make a bad film, I would have blame him for a screenwriter or director, but that's all. The thirst of this film is his fault. Heston proves that such a Shakespeare story is not interesting. I have spent half an hour of my life in this tone fest and I will never go back this time. This is the worst Heston movie ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you may find this movie fun, but if you do not spend your time, you will soon regret it.
