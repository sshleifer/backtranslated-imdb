The best Oscars were in 2003 for two reasons: 1) Steve Martin was his best friend: "I'm Michael Moor's team assistant 2) Surprise Winners: Adrien Roman Polanski for the best actor (Genuine applause) for Brody or the best director (Original jeers and boos), but they won <br /> <br /> Last year, the award ceremony was not too bad, but the surprises were few and I RETURN swept the prize, though not the best of the king's trio, but the BBC's Broadcasting Jonathan Ross did not claim to have rounded up a few template friends, and when they did, he did not claim to be happy, but when I heard that Sky was covering television, Barry Norman and Mark Kermode , but we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! English TV is a great deal for film critics if they are lonely (maybe they are), I am sure that both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will be glad to fly to LA to give honest ideas about the successful and the lost. Chris Rock was not so bad, but his place was Steve Martin, and the place was like a gym with seats! In my opinion, there are not many arenas. The main problem I saw at the ceremony was the format that the "little" Oscars gave to winners sitting in their seats! There is nothing like 'Minor' Oscar, and because they are deserved as Best Picture or Best Director since the award is for the Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design. All winners should be allowed to enter the podium. How proud the snobs are to the academy, and I'm totally disagreeing with the comments that this format was a disgrace and if it were not for the surprises that could have been the worst event in history. <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. There is no great surprise for the competition category <br /> <br /> The best supporting actor is Morgan Freeman. The best actress - Jamie Foxx is not the most realistic complaint ever since Freeman. The most anticipated award of the night. Not the best actress - Hilary Swank. It was a big surprise to everyone that Annette Benning was just thinking of winning the academy politics, but Swank deserved it and gave the best out of the night. <br /> The best director is Clint Eastwood. Everyone would think that the Scorsese award would not just win. In fact, it is not worthy of AVIATOR, because he is not worthy of TAXI DRIVER, RULING BULL or Goodfellas because he is happy about it. <br /> Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY. It was a great surprise for everyone to think that the Academy was sharing the best director and best picture awards. I thought that Hollywood's AVIATOR friendship structure would be a deadly document for the best picture, but the debate on the CIS was off the voters <br /> <br /> Maybe this is the example of those awards that this year's voters did not see Oscar's policy and did not do in the past they decided to give awards to those who deserve it. To beat the legend of RING, YOUNG PEOPLE! The academy can vote for a long time instead of the heads
