Yes, MTV is really a way of the Daria market. What started as a clever teenage warehouse has now become "how to react to the viewer's feelings about the teenage life without a certainty" how to solve your problem now. I always watched Daria and liked it. Now, after watching the movie "movie," I'm sitting here, and I just think of them. Daria tells us how to make life in college? Sorry? Daria did not give the point where she did not hit any episode, but if she wanted to do it, it was okay, no matter what the rest of the sad world's illness is, it's good for you. All of this reminded me of the scene in the "Reality Bites" movie channel for the first time.
