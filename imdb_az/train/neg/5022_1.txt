Darling, this movie was bad for a variety of reasons. I was looking forward to seeing a very low score for this movie, and I was surprised to find out. I'm asking, but it's a joke to judge so high! After shooting a beautiful shot / black and white film, the film is dragged within only 66 minutes of work. The credit sequence at the start was also revived! The guys in the van broke a flat tire and did not change the wheel for the story! How slow was the guys who really managed and actually managed to hit Campbell? It did not seem to have to continue to follow it ... I'm calm ... I was so glad I bought it with a free version of Evil Dead!
