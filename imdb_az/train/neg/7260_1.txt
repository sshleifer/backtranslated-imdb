The album, titled "A city called Hell", produced jointly by Britain and Spain, succeeded Clint Eastwood's trilogy "Man Without Name" in Italy. The template used in most of these films was to hire well-known American actors who drowned their voices and dubbed their voices. <br /> <br /> This film is no exception, as it uses some British actors. <br /> <br /> It's hard to summarize this structure, but it's going to go. The story started with rebels or anything, Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raided the church and killed everyone inside the priest, including the priest. After a few years, Shaw is moving rapidly to the city where he is masked as a priest. Mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not intend to reveal justice through his weapon. <br /> <br /> A sad widow, Alvira (Stella Stevens), a murderer looking for his wife's wife. Therefore, God knows why he goes around like a coffin in a dead funeral. After the city's mayor was killed by La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city was occupied by a federal colonel (Landau) seeking a rebel leader (sorry, but his name escapes me). <br /> <br /> Colonel seizes the city and begins to execute the city's population in order to force the people to come out as their leader. <br /> <br /> The Landau and Shaw characters recognize each other as they open the film side by side. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims that he could identify the rebel leader by touching his face. It does so and .............................................. < br> <br /> The authors are sorry that this film is regrettable. Only my horrible "1" rating is simply horrible and deserving. Shaw uses the majority of his film, looking at the trademark best. Even Landau can not save this movie. Well, Mrs. Stevens is here too. After installing Peckinpah's "Ballad of the Cable Joke" in the previous year, I saw that this film will appear in this confusion. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Savalas made some of these photographs (Pancho Villa and Horror Express "comes to our mind) before the Kojak era. Michael Craig is also a place where" Paco "Fernando Ray appeared in many of these" western ", though it appeared to be playing in the two" French relationships ". Al Lettieri will play the role of "The Godfather" (1972) in 1975 and will pass to other memorable roles prior to his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In just about 88 minutes, I look at all justice, but do not see more than 95 or 97 minutes longer than the IMDb, but only 7 or 8 minutes apart . <br /> <br /> Avoid doing this.
