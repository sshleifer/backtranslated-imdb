I have to tell the first explanation I've been watching about this movie about 6 years ago, and then I enjoyed it. I bought the DVD soon and I liked it after a second look. The player was strange and as usual, we have stereo-typical clans in their fake suits. The player's best was terrible. <br /> <br /> Tim Roth, who works like Lake Neeson, did a job, but I did not know Jessica Lange was thinking. </ P> <p> I'm tired of seeing similar movies from Scotland. Although courage is even worse, this movie only saves grace. But seriously, people did not even talk about that day, why all actors have Glasia accents? Another movie to try and capture the essence of tired and disturbing stereotypes already. I find that the only person who says that this movie is good is Americans and I have to be honest that I can see what they want, I know they have an exaggeration for men in Kilts. But if you're thinking of buying a DVD, I'd like to spend your money on a better movie.
