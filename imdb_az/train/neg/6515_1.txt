This is not a dull movie, but the audience, as well as the composer Miles Berkowitz, the filmmaker and actor, is able to stay in the cage he admires. The story is simple: after a divorce and a Hollywood non career ten years, the author is looking for love in front of the camera he plays. The first question concerns the truth: what is written, what happened accidentally? Both answers describe as "yes" or "no" M.Berkovitz low-beeing human beeing. If you find a self-love story about this kind of love, I invite you to read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Besides, my country, against France. I am Americans commonly French (they may be right) and so on, but frankly (and all over the world) have a lot of pain in America, but why do I hate it? I do not think I do not want this movie.
