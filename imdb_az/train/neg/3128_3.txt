... from this horrible movie! There are so many things in this movie, action, writing, direction, straightening, and so on. One thing is rising upward and proving to be the worst. Music! There are two composers in the film. The fact that each frame has music has necessarily led to the worst "D" movie style. They did not hear the phrase "little more". I was very painful to listen, I was silent every time I did not have a dialogue, the dialogue was good. I believe you have to worry about Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley that they have not seen such a career in the evening. At your own risk.
