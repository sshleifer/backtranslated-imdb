so I found this movie strange and really meaningless. I know that there are awards and things, but I personally did not like it. If you are interested, there is only one bunch of wierdos and no humor or drama to keep their work. Some people are not something very different, but bad, not just a good impression. I was totally disappointed with this movie, and I did not blame the creative writing teacher. The circus theme throughout the whole film was kinda cool, but I did not get it, my robot and lion would not insult my thing. green animals were something clean, I liked many colorful flowers in the garden, but how do these four jobs work? Why not make a movie about it for me? But if you do, you can do that. I'll be on your way. I warn you about possible suffering.
