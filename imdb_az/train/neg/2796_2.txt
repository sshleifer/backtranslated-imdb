for the most part, offers a terrifying horror film about Demand and offers only the horror films everyone has seen and has an idea already. I did not see either this or Inventicible (I love the movies of Mark Wahlberg), and I am in a movie watching a frequent occurrence that I actually watched all the movies. There are a million times and many movies, and I'm not interested in new films, and boy, this movie regretted me. I do not want to put any spoiler, I'm just saying that only half of the few participants in this movie are half worth. In my opinion, her daughter is dead, everyone is dead, very awesome, but convincing; I would like to take him to a psychological plant every day, so he does it well, though it's nude. The blood is not that big, I say only a few killers, or "scars", but you do not see so much and there is no body part for the injuries in the film to make it more convincing. At the end of the film, I was begging to burn my girlfriend, and if I were a member of the group, the 'note' part was not very interesting, even though it really happened. If I want to watch it, I have come to my own accord.
