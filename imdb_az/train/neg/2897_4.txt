There's little to get excited about "Dan's Real Life". First, all the installations are incredibly complicated. Did you believe that it was true that Marie Dane would not go to the restaurant during the first long conversations at the restaurant? And since Dan is talking about why he is involved in the conversation? I did not understand how much Marie had been involved throughout the Dan film. She is very narcissistic and makes us less convinced to tell us that she is a really good guy (for example, Marie sleeps in her bookstore, her brother is sorry about past girlfriends and Marie is trying to make jealous with a 'blind date'). There is more controversy in the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are captured by the whole family, as this fun scene. Yes, it can be really. Dan is slow, efficient, and manipulative in real life. Even Jane Austen Book Club's chicken bones are even higher than this predicted "tearjerker."
