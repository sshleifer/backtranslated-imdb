Deal of No Deal and 1 Versus 100, while the 12 sexy 'dancers' glowing red shirts wear the lust for the "Me Show Money" fun. "What team lost?" To a participant. Someone is given the beginning of the word. completes each word with three versions A, B or C. The competition has three chances to respond to one of these 3 choices. The owner of the house - William Shatner, wants to lock into his indispensable smarmiest - contest "answer" and the contestant says yes, she gets a "dancer", she shouts, "Show me the money!" He opens a booklet with a sum of money and, if his answer is correct, he adds this amount to his earnings; If wrong, the amount will be deducted. (So, in theory, it's possible for a participant in this heart attack to really shatter money). There is a "Killer Card", and if the contestant elects the girl with this ugly book, nothing will happen. If the wrong answer is given, the game must go to Sudden Death and answer another question. <br /> <br /> Shotner will "dance" before going on advertising, and Shatner eats the contestant and 12 dancers. At the end of the show Shatner asks for the ladies' "last dance," and all of them shake a bit. <br /> <br /> I will give you 6 episodes in this show, hopefully this exciting game will be an excuse door. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Cuba could have a Gooding Jr home even though it was a better dancer than Chateaire recently) <br /> <br /> 7/08: It seems to me that I was wrong! Only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
