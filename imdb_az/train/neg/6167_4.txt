Like some people, I was shot to shoot this movie. Because of the mighty Bolo Yeungin pictures on the dome of Bolo Yeung and the pictures above and all of this movie Beast on the film's headline. However, for my disappointment, no retreat for the Chinese Hercules Bolo Yeung Jean Claude Van Damme and there is no surrender for Korkmaz Tiger ... erm, Bolo Yeung - video box, minimal actual exposure time of the actual minimum screen! He is excellent! <br /> <br /> Wisdom is pretty basic but good things have been done - a peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and does not give up time to fight again. He then ran to his worker to work as a worker, and he surprised his employees with the sack of heavy sacks and tried to question him as a powerful warrior (he knows how it works, but never think). At the same time, the corrupted boss on the platter makes a deal with gangsters, allowing them to use a private dock. As a result, workers are thrown into the ears and forced to live in the king, where they are united against their boss, the gangster boss and his hilking boss, Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> It was pretty much anticipated (mainly waiting for Bolo's next look), with some problems - first of all bad dubbing, but, of course, in the old kung fu movies. But the film also tends to drift between different battle scenes. When it comes to the stages of the fight, they have long played bad choreography (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Hummingbird, and sometimes by people who are not martial arts. In fact, most of the battles in this movie are beaten without any resistance, not just "battles"! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - Chen Hui Min played. I have never seen any other movie with this man, but I have never been to it. He was always in tears, but I still found his accusation to confront him! I understood his thinking, but if he first realized that we had understood it, he could save many people's pain and eventually fight! All this community was a great mystery because they were hoping for a boy who did not fight! <br /> <br /> In this film was the great grace of Bolo Yeung. Not only does he always have some great, funny lines, not as big and cruel, and gives the rest of the film a master class on how to fight the film. The boy shook the screen and easily became a star. This man scared my life, but I'm not the only person watching this movie for Bolo at the end of the last battle! <br /> <br /> Generally, the low-and medium-kung fu film raised several big wheels. I did not meet anyone who did not think Bolo Yeung was great. The man is a legend!
