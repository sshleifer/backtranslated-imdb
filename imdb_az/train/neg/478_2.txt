The worst Warner Bros. Kay Francis movie competition is tough. Perhaps I've seen eight of them, but Comet on Broadway is the worst thing to date. The best thing about this is short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly dresses (of course) are good. Not James Wong Howe movie theater. Kay Francis looks more greasy and less attractive than normal. Unknown Minna Gombell is as good as a semi-bold "burlesque" dancer (more like a fashionable show than Burlesque). Passing stroke - when Kai Francis and his child (when he realized that the child was the mother of Kai Francis) was no longer ridiculous going down a road that was thrown into a prison decorated with smoky images. The whole film was so cheap, incredible, and not too careful that everyone who was doing this was affected by a single source of cynicism: Warner Bros., Warner Bros., is a trash to trash the unwanted gulls and what they get.
