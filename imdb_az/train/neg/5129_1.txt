The message of this film is more important than personality beauty. <br /> <br /> Jeanine Garofalone is likely to be "ugly duck," but it's funny that she's not ugly (actually, Uma Thurman is more attractive than a friend like a model). <br /> <br /> "This movie is a dirty duckling" really unpleasant? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is just ridiculous despite the message it wants to send. <br /> <br />
