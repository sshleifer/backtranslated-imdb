First, the worst evil is to maintain the rating of "1". This movie is taken from me because, as one reviewer points out, it recognizes itself in some funny or religious significance, and is not bad in a row. Each number simply misses its mark. ** The possible spoilers ** This dialogue is absolutely unbreakable. Sustainability is very painful. Daniel simply speaks of the love he loves and begins the flamenco dancers. Her husband (Baldwin) for the first time tells his friend that he is a bad person, what is his name (see, I do not remember the name of his character, do not forget the actress name alone). Car and motorcycle pursuits did all the right thing. Vegetable carts blew. The car crashed into one another. Motorcycles lower the stairs. People are shot nearly, but of course there is no one. Oh, that's right ... He stumbled across a knife wound with knife wounds, except for a few times stabbed and a car approaching, of course, did not see him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> I believe that these films will be more for me. There is plenty of pressure to make money in the film industry, thinking about making some good movies in Hollywood. Now you have a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not see this movie. Do not rent DVD. Do not watch over the cable. There are many other things that will make you feel more satisfied.
