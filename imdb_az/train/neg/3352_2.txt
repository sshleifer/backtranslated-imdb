I do not even know where to start. "It's about the whole family." This should be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in the "horror" film, although this can even be a fear movie! Ugh! I know Owen Wilson is a better player. The miracle that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armagedon) should stop the boy from playing. After all, the man wrote "The Rush Hour" and "Rushmore". She has some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should go into indie movies. There is no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should be a porn star. There is no room for legal action. I'm serious. I have never seen one of the worst films ever.
