Eleven "great" filmmaker, eleven pieces of trash. Ten minutes of everyone's peculiarity, sophistication, condescension, self-indulgence. He treats people of all nations. Egyptian Yussef Chahine gives "hip hip pain"! in his amateur part for terrorism. Throughout the green line, Israel's Amos Gitai is aware of a ten-minute terrorist act and crushing. Mexico's Alejandro González Iñárritu concentrated on Twin Towers, but forgot to open the camera. Sean Penn did not know that there was no building in the shade of the Trade Center on 9-11. Japan's Shohei Imamura without seeing everything. Claude Lelouch is focusing on a small, unimportant love story. Great Britain Chile Ken Loach. And so on.
