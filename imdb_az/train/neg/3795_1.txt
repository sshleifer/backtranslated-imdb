I really like this show. I really did deal with conscience. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay audiences get their own version of Bachelor. With his compulsory "hag", Andra, James, a good-looking, good thirty-one thing, has 15 demonstrators (or "lovers" as referenced in the show). Only half the problem is straight and James does not know it. If James chooses a gay, they travel to New Zealand and plain guy gets $ 25,000 if he chooses a straight one. How can this be fun? <br /> <br /> The most problematic issue with this show is virginity. James is a typically young and successful gay man with a natural smile and body, probably looking at your local bar before the green grass spread. Why would a Jewish leader lead me away? <br /> <br /> There are many feverish and lively live homosexuals to die on the television. <br /> <br /> Apart from his very average physical appearance, James is curious and interesting as part of a layer. Even with such arrogance, there is a flawless aura about it. However, when Jacob stood against a blank, white wall, he would have been in it. Perhaps during the show, James said that I can not remember something interesting or noteworthy. It's awesome and unforgettable. In fact, one of his comrades spoke plainly and said that he had nothing to do with it. I thought it was the best part of the show. Also, James speaks with a very annoying, annoying lilt. It sounds like a voice to a woman or a voice, but do not squeeze in the middle of sentences ... to sit so painfully. <br /> <br /> So, it seems to me, "I chose a plain boy and humiliate yourself and your betrayal." Many people who do not care about what's happening or whatever. In the same way, vapid can not be distinguished from one boy, except that "Hey guy has a yellow hair or a hair shaved" Yet surprisingly, decisions that make this decision appear to be the purpose of this show. While casting roles can be hackneyed to write, it would be much more entertaining to watch the amorphous drones. However, in all their wishes, they still raise James (though it is difficult to do so) in a light state. As we know, some suites have a problem that is more interesting than interesting and interesting people. And seems to have more fun than SUITS all around MORE than the advanced human? Very sad. <br /> <br /> And I also thought that something that was shown on the message boards I felt was true: straight guys are warmer than gay children. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I tell you all gay guys are ugly and boring, but in fact some of them have found it very sweet. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> This is the show time. I can accept the character of an interesting lead like a cardboard box, I can accept secular, apathetic suitors, but I love God's love a little. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sexual desires, or excitement, it is GENU'S. One of the biggest "drama" works can still have a boy in New York (Strange!). <br /> <br /> So far, there is no doubt about any conflict. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a twist, but if you have a look at Geydar, <br /> <br /> It removes most of the chips in the exhibition with a twist that does not reach elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We like to watch along the fascinating activities like Western Process dance like James & Co, shopping for gifts, visiting a delight zoo and learning how gay karaoke. YAWN. Sometimes I'm sure you're dancing superfluous, but who cares when everyone gets it anyway? One of the main challenges with the show: A ONE feels happy - they are going through a very difficult test to conduct a good time. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is nothing physical. No cuddling, no refreshing, no kissing (!), No lovers. It's just a dull date, I'm going back to my ugliness, and want to go back to a sticky CYA Sydney Operahouse (hit the lips). " This show is not such a thing, it's ridiculous. I do not want to play them homosexual men's cheating, but I can only understand ****. The people who watched the reality television show wanted more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses. <br /> <br /> This is a long time since I apologized but felt that there were some issues that needed to be addressed. I admire Bravo for putting an impression of this nature, but it is surprisingly drowning in a mysterious way that this show is taken up. To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = something else to go. You are expecting more fun at a doctor's office at an appointment, at least having interesting magazines.
