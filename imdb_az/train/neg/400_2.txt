I rarely make these comments, but I had to spare others that I had difficulty watching. Not surprisingly, both the general story and simply unbelief can not be stopped. The problem is that it starts early when it comes to eating at a restaurant in Washington DC, overlooking the Capitol Building, a government-run researcher in a new Porsche. Hah! It only gets worse. Finally, when the bad guy starts killing good guys, the latter moves stupid to want you to die in order to clear the gene pool. Special effects are good - any producer's money can get him - the main roles are great in other films, but here scenarios and directions are moronic. Many people wondered whether Paul Verhoev√© had intentional intelligence behind the previous, facial fools (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but that should stop curiosity. It's just bad.
