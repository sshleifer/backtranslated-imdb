Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing for a young American aircraft in Afghanistan. He is also a freelance surgeon and freely roaming around Kabul, who works in the wounded NATO troops. On a particularly difficult mission, he accidentally took a sniper rifle and took Osama bin Laden about 3,000 meters away. The sergeant is then encouraged, but can not decide between a disorder and a surgeon's career, and he's completely out of the Army. A year later, he became angry with civilian life, joining the Navy fleet and proudly wearing a white shirt.
