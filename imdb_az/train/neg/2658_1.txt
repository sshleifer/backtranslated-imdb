While watching CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy," I was wondering why Diane Keaton wanted to be this (as he did not have a television movie - playing for a bit older actresses) Keaton musicians like the television, but Keaton they do not offer any opportunity for brightness). A single mother saddened by her seventh daughter's sudden death, accompanied by a group of close relatives, and became more and more friends. This Romance-adapted teleplay gives a group of self-pushing characters who want to pass through the paradise to prevent us. Diane Keaton says a young man wearing muscular shirts to hear what he has heard is frustrated by the fraudulent people as it's a neat scenario and a bungalow near the beach where children live ("Surrender, Dorothy," and, indeed, Is this the "right" from "The Wizard of Oz"? "... No, not even," Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted to do so with the subject of material mortality. She turns this invisible woman into the shadow of her personality (a lot of kooky dresses), but Keaton is always so hot and similar, because she does not sit well with the audience. Here is an exciting crap that does not learn many lessons on self-actualization (a movie that forgets a dead young woman, and is a odyssey for a nervous breakdown of a mother who seems to be an extreme hippie, and nobody has lost anyone). This is one of the ways the movie demonstrators get acquainted with the propaganda show: "This is where a lot of sad mom should help." I can not imagine that no one can help, because it is self-denying, dark and surprising. It is not uncomfortable.
