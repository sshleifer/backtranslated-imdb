Last night, the world begins with a lifetime of 65 million plus annual comets. Instead of watching the show, Regina Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart) decides to hold a movie with Larry Dupree (Michael Bowen) on the stand ... They are waking up next morning and Larry is killed by a zombie trying to abandon the murder, but he tries to escape after discovering that almost everyone is turned into a red powder on the planet. Just to be able to live with incredible coincidences, another man is able to become sister Samantha (Kelly Maroney), desperately seeking more survivors and facing a long distance loader named Hector Gomez (Robert Beltran). Meanwhile, a bad group scientist needs human blood, they prepare a serum to save themselves from dryness, and they look at the donor's reluctance ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Thom Eberhardt The Comet's Night, displaying a beautiful debris and I am surprised by the amount of positive comments about IMDb in this regard, because I have never lived before that. The screenplay begins at 100 km / h, with the destruction of a whole population of the world and a zombie attack, but then goes completely out of the way and ultimately introduces scientists who steal the humiliating blood to the end of the film because there is a sophisticated story. These scientists wonder why blood is needed to kill a member of three or four bags and bloodshed to develop a cure that can be seen as a totally bizarre and direct suicide if they save their two sisters when they give more blood for their experiences. If you take into consideration that you have to die and do the work on human blood is not only meaningful but there are five or six donors who give blood or only two dresses? My two sisters are independent of each other, and what do I do about it? When Hector first met the female scientist, how did Hector know this when he came to Regina, where Samanthan was, or where he was, or where the underground object was not committed suicide? I thought that the first twenty minutes of the film slowed the snails, and after hearing good things about it, it was incredibly boring and boring. The Night Of The Comet Is Exciting Too Much To Me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Eberhardt does a really good job, I like the appearance of the movie with his red-colored sky and he really tries to create an insulation environment. Unfortunately, in empty streets, there are plenty of photographs, there are constant montages in empty streets, abandoned roads and abandoned buildings and are very recurrent and loud. Perhaps there is nobody there, so there is no need to put them under our throats, always showing ways to the car. The zombie has completely vanished, the whole movie has two zombie attacks, and although there are several spectacular nightmares, these are two individual zombies. The nightmare of the comets, which you choose, or anywhere you choose, has been removed from the Dead of the Dawn (1978), many of the best films, including the forced end of the shopping craze in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> The Comet's Technical Night is pretty good, special effects are worth it, and the production line was pretty good at shutting down the streets. Interestingly, Maroney Samantha, like a high-furious anger, waited like a blonde. <br /> <br /> The comet's night was a big disappointment for me, and I had a lot more hope. Persoanlly found this movie a dull, boring, exciting and consistent sequence of films that went shopping with the movie "Girls Only Want". It's really bad, and I do not know why many people like it did not go, so I would say this, so start harassing ...
