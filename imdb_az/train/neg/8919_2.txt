I saw it when I chose it as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I love Danny Elfman and it could have been interesting. Moreover, I am an admirer of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the appearance and feel of the 30s animated film. I thought you were interested in both of them. I was wrong. Within a few minutes, I downloaded down the speed advancement button. <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> In advance, I have some other reviews here I thought and figured I did not have enough luck. I wrote it again and watched it. <br /> <br /> 75 minutes of my life will be back. <br /> <br /> I believe that there are no worse comments. Personally, I think it is difficult to reach a minimum of 10 lines comments. <br /> <br /> This film suggests that several smaller secondary schools are ready to insult the world and think through their hearts. and puke jokes. The characters are straight. The parable of the "alphabet" is bare, actually leaving A-E, it does not consider what has fled, flying against "F". The journey to the expected discharge through the intestine will not work for the first time. <br /> <br /> What can be expected from those who want to work in the Out-South Park, Stone and Parker, which is not part of the board and is unable to determine whether it is funny. This can be fun if you're high. Otherwise, this is not it.
