The story refers to a genealogical researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by a cosmetic queen aunt like his Estee Lauder. His aunt (who we guess is married) is trying to follow the lost family in Europe for a long time. Each of them has a photo of a young girl sitting in a fancy music box. The researcher leads Europe and searches for places like Milan, Budapest, and Vienna. Decoration is a true fact and is actually grounded (Unlike the murder, Jessica must go very far and write that Lansbury Burbank never leaves). In any case, she gets acquainted with a young man who is searching for a mystery, and they work as a team to follow tips and insult the bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I looked at it because it was a scene, but I did not see the scenario as bad, so I just did not want to get worse. It did. The actor was also extinguished. I can see that Mel Harris's career never really went out after thirty-five years, but it's enough (though it seems too old for his co-star). However, supporting players go straight from the public landscape. How many times have I been called "Budapest"? Yes, it is called Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? Half of the film should be one of these Harlequin films and be sure enough. I say all this.
