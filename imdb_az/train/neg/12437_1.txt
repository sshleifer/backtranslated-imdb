'Home Alone 3' is the first of its kind, and is the first home to Alone films that have not presented the same betrayers to Culkin. However, the terrain is very similar to the original "Home Only" movie. Instead of two funny cunning, we get three or four. There are some traps in this movie, but it also has a long range of remote controlled cars. The slapstick humor is also consistent, but the young boys and villains really fail to influence this movie. (No pun intended.) This movie offers something new or different from previous movies and is not really the warm, holiday impression or subplots of the other two films. It's a cleaner comedy, but for me, the characters did not really make me laugh because she did not do it. I do not recommend this movie; it's pretty boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, you can watch the original 'Only in the House' movie.
