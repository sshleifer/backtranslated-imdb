I discovered this movie with a retail outlet OOP. And this is definitely an OOP. One year after Exorcist, he worked with this movie, but Blair's career never happened, and he never had a star star. Many of the reasons are OOP movies. It gives a good performance in this movie. It's about rejection by his parents and who is not a friend. A 15 year old girl playing at the age of 15 was funny. The film is also known for the rape incident, and there is a broom bar in the shower. In some publications, this is cut, why I know, there is no blood, OK, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, there is nothing to insult T & A people. But the film is slow, very slow. Not happy to me, but I almost feel it. At the age of 14, he is a rebel against the community, but there is no blood flow, nothing. Why is it a miracle for me to be classified according to this horror? If you are an admirer of Blair, you can find it in another way.
