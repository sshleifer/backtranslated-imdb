What a disappointment ... the best prequels you choose, but the story is weak, the plot runs, and the final result comes together in a concise way, poorly understood and confused. There are numerous sustainability errors that have been brilliantly touched with genuine films and Darth Vader's emergence is so sad that in a modern cinema there may be a legendary moment, and a cat that has been mocked for many years is laughing. I will not complain of terrible dialogue, because it is Star Wars ... The original three films feature styling, prayer emotions and tiresome stories and a strange dialogue. Prequels was diligent to earn more money, and love shows these deficiencies. Completely disappointing.
