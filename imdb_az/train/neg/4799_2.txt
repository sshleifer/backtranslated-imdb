I'm a great fan of fear movies with less than 80 budget. It's the worst, but still not spectacular. The line is worth the line, but it slips too long. Even before you see any zombie action you will pass through half a movie. The killings are not very creative and the zombies are not very rude. I really would have liked this movie to get out of zombies and it would be better if only some of the mafia flippers were turned down. Expected, but I feel that this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I'm going to give the film's credit just because it's a bit original. B-horror movies, you really need to look, but if not, do not worry. But you do not need my word for it.
