I like this movie very much. I really love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side on it. At least not me. Spenny destroyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's pretty boring with Roger Ebert on the scene. Indeed, there are many celebrities in this movie, and most of them do not mean more than one line. Generally, this film creates disappointment. I suggest you watch it only if you have it with season 1 Kenny vs Spenny DVD (it comes with free 3th disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out Papel Chase.
