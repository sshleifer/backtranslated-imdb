This show is actually the biggest, ugly, most common steam batch I've ever seen in the succeeding children's programs. The starting character, Johnny, can not be unpleasant or even tolerable when you understand that you have to represent a normal child. These jokes are bare, over-reaching (ie, not seen "come", this is not even funny for the first time, even cute), and the lack of primitive intelligence or inspiration. And lastly ... it just looks ugly. Children do not particularly criticize artistic talents, although they still choose the eye shape. I can not stand watching the show, because in some ways the art style is only gross. It really captivates. Just flat fracture. <br /> <br /> I just do not think so much airtime has been achieved. Although I understand that nostalgia may be a bit complicated, I should not get my hopes back ... I really miss old cartoons myself. Get Dexter's Laboratory back, Powerpuff Girls, this is a shitty thing. <br /> <br /> I simply advise you to spend your time in this show. I believe that really good cartoons can be used by older kids. And it did not cut it.
