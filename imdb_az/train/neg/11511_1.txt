I have a fortune to show this movie in the United States. I'm shocked to see that I've had very good reviews here on IMDB, because I'm sparing all of the horrible things. <br /> <br /> The original film is a Turk, but it is interesting. After the 1969 revolution, it coincides with the end of the 70s; this movie is just ......., good, nothing bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: shallow, poorly cut, fashionable. It does not seem to be here; he cleverly carried his wife as an incorrect star. <br /> <br /> Pay less attention to good ratings from this film's other posters. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchi to humiliate yourself by giving you money. <br /> <br />
