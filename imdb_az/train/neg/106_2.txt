1st Watch 8/3/2003 - 2 to 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A 3-D film about the zombies eating 3 stories in a movie novel. And yes, we get 3D human meat pieces to see the zombies eating! Wow, it's not! In a zombie movie 2D is a story based, not just a real body meal, but time and time again, but usually better than a zombie movie. The original zombie classics did a good thing. Etius was eaten as an additive. Because we are really understood and gradually reach out to the finals, in most of these 3-part chronicles, we have actually won thanks to deception (the zone of alley). The final story is actually the story of the movie (which is a reporter who investigates a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see the food eaten at zombies. Yes, I said enough. Look at classics, it's not a 3D vessel holiday.
