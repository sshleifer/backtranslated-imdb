Those who praise this movie ("the biggest movie shot" I did not read in one place) or care for the opera, are not interested in Wagner or they are interested in nothing else. The desire to look culturally. <br /> <br /> As Wagner is presented as a quantum song or a movie, it hits me like an unfortunate catastrophe, reading a text that is adapted to the extravagant text of the text. <br /> <br /> Being able to think of "about" people who are in an opinion (or, in particular, one thing, especially Shakespeare), should be allowed everywhere near a theater or film studio; Syberberg is very fashionable, but with the slightest reasoning from Wagner's text, Parsifal has decided that bisexual integration is the final feature of the title character, though some of the actors in the tenor are the singers and Amphoras (as never heard) if the double dose of the conductor Armin Jordan gets a double dose of magnificent Good Friday music during the double-discovery of Batonzilla or the Conductor, of course, the mysterious nature of nature, represented by the collapsing shops and naked pits, the grass is meager . In the theater, sometimes we have to overcome such flaws with our thoughts, but for Sierrack Porsifal and Gurnemanz, for Yuli Juppe Music music for the sake of the slopes. It is difficult to withstand the loud noise, and especially the pipes that have a light glow that adds some kind of fatigue to our impatience with the inflated sliding and paralitic infection of the ritual. Although Bayreuth's 1951 note and Knappertsbush's note, although his pace is often slow, there are feelings of weakness in Jordan, feelings of flow and flow of music, and half a century later, in this set of orchestral sounds, in the modern press, superior.
