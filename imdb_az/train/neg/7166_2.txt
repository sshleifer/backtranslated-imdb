This movie would be great, but it comes in a short way. Cheesy special effects and so on. I could have looked into the past that the story is not that bad. Better background would be better. The centers around the evil Druid witch dealing with this woman taking the conspiracy migraine. The film is drifting and opening and never disclosing anything, it just sits somewhere. There is a part of Christopher Walken, but it's totally unimportant as the film's most. This film had the potential, but it looks like something really bad for a TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
