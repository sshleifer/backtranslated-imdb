I remembered that I watched this movie several times as a very young person and had a part that I did not understand. I think I once saw it as a mature person and then understood these parts. The only problem I was looking for as a juvenile was not fun for me. But what's the movie? Is a "child movie"? Not too difficult. It contains topics that are not suitable for language and children. Does each parent feel that he / she is experiencing what he or she is having with their children? Maybe, but then why does Junior not pay more attention to the character of John Ritter instead? In a film that is a major achievement of a 7-year-old film, it should be a film of a crowd of seven and six, so that older people can not be in touch (even a 8-year-old film about a child of all ages do not want to see it). I'm pretty sure that this movie did not do a good job at the cash register and that the reason could not be located on the market.
