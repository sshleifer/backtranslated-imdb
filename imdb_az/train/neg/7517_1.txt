*** One of the ten stars <br /> <br /> Because if it were, it would be F. This was a bad God of the Holy Mother of God. I would like to say that I placed him in every flat because he thought he was one of the plain films, but he always left me alone. Like some other B films, the main story was decent, and filmmakers had a reasonable level, but the execution was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Hellouin is a shame that adds a good name to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> Some fame, frat boys enter hell, unless a divine spell is seen from anywhere. Yes, this idea is, but most of the film is full of loyalty to avoid the relationship of this frat boy, resembling an ugly flavor subplot. The true story is very little dedicated to Halloween or mysterious spelling. In fact, it's crazy for me to think that filmmakers think they're far away from dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is mostly frat-friendly. It is NOT Billed as this movie. I do not want to watch the producers and at least threaten them with the body. Your leadership is bad, unhappy! The scenario is funny, unwanted. Cinematography is just lazy. The whole film is amateur night. This film is essentially like the SyFy channel movie production masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the film, like filmmakers, did not produce a soap opera, and some sort of horror sequence. The devil's writing book is finally coming to the game and it's becoming a decorated character like everyone in a haunted house. When I write this review I say as I cry. Amazing! Wow! Wow it means! This was a catastrophic catastrophe.
