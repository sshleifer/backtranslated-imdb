Above all, I am a great admirer of Madeleine L'Engle and I'm so excited to see a movie called Time Wrinkle, one of my favorite books of a movie. But this movie has broken my excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg has been portrayed in the book as it has an angled curls and glasses and is considered very uncool. The film does not have flat hair and glasses and is a "sporty type" in deep voice. This did not describe how Madeleine L'Engle was Megin. In fact, Meg is depicted as being a young man based on the character of Madeleine. It's just an example of how the book and the film are different. So if you want to watch for fun purposes, look, but if you're a loyal fan of Wrinkle in Madeleine L'Engle and Time, I think you'll skip this movie.
