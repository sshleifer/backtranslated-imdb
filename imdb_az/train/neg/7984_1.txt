The latter are many mid-range lines. Very hot buttons push without any reason, there are every drama element: death, divorce, money issues, parental problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug genocide, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep love" ? You would think it would do for an interesting movie, but do not have hell? all these events are not primary. Do not bump. At the end of the film, the child's "super-deep" (and long-lasting) concert is a ridiculous thing. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to forget: the actors are all very good. Here, I have to turn him over. Their talents went bad, and the film was well spent: light, episode, and so on. - all this. Just the missing meaning.
