To find this movie, I called everywhere a video store, found myself a great fan of elvis and a great disappointment. The majority of wolf's russels were down the "elvis movements" and the sound imitation was great, but the dubbing sounded elvis did not work for me. his voice was not always compatible with the Russian mouth, and it was difficult for me to lose on the beach because he was concerned about me. There were many freaking discrepancies in the film, and people who did not know much about elvis were likely to think they were real. he was more confident than when he was buried with a great headache reading JESSE GARRON in an unmarked graveyard of his uncle Jesse Garr, for his first guitar erroneous before he recorded his songs in his real life. I knew it was just a television movie, but they jumped from important events, like special ones, and drifted some scenes for a long way. Similarly, if you want to see a good movie showing that elvisin is in the top rent, it will BE CLAIM, or another elvis concert. hearing and realistic elvis preform are truly the only way to see his talent. (I know brilliant phrases, but still ... get out and rent a good elvis flic.)
