The Bloody Jack legend is set in the Alaskan Desert and begins with a deadly oxkolist Lumberjack's relative, reads inconsistencies (The Evil Dead (1982)), reading an ancient writing book with an attempt to resurrect, and killing a great believer Lumberjack's relative in the family union. Two days later Ray (Travis Quentin Young), his wife Dawn (Erica Hoag), his comrade Nick (Craig Bonacorsi) and his four friends, enjoy a comfortable weekend in the Desert. Unfortunately, the murderer Lumberjack showed his friend ax and began to kill his friends ... <br /> <br /> Todd is a portrayal, written, executed and directed by Portuguese, a pretty rotten modern slasher. For those who kill the horror genre I'm just a fan of ultra-low-budget horror movies with the production values ​​of a holiday video. The scenario is a horrible thing for every 80 minutes, every bad slasher has a cliché, a terrible character, a terrible dialogue, and it's difficult for anyone or anyone to take care of this unhealthy excuse for a teenage slasher movie. Teens are even weaker and stupid than ordinary, the script is moronic, predictable and defective than normal, and the murderous Lumberjack friend is just bare. If you believe it's going to go away in the last 10 minutes or so and it's going to be a difficult one, as we are so entertaining with me, we're going to have one of the worst tweets of interest for the entertaining audience. had to sit only for 90 minutes. Now I will destroy the end of everyone who does not want to know how to stop reading. Basically, before the film's end, Ray described a story, and she just told the story of what we saw, and Nick and Dawn and everybody else accused him of telling a bad story. pain) and then collect holes in it and continue laughing. Why do they stand around and argue? Why did not they choose a bolt and things like this, and I felt that I was talking about entertainment in this audience because it was the kind of things that I asked myself. he lowered my throat and saw the readers scanned the script and saw all the holes in it and ended up perfectly for just a little grating (we just sat there to remember) for a drifting drift lasted about 80 minutes. Lumberjack's friend then attacked and killed everyone within two minutes to add insult to injury, why did not he start? <br /> <br /> Portugal is becoming a real messenger in Portugal, which has the worst day and night in a film I've ever seen. The whole film is intended for nightlife, and I suspect that producers are trying to use the day for the night process, but it did not work and seems to have come up on the agenda one day. For example, when Lisa is trapped in the bathroom and looks out of the window. When we look inside the bathroom, it is only a black outer place, but it is a bright daylight when it falls on the floor and shoots it on the outside. Later, Ranger Vince says that he did not get a search party like "in the middle of the night" and then a few minutes later when he was outdoors and did not get a search party like in the middle of the day. In fact, clearly points out. There is always a scene from the cabin view when looking at the windows at the edge of the edge and another clear example when walking inside the door to start with Ranger. In this film, sustainability is simply the worst thing I've ever seen. There are some stages in the body that have no body, but it goes to the human body, but there is nothing memorable. <br /> <br /> It will take several days to meet with your spouse and relatives. </ Strong> believe how bad it is. The special effects are weak and do not even allow this area to blow up a car even though it is quite viable. This is an amateur clock written everywhere from beginning to end. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The operation is completely bright and attracted everyone Oscar she would only joke, it was really terrible, and even the girls who took their daughters did not look very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Bloody Jack is just a terrible teen slasher flick, looks like a camera shot without using a tripod or stadycam, it has terrible effects, it's dull and has a twist ending, or it's totally wrong and most intelligent. To remind you how to see how to see a slasher better than 70 or 80.
