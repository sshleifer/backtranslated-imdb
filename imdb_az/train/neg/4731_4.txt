Elvis Presley is a semi-attentive attempt to bring it to the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and the subplot of a pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy and waits for its belts. A woman named EP he continues to take his life on the beach and he does not care about it! Dick Sargent is confused in another bar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Work hard like Elvis's two bosses (he sees the moonlight). Some songs, in particular "Love in Love," are pretty good, but Elvis is still updating the comedy, hipper, looking somewhere else. Elvis and his deadly charm are lying together, and there is a wooden board among them! Get real. ** from ****
