The "Smile, Laughter with Clown" film, released in 1928, described the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clone named Tito. Tito raised a juvenile (young and beautiful Loretta Young) and named him Simonetta. Tito has grown up in a circus life and has become a talented ballerina. While Chaney's great performance, I can not go past the fact that I have already hots for Tito's young Simonetta of the middle aged. Although not his biological father, he raised him as a girl. This kind of "ick" factor goes through the film. Tito is competing with Simonetta's young and beautiful 'Number' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta falls in love with the young man, but feels guilty of rejection of Tito (not loyalty, romantic love). The entire film is ridiculous, and it's incredible that in the movie, no one would ever say that Tito was a stupid old idiot (until he finally emerged). The film is noteworthy for Loretta Young, who wants to win a great career. Although I'm shining like Chaney's actor, this movie has appeared to me and looks just terribly creepy.
