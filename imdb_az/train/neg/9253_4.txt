You have not read the name on the DVD cover, and I'm never sure that this flawless and old fashioned music is closely related to the New Wave of France. In fact, if the film is back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would hate this kind of hatred of the film - so ... so ... it is unreal. And he has nothing to do with many of his previous films. <br /> <br /> Some commentators have featured this film, especially if they were a bit shocked. There are far better French music. The songs in this movie are not just interesting, and all the characters seem gentle and stereotypical. <br /> <br /> I was forced to see a wealthy person who was too busy to get rich or to get a good selling price on the designer's outfit. <br /> <br /> The following line, music, and every French music are not gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (CHERBOURG UMBRELLAS or "Huit Femmes") and Audrey Tautou, but I do not see much to offer him as a dull stranger.
