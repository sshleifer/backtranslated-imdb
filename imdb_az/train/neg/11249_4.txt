Stunning image? Most definitely. I've seen a little movie look good for a while. Sky Captain and Tomorrow World use cutting-edge cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a pretty new thing to create a familiar world. The time period seems to be the 1930s or the early 40's. The film tells about the attacks in New York by stealing generators by mechanized armies and for some undisclosed reasons. At the same time, the mysterious disappearance of relevant scientific minds coincides. Who can stop them and the world will end? Indeed, this does not make a breakthrough for a clever reporter to know himself with a clever reporter with a girlfriend who always has a warmer belt, and a reliable, thoroughbred sidekick on his wings. What is Sky Captain's story and characterization about the atmosphere and graphics? The plot of this movie is ridiculous. The movie is similar to one of the series's serial-movie series. They had quite a lot of stories and bad moves - but none of them, and I did not have any of them, in this movie, the budget and the big names. The two Academy Award winning singer and Jude Law could have kept a movie, but one Sky Captain worsened. Despite the fantastic dark look, I wanted to end the film and found myself and could continue with my life. I showed little interest in a story that has little interest in me. I have never seen any interest in Glib images. Paltrow was just in fright. Jolie was actually a joke with a role that was no substance. The law can not accurately define its own linen tradition on its limited shoulders. I would like to say, let's face it, it's Will Smith, Mel Gibson and even Wesley Snipes. At least for me it's a sad thing about Sky Captain, he promised me that he promised so much. I was in the movie for ten minutes - waiting for something to close my interests and never came.
