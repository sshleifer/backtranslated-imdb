After watching this movie I came to the IMDb and read some of the analyzes compared to the Lite Translation Lite. <br /> <br /> This film was a bad attempt on a similar topic. Interestingly, the format of the film is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. <br /> <br /> The "10 Products" runs to the viewer within a day, and the better-planned "Lost In ..." appears to stretch for a few days. <br /> <br /> "Some people will see it and disappoint because it's Morgan Freeman, and now it has a better role - it's limited to $ 10 million and now plays a bigger blockbuster than the leading roles in films.
