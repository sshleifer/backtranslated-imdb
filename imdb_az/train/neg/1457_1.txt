I have watched this movie a few times and all of this can be said that the budget is low, and the true history has nothing to do with the facts. Players' performances are very poor, but they are limited in action. Anyone watching this movie now thinks Hitler is a scarecrow nickname that works with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there were better films about Hitler and Germany in those years, and the rise of evil was very low. In front of Adolf Hitler, I can offer the German movie Collapse, which can show the brilliant performance of Swiss actor Bruno Ganz.
