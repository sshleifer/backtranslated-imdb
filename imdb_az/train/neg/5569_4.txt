I really tried to love this movie. While watching this, we can imagine, "This man gives me reptiles, and I have a command of restriction." Also, CODEPENDENCE calls in the main letters. Was this really a conversation before filming? "Let's make a film that deepens the isolation of acutely depressed, socially trained people and makes them a livelier to complain about how bad their lives are!" As I see in life, the last thing on earth is that it's always self-esteem that we are attractive on the pot. <br /> <br /> The film's mood is 80 years; sliding and slow. Do not get me wrong, there are moments in the movie, only few of them.
