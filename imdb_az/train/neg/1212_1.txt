Generally, this movie is terrible and has never been. One of the problems with this film is that if the audience and characters are attacked, for example, "Oh, my God! You want to make a feel, but you do not care if you are in this situation, because there is nothing to know about the character. Despite the fact that the treasurer has a big movie, as it seems, there is still no tension. Maybe it could have been a mystery, but it was not. "All is a wealthy tool." As it was said behind the DVD, I was thinking that this film was carefully planned and intelligently prepared, but not last but terribly, very straight ahead and very senseless. Player is moderate or low, perhaps low. In my opinion, it's an hour of my life. There were "special effects" and gangs, so nothing was special. There is not too much blood or bloody violence, too much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to get a pretty surprising sound, even though it is not really worth searching, and I do not recommend it to anyone with a few drum and drum stories, although they do not agree easily.
