It was a terrible film. There was no story line. When they could not explain all this, blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw a few foreigners! I hate executives (or any) ideas and then when foreigners blame them! If you like, watch this movie. But do not say I do not warn you. Two things: How could Vinny say "welcome" when it was not a language? Unfortunately, Mr. Jones did not play a bigger role. The second thing I was caught up with was why Vinny Jones's sources cut off and cut them into a blue liquid, but they have no role. Why not? I do not want to be shown anything, and it has nothing to do with the story line. Short. Bad story. I do not waste my time - instead of watching the mirrors.
