How can you get this esteemed word from young British actors? The awesome writing, an exciting, exciting camera, perfectly flawlessly shaped, moved impeccably. Only Rhys Ifans is trying to fill her role with life. Sometimes the "painful" is another painful proof. Why do not the money get scripts in advance? Give yourself a blessing: forgive yourself and do something else - shoot like a knee. It's less painful and entertaining than this movie!
