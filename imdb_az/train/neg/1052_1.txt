***** THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE USED - but this would not be limited to a certain classic and well-known story. <br /> <br /> CINDERELLA's story is my favorite taste. This beautiful story in the world will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story resembles a Ugly Duck, which has never been neglected. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Prince Charming was the most undesirable memory. Why does any girl want to marry a proud, self-confident princess who does not love women? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella's story go for two stones: 1) With Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella Musical Lesley Ann Warren. Even with its stagey TV - set of 60 sets, this is the best version of the celluloid bar. Casting an entire star makes every effort to ensure the highest entertainment. Have fun, distort and memorable writing and music. This is classic. 2) Ever-Drew Barrymore keeps the perspective of the history of the gem, changing the line of the story, but it is not enough to destroy the effective development of the most important points in the classic fairy tale. The principles and the symbols of all supporting roles are well-written and well-functioned.
