I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant, but Dad was a big disappointment. Moving between a horrible story and the songs were just mediocre. This story is very conscientious. Instead of running as NTR or MGR, Rajni emerged as Tamil Nadu's next big guru. Since my husband's release this movie, Rajni has been shouting more movies! <br /> <br /> First of all, we were successful at buying Babu online (old by Sivajiganeshan) <br /> <br /> This is a great movie prepared to buy this duduk, except that it is worse than the Baba's comparison !! <br /> <br /> Bryan
