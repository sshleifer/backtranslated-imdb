As a woman over 40 years old, I have found a lot of insults and mistreatment for women over the age of 40 in order not to mention every woman at all ages. It was a sad, miserable attempt to write and direct a person's "chicken whistle" and it failed. Andy McDowell is not a lot of actresses, but when he was given a non-existent "plot" (I even hate to talk about a plot), he did not have the chance. There was no reason for any characters to feel sympathetic / empathy for each of the characters, and there was no attempt to make the film a reality or convincing. <br /> <br /> It's not just a DVD to rent my money for rent, but I have an attractive straightforward men's fantasy, which I decided to make a lot of money. We want this 112 minutes of my life back. Which is a ripoff.
