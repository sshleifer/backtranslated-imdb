Before watching this movie, I could say that it was a complete copy of Saw (a black guy who wanted to break his arm to get out of a armored place and his handbags). <br /> <br /> MJH's name has usually turned me away in a movie (ugh, GROSS?!), but still wanted to give it a try. <br /> <br /> I was a little interested in starting. Acting is totally horrifying and I laughed at almost every reaction I had from my heroes (especially the man who played Sulley). MJH was even worse, but I continued to watch. <br /> <br /> But all the latter were the biggest joke! <br /> <br /> I thought this trail was more strange than the Scary Movie spoofs, and that's really something. !!
