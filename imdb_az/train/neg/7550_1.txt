Okay, so I'm a genuine Wicker Man fan, and usually I am making british movies by Americans, so why not put my worst movie experiences? I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan, and maybe there was some kind of madness? The movie was excited! The plant that started with an accident / shooting did not relate to the film, and she knew that the police had escaped, as it did not end with the two girls coming to the mainland, and all that would be good would be investigated. The history behind the cunning man was not really investigated - I think the establishment in America did not really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and did not contain any atmosphere or inactivity. When Nicolas Cage ran to the flames, the best bit came to an end! Now I want to re-see my origin again to clear our frustration. <br /> <br /> If you are a filmmaker, you will need to be able to get a B) C) Nicholas Cage
