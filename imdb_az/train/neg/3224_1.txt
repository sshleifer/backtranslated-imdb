When I'm a kid, I watch this when visiting Phil's "Amcam" friend. It's back! The story of a dinosaur is a beautiful cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (sounded by John Goodman). A small boy dinosaur tells how the dinosaurs came to the world. He explains that he and some of his friends are part of what brings them back. I thought that the doctor / professor would be responsible for taking them back, but I was not interested. Kids can love it, but it is very unattractive. John Goodman was probably the only good thing. Weak!
