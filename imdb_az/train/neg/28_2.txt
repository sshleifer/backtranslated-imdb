This movie is terrible. This review should not be read further. <br /> <br /> They say that they meet with their spouse. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. Throughout the film, I thought, that in order to know that he really was, I found someone who liked Michael Madsen. <br /> <br /> The spouse, who claimed to be original or good, had never seen a good movie before. <br /> <br /> Even Hollywood's philosophy of action is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not follow! Instead of going to a jog - at least you do not feel like killing yourself.
