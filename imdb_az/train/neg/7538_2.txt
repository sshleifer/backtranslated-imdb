I was watching this movie because I love Nicolas Cage and I found it strangely and totally meaningless ... so I decided to put a little around and took my hand into the 70s copy. Amazing! Wow. what difference is there. The original way was better. As you know, the purpose of the existence was to know that everything was actually a statement. Indeed, the Christian community was expressing its fear of idolatry. If you are deeper, she also comment on life, but simply simply leave it, disappoint you, and if you want to know how it looks, the 70s version is a little history, but much better.
