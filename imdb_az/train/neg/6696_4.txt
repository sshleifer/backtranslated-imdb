Homicidal nymphomaniac prostitutes Miya, Kari Wuhrer, 18 captures her virginity and car, although she is too ashamed to accept it, first-class students Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the film, Myia teaches not just a curse, but a bad innocent and naive Trent to teach you how to place a hazardous hazelnut job and stay away from it. <br /> <br /> Upon resting on a truck's truck, Mia Roy is taken to Burt Young for some hot and heavy moves on the back of the car. Roy is too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is not an outsider! Ria was angry that Miya did not want her to get with her, and Roy just sentenced her to death for a year before colliding with one of the drivers driven by Trent Colbert's resting place. <br /> <br /> Seeing the chances of a brain, Trent jumped into the car, and both appear as the most strange car calendar in the film. Two cars crossing the Northeast US were killed by a truck and collided with state troops, and Trent's parents were taken home and taken hostage. There is another wild shot between all the SWAT teams and the terrible brain, reinforced by local police and government troops. <br /> <br /> You can expect a movie such as "Hit and Run" deliberately or unusually funny, but this is not it. In fact, the film is worried about how Miya behaves everybody in the movie, which is also a devious and child-friendly merchant comes into contact with Roy. Trentin's drive on the Northeast Mia, combined with it in a motel room, is in a state of drunkenness with a linen lamp and a light candle. In the brain, the horny Mr Foster with the owner of the motel takes it with him to give him a weapon, as part of some strange sex game. After taking Foster, he set off with Trent, a wallet of $ 400.00, which is cold from the motel room, but still has no difficulty removing the car. Thanksgiving Trent has to make money for her parents to buy a home to buy a home, and calls her back on a car in Miya to get her money back. She knows that Trent is the one who chose Miya from the law, and then tries to drive the Trent & Miya road, and goes on the highway with her father Roy. <br /> <br /> Roy throws his shotgun in this firefighting house after chasing Miya and throwing her away on a high-pitched muddy road. Roy tried to take off his pants so she forgot that she was missing the gun. <br /> <br /> Trent's ear and nose tiran and dressed in a S & M / Tattoo boutique as well as an assault and a murder, with a hit and run against them skins and chains, by Myri, his compatibility and loss of dog with To do this, we invite your rectangular and conservative parents to Thanksgiving. <br /> <br /> After being exposed to fire with state prosecutors, one was severely injured, with two of the refugee Trent's parents, Mr & Mrs Colbet, David Keith & Elaine Martyn, all local police forces, with a SWAT team, waiting. <br /> <br /> The film, which was really worried about the latest film, was interested in the film's full functioning. The first thing you hear about Mia's is that the film just ended up fading rapidly as a tray of ice pits in the Valley of Death. Although Roya was the most difficult man in the film, the brain was completely captured by the end of the film.
