<br /> <br /> <i> Billy Bob Thornton's adventure and diversity of skills, I mentioned this movie and was amazed that he did not hear it. <br /> <br /> Both were shot during the 2000 filming and 2-1 years and more than 2 years when the theater was shot (the first clue of time transition was not entirely good). Now Patrick Swayze can not move for sour apples, but Thornton is enough to create the difference between them. <br /> <br /> I check the production data for this site. Charlize Theron is a happy person to see if he is looking at the painting. By the end of 2002, his monthly weekend after the monthly theater and over 400 each month copied each screen. Generally, a total of $ 261K would surely have been able to cover the hotel and dining of the castle and crew within a week. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty good, and Reno is usually an interesting place to use. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That's something that was a hard-working opus, a quality of shooting, and a presentation by Billy Bob (though somewhat laconic in comparison to his usual job). <br /> <br /> Three different characters, representing the three sounds of "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa", and you know, under the standard, the audience was too long to confirm this. For him, one star, even here and one is better than production, is to say, typical "Lifetime" flick.
