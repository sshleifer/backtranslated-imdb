Despite having some fun moments, I thought the movie was pretty clever. He ran long, it was worse. Once the event was included in the Monument Valley, I watched more spectacular tricks than the increasingly terrible and unconvincing effects of my characters. <br /> <br /> The girl's character was particularly controversial. First of all, it is in the contract, then recognizes the truth and earns money. Then he returned again, then left them again. Then he returned again. There is no motivation for any of his decisions. There were interesting characters, some exciting scenes and many missed opportunities. I have to say that the pictures are very small in size. As you can see, those who love the Repo Man have to do something like this. Searchers 2.0 is not suitable for The Searchers.
