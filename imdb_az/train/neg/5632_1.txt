I watched the DVD (called the BLACK WIDOW in the US) and then I thought it was a really terrible movie. But they have dropped a bit from the original movie or missed many of them. Sex scenes were very little honesty and no nudity (even a breast), but a few other comments about IMDb.com have highlighted something about vulgarity and buffer. I have not seen anything like this, a terrific, filmy and sophomotic, sophomoric plot, which is simply a strange, strange character. Giada Colagrande is disastrous, either from mouth or from Botox to dolphins, and nary touches his face. Her name Taco Bell thinks of a drink in milk packaging: "I'll be Cola Grande!" In fact, it was very bad, I started to play as I did in my Mystery Science Theater 3000, and Dafoyun celebrated things as big as the skin face. It's like a silly paste indeed!
