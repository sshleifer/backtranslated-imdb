Dr. Seuss, if he were alive, could now be evidence. In The Hat, the Cat shows how film production can pull a classic story and make it a weak spark. Mike Myers, like a Bad Cat in Hat, has a big mistake! Myers proves that he can not act in this movie. She acts as a princess show girl who recommends her arm. The guys in this movie are somewhere between weak and boring lines. The story is never just tweaks with a few original and other stories based on the original movie like the most cinematic ever! Bringing the bad neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid man who will not go anywhere in life. If you think about this movie, this movie is a funny lane rejected by the newspaper. The film looks like tranquility! Of course, there is a funny adult jokes that goes off before the cat cuts its tail and says a naughty word, cozy, gentle funny. At least Grinch crashed and the movie was really good! This movie is part of the bright colors and a badly mediocre cartoon. Mike Myers was even in this movie? And something else, the fish. What is this stupid fish? You see it for the first time, it's a real fish. The next time you see it, all are animated and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of dough in the rubber game! This film is the goal of leaving a target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good jokes! Amazingly, I was amazed at having a good joke like the water park jogging jogging, which was good. If you have a choice, look at Grinch instead of this confusion.
