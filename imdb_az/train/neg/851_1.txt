After finishing his book, I watched the movie the same day and knew what was going to happen. The film had high expectations for the rating. The only reason I have given this movie from 2 out of 10 stars is better than trying to be a movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few key points to dislike this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** ALLEGATIONS ********** 1. Casting. Jack Nicholson is just like Jack Torrence's character. Also, I have never chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I described Wendy differently. Why did Jack choose Nicholson, though he should not look brave, scarlet eyebrows, but really bad. He had to look normal, and he turned into bad. They also make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was good, though more life needed. <br /> <br /> Scenario 2. They cut many things in the book and added things. Some of the things I've been looking at in the movie have been deleted, altered or mistaken. Some of the things I saw in the book (grass, shepherd, elevator) were not in the movie, and it was half an hour! <br /> <br /> Last. The latter completely changed, Halorann died, Jack died, Wendy had not suffered any damage ... The look did not blow. The last book was so cool and the film was so terrible that it took me. Halloran would never die, but Jack killed an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack would use a lamp. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I do not like in the film, but all of this is good. The camera angels were cool, the blood from the ledge was not cool, but I was surprised to be able to try to frighten the heart of the film and not to get into the book. I recommend reading a book before seeing this movie. Indeed, Stan Stanley is not Kubri, I welcome Stephen King because I agreed to sign a contract. I will never do it, I will take all my rights to forgive him all day. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
