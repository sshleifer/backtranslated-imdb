I generally want to watch Burt Lancaster movies - especially for Elmer Gantry to go to the hazelnut with its admirable display presence. However, his greatest strength was his magnetism, and sometimes his greatest weakness. This is really a deficiency of the Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a showman, but Katherine Hepburn was not fully explained how it might fall under his spell. He had to be clever, but it does not look like Lancaster's blanket on the screen! However, the story is probably one of the most stagy-looking movies I've ever seen, and it's obvious that this is a game-based movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a very advantageous movie that was shot on the stage, not in a very big open west.
