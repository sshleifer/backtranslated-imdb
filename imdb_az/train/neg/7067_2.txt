Five passengers on a bus depot tell each other about their dreadful dreams. <br /> Do you have more nightmares than you have with me? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Each segment has the worst features that operate, have special effects, composition and music. And were they terrible? Hmm .. I think I'm more embarrassed in the Teletubbies episode. I swear, I sit like it was, drown in tears for something that happened. Please do not worry. There is never. In fact, they even stopped moving rapidly because the main feature was more fun. And the end is the last police. Yep, none of these actually happened. If I could say the same words during the day, I set my VCR to celebrate these cobblers .. 2/10
