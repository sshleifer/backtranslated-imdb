Yuck. Instead of cursing their ancient books, I thought they were prepared with a generic script. Acting at other times is very strange and dramatic. Why would the "devil" kill two suspects who were immortal to a quiet doctor? Only for that heck? It is really important to show the Lilith's motorcycle when it's in the same place. We buy it! You spent a bit of money leasing a third-generation belt rocket. This does not mean that you should always show! "Faith's" lair looks like a Battlestar Galactica old school with a last-minute change. There is a scene in which we meet some people with a talk show about 30 seconds, for a reason and an undue killing. Everyone is the character of a throw. Unforgettable characters and more unforgettable plot, SciFi is one of the most thought-out films I've ever seen. Stay away from bad movies.
