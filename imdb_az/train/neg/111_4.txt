The interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to buy this video. Although there were great actors / actresses, there were plenty of subplots to keep an eye on. Moreover, it was not interesting. The dialogue was difficult and confusing, and the story turned out to be very convincing. I enjoyed what I was thinking of being one of the latest films by Audrey Hepburn. I always love John Ritter in the best slapstick. It was very miserable here.
