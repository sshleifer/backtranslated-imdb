Yes? Did not know that Scooby-Doo fought zombies? Well, you could not have been aware of this little movie, which was run by Victor Halperin, who ruled the White Zombie four years ago. He probably would have prepared a second zombie movie. <br /> <br /> No, most of the zombie films do not go straight to Dorothy Stone as you expect, and even brains are eaten. <br /> <br /> So, you see, the typical of the era - there's a lot to talk about. <br /> <br /> You are Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but it's about it. Cambodia zombies, really!
