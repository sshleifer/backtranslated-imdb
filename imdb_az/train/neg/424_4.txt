Yesterday was Earth Day in the United States and other countries (22 April 2009) and I went to see the full featured movie version of Earth by DisneyNature. Like car makers, Disney is trying to convince us to care about the planet. Perhaps they do not really care about the planet, but I do not think it will provide a special unit with the word "nature." I know my little girl loves Mickey Mouse and whom do I tell my personal feelings about a year-old Disney? <br /> <br /> Apart from the incredible movie theater, it was a typical disney disappointment for me. Disney movie trailers with a Disney clich√© ("life circle", "falling in style"), dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney "40% new footage" claims). I even began to think that James Earl Jones's story was a bit boring. I love James Earl Jones, but the work begins to make every Warner Brothers story for Disney and Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> I think some artistic photography thinks Disney has been purchased in a unique way. Some orchestras felt that they would sell themselves if they slapped music and recognizable noises. <br /> <br /> Disney, showing predators who chase and kill baby animals? There was such a scene in half a dozen that when they all fell down, they dumped the young men. I know Disney's animals are a life-rich and exciting life, and I think that the death squads, who are referring to teenagers who are directed to their action movie by their parents. I also understand how Disney does not provide brief information about climate change. Are they afraid of only a few unbelievers, still a controversial issue? <br /> <br /> I skip this and advise to rent Blue Planet DVDs at Netflix. Nature movies are best viewed by the English.
