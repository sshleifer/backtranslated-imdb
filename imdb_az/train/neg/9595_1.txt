The latest film, which should be left here in the last movement to bring Asian movies to America. As I'm dependent on all the movies that are a big fan of Asian films, I went to the gang and came to the US market, so I decided to check in advance and leased it to a local video store. br> <br /> Make me ... the action scenes create incredible disappointment, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely exploded this film. Jet Li would fall asleep following the battlefield. If you are looking for martial arts, your time would be better with Jackie Chan flick! <br /> Moreover, you entered a vanguard for the death of a girl on a martial art! BUT surprised! In the middle of this film is a good hour because of dialogue, inaction, the tangent plot, and because of the foundation we are exposed to. She has a much more connection with her relationships with the boy and the compass group she / he / producer produces and partially diverted the film. <br /> <br /> Because it just cut off all the time and developed the story through another film and directed it to martial arts. <br /> The Iron Monkey choreographer has made the move to Princess Blade. Moving slowly to describe the physical speed of the spouse was often insulted by the frequent use of camera changes. <br /> <br /> Please, I would like to spend your time / money with this movie. Spatial intrigueing and trailer can even seduce you, but I will not be the most appropriate movie for the film industry (maybe in Japan, but not in the states) and the film will be the worst movie in Asia film industry.
