It's like watching complicated details inside a piece of mahogany by a master carpenter, where Marlen Brandon is on the screen. Brandon's action is something that can be watched by the movie. The area is convincing and laughable (not funny). Players of another great name are making hopeless attempts to give symbols describing some of the modics of humanity ... These symbols have a wet cardboard on humanity. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either mediocre or just terrible. The director has a freezing frame and slow motion on impunity. Accidentally music is a cartoonist and destroys any sign of dramatic effect. It's not really looking for a movie, even the wardrobe has gone astray. A brilliant Brando could not move away from the terrifying lanterns they had brought from sculpture. I've heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... what it is. David Lynch's films are derived from bad creativity - this movie is not creative. And do not mix with foolishness.
