Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show have fled for years, but this is the film director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as you can get from the B-Way) and most likely to be a proof of his power and charisma in adapting this film. Leading Actor (Michael Douglas, author-choreographer plays as a subtle corporate lawyer). A thorough story about a terrifying soundtrack for a Broadway show that has turned into a therapy session for actor dancers, pushes us through the loud, skilful talents that sound alive. Nothing is modular or subtle, especially a funny subplot, about a dancer who is drifting back to the theater and burning his head with a flaming Douglas. Those with extreme desire are filled with promises and heartaches, but the individual stories of individuals are a bit embarrassed; It is compatible with Attenburton's rapid pacing, spells disaster, and even now popular songs fail to break through artificial dressing. * From 1/2
