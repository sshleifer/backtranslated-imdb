In this review, more than 50% of IMDb voters appear to have cast a 10 or 1 rating for this movie. I think that only 10 are either casting or crew members. They say that there are enough monkeys and enough time and enough writers to make sure that these monkeys will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare by random props on the keyboard. However, given the small number of monkeys and the number of times, you can find the only person to give this movie a 10th degree. <br /> <br /> I patiently watching the first half, foolishly developing a movie, a plot or a character, or some kind of social commentary, or just an intellectual idea. As a way of paying my attention, I was ready to take action, screaming, comedy, horror, and even arbitrary sex. Finally, I was disappointed, and therefore more than half the number was viewed at double speed because I found it to be empty for some small cinematography liberation. Unfortunately, there was no one. <br /> <br /> If the "The Choke" is confronted with the Scooby Doo episode, I'm scared that the cartoon will lift her hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unexpectedness. Speaking about the characters of the cartoon, the acting skills of different shooting members, Brooke Bailey London, the freaky, pseudo goth, appearing to be dead, were among the best (and best) and disgraceful of the London poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> I would like to finish a positive note, but even the voice soundtrack, the modern punk rock second time rate, even serve to increase a very bad flick, failing to enjoy.
