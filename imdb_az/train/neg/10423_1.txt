so ... really sexist and classic, and may not be in the early stages of the film, but stella says he will not change unless he wants to change himself and start talking correctly. well, she has, of course, changed her melody and looks to follow other reviewers. Although it seems like a love story at the beginning, it's really just like the social placement and sacrificing mothers. The end of the film does not give her a hero, it saddenes all. and I think he is sad, that people are heroes. Perhaps, people are commenting on the film they are filming. positive acceptance reflects persistent patriarchal trends in public conscience. yuck
