An attractive boy and his mother will not cross any city, cats and death will soon follow them. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I will admit that I am a little embarrassed by cats. But in spite of all the mistakes made in this film, I believe that there is a lot to go around and, in general, a very unpleasant experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more than just cartoon-based instincts here. Fear, envy, pride, or anger are all things that motivate these people. Although it does not seem to have happened, it seems that it serves to explain the story. The supernatural foundation and the scenario of Stephen King (which I'm not specifically to Mr. King) are actually supported by a few exciting FX jobs, makeup and pretty much music. <br /> <br /> The absolute boat of this film is undoubtedly Alicia Krieg. <br /> <br /> The King is a bit different (probably in that case too) trying to sit on the smallest horror ship that must be in the gathering of any fan of fears.
