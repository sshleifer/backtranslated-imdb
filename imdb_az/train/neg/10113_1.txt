I discovered this movie hired depending on the packaging. The zombie in front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you go to the movie and have the masks of teenagers. zero special effects ... and even in combat scenes, you can see them by 2 meters from the shock. Something funny is that Lommel behaves in the film shortly and is worse than any of the filmwriters in the movie. The only thing I can think of is that Lommel is trying to get such a bad film, which only expresses the "cult classic" ... but I think everyone who does not think this is one of the worst films ever. was made. the worst horror in this film. I rented and promised not to see Lommel again!
