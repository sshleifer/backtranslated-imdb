Give me money! Give me life! Give me some credit. This film was vomiting. It is useless and time consuming. How much energy is lost and completely meaningless. Okay, I understand the ideas and ideas, but give us a break! Next time, give me money and spend it. Lost boy, blame the mother for the cunt, the sinner! Clich√© yes ~! Get a life! We're sorry, but this movie is my total time of my time, my money, and my existence. I would watch egg cooking! There is no explanation of what happened. Prison? Why? Loss? but why? What should I do here in the Oscars and in the cinematography work I do for a single salary? How much has this movie won? Well, this foolish businessman made a foolish copy. He said enough
