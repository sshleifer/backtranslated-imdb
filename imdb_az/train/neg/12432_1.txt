This is the worst result of Home Alone movies I've never seen before! See Part 1 and 2, but do not say everyone is better than the first two! I would like to say that you do not shoot a movie, then continue with the same characters and actors, and the next step with INDIVIDUAL characters and actors! That is, if it was not a "Home Only" movie, but OK, they did not make a Home Alone movie. Culkin is already too old, so stop continuing! Goodness, this movie makes me BESK! Buy Parts I and II.
