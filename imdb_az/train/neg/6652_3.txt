It was a strange film around a main character (name of title by Brad Pitt) who was living in New York and thought his wife was Ricky Nelson musician. . <br /> <br /> The terrifying accent comes into the picture of a woman in a bad New York City and is fun as long as she seizes her. The film was destroyed for me. She was supposed to be Catherine Keener, who usually played heavy and rubbish women. <br /> <br /> Pitt's hairstyle - exhausted Pompadur - was fun to look at. I can say Johnny Depp plays this role better. Last Record: In 1992 (apart from Woody Allen) alone was the only one to hear a mono sound.
