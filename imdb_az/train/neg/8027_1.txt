I watched this movie. To the end. And that was not really easy. It's impossible for you to seriously believe the manufacturers in almost every detail stolen from the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which is very boring, badly played. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to watch a movie just watch the movie Scream, but if you want to laugh, it loudly and happily lets you watch some kids who are screaming each other and fleeing from the trees there, Watch the dark area to show that it is possible.
