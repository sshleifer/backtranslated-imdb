Because of the content of this movie, I did not know that all the constellations, like the Brit, were segregated in the US Navy during the Second World War. It is a very courageous attempt to bring this truth into the world. However, the movie is miserable, there is no direction, the player is another clich√© on the board and the script. I'm honest, that's one of the worst films I've ever seen. From the start, I sat down and drowned. It could have been a great movie, something new, unique and interesting for many of us outside of the United States. The sadness of the issue is its bringing together. Unfortunately, a similar truth is thrown into a downward budget, poor film, which may have changed people's attitudes. I only hope that in the future, one of the main studios will take this issue and will do justice.
