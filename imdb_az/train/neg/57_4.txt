What does "Executive Producer" do in a movie? If I remember correctly, it is a person who increases financial support for filmmaking. In many films starring Sean Connery, we can note that Connery, who is also a big player, is an executive producer who has increased his money. Unfortunately, there is a large number of films starring Sean Connery, he has been able to earn so much money from the great Hollywood actor, usually the producer's producer and the star reader, the film itself, and the movie itself is a star-filled movie / tool. <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL could be like a visitor gift from a kooky bimboesque cocktail waiter following a Sunny Davis saga and as a prize top diplomat pulled out. Davs (who has problems with combining both sentences) finds himself in a more boring and less likely situation As I've worked with Davis, do you understand what I said to keep the story / scenarios from PROTOCOL stars Hawk, the executive producer of Goldie Film?
