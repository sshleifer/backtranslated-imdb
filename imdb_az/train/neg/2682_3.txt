For a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise," I was impatient to see this movie. I'm very upset. The most realistic thing about this was partly an unexpected end that I thought was a "return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> Denmark, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles on the positive side. Despite my first meeting with the character of Denmark, I find it very boring. <br /> <br /> I really did not see anything about the movie. It could have been done better, for example, to draw more attention to prison conditions and horror. It was a really nice movie. There could be more motion and pressure. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" end. It is impossible to predict it. But at that time I did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
