A real-life drama is going on around Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who has followed the Walking Tall since 1973, but this installment plays as a bare TV movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but is very soft for his part; a guitar instead comes as a singer of an ambling country with a bat. Actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui are beginning to do very little. I will direct the film with good intentions, but the scenario is the mass of producers of transparent and lazy, and production is cheaper. Followed by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" in 1977 and "Real American Hero" in 1978.
