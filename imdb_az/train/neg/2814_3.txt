Part 1 8/26/2001 - From 10 to 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Marquis de Sadein has performed the same sadistic movements and made his predecessor. This Tobe Hooper movie is no different than the style of Freddy Krueger, with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a double role (Marquis De Sade and his relative). It really looks like he wants to put on Christianity, but in the end he loses much of my call, but leaves an idea that is incompatible with the film. It could have been worse if they were excessive in sex and violence, but they tried to keep it at a minimum, despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought is what Hooper wants to do in this movie? Undoubtedly, if it really took a bit to distribute, then in order to earn a lot of money in his name and therefore, he should be called gruesomely and the name of Hooper. That did not work.
