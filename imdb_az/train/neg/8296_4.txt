Basically, the dentist is engaged in swearing by the spouses and 3 daughters. The stage is interesting, the player is good and the music is quite cool, although sometimes it is not instantaneous and directed. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. Her husband shouts her in an opera before the poet before a dance show (which has a small role), then goes back to give it something, but sees it with another man. The rest of the film is related to the fears of the episode, his vision hallucination and the fear of his wife alter ego (Denis Leary, an old patient) and his "fear of having to deal with his wife to avoid having to do something about it." but I'm not going to tell you that the film will not go anywhere and the last is like a shaking scream. "Cartoon Motivation Is Missing: Why Does It Threaten?" She is a dentist, good-looking, good father. But why does he want to continue his marriage? Who knows where all the children are going to vomit? Where does this film go? Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (Comic Relief, Denis Leary) did not know that good performances did not want to be an American Beauty or family movie This is a stylted nonsense Avoid this.
