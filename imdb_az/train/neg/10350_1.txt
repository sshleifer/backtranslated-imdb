We all know that the greatest films of all time were based on books. Although they are not exactly accurate, these films are still excellent films. Some examples include the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Throne of the Rings and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie. Nevertheless, it should regret that it is not one of Time Wrinkle in Time movies. Not only is Madeleine unable to fulfill some of the main expectations of L'Engle's fan base, but it also hinders the standards, acting, special effects and ultimately respecting the audience. Think about me, I do not want to say; but on the contrary, I went out with an open mind. I thought that a prepared T.V. The film is for its lack of razz-dazzle in its script. Finally, Star Wars spin-off Ewoks would be a little foolish. When it comes to thinking about it, the original Star Wars was built on a "lunch money budget" and looked at George Lucas! But after the first scene, frustration closed me as I approached Black Thing while insulting me. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the Greedo film was originally transformed into the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (an admirable director's disaster that made a few treacherous changes to a joyous classic of an unlucky director), Mrs. Whatsit officially called the Confusion of Time, becomes a personal sympathy for stupidity. This is because mutation is at the edge of belief. Alfre Vudard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio), along with the slightly controversial decision of casting, has decided to introduce him as a master, like a master who turns our favorite star. True, a crow. Moreover, the celestial form of this favorite character has been hacked by an eight-year-old naked look; with a semi-horse, half-horse, with a creepy smile on his wings, has become a great human head, and a pair of wings have been hated by a knife to hurt the middle. If I was five years old, it would give me psychological trauma. The worst part was behind the back to avoid responsibility for synchronizing, causing the scene to look at the back and seeing a single, non-slip cheek. A part of the special effects that are more convincing than the ET <br /> <br /> Being the most bitter part of the road, I have to go through a tearful step - characters, actors, and stories. I personally, always, had imagined a look like Moyn Myrtle from Megni Harry Potter films: flat hair, glasses and most likely to find a figure laughable in supermodels. He was a grueling, humorous, pessimistic genius who had always been less concerned about importing and exporting Nicaragua. In the film, he knows a bad thing, I have no sympathy for me. In fact, she apologizes for the poor school principal, poor Mr Jenkins, who is constantly involved in dealing with me. Everyone's cute, smart boy Calvin was a joke! This irony is terrible. Unforgettable Pleasure When it comes to the middle, they have taken a happy old woman who loves to look happy and who is replaced by an entity that is "above sex," and liked to look at "funny" things, like girls. </ p> <br /> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the film has left a good deal to repeat the story found in Harry Potter and the Prisoners' Book of the Azkaban, preserving a portion of the original work. At the very beginning of the book, Hades is unaware of the downfall of the underground world, the destruction of his body. Ilkchel's rectangular fungus breaks his waist, as he shows the loneliness of the darkness, the truth, and the way it looks. The God of the Dead, pointing to the depth of terror of Camazotz's terror in Yerazad, has been scattered in the sandstorm and has lost its darkness. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that this movie exists. I do not believe your actors are really bad. It is written that these heroes will ruin it. The Wrath of Time was deserved by John L. Williams, canceled by Skywalker, voted by THX, and by Lawrence Kasdan, driven by George Lucas or Steven Spilberg, Industrial Light and Magic, sold by Twentieth Century Fox. In the present case, the film is not worthy of showing respect to those who respect it. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Oh , and the main cover / poster has a picture of three main characters driving horse riding on a castle. Some may say that it symbolized a high level of adventure. I think Photoshop symbolizes the irresponsibility of the artist who does not disturb Meg's arm properly.
