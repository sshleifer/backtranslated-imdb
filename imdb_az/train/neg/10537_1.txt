<br /> <br /> <strong> What can you say about Barbara Cartland adaptation? <br /> <br /> There are some incredible actors (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer). <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared on Anthony in two other Cartland epics - Hugh Grant (appear embarrassing accordingly) and Gilbert Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to go to Cartland's adaptation, one of Bonham Carter's ("A Heart Hazard" - what a topic!) Gilbert is a weak link, but Bonham Carter is certainly nice and, of course, , can move, and the rest part from the tongue on a solid sidewalk (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
