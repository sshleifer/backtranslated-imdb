As I grew up with Beast Wars transformers, I was not familiar with the original Transformers, and now, when I see a great movie and see an old cartoon that I have already taken, I love myself, the original cartoon and the live action movie are more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> I do not like BW's characters, just like Optimus Prime, Better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> So, "AT AUTOBOTS PERSON AND ROLL!" very well sounds "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The original Optimus Prime voice is still a powerful, realistic team, more Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Besides, Powermaster Optimus Prime is stronger than Optimus Optimus. Just look at the internet! <br /> <br /> In the character of BW, Megatron appeared to be a joke version of the worse version of the original series. <br /> <br /> Animal or robotic vehicles and spaceships? Genuine Transformers every day Gimme over Beast Wars!
