<br /> <br /> Once I'm surprised by Daniels (Daniels), but it's Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people. In 1983, Sirley showed the depth and promise of "Development Conditions" as the unfaithful mother-in-law of MacLaine. Over the years, Daniels could not get a good, meaty role. Instead, he is in the comedy of "Dumb and Dumber". <br /> <br /> As for this picture, it fails. At least the television show has led to different situations. <br /> <br /> A part of Mr. Braun is a perfect example of the film's failure. <br /> <br /> In the film, we constantly slap and make people into monsters. movie On television, Pamela Britton described an individual person who was in a state of confusion with the stranger's surprise. <br /> <br /> Television star Ray Walston plays a minor role as a government agent, or is it really a big disappointment for those who love television too?
