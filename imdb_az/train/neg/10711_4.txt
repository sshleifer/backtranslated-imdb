Minion ... well, minion. A servant of Satan and his purpose is to get the key that leads to the opening of the door where the master is closed. It is something that has a human being and will have another one when the body dies. Everyone who is there will continue to be angry with a berserker. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a secret of the Templars, which keeps the distance, regardless of the lock. The film begins with a few thousand years ago, when a few guerrillas in the Middle East escaped from the templars minion. Then, since 1999, the main underground ground winds are in New York. The archeologist determines where to find the ground. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about some films that after a film's filming, there is a long-running scene between the tiny, Lukas and archaeologist. . The film does not have energy, and it just bends. You're up to it, but you will not participate in a story that has been deliberately taken from movies (especially Terminator movies). Struggle with Minion is hard, so you do not understand how good and evil a warrior is. When it comes to fighting a squad of "skillful" templars, it becomes a soldier sucks when it comes to each other. And it should have been around for a long time. All this goes to show that logic is just drain away for comfort. All the ideas of a secret order of Templars, a door of hell and the basics are not well explained. We just accept that they existed. The film does not have much potential for the story, it seems to be made with just enough feeling to earn a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren looks sure he wishes to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 2/5.
