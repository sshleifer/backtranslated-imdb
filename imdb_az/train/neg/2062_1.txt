I read all the reviews here, this piece after the cinematic trash, and took me at least 2 pages so that someone else did not think that this terrible, unmanageable assembly was not the consciousness of any humor in the 70s or indeed. another period! If this is not a comedy * comic * at least funny, I've seen it do it before you see it. Half of the skaters were made of actions like Monty Python and Woody Allen (and better than infinite). A beautiful animation piece that lasted 90 seconds is emphasized in this movie for 75 minutes, so do not get too close to how the waste started to shrink and slide. Seminal Comedy? Only seminal really mean semen in the EASTERN world. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is really najis. Precursor jokes? In that connection, it's just a book, not to do a comedy. Busts and bums are just strange. Fine ... if you are a free kid at least on the one hand and you do not know if Playboy is not available. Break off this early 70s? In no way. Sketch comedy was back at least ten years ago. Even if it is only in the source of the gun that it can even forgive the film. Retro? Very hard. Palvanes' children might be advanced in some circles (and really laughable) about dressing up, but it really comes as sad. What took me all 75 minutes? I believe they have a very funny sketch. I gave a movie because there was not a low point ... and I can only recommend it to patients in the sleepless or coma ... or perhaps unable to lock ... their jaws would eventually be swearing.
