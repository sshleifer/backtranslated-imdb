First of all, give me this article that I am an admirer of the original Star Wars movie ... I do not read books, play games, wear clothes or eat grains (if any). I am simply a fan of films. <br /> <br /> However, I am struggling to see how well people are praising this movie. How can I tell if it's an incredible movie, getting it by itself and comparing it with terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2)? According to all the terrible shortcomings in the scenario - cheese dialogue, on the contrary scenes (ie, R2 is suddenly a badass and long CGI is a sad sad scene), HORRIBLE moving and celebrating ...? There was no internal dilemma in Anakin; turned into a passage and suddenly it was bad. The film is not interested in movies until the last 20 minutes or so ("NOOOOOO!" Was destroyed by the Frankenstein scene). Sometimes it is NOT ALL FILM when you fill the gaps with CGI effects on the screen with BOMBARD and more, and when you say a completely fierce liner. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a "dark" voice, there was much in the speech of ALL characters. <br /> <br /> I am quoting a question: Is an immediate and important feeling for the events that really happen really from the beginning and end of the movie?
