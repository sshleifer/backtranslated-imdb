I want to say that really ... or suddenly I lost my sense of humor, or this is really a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For some of the movies, this is very important to me. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to good old times when you find clever comic strips in any movie? When players do not have to play a funny role in trying to laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> PS (I apologize for my English language)
