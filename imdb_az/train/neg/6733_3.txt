The headline is somewhat suitable, though. This movie just does not cry - it sounds loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone have made conspiracial, humorous, mixed thrills that reinforce a semi-documented feeling. Here's the actual New York places with tinny "real life" acoustics to make the verisimilitude jack up. However, voice recording propaganda only serves to strengthen Stones' maladroit dialogue and oral hysteresis of tortured butterflies. Stevens plays electronics's spouse in a performance completely deprived of modulation, attractive James Mason (looking for haggard and boredom); <br /> <br /> An airline with an unknown bomb on the mason was intensified by the violent cohorts and violent cohorts to blackmail the investigator Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Every instance of a criminal case, The idea of ​​Stones's nail-strain tension is to hurry up with Stevens with Neville Brand with a rifle only Benzedrin and, on the contrary, fill the frame with the drooling kisser. But the camera case does not even cause the Brand to say that the effect (such as uncharacteristically) is almost tough, less lagging. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Stevens ends with Steiger, who flies to a subway trader. The road is calmer as a hard heavy. Angie Dickinson and Steiger's American friend Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
