The trailer of this film was interested in me for leasing DVDs. However, the movie that comes out is completely odd! Of course, this is not the worst movie, or this year's worst movie, but it's just a damn crap! <br /> <br /> The main issue is a movie that does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teenage porn? The story is interesting because it deals with the traps of the mail-ordered brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mild "comedy" (a word that I use in the least likely sense) then turns completely opposite and turns into a very grim and terrible horrible thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin has wasted it! <br /> <br /> Like MÃ¼tteki Kassovitz and Vincent Kassel, I can only do that for this money. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad film in every respect. It's not funny, because you're almost sexually addictive, it can be that Benny Hill can forgive everything, and dramatic elements are just a terrible mistake. Do not shoot a movie without seeing any of Kidman or Chaplin movies!
