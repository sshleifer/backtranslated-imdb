The worst movie of all time called the "House of the Dead" is not really there. There are bad movies there. <br /> <br /> I watch many of the Hong Kong ninja movies, which is actually the result of a Japanese police drama, which has not been completed in the end, in order to create something that is technically called a "movie." <br /> <br /> Dead is one of the worst films ever seen in my theaters. When I walked halfway through, it really was built with 45 minutes of this trash.
