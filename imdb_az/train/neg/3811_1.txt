Every Friday hates this crap as part of the tgif, and sucked a consistent big time each week with stupidity every week. If you want to see something in the comedy, "No On On Tell", Candice Cameron and Fred Savage are really looking forward to entertaining a good movie career after making a horrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these guys, and bob saget goes on a bridge to make this crapfest. I saw funner stuff anywhere else here. I'm writing 10 lines! Make a 'home full' for at least some of mankind's presentations of art and entertainment.
