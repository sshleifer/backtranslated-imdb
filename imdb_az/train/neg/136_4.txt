*** ALLEGATIONS *** *** ALLEGATIONS *** All young slasher flicks suffer from original drought? It looks very nice. Above all, it is a noble body that can be used well. Where is a young girl growing up, growing up, and killing all the girls who torture Hell when it's high? We can not say that there is nothing to work. But this film is the same as all other approachers. Everything from your account to the camera angles allows you to accurately predict when a wrong alarm comes and exactly kills the killer. Now we know the example. This stupid slasher pushes the envelope to credibility more than minutes. Ask me a question: Who is surprised by a friend in the dark, delicate body in the middle of the night, and who is surprised by the funeral, which surprises her in the blue? <br /> <br /> Valentine is sometimes just innovative. A good shot covers the scarcity of Denise Richards' character. It is locked inside a pool and holds it with a chain of killer. There are some good songs from the soundtrack, including a cool track by Orgy. The music video is included in the DVD Special Features section. <br /> <br /> Even acting is the best mediocre. All actors play their roles. Of course, David Biorayaz is often stoik in his description as Angel's title. Although Denise Richards is a great actress in the film, she also keeps a stone pitch across the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" looks like you are expecting: ambitious, incredible, unforgettable, cheerful, and good afraid. landscape <br /> <br /> My Account: 4 (from 10)
