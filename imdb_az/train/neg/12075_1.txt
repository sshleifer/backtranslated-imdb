This Hamlet has become one of the most powerful MST3000 episodes. I'm not a Shakespeare fan, but I do not believe in the fact that these works are slowly moving forward and squeezing. This is one of the most challenging movies to find, because there are a large number of Hamlet. I said that it's pretty boring. This black-and-white, pacing has slow and minimal scenery. All actors are dubbed, as they do not help. This is an MST 3000 I can not watch a seating reason, guy who plays Hamlet says his lines can sleep in everyone.
