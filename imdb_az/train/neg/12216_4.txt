Do not get me wrong - I like David Suchet as Poirot. I love the movies beside the film, but it's enough: Nile Death. Everyone did it! We know who is dead. We know why they died. We know who the murderer is. We know how. I mean, I say! Mr. Suchet could have used this excellent talent other than Agatha Christie's novels. I can say that the actions of all actors were superior. The fixtures were awesome and very realistic. Especially I liked David Soul, but I was surprised to see "terrible". I hope he does not look like 'real' life in such a way! Honestly, I do not remember the end of the other films. Sometimes I do not think so. Although I was writing this way, I thought Mrs. Christie was a very brilliant touch. I would end up losing more in prison!
