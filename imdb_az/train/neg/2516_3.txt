Unfortunately, I do not remember my book anymore, but I remember that Edgar loves me with Wallace's stories. This film represents a poor German product. It does not stop me - though the story itself is good, it's just bad. The characters in the center of the magic are quite surprising and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their speeches. Even well-known and loved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy can not rescue this vulnerable look. But there is hope ... They told me that this movie was better and better. So, we can say that this movie is not worth the screen, but it's enough for a lazy day.
