This movie is terrible. The stories relate to a woman who is trying to learn what happened to her brother. The film fights with identity that pushes heroic elements thrown out for erotic, good measure from noir / tension. The film has a very complex structure, for example, flashbacks that are often used without storing them. The site was poorly developed and characterized by difficulty distinguishing who it was and who it was playing. Some of the pioneers are in many films, but the protagonist is willing to go to the house with a strange, and then go upstairs (telling him to find a phone call), the minus the gun he brought was hard to believe. Some cinematography is too weak: 42 "was watching television so it's better to know what's going on in almost all of the dark scenes of everyone who has a smaller set, and it's generally chaotic.
