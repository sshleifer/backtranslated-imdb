This film is nothing like "Office Space" except for the premise. Office Space was hilarious. I do not recommend this movie to everyone if I did not laugh at once. Mrs Cornbluth's delightful tirade in the same room 15 Jason Alexanders are becoming more frequent. If you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or see someone else's home.
