It was a movie I hope I can offer my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the film, I realized that I could not even close the curse. I believe that the real war did not last long. Others will try to question my patriotism to criticize such a film. But if you go straight, you can watch the Private Ryan-i Saving LOC. Do not forget about the budget's budget or audience - the director's ability to make a smart movie. The length of the film is not that bad and is a recurring phenomenon - attack the same hill, but give different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - it was like my backpack. Character development sequence ("flashbacks" of displacement, after reviewing the last moments, before placing it) and throughout the movie have not been accumulated for a long time. So far, I have not finished yet. But there was a better movie called Border (not much more).
