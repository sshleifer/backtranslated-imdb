METAMORFOZ I'm on the way to the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Collection Collection and METAMORFOSIS is the seventh movie set. In 1990, the METAMORFOSIS appears to be a restoration of the Atomic Age Vampires, and it is a scientist who is trying to draw similar results. In modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of fright film. <br /> <br /> A university researcher seeks to break down the human genome to create a serum that will prevent aging. He was pressured by the Department to publish his documents; and some results (or risk of losing the risk), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! Thinking that there are no side effects at first, he eventually sees that the serum really changes it unexpectedly! <br /> <br /> The player is stilized; and the plays had a negative impact on the film. The score is pandering. And the science behind the experiment and their results are not just mistakes; this is absurd; is it funny? at best. <br /> <br /> As we have noted, the last 30+ minutes is the end, the seemingly infinite. Without going too far, I would say this, "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde met with the Creator of the Black Lagoon.
