Although this film has Flying Guillotines under the title, it has nothing to do with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its subsequent Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two works are masterpieces of the kung-fu film and are still classic. <br /> <br /> This is a very low example of the original, and it's on a moderate level, like a regular kung-fu movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film does not work very well. This is an illogical battle scene that follows one another and the flying guillotine does not even play a major role in them. The story was a part of the plot of the wicked prince, about some chauvinist monks following some bad guys and a part of this book, with a holy book. The same evil prince plans to punish the monks and use the flying helicopters. <br /> <br /> There are four films along with Flying Guillotine. This is least quality in my opinion. In this film, the design of the flying guillotine, in contrast to the other three films, shows that this film is produced by another three different people. <br /> <br /> The film does not have chemical dependence; poor production. <br /> <br /> Skip the best of this and watch the two originalities.
