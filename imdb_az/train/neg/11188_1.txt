This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid 3.50 for watching this steam turd in a movie. An incredibly dull, weak, scary script, often inconsistent and many scenes, as Heath Ledger nails on a wall by a ghost intercessor ghost ... <br /> <br /> There was an article on this movie , it's all about working time. <br /> <br /> This should be taken to the 100th step of the IMDb. Hopefully, 1/10 of my voice will help.
