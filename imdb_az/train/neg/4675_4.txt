"Washington Square" is a straight, obsolete adaptation of a short novel by Henry James. The novel is really good, but James is far from masterpieces. Moreover, a simple, unusual story appears inconvenient to make a movie (William Wyler, together with Heiress, gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> In any case, the film's great American writer betrayed the spirit of this work completely. The hero in the novel Catherine is not shy, very seductive and somewhat calm, but she is a healthy, intelligent young woman and as pure as it seems. His father is respected and respected, and he has no sickness. Over a quarter of a film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a weak thing, a weak thing. In the last quarter, he is clever enough to know a woman (and an incredible) woman and all of their dignity. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to this story. First, when there is a nervous child Catherine, there are difficulties with good vesica. The second scene, when it comes together, when prostitutes see some kind of open-air prostitute taking women out of the tents and so on. Nothing could have been more controversial to Henry James's spirit and artistic ideals. The writer is quite decent and has been so disfigured for the standards of Victorian age. I'm disrespectful to anyone to find any bullishness on the thousands of pages of Jacob's great literary production. I'm really worried about these two scenes. <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs a reasonable freedom to adjust the screen. But I do not see an author using his work to ignore or misinterpret the author's art (Henry James here) to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Sufficient for the film: poor and straight despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is a definitely not recommended movie.
