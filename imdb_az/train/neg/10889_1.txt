Gingerale is the worst movie I've ever seen. I think it's a comedy / comedy. I've pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. Special effects were not very special. I believe that I can have a good influence on things that lie around the house. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I'm not scared. Even Coolio is embarrassed to be seen in such a Turkey. After a little thought, it's good to say something about this movie - it's over.
