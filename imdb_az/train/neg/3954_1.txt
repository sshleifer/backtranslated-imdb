ALL FILM is from the first Boogeyman movie, as well as other Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love movie Brainwaves. It is framed with awesome, weak movements and more up-to-date (from the beginning of the 90s) footage. The film repeats these flashbacks throughout the movie, not just with the fun. So, you see the backward images again and again, as you can see now. As the originals are not bad enough. I have never seen a movie in full ... One of them has cured the last dollar of these films. Total ripoff. And talk about padding ... Why should I write 10 lines on this trash? If I say that there is rubbish on line 2, that is enough.
