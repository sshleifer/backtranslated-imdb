Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories. A mother and son moves secretly to a small Indiana city. They are Sleepwalkers, cat-type creatures fed on young girls. It has a small story and has a special effect; <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is as beautiful as her mother. As you can see, there are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. See very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King, the guardian of the cemetery, arrived.
