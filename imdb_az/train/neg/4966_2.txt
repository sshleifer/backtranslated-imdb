I realized that this film was built on a very low budget, but it's no excuse for Grendel's monster. Deathstalker, The Firebird, the Queen of the Barbarian, Fatah, the Invincible Barbarian, all of which were made on crossover budgets and poor special effects, yet able to create a classic of kult by adding some poorly dressed female fighters and a good sense of humor. Elephant costumes, dark castle and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes gave Grendel a very good low-budget sword and magic film, but manufacturers have completely destroyed the use of such extremely poor CGI effects and colorless symbols. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). Citizen Kane can not be a good example of how an entertaining low-budget fantasy / adventure movie can be used with reliable special effects and attractive characters.
