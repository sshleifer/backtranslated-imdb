When I looked at some of the movies, I thought the movie might be a decent movie. What if I was wrong? The film came together and brought together the hearts and decided to make a low-budget movie. For the first 10 minutes, you do not feel special effects with cheese moving, terrible sound and terrible god, but it gets worse. About 20 minutes later, I asked myself, "What was the plot again?" I just did not laugh this question for longing for this movie. The main actor is a setting for emotions, and he loves it throughout the film, but he hates it and even if it needs to spend between everything. The Flashback scene led me to vomit because I had an extra few minutes in the previous movie. Now we try to pull Morphey from "The Matrix" from where they shot in the middle of the film, though it's just a terrible job. The actor talks about "Star Wars" and fortunate cookie, almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the film, you do not realize that you are the end of the movie, because the plot is actually developing. The character of "Morfey" is just a good thing about the movie. Speaks a few words and credits. What is this? No plot, bad behavior, poor things, no evil. Please, if you value human dignity, THIS IS NO MOVIE!
