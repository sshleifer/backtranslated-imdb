<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie for the first time, I had some high expectations, but that could have been one of the most boring films I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace was much slower (and not short) .I was convinced that when Jane Austen wrote her book, she wrote several pages, filled it with illustrations, or did not intend to read people one day, Emma's best-selling application loses and drags. Now, "Sense and Sensitivity" had a slower pace, but at least there were live lines to prepare for it, as well as some good speeches! <br /> <br /> This is a 2 point defect, of course, a player. I am sure that despite the fact that most of the filmmakers do not care about it, they can work well but I have not seen much of this movie. People were too hard to be too tough to be English, so it was very difficult to be "top" and therefore not all as many people. # 3. As I said, the player just seemed to act as an actor they really are not like people playing. Perhaps there is a good thing, because they really did not look so beautiful. Why was everyone like Emma? Of course, he was beautiful in front of the rich and beautiful people, but behind it was a terrible gossip. If his friends were "ugly," he would not worry about going back. So why is this girl so great? Why do people have to explain the stories, "just to make him laugh?" Of course, the snob could not do that right. I have some problems with Gwyneth Paltrow and Gwyneth Paltrow, and his "Emma" has not completely changed my mind. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's easy to see if I'm so interested in it. I'm sure this is a beautiful book and it's all, but some books are not actually meant for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
