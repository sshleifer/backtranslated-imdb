Any movie with Karen Allen's naked scenes, and I think I'm still bored, this is a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen has been squeezed out of Paris and loves a mixed French man who is soon married. Of course, she is married ("But, cherry, why can this be a problem?"). What is an interesting clash of civilizations (or not) is just dull. I am exit. <br /> <br /> Maybe, after leaving the movie, the movie is better. <br /> <br /> My advice is that if you find yourself in this case, do not escape, do not go. Save your time and energy. On the contrary, you can save money. The production company did not keep the money.
