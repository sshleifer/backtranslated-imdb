This is a very low budget prepared for television for the kind of movie that is intended to capitalize on the success of the original. I'm an admirer of b-films, and it would be better for them not to add "Cube", because the original director and structure are better, and this movie is just a taste for my entire series. Characters are frustrating and clich√©s, have continuity issues, and a few open-cast screws. The story is hardly likely to develop because of more dialogue and suffers from it. <br /> <br /> This is simply a disappointment, if you use this same horror gimmicks and more in one movie, in the same movie, and at first very good. <br /> <br /> I would give this alone b-movie, probably four. The "1" rating I gave was a comment on the impact and disruption of intelligence.
