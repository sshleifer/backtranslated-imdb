Hello I'm Paul Raddick, a.a. Panetta Attack of WTAF, Philadelphia Channel 29. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler will tell you about this strange movie that enhances his movie career but soon became digital. <br /> <br /> Plus, a picnic, a runner by Sandler who runs the boat, is a comedian, and I failed ... or thought. Sandler is facing fathers who are like the World Part 1 and the Rebound History. The fathers were planning to engage, but in fact, they were killed by Sawtooth, the world's most frustrating bird. Adam Sandler went bad at Going Overboard, but Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's favorite, The 50th First Date went well. Man, Drew Barrymore was a hot chick. Spanglish red hot, Goboard Overboard Dooley is not squat! End of file.
