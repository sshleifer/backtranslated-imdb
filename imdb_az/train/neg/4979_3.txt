Why oh why everyone can not produce a fairy-tale movie from a fairy tale? It's been a year since Beowulf's second adaptation. But I must say that the previous version (Beowulf & Grendel, playing Gerald Butler) was superior to that. It was a bit disappointing. This is a mess! <br /> <br /> What makes me the most? Unhelpful plot elements (Human Trafficking, Breathless Love Interests?), Or bad CGI, or the inconsistency of symbols or unheated behaviors, were not added to any reason? Even worse, they were the way to look so awesome in the beautiful Marina Sirtis !!! And do not let it talk about this ridiculous passage? <br /> <br /> Beowulf has 30 people and has not yet shown the most striking sign of such a power throughout the film. He was thrown into the pit by the monsters who fought in his straws to save his pig. He pushed the arrogant prince, even beat him. He was very dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like it. This is of course the strong Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to finish it with a positive note, but I can not really look at it. If you read almost Beowulf, you will be forever disappointed with this inadequate, inaccurate excuse!
