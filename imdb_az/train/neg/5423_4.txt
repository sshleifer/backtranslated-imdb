I've been using IMDb for a few years now, but I've never written any reviews. <br /> <br /> This movie was very surprising (even when writing 6.4). Noisy New Yorker (Tim Robbins) <br /> <br /> Like alter-ego, like alter-ego, it looks like noise pollution and car's alarming alarm and vandals any of the cars he finds. <br /> <br /> The movie's title will be somewhat misplaced. Even though there are several copies of the observed or recorded noise, the only real focus of our hero is the car's excitement. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. The film seems to be thrown to influence the character of Robbins when it tries to shut down other noise pollution problems. <br /> Yes, we all will be disturbed by noise. No one likes the car's alert tone. Of course, all of us are using this phenomenon and this fact only to buy a baseball track for an instrument and sell this movie. I also say 'pretty much', because there are obviously sexually explicit (absolutely unnecessary triads) thrown to filmmakers who need such things to enjoy a movie. Honestly, this ensures that the eyes roll. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character is completely invaluable to the film in a very short time. It seems less likely that he will no longer be confronted with noise and will pay more attention to the noise that loses more visibility. The first half of the film is a story from a fierce, full-bodied friend of mine, whose hero turns into a hero. The Rectifier. But ... no transformation occurs. <br /> <br /> I can continue for a while. Annoying generalized public comment is always coming, and then the self-confident smirk does not help to add the film's ambition, and never create Robbins' face. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's obvious what this movie looks like, because it's pretty bent over your throat, but in my opinion it's a big failure. Only one person's thoughts are happy.
