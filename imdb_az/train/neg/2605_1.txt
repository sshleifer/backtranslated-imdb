Even though I recently put on the list of the 10 worst movies, it's no worse than Burt Reynolds' s "The Maddening" or any "Look at Who's Going" sequel. Still, with sexy Drew Barrymore and Holly Golightly, she has been transferred from New York to Los Angeles, but she plays with a horror-movie response to find out she is walking with her deadly look. Sally Kellerman, an actress dreams of a great acclaim in the 1970s, is a supportive roster, and Barrymore's forerunner, George Newbern, is the worst kind of sitcom actor ever to laugh after each line. The picture is drifting, but Drew's bloody shower scene is showy and psixon's identity is interesting (even though it's a Scooby Doo episode). But when it comes to the finals ... let it be true! Who had to clean this purity? * from ****
