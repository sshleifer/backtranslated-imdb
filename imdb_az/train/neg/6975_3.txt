O God, what a mock movie! It's incredibly cheap with fake special effects (livelier, playing a boy in a suit) and a fool's plot. All the dialogues are incredibly bad, and these actors (HA HA HA!) ... they are simply gracious. For example, I'm awesome (this is a dull guy or a husband and more pregnant women) and so on. I have never seen any annoying characters .All of this is great fun if you are drunk. I'm like this illness.
