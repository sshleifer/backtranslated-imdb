Marie Dressler links this Depression-era drama to a well-known bank owner recently released during TCF's April Fools comedy month. If you come with a great laugh, the Dressler-Polly Moran team will be disappointed, because it's a really bad movie. It is also very weak, surprisingly coming from the MGM. Leonard Smith's bare-bones cinematography causes a "school to build and do not act as a school that frequently damages one's worship damage" that ensures the line of the screen itself). The film does not have a credit director under the avalanche seen by night nature of production. In general, it is in a dissatisfaction with this Dressler, often emotionally stunted, and drifting into the bathroom to make a strange, end-to-end reel.
