- I was planning to explain what I did not like about this movie, but it would be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I do not remember much about it. I just watched it three days ago and I was not impressed. This is usually a sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remembered was unbelievably overwhelmed. It looks like the appearance of Humphrey Bogart, the exact detector. If he could move it would be different, but he is a celebrity-entertainer. Murder scenes were operated amateurly, and there was no tension in them. If you can not go into the murderer's five-minute movie, you have to look more afraid of Euro. Casting is a dead gift to the murderer's identity.
