As I have never read Gary Paulsen's novel, Hatchet is the adaptation of the book 'Wild Spells', so I have to compare it to the book. But I'm going to say that it's a little adventure, like a movie, adaptation or adaptation. <br /> <br /> 'A Wild Cry in Wild' version is less luxurious, a teenage mountaineer (Quincy, California, the only place in this movie). Jared Rushton, 13-year-old Brian Roebson, was heading to visit a father of a child on a small plane, collapsing in the mountainous areas of art, and was a child who was trapped for a while and was able to defend himself for a while. There are three parts in the film. Brian and his mother are ten or fifteen minutes of the characters. <br /> <br /> Approximately the third part of the movie (actually consuming nearly all films) Brian is "rude". These scenes, besides the wonderful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape, are nothing spectacular. You will not miss it, no real arguments (except for a conflict that is not confronted with a robe), and there is no great evidence to make any kind of pleasure or touch on the screen. When you witness Brian's first, primitive means and then improved ones (using tools) and his condition for survival, you can feel a bit of an embarrassment. This is really a case, if it resembles a normal one, it is almost too much. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In other words, when Paulsen's words turned into visual media, they did not leave any meat. <br /> <br /> Of course, the third part of the film is his rescue. However, there is a subplode that constantly works to strengthen itself during this time. Brian and his parents made a fuss, anxiety. However, in most cases, it is only explained by short, intermediate, minimal informational papers that appear as a back story for a music video. Every minute, Jefferson started singing "Sara" from Starship. If we think that the viewer has his or her own needs to fill out the gaps or to pull the results out, we get a lot of downtime to use at least some of this movie. whether or not he / she has been involved with Brian's right adventure in the third part of the film. These are the flaws in the narrative, when fighting on the screen to find out what these people are doing, almost say something to the TV screaming and tell me more! <br /> Of course, it's not a good adventure story for me. But for Jared Rushton fan, he was one of the last few films. So if you do not have anything else, look it up for nostalgia.
