This movie made me feel as if I miss some important scenes from the very beginning. Sustainability errors and suddenly stopping areas were just as initiated. I really liked Oopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, adding that Danny Glovers always trusted and respected the role of Rolling Grand Canyon. I should finish this movie after being seen as eternity, but it's been less than an hour; we had to extinguish it. There was no comedy, nothing to embarrass the characters or give them a sincerity, there was no excitement about the film and the clips of the past were weak, mixed and unnecessary. Not a drama like a comedy but a great idea for a movie (though a comedy would be better in this case because I love watching white guys and start acting like a fool) laughing at $ 1 in my video shop translated.
