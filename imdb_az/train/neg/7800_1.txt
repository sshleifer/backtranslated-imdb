Inexpensive, it's hard to avoid shooting and video. <br /> <br /> A woman who wants to kill her husband and daughter, I've seen English dubbing! Dubsters seem like American fans (members of the Germans!) And can not decide whether they want to play straight or make a comedy. One character (white German, of course), seems to be dubbed by a black man, speaks with a thick eboniki! 'Kno wahm say', Comrad?
