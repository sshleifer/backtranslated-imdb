Just a few months before the release of this movie, you saw it on all print media, so I patiently waited for the video version to see what all the videos were about. In the last half an hour after my death, I apologized to my roommate to invade the VCR. This is basically a feature film about unsuccessful characters. Except Amanda Peet (Amanda Peet's only paid quality), you can not stand for any of them. The film is based on the sophomoric, moronic, and raw dialogue. Only a little fun character is Eric, the only member of a group of friends described as dead. The last breath intended for laughing three heroes only causes the same frustration with Peet. In general, if you only feel desperate or have a dark sense of humor, rent it.
