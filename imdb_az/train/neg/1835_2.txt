Start with a scenario. I've seen cartoons deeper than Envy. Every time the character repeats what you see and is not funny for the first time, "Envy" is definitely the film's deepest concern. A joke-based movie was better for a better place. Here's a movie that's going to be completely out of the ordinary. Christopher Walken especially wants to forget this boom because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller, in pretty good comedy, "Disaster Flirting" and "Duplex" immediately come to mind. Make sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There is no dual meaning, only nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low price because it's as bad as its theme. - MERK
