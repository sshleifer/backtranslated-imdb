I liked Batman: Dead End. An unusual film for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the actor first. No one really good. It may be the best, perhaps Clark Bartram as Batman. But this is not a word. He is better than at first glance, but if you realize what that is, it is the founder of the body, a gritty actor. But the main problem is that Batman does not belong to the day and looks like a stranger in the Bat's suit. Instead of a terrible wounded man who wants to prepare for old errors. In the daytime, Bartra's face also shows an angry scratch on his face, which is never seen on the face: Dead End is likely to be any darkness on this trailer. Bartram thinks his head is shaking and shaking his head, but on the contrary, he does not. <br /> <br /> <strong> I did not understand why Colorado brought the bodybuilder. It's more important to act as an actor who can handle it, not a founder of a body, but HEY wants a GREAT TIME! Certainly, if Collora's dialogue did not leave anything undesirable, it could have done better. <br /> <br /> All trailers (yes, trailer, full-length movie) are centered around more Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is the cornice, the cloying, and the amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. She stays around her, smiles, she says. About it. He was not surprised when he was just a bureaucracy, but they took on a job and apparently moved on to a few attempts. Once again I say to Collora, we can carry ACTORS. Not Bodybuilders. <br /> <br /> After the past, when it comes to the Batman suit. Yes, it looks good in the dark. <br /> <br /> Somehow the costume resembles something that will get a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies to this movie. But it's not a good thing. These shots are especially appealing to lovers. It looks like and many "movies" shot in the back yard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shot is a Superman fire that holds a car in its hands. The two-sided and Batman's final filming ended. You saw the trailer for you. You know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why are you trying to show your talent as a director, making a trailer for a short film? When it comes to a true director, it does not prove anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-family: color: red; "> I can not understand where this error went.
