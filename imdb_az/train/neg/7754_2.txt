Spoiler will be this. It would be better if the movie was just a different script, a director, or a CGI provider. Not true? There is a man who begins with the movie's own groundbreaking mistake ... that people can see dinosaurs on an island ... err ... called Sabretooths and Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not have any original ideas for such films, so you face it in front of these films because it's part of the Rugby. Even the "shadowy design of creativity" is something. The Sabretouks, looking forward to Paradise Primal Park (Simply Ancient Killing Cats), are fragile enough, but I call the crown "Suluk". Because, after throwing a big cat, a hero is relaxing a little, because there is only one left. Join a strange nutritionist who says that he is a monster with three, three, and a third with his forefoot. Great, groovy. A group of college students also tested for access to a scavenger hunt, accessing their clicks frat or sort (always thought of needing a shorter nickname). He was one of the only survivors, so suddenly I was shot. Oh yeah, the Mandatory "Evil Capitalist Die" Clique is not one, but there are two of them! The death of Mr. Primal Park is one of the most funny things you can ever see as a sculpture of Sabretooth statue (sloggy glory) in one of these films, shrinking in several sizes and touching people with the throat. I just could easily get away. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
