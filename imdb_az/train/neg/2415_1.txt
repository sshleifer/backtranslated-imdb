... you know the rest. If you like a good zombie movie, THIS IS THE MOVIE. If you want to look at documentary-documentary "life-headed", you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a laughing movie piece, this is a real victory! The player is straight as a piece of paper. The best example of this is the absolute driver of the driver. We can say that he sang the sound of the 911 operator with a flat sound. A cardboard box discussion would sound like this person when I heard it. Oh yea and "zombies" have made the impression of the best snake with their FANTASTIC-operated (recorded sarcasm ... won the Oscar for the BEST MAKE-UP) The Quirose ...... Managing Any Direction . I felt like I was looking at an improvisation period (the period was more LA in the 1990s). This is one of the worst scripts ever I've ever had to do with a movie. As an epic word, starting with the movie "F ** k," I have not heard such nice lines because the Ice Grill, another "city" thriller. Of course, it works together with the epic hip hop soundtrack! All 3 or more songs! In general, what did you expect from hell in the film "Living Dead Hood"? I rented this movie, which is going to laugh at every stage, and the guy surrendered and more! I will laugh at everyone who wants to bring it together with a group and in the horror of a low budget (yea ...) for the night. An unforgettable experience for sure!
