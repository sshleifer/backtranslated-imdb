A really intimidating film. The gay boys are almost perceived by a flat person who wants to show that gay people are good, normal, world-graduate students in the early 90's. Although it is very dangerous, LTR is a great way to get rid of monogamy and grief for homosexual, single, sexually explicit gay women. Amazing! Wow! Who knew? Supporting characters are cartoon gey stereotypes (efemamine belt, pain, only queen, faq haq, etc.) and the main characters are small, middle-aged clones that are of minor interest. When it comes to romantic and ideological struggles of the main couples, it does not say much: we have seen before and we do better.
