One day we stayed in another day, another movie to watch. Finally, after finishing my Christmas shopping yesterday with a cold and foggy afternoon, I was nowhere to get rid of the "Land of Time forgotten". Doug McClure is the castle of leading actors, siphoned off in Atlantic in 1916 by U-boat to several Allied sailors. U-Boat (on a scene opposed to logic and reason) remains ultimately on a strange island, unseen by human hands. Together they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and Neanderthals! Can they escape before they can escape from the soil they are forgotten? <br /> <br /> Despite being shot several years before Star Wars, these films are light years for special effects. Model shots are better than you'd like to see in Gerry Anderson's Stingray episode, and the creatures are not even better. When killed by the zombies, T-Rex (I assume it was) was dropped the same way - mid-walk and frozen frozen, arms and legs were buried on a sleeping cow. Of course, sets are not bad, but vice versa, all of which are inconvenient and explosive to blaze the overall reliability and joy of your picture (all the same sound). The characters are just as convincing and sincere as you have to throw their weapons with something moving. <br /> <br /> For the first time in a few years, the bear has been t-shirt bikini and spin gloves for several days. Although it is quite clear from these movements, you did not know that some of the characters were Germans. All this was merely a polished and adaptive, and the audience did not migrate and moved to others. All this, while working on Colin Farrell's where you can find a little fun, this film has made an exciting fluctuation these days. I saw his name in the credits and half waited for an Irish accent, and he suspected his face. He is excellent. There is nothing particularly great about seeing here, but just OK, and the weather prevents further activity.
