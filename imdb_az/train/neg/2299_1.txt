Before they start, let them tell me to believe in God completely. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay is now out of the way, I just want to say that in the world, are these morons called themselves "hosts"? For the last time, I check a host, I do not discriminate, hate television hateful, or try to put my faith in every unwanted spirit. This guilty, bizarre, conservative, Fred Phelps, a believer in the Bible, deals with Pat Robertson everyday. I am all free to speak, but this pretty much says that if you come out of the ideal way, you will be sent to hell immediately. This is simply a perfect example of a problem with the SOOOO problem. One day, I had a teacher in my classroom, so we decided to watch some TVs because teaching did not give us any work. And we were watching the Club of 700 (against many of us) and, of course, Perk Pat was in confusion and confusion about the Bible, and Simon said, "God says homosexuality is sin" and I heard a child say "Hmm, I have my right" go. WTF ??? In a serious situation, if the host is trying to think that the sexual orientation of others is a great sin, then they should accept this host, find them and assign a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic.
