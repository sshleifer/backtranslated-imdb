In 1967, I had no idea about a certain director, a remote or near-galaxy. He tried to complete a movie with the name THX and so on. This is a short rehearsal of George's. We are sorry that there is only a cut to defend it. This is just the director, actor and so on. An ad promo for it. take it The artistic value is very small. This is a brochure. George's playing lead, Leia's character and ersatz Darth's character are very beautiful. All are flat trade dross. Which is a waste. I still thought I had seen the job. The rest of the film, I guess, pour water to kill its time. just a brochure.
