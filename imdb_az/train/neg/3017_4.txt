Now I had the best intention of watching it. I like some of Tony Scott's work, and a friend said that it was a great movie, although he did not hear anything but the other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> According to my humble opinion, Tony Scott worked hard. All this was a lot. Talk to me in detail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < People who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen was not able to save the movie alone. <br /> <br /> There were a few scenes to be drawn to their originality, but it was felt as though they were written by someone else. There was a certain sound around 4 times, it really started wrong after the second time. I strongly believe not to use the same tune one more time. <br /> <br /> Along with this, editing has really started this cut because the cutting rate is very high. Oh, and some of Keira's lines echoed again after hearing the second, third, fourth time. <br /> <br /> In general, in my opinion, if you want to see a high tempo and a "somewhat" funny flicki and do not pay attention to everything I have mentioned above. <br /> <br /> (On the side: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley).
