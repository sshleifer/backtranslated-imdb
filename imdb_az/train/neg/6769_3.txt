A failure. The film was not just good. 5-year-olds have a humor that can not even giggle. I want to say that some parts were fun, but that's not the majority. Lindsey Lohan should act as a great actress (and bad singer) and better movies. The film should have been released as the original film, Disney Channel, for FREE. <br /> <br /> This movie was a good thing about music. There is nothing like a climb rock rock soundtrack to brighten your day. These songs are very good. Peter, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun, especially about Alyson and Amanda's Sunshine and Caleigh Walking. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4. I gave it ten, 9 songs from it, 1 movie. Do not value your money, but it's a noise.
