*** COMMENTS LIKELY SUCCESSFUL *** I will make this study short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it was interesting and was some of the best actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Yes, that's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays a Wannabe journalist Pollack who rejects a case that could lead to corruption in the Edison Police Department. LL Cool J is a police force in a special force called F.R.A.T. (First Response Attack Tactic). Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) united with a "best" bad cop. At the opening scene, we see that Lazerov & Deed are facing some bank robbers, but at night a few guys dealing with narcotics are holding their hands. I do not want to go too far, but things are bad for children who make drugs. Ashford's Pollack (Morgan Freeman) will go on trial with Deeds & Lazerov. Suspecting the wrong game and with the help of Ashford, explores some ugly turns. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), F.R.A.T. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text- align: justify; "> You can tell in advance that Freeman and Spacey's performance is pretty weak. Dylan McDermott is the only person who gives all of his performances. This film has a full walnut and a believer from me. LL Cool J scares this movie. He says that each line reflects the same feelings and feelings. Deep Blue Sea was better than any movie he / she gave on Sunday. The film begins with a few wonderful activities, but with the rest of the film it drags the legs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. I put this weekend on Ebay.
