I'm writing about this "princess" of the German New Wave and I do not agree with many things. <br /> <br /> 1) The simple exposition has major flaws in key communication points of critical plot. Maria's abortion, and her husband's secret contract with Oswald. Some observers who understood that Oswald had come to his husband's consent to not go back and restore his wife until he died? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is very unpleasant, because it is arbitrary and accidental. His original scenario, when he read Maria's request for suicide after Oswald's request, found that her husband sold Oswald's marriage. However, in the latest version, Maria only takes a crib from her wrist in a gesture of suicide. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder hopes that the public will be forced to privatize and favor political politics. personal. Unlike the critics and "experts," I do not think it's working. Historical radio reports about the dramatic drama of the film or the noise of the German reconstruction do not sound dramatic integration of these historical events. <br /> <br /> Maria's passion for poverty from rising source to prosperity is parallel to Germany's economic miracle after the war. Thus, Maria is meant to be a woman of her own time and place, but in reality is unoriginal and non-specific. Women have been defending their independence by sex for centuries to develop their independence. 4) Finally, Fassbinder's drug addiction and ultimately impatience and carelessness are, in many cases, self-confident and amateurs. Unknown people speak the screen without ever seeing them; inadequate interference with music; It is strange that for a movie that condemns a country for the Holocaust's voluntary collective amnesia, it does not say so.
