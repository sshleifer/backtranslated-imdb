Bad, perverted groove soundtrack and a vicious copy of the VHS that can not be retrieved by the use of yeast, which runs on bad script, bad behavior, malicious management, irritating script. Trust me, because I have compassed this turkey to the very end. <br /> <br /> Hitler was the fourth grade code of spring. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was just an uninteresting spark that could only be read better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to look something like this, but if you want to watch a thousand times better, then look at the Dolls Valley.
