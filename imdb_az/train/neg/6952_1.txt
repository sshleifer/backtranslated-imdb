Most terrible retelling in a large number. Battlestar does not need to be named Galactica because it alone has its own name. Many changes only cause changes. Women have become men as women, but dependably on dependence, they are strongly encouraged to "attract female audience" to all the vulnerable women. There is a sense of corn. Go is your quest for space. The lack of cylons that do not accept the terminator leaves the film away, especially when it is a fembot. The original show had a lot of cheese to him, but the following was a great one. They tried to continue this work, but their supporters did nothing to work for their "story" and spit on their faces. Changes are good, not to do them when doing something better.
