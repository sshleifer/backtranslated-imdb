I can always say when something happens. I see, I do not hear and feel good. I did not get a good feeling following the front view. I'm not astonished about this movie, and I'm not surprised that I was rated as one of the worst 100 films here. <br /> <br /> The first thing I was throwing was the name. Because I did not have a problem with Eboniki (I am not black), but for a movie they could use a better name and used a headless grammar hood during that time. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of dance is enough. At least "I served you" was better than I thought. Even the soundtrack did not terrify me.
