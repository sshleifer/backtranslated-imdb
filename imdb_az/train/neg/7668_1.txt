The next minute started, we knew we were in trouble! The release is the best laugh. The story line was even worse. <br /> <br /> Acting was harsh and the actors were inexperienced. You look more like Slater, Reid and Dorff. Rows were delivered as a robot. I'm sorry, I love Reid, but it was incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff tried their comebacks and took a bad movie for the scene. <br /> <br /> Sustainability has come out of the whole movie. The living was not bad, but they were not really good. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line, we want to return ninety minutes of my life. They can save money, but take time! Which is a waste.
