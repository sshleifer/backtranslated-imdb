It's just bad. Sometimes remakas themselves, even if they are originally from the original. They can bring another look and achieve a certain interpretation, which makes them unique and enjoyable. This was poorly thought out and possible. This is not something that is even standing by itself. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but with some role and choice of projects puts something desirable. The original "Vanishing Point" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure and it is pleasant and fun. The film was shot from a different point of view, filling up with proven points that Hollywood believes it will be pleased to see the filmmakers today. Basically, we see a group of us as stupid. Someone insults him as a feature film, and even a cult classic tries to reconstruct these gaps. Manipulation Structures, "dog-open-so-they-don't-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateur trends ... <br /> <br /> Plain bad ....
