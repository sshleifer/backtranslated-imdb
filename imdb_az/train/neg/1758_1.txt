If you have not yet seen it, I say, just move on, do not spend time in the park. Neither the screenplay nor the player's value is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide which is worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's ability to act is very doubtful. This story is simply incredible. Loose ball American police are fighting criminals in their own Europe? Infinite Slavic mafia is protected by only two hunts? An emotional art teacher who faces a brutal gang? Spanish police thrown out of hammer than ??? Give me some time. There is only one good thing about this film: At least the production costs should be lower than the Ocean 12, which is meaningless and above.
