I feel it is rarely transferred to make such comments but I really feel like I have the right to say that after sitting in most of Rankin's terrible film! I actually did not get to the end, and we went about half a dozen or more (around 1/3 of the audience), after the whipped one, the frightening dialogue and the insulting character were very heavy. All of this film is pose and art. all styling and no item. this terrific player is drawn down with truly strange script, indifferent kinematography and student-level production values. how it finances, starts and ends is a secret for me. I think you earned a million dollars that is not released. Relevant critics tore him apart. really bad movie. shockingly bad. without really reminding you of an inefficient effort and even an uneven new-born-cat-one-deep-fat-fryer instant-fall. completely imprudent, completely lighter and worse; this movie is a great embarrassment for the big movie theater.
