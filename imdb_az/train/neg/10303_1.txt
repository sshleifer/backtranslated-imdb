*** Comments contain spoilers *** I just caught like an Appointment TV for this show, when they started teasing music under each SCENE, Don Epps was almost average at mid-time average, very versatile Diane Farr obviously pregnant (but we did not see it) and Colby was the TR TRIPLE agent so far. However, in the evening episode, David was shot in an elevator and trapped with an amateur amateurs, a paranoid, a nutshell. A trained, experienced field agent who has experienced a lot of times in the gate a few times and who is experienced in a hand-to-hand combat, will deal with one person. The hazelnut work does not go away, it does not go away, it falls off, it closes its eyes; <br /> <br /> Then, looking at a pole about 20 seconds, she looked at a fiber-optic wire curled around a ceiling like a stripper. <br /> <br /> Then, let's say that the scene has come to be more attractive than my chubby, frumpish but very attractive Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / Amita interest, another Friday night. Don gives David the word of anger, "the code to go down to patience"; David is ready, kills the lights, releases the elevator, shuts the hazelnut work ...... <br /> <br /> DAVID DOES NOT REPLACE / DEATH / SHOW DEFINITION. <br /> <strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; I hope NUMB3RS is entertaining.
