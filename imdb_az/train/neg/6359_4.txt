Woody Allen, of course, has one of the most harsh pens around. He can observe it sharply and turn it into a blow line that is not distinguished by anybody. However, when it's the worst movie, it can be frustrating. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have until the end of the split. Set up is one of his more interesting ideas. Four friends sit in a restaurant that discusses whether life is a comedy or a drama. To resolve the dispute, a man links the story to the beginning and asks the other two people who argue whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy (a comic playwright and the other dramatic dramaturge). Two people then continue the story and the movie plays stories they touch. Now, when I first heard about this movie, my concept was telling the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) varies only to how you look at it. Now it would be interesting. But stories share only one key element and several side elements. They are completely different stories. Drama is a very strange writing and ambitious that can only work as parody. If this were the case, these elements were unsuccessful because these elements prevent viewers from feeling emotional about any part of the characters. The comedy is a story of success, but they are still short and fast. Will Farrell is obviously intended to stand up for Woody, but he could play more of this token without adding Woody's belts and al-ticks. Woody Woody is not the best. When someone else tries, they play a character, model a well-known player. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films make me feel more spiritually than I am. my money is back.
