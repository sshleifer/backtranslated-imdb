This movie comes as a disappointment for me in Tsai Ming-Liang. Every aspect of it is lazy. So I will not analyze it thoroughly. However, some observations are: <br /> <br /> 1.

It means something in the metaphorical context of the movie (thirst expresses desires for proximity and the root value of watermelon, sex). <div style = "text-align: justify;"> What is happening with the porn actress, why it's unconscious? <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: or we do not know if he is dead. The high lie message appears to be a sophisticated question during successful delivery (= bombastically) but retrospective, its inert body is a cheap dramatic gimmick, a pretext? <br /> <br /> 3. Antonioni did not express himself better than 40 years ago, but nothing in this film is expressed? 4. The musical numbers (repeating the "The Hole") seemed to be an artistic interaction of the secondary school that was skillfully performed at the secondary school level. If it were a point, the point sucked.
