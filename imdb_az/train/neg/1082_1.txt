I've seen all of Grisham's films now and they are very bad, except for The Rainmaker, but it's so awesome. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> This is the character that nobody can do is one of those films that are foolish mathematical things. He is a lawyer for Christ. Why does not he call the Police to the missing children? <br /> <br /> Yes, the police hate all human rights defenders, so they limit it and attack it. <br /> <br /> He will be released after being arrested for murder, a prisoner who is locked in a cell waiting for a trial. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> <br /> <br /> 0/10? ? One of the worst films ever.
