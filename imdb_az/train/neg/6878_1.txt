I'm from Puerto Ricanam and this is one of the worst I've ever seen. You can see that the people on it are clueless. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and their culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican, but they probably do not know the rest of the others. You see them talking while they are contradicting themselves. If you want to see a real, true documentary from Puerto Rico, you should see Mi Puerto Rico. This is a serious, real documentary document. It's not like a trail. Rosie Perez is based on this documentary. I thought I had to think about Puerto Ricans. They repeat what I do not know. Here's the only thing that goes to the documentary film. I hate seeing a piece of garbage using the name of the island. It reduces standards.
