Why do people get good materials and change some of them? When I read the book allegedly preceding a few years ago, I can say that it is very small if nothing else is in the original book. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with low expectations - I knew that there would be an unfortunate telemovy feeling - but it did not even answer them. <br /> <br /> This is not the prequel, the original name. This is not a story of Carlito Brigante but a story of a completely different nature. They are totally spat in front of every Carlito's Way fan there; <br /> <br /> Luis Guzman shoots the movie <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Based on the original, non-woven material of the book, Carlito's Way - I really liked something that I liked. I felt the same way with Chopper - there were four of them, as well as interviews with fantastic non-fictional material and a brilliant biography of Australia's most fearsome underground figures, instead of being Eric Ben's performance spot. We will never see Carlito's original rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars are not so terrifying as they look at themselves alone - there are some decent speeches (Jay Hernandez is not good at Carlito but other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But in fact, the film and the book have something to do with it (after that, a lawyer and now something written by Judge Edwin Torres) <br /> <br /> Truth, though, is not alone - it's probably the most disappointing prequel.
