Every Christmas man shows that my kids are a beautiful life. I'm also happy with Bad Santa. I mean, it's me. I confessed that. I love cheerless, northern movies. I love the perfect ones, but the variety is good as with many things. What would happen without Santa's annual kinematic ka-ching movie in all the movies from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton in the Christmas season? Fred Claus Nobody remembers Bedford Falls, but I do not believe that the Christmas movie should reach iconic height to succeed. "Fred" is a great holiday movie, perfectly enough for adults, with enough humor and enough charm for children. My husband and I were laughing, and even most of the humor was clear and Vince was only Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-fork Santa who was very helpful. It's not a great flick, and it's not going to be possible to review everyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I'm glad to do it, a little spicy holiday schmaltz. There is nothing wrong with that.
