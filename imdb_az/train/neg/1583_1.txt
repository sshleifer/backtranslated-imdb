I am a great admirer of Stephen King. Loved Running Man. So I am very excited that someone obviously has a movie. When I showed a local network movie, I was in heaven. I was preparing for an entertaining night! <br /> <br /> The first indication of something wrong was that I saw one pouring out Arnold Schwarzenegger. I do not believe that a person who is famous for films shot with a "shooting" can become a more cunning part of the book. But I still believe it will be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Do you know, Arnold had some secret abilities? Soon, the only reason he was even rewriting the whole story to deal with someone's helicopter fight. Yup, this is a standard Arnold movie: when the hero is mistaken, the hero tackles the difficult muscles and fears everyone, solves the problems and takes the hero. <br /> <br /> I was surprised. This book does not say anything. I know that books can not be written on the screen, but they have nothing to do with this book. Stephen King should not criticize any connection with the film and must be banned for the "Running Man" for this shameless shot of the film. I often say it, but this movie was BAD. If I did not watch at home, she threw the rotten tomatoes on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> even more by calling them here embarrassing)
