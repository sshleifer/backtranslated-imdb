This movie is incredible; - all conditions are ugly; It is a fact that a serial killer (vampire or other) is ridiculous to kill many people as they fly around the film and prescribe the movie. The Vampire itself will not look in the Bela Lugosi movie. Most players are such a tree, actors should be treated for dry rot. I'm looking forward to a good film from Steven King's novel (except, of course, with me, Stand). This film suffers from the majority of Stephen King films - the lack of money used for "special" effects, poor players, terrible characterization and dialogue. This movie fails in everything that is cheap, sticky and successful.
