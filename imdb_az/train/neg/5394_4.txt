When the director is unable to get the idea of ​​using or refreshing the original, I am irritated by Shakespeare's adaptation. While using genuine words in an upgraded space, it may be difficult to work in the periodic style, even though it is particularly difficult in the 20th or 21st centuries, for example, Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night created a late Victorian very effectively. If he were less than just a song and dance and would have been more than Shakespeare's text, he could work with verse 30. Unfortunately, it's just a very nice show, but it's pretty trivial. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Brana. One of the students is too old to play, but it is more important that he is an experienced Shakespeare actor who, despite all his efforts to become another student, always shows the strength of the players. Of course, he played the King - there was no problem when the adult student, the king, was a young student. Instead, we were a pleasant but unforgettable actor for the King, so no kingly, not a so-called king. <br /> <br /> Despite the good songs and dance, the amount of song and dance that I found tired was, unfortunately, the sharp disruption of the great Shakespeare dialogue. That's all, it ends with an inadequate and soft sweat, and I am very bored, including funny turns, when it's over. The branch did not justify Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> However, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan are definitely beautiful as an elderly couple.
