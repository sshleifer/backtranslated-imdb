I thought it was a very magical, unresolved version of the famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good and gave their characters a personality; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe you start with a shot and then there's a recap for flashing. <br /> <br /> Like every scene, like a very bad TV soap, I felt that everything was predictable and stopped. <br /> <br /> I really was looking forward to this movie and I hope for more. The only thing I can say in his favor is that Mick Jagger crashes, but not many.
