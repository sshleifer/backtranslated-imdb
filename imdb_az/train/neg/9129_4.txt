There is nothing around - this movie is terrible. I've seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I know the characters and have no serial origin, but it's still just that. Nevertheless, Peter Sellers's genius still lights up with a stoic facade that reflects the sadness, tragedy and power depicted by Noyland Smith; this is compared with Peter Cushing's described by Van Helsing, but is made up of a tenth of all Cushing's "Dracula" movies. It could have been a special thing if the film was made more attractive, like the BUBBA HO-TEP with the 1960 AVENGERS TV show. If you complete a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something you have to do, but it's a link for everyone.
