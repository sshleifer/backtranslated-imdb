In the valley for 2 days, I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. Except for a long line of Tarantino years since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the movie is entertaining for the first five minutes, but filmmakers make unforgivable mistakes so that the "hip" part does not allow unnecessary and strange violence. This is a jump better.
