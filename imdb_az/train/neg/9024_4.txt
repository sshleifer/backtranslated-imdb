"Shinobi" is one of the films that automatically kills a character with a story or feeling of feeling automatically. Unfortunately, for watchers, you have to develop symbols in order to pay attention to people's death, but all of them are a series of violent incidents. <br /> <br /> Okay, so whether you are worried about the characters in any way that are unforgettable or sympathetic, at least, why should you basically justify the causes of death? Nope. There is a war between the two ninja clans, without knowing what really is happening to each other. The emperor says so, because they kill each other. Even after the apparent desire of the emperor to die, they even refuse to leave their meaningless missions. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is very good. No feature development is available and there is no justification for the plot to fight. At least they are fighting for cool action scenes, right? Again NO! In fact, many battles are not even battles: the ninjas, which proves that the film has been a long time and effortless, suddenly dies (and in my opinion). I'm talking about things like "Lalala, I'm riding and thrown into my neck". The ending for this character. Not even half of the movie, I started smiling.
