Every good story should be "upgraded" with the rooted Broadway music? As you can see, those who can not own their fields think that there is room for plundering of classical literature. Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorite, I acknowledge that Dickens is often writing things that leave you alone, and that's just a fine example ... Of course, add the creepy music and with each character, combines bobbins from boys and rounds them all one at a time. Argh. <br /> <br /> Four stars in my rating come from a cast that resembles my Fair Lady. In each of these films, a game version could have been proud, but then they should go and read above (see above). Unlike my Fair Lady, those who are studying here can really do it, and they have forgiven us the kind of sound that Oliver Reed sings (if I make a mistake, pardon, for some time). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint, he said. Why am I embarrassed to anyone except for being really embarrassed by putting his foolish songs on a perfect story? Rarely, this has had a good effect. Generally, the story is ruined. However, he did. The jury still thinks this story is worth the effort, but in the light of all this, it is impossible to say.
