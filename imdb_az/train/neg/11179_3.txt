It was painful to see him in this movie than we all loved Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> Once Pacino plays the Pacino party, which has attacked and attacked everyone with a totally fraudulent and incongruous Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger does not see much work there, creating many gaps and weaknesses there. His scenes with Pacino are straightforward and unconvincing. To believe is hard to say to one another. There is no energy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Tea Leone lit the screen. He was an electrician and scenes with Pacino were the most interesting in the film, but Alin was not enough to get rid of shame.
