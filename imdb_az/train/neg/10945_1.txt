Words can not simply describe this movie as terrible. I looked at the video last night and did not believe it. Basically, "Snakeeater" is a search for his stolen sister, who was captured by an old warrior (Lorenzo Lamas) and his rescue style Rednecks. <br /> <br /> The film's actor, writer, direction, photography and editorial is saddened by a song called "Soldier", which should be one of the worst subject songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) is a funny bad man playing "Welcome to Carter". Otherwise, be afraid of all expenses.
