Cannon attracted a true visual beauty of a seductive medieval epic (except curved fan). How did a long-term studio, known only for Chuck Norris films, first come with a lack of knowledge? Here's a point: the amateur player and the terrifying field are a sign of medieval legend, and there is no cure for some bad deeds. They have also prepared another cheap exploiter with hundreds of lusty bimbos to further enhance this look. For two "Barbarian brothers", they are able to create even more strange noises than brave warriors who are strong enough and courageous to save their homeland. This is the biggest loss of the potential I've seen in a "low-cost" low-budget movie, and it's bad enough to hit a bullet through brutal beautiful pressure. All this started an advertising campaign selling T-shirts based on BARBARAN! Only the movie is a great reminder!
