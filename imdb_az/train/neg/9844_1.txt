This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not sure if it's still serious or just a satire. One of the movies that use every stupid one can think. Arrrr. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was actually pretty good. But something else sucked. Ten years ago I saw that it still hurts and does not last forever in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line in the film is really stupid. If you want to deceive the fate of this movie, I will not destroy it for you. But in the end, I invite you to take a nhya * moment, between the several. If you do not have a better thing and you want to celebrate it and laugh, perhaps it may be worth your time. Additionally, if you are forced to go on a date with a person you do not really love, suggest that you watch this movie together and they will leave you alone after seeing it. I think it is a fair price to pay.
