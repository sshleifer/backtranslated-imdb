Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Over the years, I've seen very bad pictures. Sound sounds can be used to capture picture quality, direction, operation, and so on. Description and so on. Only good shoots (funny because they are too bad) are special effects. Generally, there are about 5 thousand laughs. The rest of the injury will damage your brain.
