He said that the channel was surfing and that he had kept it in LOGO. It's like Roadhouse without happiness, moments "so terribly bad that I have to watch it." Writing is sad; <br /> <br /> Generally, there is a gap that this epic is thrown and can never be seen. That is, the main character is directed to skiing in some hired homes, and the house is not a good, ordinary thing, but they choose to show all the homes that have been shed, as in the Sistine Chapel. We're sorry, but every 6 people in 10'x10 are looking at a dining room with a futon and the squirrel is naked. I have not learned anything bad from the Bad News Bears, my wife's insult (see the hotel room) ... wow a toilet! yaayyyyy !!!! I will not buy anything out of it, so something is up to you. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> I believe that I'm not fond of this movie I'm not the only "open hater" I can only admit to being "phobic", of course this is not true. Based on the actual content of the film, I decided that the movie was dealing with a flawed, terrible thing and was not in its presence (ie its renewal ...). <br /> <br /> Certainly, it refreshes to see, but it does not fit into a big movie, give them a better material to work and give them a closer look. In fact, I welcome my endeavor. Without a doubt, I would like to listen to My Distinction Kitchens rather than watching.
