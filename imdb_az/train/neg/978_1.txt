I watched this movie recently with my sister, who loved Sophia Loren's performances. I am a cultural barbarian. I hate art in every form or form. Rambo is more than my movie, action, killing, blood, horror. If you do not know yourself, avoid this movie as a pandemonium. No one dies, no action, no nudity, no such thing. Give me a recipe with a little sentence. The black and white Nazi propaganda begins with 5 minutes. Every Italian woman in a housing block passes a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of anti-fascist and guards. Housewife, deceived by her husband, meets with anti-fascist. She is in love with her, wants to fall in love with her, but she is anti-fascist gay. Nevertheless, they fall in love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife sings a book with a gay lover, and the boy himself is deported by his agents. Last. Want a shorter resume? BORING ... It's short enough? The boy must use his gun at the beginning of this film and shoot himself in order to save the audience from this oppression. On the one hand my brother loved this movie. I said, I am a Cultural Barbarian ...
