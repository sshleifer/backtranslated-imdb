This movie has an interesting structure, but the player is pretty bad and the script is weak. I'm very upset. The moral dilemma facing the main character is interesting, but it is written off and is plundered for the shedding of the potential winner. Two of the four people in the theater were released about 45 minutes later, both of whom laughed at how bad the film was. I hit it until the end, but I have to admit that I play Blackjack on my mobile phone to stay in the last 30 minutes.
