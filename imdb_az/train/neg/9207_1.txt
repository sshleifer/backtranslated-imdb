This movie is sold for $ 1 in DVD on Wal-Mart and I do not feel as if I've lost something to watch this movie except for my movie. Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling) enjoyed a superb performance by taking into account that it was a very young and terrific command. The story is about the college students who decide to play the game Maze & Monsters, only in a very realistic situation. Robbie Wheeling has had problems playing this game with other colleagues in the past, and it is recommended that parents leave the game alone and have a good rating. Robbie faces a very nice victory and plays a romantic toy with her, and once she plays games, does not love her, and behaves like Monk. The film has some scenes from the old World Trade Center, as well as films flying on the Observatory and Roof areas. This part of the film is a very sad thing for many people to die because of the evil in the world. Except for Tom Hanks, it's not a very good movie trying to keep the movie above entertaining entertainment.
