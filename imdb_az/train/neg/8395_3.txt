- A film crew has been filming a horrific death of seven people for a number of years in a past, cursed house. One of the crew finds an old magic book and would be perfect to use ritual scenes in their films. Spells in the book are better written than the script we use. But as the book is being read, suddenly suddenly a cemetery lives. Casting and crews now face a real threat. <br /> <br /> - The IMDb lists a 90-minute working period. Nothing will happen in the first 60s of those minutes. The movie is spent a lot of time. Should we be scared by the horror film we are shooting? We already know that their films are not real. <br /> <br /> There is little to be satisfied with seven paradise houses. The player's shamelessness. Most of these "actors" were playing games at elementary school. The score is very scary. The 70s of the television series are very reminiscent and do not create any atmosphere. At the end of the film, there is no one to talk about the atmosphere except for a couple of minutes. Character logic is completely non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. I do not remember a scene where a character did not choose the most sophisticated benefit for them. And finally, the first 60 minutes of the movie I've already mentioned. Are you saying BORING? <br /> <br /> - I did not rate the house of seven corpses as I was actually working on the film (possibly an accident). My two favorite start and end. The opening title sequence presents the deaths of seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the film. And the latest scenes of massive jewelry, like zombie, endanger the film crew (a noise reduction). In general, these moments are not enough to make a good movie.
