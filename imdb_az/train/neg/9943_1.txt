The art of lids (like a man holding a terrible pelet ball) may seem like a martial art film. (Very difficult.) <br /> <br /> I'm interested in the movie's original name Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a US-registered condom) The film is loaded with homoelement. If you love these things, this movie is not really bad. However, look at these points: <br /> <br /> Actors' groin and legs are approaching a large number (one scene resembles each player with a complexity even in his pants). lime, peach and red. As a filmmaker, this movie is a drift queen! Sometimes, sometimes standing symbols, sometimes close to each other, touch on as they speak. Also, the heroine's uncle loves women and everybody in the movie tries to kill her. Is there a message that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> Do I go to the scenes of fighting? (Yes, some of them are kept in a fight.) Martial arts scenes are short and inaccurate. There is no good thing here, just the standard actions you see in the old Chuck Norris flick. There is also a scene followed by a car that can be tracked at the first LOW speed.
