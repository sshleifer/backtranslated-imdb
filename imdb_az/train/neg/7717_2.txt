When I hear the plot of this movie, I just have to see it, all the cities destroyed by the murderous tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is so funny. <br /> <br /> Detective Dick Mason, a special military and scientist group (never a SCUBA's outfit and a poster on the back of a paratroop, including nevertheless Greg Colburn), "The Attack of the Killer Tomato", 1950 is the parody of the B-Movies, which is the horror of Japan in recent years. The film starts with a standard-sized tomato detected by a woman who washed in her kitchen before finding a place in the middle of an event as we have claimed that the tomato killed this woman, and let me know if any saner film progresses! There are a few funny moments to be fair, for example, the Japanese scientist Dr. Dickle with an American accent on Diet Nokitofa, or when expert Sam Smith leaks tomatoes, can anyone pass through a passport? . Also, this film was bad in 1978, maybe it was all so good. <br /> <br /> The film "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", such as "Aircraft" and "Naked Gun" series, has been made better and has begun since this comedy. there is zero stability in the editorial, and it really feels slow and feels energy shortage. You need a lot of things happening suddenly to run a parody movie. Reading in the film seems ridiculous, and the furniture store ads on the screen are really strange for the movie. As a result, you can see why this film is a cult; I do not see that many people are indifferent to it. Unfortunately, I will give so much results.
