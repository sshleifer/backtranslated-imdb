This movie was followed by a project on love. Tell Nicolas Cage to learn what he wants to be his character, and then read the lines that we say. My life can not last ... I accidentally cut my hand ... my brother was nearby. Obviously his fault. And from the moment I reached the happy end, she entered the wonderful guy waiting for my mother's sadness and singing. There are no banners, bad scripts, and enough extensions to small characters. Save yourself to a good laugh. Clothes were done properly and additions made an incredible job. It would be an entertaining movie to do, but I'm sure that more genre is special, I can not recommend this movie to everyone I know because it's not an intellectual movie. This is not a chick pee. This is not a serious romance. And I can not show children because of gender and questions to watch. All this is not a good flick.
