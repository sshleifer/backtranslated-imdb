I'm China in this movie. I choose the screen name of Sheeba Alahani, because I modeled in Italy and could not tell the true name correctly, I chose Sheeban, and added Alahani as it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I have never moved (and shows), but it was great fun for the movie. Every morning they gave me "action lessons" (obviously not helpful). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were an explosion on a bunch of good humor and jokes. This film was never taken seriously, and it was a tax deduction for internal information. <br /> <br /> I am giving an envy because there is a sense of humor, but I am enjoying "acting" on 10th.
