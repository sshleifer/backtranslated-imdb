I'm a little tired of abuse of God's name to protect people from their thoughts on earth. I do not think that some people who are really good people (mostly white Christian children) will go to paradise if I do not think about the idea of ​​Armageddon or against Christ. Because we are not good enough, the rest of us need to suffer for a thousand years in heaven. God can be a judge, but I do not think that will measure the level of goodness. Give the creditor some credit.
