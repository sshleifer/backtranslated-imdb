<br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see this only by Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel that I have spent my time and money, because it is increasingly an actress / actress to see a movie. Hopefully, I learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping it in its place. Because it depends on me, at least I want to see the last one, we only hope for a good thing, but I did not hold my breath and, fortunately, I was the only victim of the film. <br /> <br /> This black and white film is black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is as bad as it was registered, and all sex offenders describe the hardest criminals in a difficult situation, and the bad ones among them were really bad. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's player was in a normal situation, but the yellow girl she needs to replace is the best. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to exploit a popular theme and makes it cheap, dramatic, and scenario - it's just unreal. They simply use sex offenders as a pretext to deal with cheap felonies, beatings, rape and torture - almost nothing seems to be. <br /> <br /> I will collect the film, I will not go to the United States and go straight to the DVD. It should remain in other countries, but Hollywood and Richard Gere had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie B-series is not worth the movie.
