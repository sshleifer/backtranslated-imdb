The police outside the city came to Stephen, who was convinced that his brother was brutally murdered and wanted to bring his murderer to justice, but his brother was a victim of a savage culprit. So his sister, his best friend, and Stephen traveled to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> I was wondering how incredibly terribly B grade products and even how they were released. This is a true "ghost" look like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee thought that this should be the worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is a real cheap co-authored film, Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (Lee did not forget), cheerless fashion (these sunnies), cheap and shadow special effects, illumination bad use, humor ... if there is any trashy 80s music (some films are directed only to play some unusual band), there's a tedious story with a straightforward and boring dialogue, with Wolf's vision scene. I thought it was bad, it would be very funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Articles have shown the location and settings of the film well, but in this regard ... I will really add Sybil Danning in a short space of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why is the scene of the movie, <br /> <br /> It's a terrible piece but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
