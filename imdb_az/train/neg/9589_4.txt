If you pay attention, this movie is awesome. Only colorful images are a perfect movie if you're dancing on the screen. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and thank you very much for the music. In the end, Bowie was only 10 minutes in the film and watched the song and dance sequence and left something he wanted. The story's morale was really terrible. I can not say whether there were foreign issues in London in the 1950s or not. How much I liked for the first half of the movie, but I liked the "not sell" message. When I started killing the Gypsies, I thought my job was broken. May I rent half of two different films? No, there was a "British White" song and dance series. We're sorry, but it's not something you can write about music on the Second World War. At least in this study, it's not a music that can be described as "campy" just like a few times. Generally speaking, if this film favors its mind and better players, I would say that this movie could do something better. (And do not put David Bowie in the yoke longer!) My Price: C-
