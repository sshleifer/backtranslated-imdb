I have also featured this movie at New York's High Level Film Festival, and I want to say that I have a full and terrible hole. Although somewhere laughable, it turned out to be a real area to talk about real laughs, and it was terribly awkward to move in some places, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the narrator's voice had never heard). J.C.Mac felt the real character of his film, his true performance and his creeping and the only real function. I am convinced that another shot and not a tough government with leadership, it could have been worthy of half a movie. Let's hope that this is not a general release, or if you really want a copy, look at the bargaining table in Lidl.
