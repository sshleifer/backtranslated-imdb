I reflect that this film is very well prepared and very well behaved. <br /> <br /> First of all, a game built around the concept of "Russian Roulette" had to fill the clock. great problem, if you make a "live" show, your first competitor is likely to fail enough to shoot "real" bullets. Then what are you doing? There is a 50 minute show to show and there is nothing to show. As a result of the trial, you will end up and the first five contestants are alive, that is, the number 6 bullet and maybe they can not get a payment. He is not going to shoot himself at this point, as it is the kind of anti-climate. <br /> <br /> The second problem is almost great. Human nature. People walk in nudity, panic, land, and on the contrary, they do things that will not create a good television. Too many coincidences. That's why the "real" Reality TV is really intensely written and even closer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sexuality is a great surprise to those who survive the film with two minorities (one gay) and two female competitors, so we stay with two white men and, of course, take a bit less unpleasant. <br /> <br / > Klaimax's character, Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and played in this role, and therefore has no one to blame for it) when fighting for two hours of television suicide, is actually producing conscience when someone dies., What did he think? <br /> <br /> The problem with the text satire is really the truth, This is because it has a place based on a headset or is ridiculous from the top (like the Network).
