A great little strangeness ... I doubt if a single shot would last for 4.4 seconds after adjusting MTV. It is worse than Kusminski's version (a reminder: he exposed Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). However, the rich received what they deserve. Heathcliff is a dark and rough Heathcliff gold-locked angel, a fragile and attractive Catherine, a cheeky, melancholic breasted heffer, space and a lumber-like roof, and has become the character of Sara Michelle-Gellar, the innocent Isabel Kadeer intentions. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners warn. This thing has been prepared for you. Everything is an hour and a half long music clip given to you; you do not even want to understand the complexity of the characters, and even protect yourself from the start shock. Actors worked, but as I said before, they were wrong. Fine photography, but correction is in the classroom TV production class. I beg all of you to read the book or even read the cliffs; the previous versions, even Kusminsky followed; but avoid a large number of future years, which will not be able to benefit from a commercial free premium.
