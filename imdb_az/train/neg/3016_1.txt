As I'm an admirer of Tony Scott movies. When this film came out, there was hope that it would be like On Fire. To learn from the movie that this is one of the distant things! The story was water treading from going and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And all the "guns" were too free! <br /> <br /> Film is centered around Kingera King, and this movie will never be a movie star! <br /> <br /> I love the management of Tony Scott, but it takes all the friggin cake! We're sorry Ton, from 1 to 10!
