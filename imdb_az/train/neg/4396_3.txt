The complaints here are pacing and financial issues in the film. When using archive movies and letters, the film presents a fresh and interesting perspective, often not just too much of the material chosen to emphasize (for example, Goebbels complains about this or that illness or a small German country). Also, the film crawls along the cover. It was evaporated during the war in 1920-1939. The film's history of filmmaking can be better organized by the story of Goebbels's life, with the exception of the Canal documentary's slightly more sensitive. Nevertheless, I wanted to.
