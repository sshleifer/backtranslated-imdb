I'm totally disagreeing with comments that said it was a good movie. This is a completely SUCKED movie. I say SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. Story development is strange. Mia Kirshner has changed into a dull looking party for the party because she was not convinced of any innocent girl. In addition, all actresses looked old too long for college students - college students seemed to be about 30 years old - you understood the rest. I just watched for ten minutes and started rapidly to look for sex scenes. all sex scenes are bare, hurry and, most importantly, no frontal. All sex scenes laugh at thinking of how much clothes they have. Give yourself a blessing - put it and earn yourself a few bucks. Result: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Player - 0, Points - 0 out of 10.
