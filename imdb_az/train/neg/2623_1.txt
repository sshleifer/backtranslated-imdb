Sly Stallone is the best actor in the world, but is better than his brother Frank, now drop his prizes! The Mullet hairdoer, muppet Frank, believes that every part he plays may play American / Italian Wise-Refuge refugee from "Big Daddy". If you ask someone to make a move, you can 'refuse it!' This film worsens its position even with terrible bottlenecks here, while Frank still stealing hateful acts. <br /> <br /> Everyone who lives in a mood, throwing their guns off, silent with movies, does not mean anything like a meteorous land and turns all women into a terrible nymph, but since it's a 15 certification movie, sounds in their underwear and sounds like hot dogs. What happens at the end? When I lose the desire to live a long time before the end of the film, I'm sure you do not hesitate. <br /> Take this situation and "Deep Impact" last year. Point of sale: When one of the women's women has lowered their underwear, they have pants / pants under her suspenders / garter belts, There are sticks on suspenders to let go. Perhaps, though, this is a pointless point, but it shows how dumb it is when you can not get this right!
