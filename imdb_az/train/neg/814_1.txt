This movie was just bad. Only every police movie is available and considered. Bad guy goes away? check. Partner? check. Conflict with partner identity partner? check. Rookie proves something? check. Rookie grizzled veteran shows. check. Only idiots were those who were not related to touching themselves, but they were saving my old chest for Dooley's next visit. Dooley's award-winning car always adds a sexual battle with Girl Power, along with tired old-fashioned gags and banal overdone material, as you've got a recipe for a really bad movie and a really bad movie. Avoid all this.
