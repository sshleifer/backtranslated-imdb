This is such a strange movie, you say terrible or sit down with friends, you can give a killer a rose. Something more strange than that. Amateur hit, even worse, and directions, perhaps none. Special effects are funny, but the accompanying music with a flying devil baby will certainly be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But do not do it, and do not take it seriously. 'Porn genocide' is likely to be respected. I think I'm worse than a tribute because I have not seen it. I gave it to 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it exceeded the limit. Excessive eye is the only thing that one works. If you smile more dark, stay away. Do producers laugh at doing this?
