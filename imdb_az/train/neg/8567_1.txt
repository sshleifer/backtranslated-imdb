When I rent this movie, there were very few expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was bad), the story was very foolish ... this could work for a Disney movie (outside the fence), but this is not a comedy but a ridiculous princess stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing: dead children can then add a stupid movie! I create 1 out of 5.
