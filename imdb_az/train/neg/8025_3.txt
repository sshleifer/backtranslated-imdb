Yes, this show is as bad as a fanatical actress and student. I did not think of the first few demonstrations, but then I realized how sad it was to show everyone in the show first. Alex and Aaron's antiques have given men a bad name because they cheat or make their choices <br /> <br /> Ryan can get acquainted with Trista. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> In the daytime television, any show really looked. I think the reality of the TV is to evaluate it as an "entertaining garbage". Look at something as a laugh and I should not think too seriously (I do not follow CSI as TV-tired and clich√©s, but you have to think too much while watching). Several ideas for some of the reasons behind the show. Initially, a woman like Amy (who had many students about it), as a 'warning to all women', tried and staged the scene of the bar and the club to meet each person in every stage. Hey Amy is an ideal place to join a club, get a hobby, do a charity job, change your business to a place where you can get to know more people, gees, a bar where I know a future future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls face the views of the "perfect man" meeting. Talk to the ladies: she does not exist. Besides, there are many beautiful men who will make great husbands, and some will be right for you! they may not have an annual figure of six or have a small JFK appearance, but all of these are older children. In this show, the woman's instability is incredible. I am still young, and we believe that women are gradually grown because they are older and more realistic about their future partners. This show proves something else. <br /> <br /> Generally, this show has done much to confirm many stereotypes of how women look at men in society. This is really a terrific show, and I think all these types of shows should simply be stopped. Blind Date and Fifth Wheel, because the best acquaintance show by a country mile is entertaining. Nothing is more than a simple night in between "couples." The bachelor, unfortunately, is very serious.
