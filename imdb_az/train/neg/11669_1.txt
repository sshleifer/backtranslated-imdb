Perhaps, it's nice to see beautiful things in the absolute space of a movie like this. With the sometimes senseless limit of many Hollywood movies, we can use a scene that is comfortable and explosion-free, with an incorrect language and a mixed liner. Minimalism takes its place and can be very effective when used correctly. But this is not one of these events. <br /> <br /> Take on long scenes without any dialogue and terrible, sparse scenery. I am convinced that they must have a great sense and understanding, because the intended message has suddenly been abducted. Acting is weak ... moderate and infantry ... and one of the worst crying scenes in history (you can sit down at the end of the movie). The decoration is a delightful, long-drawn sequel of a girl who is in desperate and wandering through a curly park, as much as she pulls from a tooth. I called it an anticlimatic, but the movie was not set up for any summit until anything in the "erotic" scenes ... it would not be right. I'm sure there is a script used during shooting, but with the amount of dialogue I think may be written on the cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie does not offer anything interesting or surprising ... there is no beautiful story, no surprising concept, visual drama, no excitement. In addition to two or three fun moments, this movie is over two hours old. So dull and terrible movie.
