I've seen this movie recently and have found great hopes. Previously, the film was not based on the release of the filmmaker, but rather on the basis of what he wrote. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (Body double, leading role in Brian De Palma's masterpiece) played a major role in all the films. <br /> <br /> According to Qafqazinfo.az, the only thing that can make a little attractive is the selection of places to shoot. According to my humble thought, do not waste your time.
