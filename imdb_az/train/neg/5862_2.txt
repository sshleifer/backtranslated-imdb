A good guy "Why does not he remember this movie?" It's good to answer the question. Because, in fact, in 1978, many people have not seen it and are no longer seen on television. Even if there were some crazy comedies in the 1970s, filmmakers were clever to avoid this movie. Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde, or Joan Rivers! "Paul Lynde was a funnier on the Bewitched or Hollywood Squares where Joan Rivers, in his career, singer Karen Carpenter, each laughs to the jealousy of jealousy because of the lack of weight! Everyone is Joan! And it seems that every single "one" name from the period is dropped. (The most striking is Doris Roberts, then "Everyone loves Raymond"). /> <br /> In any case, it is a good idea for a story, a man who is pregnant instead of a woman, with a friend, Crystal was finally set up with a prostitute to lose her virginity, but instead was "top" , she is pregnant! <br /> <br /> Crystal stomach is growing, all women are affected by their emotions and feelings. "Unfortunately, she is now socially wrong! <br /> <br /> She takes her son's baby If you like a fruit (God knows how it can get out of here!) This is not a girl (there's no shock here)! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and unforgettable, humor is moderate or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars is a good idea and some good touching and relevant moments / Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Do not see the rest of the Rabitit test, do not take a great time! <br /> <br /> I do not believe that Roddy McDowell did not sign up!
