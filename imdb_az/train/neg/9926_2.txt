I just watched Blazing Saddles's 30th jubilee, one of my all time! Black Bartin's TV pilot stunk. The field was non-existent and the player was not good. Of course, Blazing Saddles was an attempt to succeed, and there were television shows that could make great movies, but that would never work. Given that for many years, television movies will not hear silent when broadcasting television, it is unthinkable that they think they can put on a television show with the word "N". On the other hand, I saw many faces familiar! Over the years, there were many actors / actresses I knew from other shows. I have to write all the names and make a few searches. It was fun. If Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash, I would argue with my mother. I won! :)
