Over the months I've heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I see how many scouting filmmakers are beautiful and sweet, as it combines the creative ideas of other people to create a stunning premiere of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any million Blair Witch parody comes to mind. Whatever these directors wanted would be a foot on the Hollywood gate, they did the right thing and they should talk about how Hollywood's films were compiled. How many times did you hear the word "This Animal House Gets Future"; "Wall Street meets the dead poet's society"; or "Love Shakespeare meets Star Wars"? I recall that independent films are not genuine and courageous, but safe and predictable.
