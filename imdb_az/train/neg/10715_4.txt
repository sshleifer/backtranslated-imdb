What's going on? Here we are basically a firm and reliable premise and with a decent and talented cast, but loses it somewhere in the movie. In fact, it was really going. When we realized that Angie really was not pregnant, there was some excitement, and then I realized that it was, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot of fun to a movie, was full of fright, and his whole character was not nearly as important as this movie. I really would like to see more interaction between mother heroes, Kate and Angie and, unfortunately, I can try for a pure comedy with a drama that is not a comedy element. The film was so laughable that both players were so laughable and could have been so funny in the movie, I guess that's a lot of scenarios that can be a rule.
