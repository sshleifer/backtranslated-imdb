I think you have to spend about 80 minutes of your life watching the cruise track, like me, as you enter the sixties. These strange anti-depictions, a strikingly sophisticated public comment on the sixty values, and a relatively well-known actors captured in early (and embarrassing) images. Laugh-In manufacturers sat down and decided to write a full length movie covering all the high dots (and more) of issues between the children and the structure, and then gave him a few hippies and about $ 10,000 to complete them. It's a very challenging classic, but in its turn, it's just as strange as the time, the silence, the very idealism and the compassion of the structure. Not clear to everyone.
