In my saying "Kool-Aid drinkers", I have said that these are dedicated Pavarotti fans who do not try to objectively evaluate this film. This is to award a 10 Wally Cox Award for Mr. Universe or to paint a cuddly Elvis in Louvre! At the beginning of this film, I recall wrong misgivings like "No, Giorgio," and some said that he was among the worst films in the film. This, of course, is to multiply it. Despite the bad and distant from a great art work, there were many things to do about the movie, and the biggest deficit of the film was not Pavarotti's player or entry. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, it only stands on the shoulders of the writer (whoever believes in chimpanzee). It's rare to see a movie with heroic scenes such as clich√© dialogue or food fight, but not in the heart of the problem. The issue is that writers are eager to care for the "romantic" composed of an adult mid-old man and a seemingly hopeless lady. Perhaps the European audience could do more than that, but in 1982 or today, such a romanticism in the United States is evident and selfish - especially Pavarotti Harrold's spouse, and that "it's just fun". Wow, talk about romantic dialogue! Unfortunately, if they just changed their scripts, and Pavarotti is a widow or a couple of classic Hollywood movies, such as ALL BU and HEAVEN, TOO or SUSPECT, it's so bad and hard not to have a husband or a job the one who killed him can be forgiven). <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> Pavarotti's music can save this movie could not. Towards the end of the film, there are some nice scenes in New York, where the band is incredible and that Pavarotti is in love. Therefore, the film is worth at least 3. Now I would like to love the movie more, but it's a really bad movie - not as ugly as you hear. Unfortunately, as Pavarotti's parallels with this film after his own life, this movie I have read may be an imitation of life, although this is not a forum for a detailed discussion.
