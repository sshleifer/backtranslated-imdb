If it were able to adapt to this unpleasant German-television adaptation of the classic game, weird Will would have played a role in his tomb. Yes, very little money was spent. A stage enhancer, a cat and a set of randomly positioned columns passes like a set. The film, English voice actors sometimes dubbed their own lines, dubbed English in English. All the production was incredibly dark and terrible. And just fled in the movie Fonterbras? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Do you want to be or not? I wish that this movie never happened.
