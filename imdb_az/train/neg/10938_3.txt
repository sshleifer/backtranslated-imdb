I'm going to do so, but I'm still frustrated. It was the production I had at least my favorite Halestorm. I thought it was a comedy, but snickered only with 3 or 4 jokes. Is there a really funny mix of a fat guy that is eating bread and suddenly falling apart? What happened to the watchman on the Paradise scene? Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but this has not worked. They need to spend the whole budget to look like this because they do not have "light" actors' lighting budgets. Apparently, a video camera was shot and most scenes were too dark. Is it really enough to shoot a basket and fix the ball instead of really showing someone to hit the basket? I try not to criticize low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.
