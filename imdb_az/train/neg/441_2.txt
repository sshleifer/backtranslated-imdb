We do not have this on our UK television, but I've traveled over the Internet on YouTube. It's dumb, immature and boring! This is one of the creators of Earthworm Jim Douglas TenNapel, I have never been into this cartoon, but I have to admit it better. Cartoonist has done nothing for many years. For Doug TenNapel, it's a return travesty and down all the time! The story is made up of a cousin of a deceased woman's lady and three cats who earn a lot of money. They are controversial and do not agree with what they want to spend. "BORING"! The animation is scary. The main characters are cats, right? But they do not see anything like cats! Only strangely monster-looking creatures with great mouths, teeth and bulging eyes! Human and other animal characters are also ugly! The theme song is terrifying and irritating! The stories are also barefoot and are often transmitted from old shows. This show surprised me that IMDb received 7.5 / 10 of other viewers. Television is not really used to be! But now most of them are calm, cheap and boring. I may sometimes agree with me on my Web site, but I'm sorry, but I'm happy that this is a complete loss of money and the full and complete disappearance of the time, and I'm happy that England is not very welcome (yes, if you have digital figures), but I do not care! Lost! 2/10 (and I'm very fortunate to get the other shows because of the worst!).
