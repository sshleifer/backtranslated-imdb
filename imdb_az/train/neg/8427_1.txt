Let's start by telling how much I love the TV series. Despite the disastrous nature that an average-aged man could not fulfill his wishes for his unhappy, manipulative father, he was incredibly light and entertaining to watch in practice. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest English sites of all time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie is a real tragedy in every sense of the word spin-off. None of the essence of the TV show is successfully filmed. This movie has a very scary, surprising tone that attacks me several times. My comedy is not an idea of ​​seeing Harold beating a pub (not a funny one), but the admirer of a television series is a reason not to love this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Apart from where Albert immersed in the sink and was seen by his neighbor, the film was very cruel. <br /> <br /> Harold and Zita's romance was totally out of the tone, and this movie was no worries about watching the television series. In the television series, Harold is not always cold after dear girls. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to his words by Harold's girlfriends were totally unusual in the television series. In the film Albert says almost nothing after such an opportunity. <br /> <br /> The majority of British sitcom films were spin-offs on BUSES films (except the fact that it was actually better than a television series!). However, STEPTOE and SON should be ranked at the bottom of the cell, even under GEORGE and MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip it and watch the second spin-off, STEPTOE and LAST RIDE instead. It has a very light tone, is more loyal to the TV series and is actually very laughable.
