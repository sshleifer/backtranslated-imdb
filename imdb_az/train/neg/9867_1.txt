We saw a longing before last year's award season, but they did not know why they gave up after the voting, but no matter what, at least for the exposure, but the film was a mixed blend. Of course, some parts were funny in a strange humor, but none of the characters seemed to me to be real. There was no one I could contact with, and it was a place for me to fail. Of course, the plot is somewhat fascinating, and Scientology is very destructive against WOW! What a great idea ... Let's see that it has not been dug up anymore. All the tests, lighting, casting, scenarios, horrific visual effects (deliberate, almost everyone can be, no one laughs at you) is fake. Anyway, at least on DVD, I hope, I do not want many people to make a clear effort. But there are both ways. So be squeezed.
