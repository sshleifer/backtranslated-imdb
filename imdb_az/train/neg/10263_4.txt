Yes, the "South Star" is an extremely unforgettable hood that was sounded by Matt Monro, the master of this heavy set. In a search of a great diamond, it is a lot of sounds for the exaggerated and extremely boring feature, surprisingly worsening with the adventurous couple Jorge Segal and Ursula Andress. Harry Andrews (with a strange emphasis, at least a bit of an emphasis), with a weak drawn and loud photography by Raul Coutard, ends with an ostrich, a single wild image, and a tear that is not completely squashed from the Senegal's knights.
