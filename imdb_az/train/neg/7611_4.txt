From 1 to 2/28/2006 - From 10 to 4 (Dir-Sidney Pollack): - I watched the DVD version in "3 Days Condor" - So the CIA drama, the movie. The premiere of the story 7 of the 8 members of the CIA research team were killed in the character of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, becoming an abandoned one. Who killed them, and why? Redford is also trying to find the 8th victim. By the way, because Faye Dunaway's character is primarily in need of a place to hide, he helps him after a little lovey-dovey time. It is one of the few innocent people, but it does not have much tension. Straight displays do not help, and finishing does not make enough room for the audience. Despite being a good filmmaker from Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers, what should be the stories and performances, and therefore the film does not.
