I like this movie very much. A beautiful prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, an effort by John Saxson, who touches on the exact opposite of the 80s and plays an incorrect game. It reminded me of some (beloved) Italian horrors. But the direction is very tree and there is no nightmare / dreadful moment. It just goes on and after and after (logical) should end. More fertile and more courageous visions and flaws such as cultural classics would be sealed.
