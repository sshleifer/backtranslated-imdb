Hmm, IMDb rating 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... Okay, my two friends and I have ordered pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or something funny, like Versus. But Naked Blood sucked. It's a waste of time. Okay, the scene with the woman who is eating is pretty good. But that's it. There is nothing, nothing. I do not want to burn the field, other people have already started, I just wanted to stop the nudity. But wait for yourself. Maybe we can push when we lose the rating. Another thing that comes to my mind is worse than the Soundtrack Carpenter - ok, John cool ... :) 2/10
