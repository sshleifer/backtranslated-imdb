Is this a stupid movie? You bet! I could not find a creepy or scary moment in this movie. Stupid moments? Many. Stupid heroes? Your bet. Bad Impacts? Everywhere! Rick Baker went on and made things bigger and better, which is not one of them. Good people should start together. Dr. Ted Nelson was chewed. He is the most physician I've ever seen. She is a mute man working somewhere outside of Ventura County, she is not happy that her husband is pregnant (although weighs 55 and 90 lbs) and has no crackers found anywhere. There is already a very helpful general in the hands of astronaut Steve who wants to find. The local sheriff wants to know what happened though Nelson can not tell her anything. There are some random characters thrown at a good event facing the early man. Finally, the movie ends and the monster is thrown into the trash to be a garden. Finally, what you need for a great MST episode.
