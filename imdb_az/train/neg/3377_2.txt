Broadway music, "One Chorus Line", is the best music in the theater. About the experiences of people who dance; their joy and their sacrifices. Each dancer is selected for parts of a Broadway chor line, but each of them comes with stories of reasons for finding a dance as a respite of their lives. <br /> <br /> Although the film version is unlikely to attract any passion or beauty of the show, and undoubtedly, Broadway music is the worst movie adaptation ever to lose it because it is lifeless and dance-free, no matter what . <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was taken to Sir Richard Attenboro, whose lead was only offered for Gandhi right touch and pacing. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the next problem? A choir line goes to the stage without a true set of costumes and limited costumes. It's the most delicate part of Broadway's musical compositions, and its simplicity was its glory. But this is not a good translation, and nobody really thinks about it. For this reason, the film should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and leave the theater and the selection process. The singers can sing their songs in other environments and even voted for their first ballet, jazz or task class. Heck, they could dance on Broadway's lively imaginations. <br /> <br /> Considering that Attenborough did not completely ignore dances and that the show appeared to be indifferent, there was no idea of ​​the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> Dancers are obviously concerned about many scenes, as they say, their desire to hear the story of Michael Douglas. Douglas's character is dependent upon a sympathetic ear extension and whom he does not have the patience to choose. <br /> <br /> Although filmmakers claimed to be genuine in the nature of the game, some have undergone extreme changes. The number of the scenes that brought the rebels back to their teens - "Salam twelve, hello thirteen, my darling darling" - an Oscar replaced by a very nice "Surprise". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> "Surprise" will just do the Broadway show when it is filmed. If you want to see a movie version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob's Fosse's brilliant "All That Jazz". Although Fosse's daughter is on the "chorus line", she is Fosse, who must be a director. He knew what to do with this material, which was more deserving than this sad effort.
