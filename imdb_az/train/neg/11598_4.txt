When you look at another bad Nightmare album, like Freddy's Revenge, give it a try to get at least something new. Though Dream Child is more efficient, it offers a completely new series. Yes, there are creative deaths as part of a comic book as a child and facing "Super Freddy", but such scenes are not used for their full potential and they just miss the pieces without Freddy. <br /> <br /> This has officially denied the cowardice. Freddy now looks like a comedy ... but why? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
