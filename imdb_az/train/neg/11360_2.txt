Okay, so it's a good idea to film 3D IMAX on some flies sitting on a distance and on the moon, several years ago, on Apollo 11. So they did. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I will give artists the homework assignment on the hardware. As I said, missiles and launchers were blowing. The graphics were generally pretty good - the launch of the rocket gave me a deep shock, and as always, a good rocket release (my Mechanical mechanic was flying the car's gear is still strong) and 3D was pretty effective. CG Pixar is not quality, but generally good. The flies were medieval anthropomorphism, some of which were about 60 colored hippies, African-American flies with giant aphrodites and black shades, etc. The missing half-dead characters and pumpkins were human baby heads. Scenario writers , attack and obsolete clich√©s (the most unusual women's characters in the 1960s, the racist stereotypes, the bad Russians, the obsession with sexism, etc.), class-two-level global humor. In a film directed to the IMAX, they created a great opportunity to hide in some educational content on physics and space travel - they did not gain the right to physics (zero in the Moonlight during landing) Even worrying to read original radio transcripts between Houston and astronauts are all in the public; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Uh, summer. 1.5 / 5.
