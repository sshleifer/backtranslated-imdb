"Gentleman's Game" uses a golf game in a country club to show a young man's discovery about honesty, bias and other lifestyle lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was, but to prove it was wrong. Unfortunately, I did not know what the film makers knew. In this movie, Gary Sinise is probably a scene that forces the "The Karate Kid" to emerge from any concept that will go to become a mentor for the adolescent golfer. This movie refuses to follow the majority of simple and very handy movie formulas. However, many are still attractive. When people fall into the hat, people are depriving or denying all the civilian actions, or they are exposed to something less honorable than in the community. Unfortunately, these are not common occasions. And, as long as the club serves as a background for them, there is no real sustainability or relationship to them. The writer and the director are a shame that a movie can not get better, especially with some talented actors in the organization and its potential.
