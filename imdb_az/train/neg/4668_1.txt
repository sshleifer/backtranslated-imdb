The potential movie set up in the 19th century did not produce extravaganza. Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many other great actors did not have any reason for the movie to fail. However, the film was an unforgivable excuse for a plot line and was broken by its sustainability. A typical story that has come together with the love of a rich girl and a poor boy and has been destroyed by the beauty (or lack of it) and the inadequacies, the early death of the mother and the touch of a father's father. Finney's father is a man who lives in her daughter's life and death. Believing that her daughter does not have a good appearance, breaks her fate by marrying under her social status. The actors tried to save the rest of the scene. The Washington Square is a black pit that destroys and destroys the precious time of sad people. I give this movie only 0 instead of one for the actors' attempts. Get rid of yourself, stay clear of Washington Square.
