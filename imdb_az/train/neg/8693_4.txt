I'm in Dallas / Fort Worth and have lived in Arlington for several years. The film went away as it looked like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background! There are no mountains in Texas. A movie in Texas should be filmed in Canada. The accent is really bad. Texas players have to win the pieces. There are many actors in Hollywood who want more than Texas. The film is really sad, but it's a true story. I said that the murderer was found guilty. One good thing is his death bc, now we have Amber Alert to find missing children after we've stolen.
