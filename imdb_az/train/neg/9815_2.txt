In fact, this film began to give a unique idea, but later it became a big disappointment. If the rest of the film is too small to avoid clich√©s, what is the original start? The film itself is incredible. I would like to know how someone would go into the clinic, get a nurse outfit, kill a doctor, put a patient in his bed, put it on the Chevy pickup and leaves? I guess that no one would answer this question, so they jumped into other areas where these little details were hidden. The performances are simply dirty. This villain is just a "boring crazy antagonist", with no depth, absolutely linear. After a 20-minute movie the most scenes were incredible, they seemed to be just there for just 90 minutes as they were totally unnecessary. A physician sees a woman with a strong drug, refuses to investigate, is dismissed from the house, and is just calm? The last scene has blown me into the laughter, but Mickey Mouse can just make it real. It's the first 10-minute movie I'm bringing from 10 to 10.
