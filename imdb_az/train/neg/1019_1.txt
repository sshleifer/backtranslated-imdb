Before watching this movie, I heard many honest people say that this movie is a shame. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey did not believe that they played a role in this movie, and I watched it myself. Evidently, they were right. <br /> <br /> Film shooting, film, movie, movie, movie, movie, film, Business. But Morgan and Kevin? I can not stop asking myself for the reasons why they agreed to participate in Edison. Their role in being honest is quite stupid. <br /> <br /> You can think of good players when you suck, then you have to pay more attention to me. It is really the foundation of a movie, but the kids ... trust them ... It's not a movie you want to give credit for this story. Imagine that the smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learn how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this has been supported by an agent of justice (LL Cool J) and brilliant researcher Kevin Spacey. Finally, they beat a story with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Jeez could not even go on with that. I only remember that the film is already sick. Recommended guys, do not follow it! Please save money and time for another movie.
