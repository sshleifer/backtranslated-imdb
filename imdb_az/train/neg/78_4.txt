The jerky mouse and lullaby really existed for me and really did not have anything to do with the story ... This is what I will do in the first year of the movie school. Very sad. In addition, the story seemed to be drifting without any apparent reason ... There were many things that had nothing to do with the story yet, so I felt that the creative team did not know what it was, or it should have been shorter ... it would be a blessing, not a blessing. As I watched all episodes to this point in the last week ... I have to say that it is in the worst case and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
