Here's a European story that can tolerate another blasphemy, the burning of their country's religions. (These atheist directors are merciless.) Here we see a disastrous explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clerics (and I am also a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This won the Oscars for five foreign films in fact. Probably because the story looks very weak in Catholics and generally religious beliefs. One of the main symbols is priesthood and more about eating. He is nothing but a fool. <br /> <br /> The Academy, which has authority in the world, did not seem to be surprised by its love for this movie. <br /> <br /> Also, there is some legendary fool who plays a boy who is religious, so he can marry one of the four daughters who are familiar with the story. The girls are deceiving the "seminary" pupil (who says they have been studying for six years, but it is agnostic). I want to say that this movie is a blasphemy! <br /> <br /> This is a secular-progressive story of movie business around the world (not Hollywood).
