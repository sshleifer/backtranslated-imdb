It was a terrible film. Mostly Jane Mart was a North Korean spy of a half-Korean sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible in American forces in South Korea. She is an American soldier of a military family, though they are more white, all of them consider him as a Korean (1/4 or 1/8 of South America, not all Koreans) and the teenage boy begins to hate home, and he begins to sleep with him. It's completely crazy, as depicted in Korea and the US military in Korea. The screenwriter and director did not spend a day in Korea before filming and did not intend to give any real insight into the life of Koreans or Americans in Korea, regardless of how completely unbelievable the movie actually was, their sad Asiaphile fantasies. Everyone who comes to Korea will know that it is completely trash. In the end, the North Korean princess spy is killed by paying for her sins. Very poor film made for television feels it.
