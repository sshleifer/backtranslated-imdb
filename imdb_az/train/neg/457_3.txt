Of course, I love cartoons, but I do not like it. Of course, children loved it. But still, I'm not a kid again (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> There is no story that I will not say anything about the story. How can this candidate for an animated film be Oscar? Well ... I think we are happier than the people of the 30s. Everything on the ground should be fast. So far, watch movies and come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to slow down. This is really shameful. I wish I was 30 years old because it's a very peaceful look. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
