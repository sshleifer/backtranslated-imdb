I have seen this movie a long time ago and I do not want to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, always invisible to his eyes, family and always cash shorts. All this changes when a bank robber crosses Preston's bike and goes through a retirement trial. Preston uses a check to pull $ 1 million from the bank (belonging to a bankrupt bank robber, a mockery of money). Preston then purchases a home and says he is a mysterious and wealthy assistant assistant named Mr. Macintosh (on behalf of the computer). From then on, he fills with money. <br /> <br /> It comes as a nice idea in paper. But it's one of the hottest movies I've seen on the screen. Very incredible for something. I know that some part of the movie was incredible, but I was on a thirty-year-old woman of a twelve-year-old boy who was responsible for the small wealth of an imaginary man. In addition, it was a shallow film with a weak line of action, a remarkable line of lines and memorable little characters. Heroes or cheeses are top, teeth, or less developed. However, "Juice" was a comic character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, go through it.
