The film appealed to me for the new type of Pokemon Chalabi. But it was outside of this area and did not look like other films. Money and time lost. Kill the same sad humor and bad guys. The film that you want to make in the movie Pokemon is no good. The film should not be more relevant to the animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawings and settings did not rise to any level of original anime standards. It's a shame to talk about this movie. I bet that Pokemon fans will be disappointed by the film's outcome and will abandon Pokemon. Digimon is more than an anime and does not fall close to Pokemon. The second film comes in late 2002.
