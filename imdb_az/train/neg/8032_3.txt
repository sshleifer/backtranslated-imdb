It was a huge cast with big names like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henri Hull and Brian Donlevey and a smaller but lesser-known band of shorter roles. It was Technicolor from several films made with him in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now bad news ....... unfortunately I can not say very positive for the story. James described the boys in a very positive light .... Hollywood has done so since. Why are these criminals always "good guys" beyond me? This film glamor them and turned their enemies - the railroad people into bad people. The last was exaggerated, and that was terrible. Well, this is a movie world for you: bad is good; Well, it's good. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: There's a story here - James boys were criminals! Indeed - watch it up!
