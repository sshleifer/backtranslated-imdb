If you see friends, the post will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of your friend often share the same comedy organizations. <br /> <br /> The show is a merging group that has been divided into the same class when it's very young (about 10 years old I think). Now, they are in the twentieth year and again are faced with a class unification. This is where the series will begin. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with many story lines simultaneously. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is divided into more than one section and then displayed in a mixed way. <br /> <br /> Sketches are my series of issues. As in the next season of your friends, it is very difficult to believe in situations often. One of the main faces is that it's really stupid to do something hard to believe. The situation is then exaggerated, and it's probably not smart enough. If you are in this kind of humor, you probably love this series. <br /> <br /> The reason that started watching my friends is a few seasons. There are interesting and especially convincing stories, which root out romance for symbols. There is no one in the classroom. These characters are simply too compelling and stereotypes are far away. Therefore, it is not possible to establish contact with them. <br /> <br /> At least a few seasons with friends did not escape from steam and all the signs of the healing were healed. But in the class, even before the steam went out.
