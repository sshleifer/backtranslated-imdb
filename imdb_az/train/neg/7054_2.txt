This film was completely miserable. The absence of a painful scenario and no story left me bumps to watch three losers for babes. In some cases, I felt that I watched the Beavis and Butthead episodes. He could not even sit in the whole movie. Emran Hashmi declares, and Hrshitta Bhatt does not have any influence. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only part of the film is associated with Anu Malik and the shameless deed. It was pretty cheerful. "What's Sini" and its remix version were really good. You can always lock Emran lip and sync a lighthouse lip. All this seems to have no good script for Emran to support Bhatts this time.
