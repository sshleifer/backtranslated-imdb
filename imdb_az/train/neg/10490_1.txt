I feel it's a very good review of the previous reviewer (still in school), and we can only take it into consideration that the reviewer has not seen the adaptation of this classic novel since the BBC since 1989. In this (1999) version, my biggest problem was that Anthony Way remained as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy after appearing in the mini-series "The Choir". I just feel that Tom Cho's "Chorus" has played a great deal of strength. Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in The Choir, filmed Tom's Midnight Garden, and turned it into a long and ugly teenager, just as Anthony did not agree with Tom's schoolgirl Tom. Tom (playing Anthony) is a far cry from the idea that you will be friends with a very young line. In the 1989 BBC version, Tom and Hatti are closer to age and their friendship is much more convincing. Even the special effects for the 1999 film have failed to reach agreement with the 1989 television effect and are of no consequence. The cast and motion of this version was far lower than before, and the whole film was actually a glimpse of classic work. As a recent observation, I would point out that the BBC version of the 1989 BBC came from the £ 20.00 second, a new DVD of this version can be taken at £ 5.00, do you need to say more?
