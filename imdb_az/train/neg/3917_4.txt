The "home of the souls" is pretty bad. While I live in South America, I am living in a dictatorial country while trying to portray it as a movie, and although everyone is afraid of the truth, this film accepts the audience as both an ignorant and a fool. As you can see, there are things that are simple and straightforward and, of course, the political process is even more complicated, and it is interesting that "at home" ... If you can not show that complexity on the screen is not good to shoot any movie. What are some examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the film industry? In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda appeared in parrots and palm trees. When talking about some things, you should be careful and respect the public's intelligence.
