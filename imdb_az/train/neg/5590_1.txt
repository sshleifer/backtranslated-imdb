Terrible film. About an old little artist standing around with an old girl. Do not bump. Tatum O Neil acts in his own part and has the most terrible lines in film history. Richard Burton appears dead in this film and we should believe that he looks good for the Sixth. As you can imagine, the player is bad. As in this story, the characters are terrifying. It's really hard to feel everyone in this movie, except for Larry Ewashen, a boy playing in a porn theater on Tatum, he's funny. This movie really spends time. If you are a fan of Tatum like me - this is why I first rented it - do not see this movie. It's really bad, and maybe you will be surprised if PAPER MOON is a flutter. Although it was known that BAD NEWS and EVERYBODY could do good, he still did not rent this movie. If you are an admirer of Burton, rent something when it is well-visible and not a fossil.
