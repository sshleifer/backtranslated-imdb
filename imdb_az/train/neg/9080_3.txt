Yes, I just ordered this job at my home because I was very bored and asked for laughter. I have to admit that I did giggle a few times, but I do not remember the parts. I do not understand why this film is being prepared. He claims to be a comedy, but I can not find a very feminine, strange penis or a bare 70-year-old woman very funny. This film tried to fit into the "gross-out" comedy like American Pie and Road Trip recently, but this was just a failure. It was a great way, then it was a comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz add his name here?!?! It was something I like about this movie when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I've done sexually, pleasantly and well. Also, avoid this movie. 3/10
