This film is the first class of Stephanie Beaton and the new production company. <br /> <br /> Being troubled by a number of problems, because of the low budget production, this is a good beginning of Beaton and its company. <br /> <br /> The story is The Burning and every Friday is the 13th day of the second part. However, speeches are sincere. <br /> <br /> It is not a murder (or return) of a spouse. Others drink sweets, but the trauma of the incident is sent to different destinations in the life of every human being. Ten years later, friends kill each other by a terrible stalker known as The Bagman. Who will live? <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or any arrogant critic, you probably do not worry. But if your taste is more likely to go to Joe Bob Briggs and if you want to know a group of people's art, see The Bagman.
