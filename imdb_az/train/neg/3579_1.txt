After a couple of years ago, this movie was rented and immediately watched by a friend and I decided to make a movie in absolute zero. There was nothing about the movie that could be worse than this movie. To date, we have evaluated how good the movies are, and even the worst, of the "The Lonely Lady." <br /> <br /> I talked to Eleanor Perry a long time ago and wrote scenarios along with the "Last Summer" and "Mad House House Agenda", he wanted to write a screenplay of Harold Robbins' "The Lonely Lady." He was denied because he had been treated and did not realize that he had not understood the troubles of the female screenwriter in Hollywood. He said, "I think someone else is writing." The interview was taken before the movie. He died in 1981, and when I came to heaven, I doubt that the first thing she did was that she personally did not compassionate God.
