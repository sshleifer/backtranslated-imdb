.... Because if I had not been crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to figure out the essence of this movie, and I had a trick to start with "generous." As noted earlier, Richard Dreyfuss is a mistake on the cover of the DVD that really is a star. She was forced to film. And if he really said it was YES because he was in a disaster for a film, and if he did not get out of it, perhaps the back cover would be "hysterical"! The film really focused on Jared Marty, and what was his role in the film, apart from those who were too close, whether or not Gene Barry's role was really great - or not. Speaking of "great" ... Whose Bride has a good idea to fit Gene Barry into a Humpty Dumpty suit? She should be punished for a long time by watching her movie as if she had pulled her trousers down to her chin. This is a plot missing from a dialogue that is incompatible with the actors' clutch cargo (from the stage to being generous to calling on the picture frames), but by mistake, jumping from the scene to a scene .... However, in the early 70's and if you're a cottage in Michigan with something else in this movie and a baby and a cats box, I suggest you have a good bottle of wine before starting this strange slide of a movie because the next day you do not remember it.
