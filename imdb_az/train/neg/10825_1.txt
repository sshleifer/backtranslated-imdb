She hoped that this movie would be so appealing that she would live up to the brilliance of Charlotte Bronte's original classic story. It was a deep disappointment to find out whether this film had the features that made the original novel so powerful that it appeared to be written or drawn to a great deal of haste. Among the main heroes, most of those witty and attractive among Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester were left in the missing or trimmable scenario. Jane Eyrein did not lose his sense of charisma, and suffered from all her confusion and triumph. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this film is not too awkward to run Jane Thornfield and Mr. Rochester, to include one of the biggest parts of the story. The struggle for nutrition and shelter, begging for bread, the danger of embarrassing cold, and the danger of moving away from a loved one, in my opinion, simply came out of this movie. The character of the hood looked dry and thirsty. I do not think that this story would be of the least interest to those who did not like the story and did not read the book. The Scenario and Director did little to make any credit for the classic story.
