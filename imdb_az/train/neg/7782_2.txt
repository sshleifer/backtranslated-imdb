Monster is a numbingly horrific film about a bad American concrete factory (in Hollywood?), Which pollutes Colima, the city of Chimayo, the small city of Colombia, by directing lambs and females as a predominant fishermen. James Mitchum is Bill Travis, the man who was sent by his sad head Barnes, will not be able to grasp his secretary's post behind the wisdom. Chimayo Bill, as you can see, must fight with an angry reporter who is fully publishing all his English-language stories. Perhaps in the 1970s, there was a market for news from smaller cities in South America. There is a radical called Sanchez, which wants to sabotage the plant to pollute the water, which works for the local population, but why is it a toxic-rich ecological marxism of cold-blooded economies? Pete, the boss, in the factory, is known by the monster without knowing when he is in his old girlfriend, she sees the mayor's daughter, Juanita, telling them that they are there, and then eating it immediately. Moving slightly to the side without evidence. Shapkam is for you. John Carradine is a monk who believes that the beast was sent by God to punish sinners. You can see her hate for her in front of her. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <div style = "color: red;"> it is terrible in all fronts. The filming began in 1971, and eight years later, Kenneth Hartford put two bereaved children as a new hero and put Andrea in the best bill with Andrea Mitchum and Carradine after putting her foot on Monterey's throat. No sound quality is available, and most scenes appear to have faded out of the camera before shooting. During the night many scenes are made more elegant. The beast itself is laughable, because the ugly rubber head ends anticlimactic. James Mitchum, along with his brother Kris, proves the need for limiting the nepotism in the actor industry. Rinse not completely washed. I betray you John Carradine.
