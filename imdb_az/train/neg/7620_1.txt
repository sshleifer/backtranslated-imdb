I rented this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but this was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read a comment from Gumby-8 and it should be part of a castle or crew. <br /> <br /> Gumby-8 In the right mentality of a 4-year-old boy or a strange family, no-one thought that this movie had no potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments of Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Because the animation opening is initially inspired by the "Sea" ... this movie looks and works well and the recurring look is unexpected. "<br /> <br /> The only aspect of the film, it's a fact that you are looking for any kind of exploits, and I do not mean that Halloween was shot with a budget of 100,000.00 dollars and it should come together with a painted mask and at the same time a cult classic. <br /> <br /> There is another proposal from Gumby-8: "The game also has a powerful feature." Respecting actresses, their activities are nothing but the talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> Catchy Tagline: "Avoid hours between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> This film has no darkness or darkness <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MPAA rating "<br /> <br /> Only you see some red paint on a layer on a dead dead body. <br /> <br /> At the end of the conversation I have seen the horrors of the 50, 60 and 70s. I thought it was completely bad and somebody was very good. The director of this movie either did not try, fell asleep, or threw a pickle. I think the actors deserve praise because they are trying to get a very weak job. This movie is for "B" 5.
