This film does not succeed at all levels. I have an idea that everyone who is involved in this film should send them to the warmer zone in the Middle East. If we were to be happy, all of us would be shot and killed, and we never waste their time. Have not I ever said so much since my cinematic story all my life? God, I can not think of everything I see as bad. In a better way than sitting within 10 minutes of this excuse for a movie, I'm going to watch 25 times. If I were to meet anyone involved in this film, I would be spit on their faces and then beat them down. This is my two cents.
