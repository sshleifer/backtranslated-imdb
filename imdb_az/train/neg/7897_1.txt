This film was made for Gremlins who were very heavy and for Critters who found Hardcore. This movie is as bad as about 80 critters / trolls / gremlins. A sad part is that there is no punchline for this comment. <br /> <br /> This miniature monster movie problem really tricks and Howie Mandell is a problem that ends up being as successful as A Walk Like. Man. Turning the other 80's horror movies into classics was really trying to be intimidated, but it was stunning because they were not very surprising. Someone told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a skill to play before filming. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> When you leave Lost Boys, you see a strange little mutation across a brown coat and a swinging puppy thrown into the ball, but it's not enough to save. <br /> <br /> The most unexpected part of the film is Paul's character. Its Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to start moving rapidly from the scene stage, until the end of a one-time stop to see a scene that throws a cannon boy throwing balls in the cannon ... it does not do that. <br /> <br /> So, the lower line is running, thank you for not going to the nearest Blockbuster and shaking hands with the manager and collecting garbage on the shelves for grapes.
