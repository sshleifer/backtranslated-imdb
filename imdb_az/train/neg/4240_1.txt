As we all know, Hollywood changes the surrounding historical events for our taste and is one of the hollywooded films for 44 minutes. For example, bank robbers have never begun to shoot at LAPD, but have seen that they are back twice in the film. Another example is the number of LAPD officers shot at the end of the film, far from the truth! Of course, Hollywood should be well-bloody, and they should add more blood and gut. Some events were combined and many leading actors played a few different people, but Hollywood always complained about why? It's only a sad part that I have watched nearly one hour of documentary films in North Hollywood, which is better than TLC!
