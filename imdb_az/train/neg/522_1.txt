My wife wanted to leave in about 15 minutes. Not because of the material, but the lack of them. They decided to fill the gaps so that they should have many languages ​​and pretty vulgar talks as funny things. When we leave this (very rarely), we will come back and watch (laughing, unconscious) and wait for the next global or offensive word. About 35 minutes later, we both rose and went. He said how great everything we were reading. Trailer looked good, and Roger Ebert was actually "smart" and said that he did not have a hoo sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, this is the only movie I've ever been to ... and I have no regrets. I'm trying to go to comedies in America.
