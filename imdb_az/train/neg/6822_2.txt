Drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer pipe, children read. The most imaginative "world music" can be imagined. This is a tourist film and a bad man. The thing that really kills is consistent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. No crossings, there is no explanation for the reason that we are suddenly tens of thousands miles away, there is no thought in the pictures. As another reviewer, he said only a set of third-party outlines, the "basket on their heads." It was infinitely a deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make the 3rd World Music Video, Koya's best parts chose a few hundred miles south of the hit and filmed in Mexico. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it was a scrambled touristic route covering the half glob of what they had decided to do, and, as it turned out, was a great deal of surprise. <br /> <br /> This film is just one thing to recommend, so he can not ask for much as Nagaogatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
