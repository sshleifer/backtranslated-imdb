- The film opens in a lake with a meteor. Unaware of the locals, the dinosaur eggs are also under the lake. The Meteor Lake warms it into a giant incubator. <br /> <br /> You know, egg coatings cause release of dinosaurs. This stop movement is not about thinking about religion dinosaurs, but there's everything about the film that bothered me. The player's shamelessness. Dialogue is absolutely funny. Funny relief is funny. Logic is unavailable. In this film, any similarity between "scholars" and a true scholar is absolutely coincidental. I can continue the etiquette of this movie, but you get the idea. I call this disaster "MST3K Precious" quite safe.
