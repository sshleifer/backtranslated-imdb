A instead of "1" gave a "2" (terrible), because most visuals do not deny being embarrassed, and many talent enters special effects and art. <br /> <br /> Some of these films have been painted several times before, and the colorful "septia" consists of many things. There is nothing new there. I've seen a few hats lessons for other old, classic films. OK. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sad, the character was two-dimensional. Slow motion. It was nice to look at some of the scenes, but in the end it was pretty boring, and I could not recommend it.
