Over the years, I've directly seen these videos directly on Segal and each has a lot of fun; unfortanetley, where the level of entertainment is low. Of course, the movement schemes were fun, but it was pretty much. Seagal was really his head; <br /> <br /> Segel under Siege 2 and in the Executive Decision (at least in terms of action), but for the past ten years, Segal's films have not really met their past. <br /> <br /> The more positive the film, some segments of action, and the use of the mind has made good use of the time. When the film appeared to be just drifting, a pretty scene of action drove him out of the lane. Honestly, I believe that most of Segal's films would be better if they were not part of those who were familiar with the movie. Supporting actors and actresses is very important, and if their existing films have prominent actors and actresses, perhaps the film will get more popular results.
