argh! This movie hurts my head. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Keep the title and throw the rest. instead of a few half assesd use future gladiator stories, for example, all the things that threaten the soil's collapse (why there is a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about cameras?) <br /> <br /> All movie shouting eighties, from truley to dazzling ballroom shiny suits. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. Some people know that you love it, but some are afraid to peed and I do not understand them.
