<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> This movie, but 95 minutes of my life wasted. There is no tension - I'm actually clairvoyant, feeling weak, and thus having technical mistakes, so I do not believe it's a computer geek. They tried to make a confusion with the general war movie 24 hours a day. But this is not worth a low-budget television movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie, it's a full time loss. Instead, be original. The topic is still valid. Do not give too much power to a car. Players and players are very far away and compelled to do so.
