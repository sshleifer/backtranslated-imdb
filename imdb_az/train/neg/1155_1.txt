Never was a film directed to me to review, but it was just scared. As he tried to find out what this movie was, snoop chose the first serious role, but something open was a poor choice. She made a good book, but of course she did not work for me as a movie. It's incredible, it does not have the atmosphere and many of the scenes stilted.a can be a lot of music maestro, but a serious actor snoop ain't.the action is not enough to conduct a weak dialogue with a passive, but weak zone by Dylan McDermott and flowers. maybe I left the point that I totally missed, but it did not bring me any genre, did not bring any emotions to the characters and did not cause any tension, actually I was praying for myself and the desire to collide with each of the three main characters!
