The story of a photographer who was dreaming of killing models of a model in the 1980s television movie and television series (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, and others). Of course, models and other people are causing any kind of complications. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Interesting. This Cinemax cable channel is the best portrayal of the movie that Skinamax has given its name. Indeed, if there is no need to see every dark thriller, I do not see the point to watch it. (I have to comment that this movie is full of cigarettes, and I came to the point where everyone was laughing when it was light)
