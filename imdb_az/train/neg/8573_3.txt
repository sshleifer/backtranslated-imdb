I did not like Sean Penn's leadership, and this early job, Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no basis, with honesty honored the most part of Penn's work, the latter's work is even more pre-painted with some kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, and Sean Penn generally seem to produce some loyalty, mostly banal products, for honesty, but in most of them, wrestling matches, Hallmark cards have developed a hell of hell's greetings and made me a beautiful film, it took a long time. Viggo Mortensen's player is much more convincing here than this ridiculous Eastern Promises with Cronenberg. The film is a trivial dead and looks like a technician, a technique rather than a story. However, Charles Bronson proves that Kudos can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. For this, 10 is a bad 3 Indian Runner crap.
