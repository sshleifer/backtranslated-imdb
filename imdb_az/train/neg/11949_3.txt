This dumb comedy is really a good job of losing comedy talent. Particularly, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are used badly here. I could have been surprised one or two times in this movie, but in general, it's a bit of a dull movie that is a good thing to do. Stage, although regular, is still not bad, but after the plot has been set, the movie has gone anywhere. Do not waste your time with this arrogance.
