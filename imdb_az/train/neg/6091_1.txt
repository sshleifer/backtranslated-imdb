I bought this movie at a high level, with respect to the entertaining blood lake. I bought one of them. This movie is not at least scary or funny, it is not just about failing at every level, it's just a horrible movie and does not give the audience something to watch. What is bad about this is that he has said that he is far from being violent and cruel, and there is little violence. There is no blood loss, no excitement. Actor, direction and dialogue are completely unbearable. Honestly, she really laughs. Once I got tough of this common trash; Of course, I will never want to watch it again. Do not waste your time with cellulose consumption in such a way; this is perhaps the worst movie ever. If I could give negative stars, I would love to.
