I have not commented on IMDb from the beginning, but after watching the Batman animation, I felt it. Its definitely trash! Warner Brothers had a great animation series in Batman in the early 90's. So, are they trying to fight the hellish formula? I feel like writing a complaint to the WB. The original animation was dark and was meant to be a batman, exactly what was meant to be Batman. WB met with the Future of Batman. Now they drive this drive. The Joker DC resembles a Joker remotely from the comics. DC must file a lawsuit. I urge anyone who agrees with me to use the human power to send an e-mail or write to the DB and retrieve the original formula
