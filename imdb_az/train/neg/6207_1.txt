I'm going to say that this film is raining on the audience. The film is likely to be very exciting among critics in Cannes, but the final scene for me was a loyal attempt to distinguish itself from a new director. <br /> <br /> Violence, drug abuse or teenage conspiracy (or another issue) is not very difficult. <br /> <br /> If the attacker's metamorphosis of the main character is a good, but problematic boy, the scene of aggression (which is an aggression from the "clock mark orange" embodied) is unbearable and refuses to comment on its aesthetic values, there is no. There are some things that the artist should not try to achieve. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To finish it, you are shocked, brutal, rebellious and NOT YOUR TIME. Instead, see "One Hour Orange" or "Le Pianiste".
