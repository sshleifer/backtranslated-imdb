I'm a supporter of Miyazaki's job. I say "partly" because most of his films are divided into two categories: bright and boring. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the next category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same basic problems as Miyazaki's new movie, Howl's Moving Castle. <br /> <br /> The first three parts of the film reveal its post. <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;" appears as if it's a story story and really looks like a very interesting story. The middle part is mostly subtle covered eco-propaganda, and ultimately depends on the type of impenetrable spiritualism, which is damaged by many Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film feels as if everybody comes from the script before moving on animators. (although the look I had was a generation of bad color - Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when she flies with a general myth), but in a small sense and eventually confused me.
