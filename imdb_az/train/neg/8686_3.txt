<br /> <br /> As I read it, it is clear that Republicans are tolerant to this show. Democrats look like this when they are so faithful. <br /> <br /> Even the first reader is actually convinced that these events are believed to be in Bursun's classroom or may happen. <br /> <br /> But as I look at the content, the group that made this series really must be Bats's enemies. At the end, in the episode, s02e03 showed that the program had been shown before long before McCain was a front-pillar for nomination; <br /> <br /> Another thing that took my focus was to add to the toilets. <br /> <br /> I thought the series was sure to be in the United States in Europe. Because I know any of the US homes in the homes of the artisans who do not build in the closets. <br /> <br /> Looking at the show, yes, like it, she wants to make our writers do their best to embarrass our president. There are problems as many Americans agree, but there is no reason not to hate such public appearances in this world. Perhaps this tendency has been determined by this show and network, so whether Obama or Hillary were still creating the same "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just comment on comments from a commentator. If there were some changes in the election in 2000, he was convinced that he would be a completely different president. Wow, her thoughts in her part. As for 911 events, I think that Clinton was back in power when I was president, and I can not see how the Gore president will be different.
