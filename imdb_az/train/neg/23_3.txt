I leased it on DVD without prior knowledge. <br /> <br /> As I said, Mr. Sarin is very happy that he was suspected of appearing in a film appearing in the movie. <br /> <br /> As you can see, if your script and dialogue are frightening, even good actors can not save their day. I do not remember amateur players who will carry this movie. Many non-native-English-speaking speakers play a part of the native-English language, read misspelled lines, and miss out on a script that has not been turned into a movie. The finer detail of the film is incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> For the first time, this movie has been part of a few years. So I gave it 3 instead of 1 instead of worth it.
