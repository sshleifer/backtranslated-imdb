Great hair, big breasts, bad music and a huge security pin ....... This is the best describing this horrible movie. I love some of my favorite american films and have seen hundreds ... But that was not the worst sinner. The field paper is gentle and ridiculous, it's moving, the scenario is completely laughable (with the best policeman and how the murderer works), dresses are complicated and funny, hair is big, horses have a lot of leaps, T-shirts (men are really wearing them) and the music is just synthesizer trash and again ... almost every stage has bare music, taking pigeons and paramedics ... and the gym is not near to dignity! It's a really bad movie, despite all that, leaving only a good old gossip about looking at the disaster in the 80's and how bad everything is.
