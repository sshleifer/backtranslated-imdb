I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculous, it was bad, but I'm not really disappointed. Why do not you believe anyone can shoot such a movie? Marginal was fun, but I feel like people have a lot of disagreements about what they do. Monday, became a writer; Tuesday, director; On Wednesday, the coffee maker; <br /> <br /> Someone was saying someone else was really good at the actor, but I also would like it. to agree. Later, if actors can keep a straight line during the shooting, they may be better players than lending them. <br /> <br /> The DVD movie is a mystery along the line of History and Order or National Treasure. It starts like this, but then it takes a turn to a bad episode of the Twilight Zone or nowhere ... Something else that shows that nothing is good ... A bad episode of Foreign Borders <br /> My main complaint is just that. There's a bad guy with white hair. When it first appears, the wind is really interested in the love that comes from the hair. Seriously. Once you understand that you have a Christian movie, it's easy to find the place for the latter. <br /> <br /> Kinematography, especially in the opening scenes, is weak to put forward your best foot. The film was not grieved for the majority, but in a dark room a ridiculously bad shot took place, while praying in a dark room - it was just a little embarrassed to watch the movie.
