There are many stupid moments in the film "Death tower" / "Death match 2", which is really a shame. <br /> <br /> It should be honest that this movie is related to the Death Game. If anything, this is the continuation of many elements of the film - 'Enter Dragon' which combines the actual images. Bruce Lee's character, Billy Lo (in appearance) is facing a sudden death of his friend and a man with his daughter's daughter. <br /> <br /> Tong long stars are regarded as brother Bobby Lo and really does not. The film will be charismatic. His fighting skills are very good. Bruce Lee is simply transforming into images that have been erased to justify inheritance. Changes are really so much fun (I say boldly mentally) and at least the film being watched weigh. But there are many elements in this movie that really test your patience. First, is there something that is living in its palace or a mentally housed? Hell, eating nourishing bread, wearing drinks, carrying a monkey on its shoulders, and having some peacocks and lions (!!). <br /> <br /> In fact, this mid-section is terrible and when the scene takes place, wait for someone to bring her to her room. I came to a naked brothel and a lion costume, and I quit it. But I finished the movie and saw that I was glad because it was the reason for watching the end of the battlefield (like 'GOD'). Although the story is a shame, the move contains very good and excellent choreography. They told us that the Tower of Death was head down and underground pagoda. Bruce Lee's original idea, as a twist with different styles of battle at each level, has sounded so great. Is this a planned 'Death Game' at the start? No! The film was called "Death Opportunity" because it was going to the tower. Yes, there were really one or two "different" styles ... there were foil-coated bullets, leopard lungs, and stupid monks. <br /> <br /> <strong> Enter as I did not get into Afghani, or poorly imitated. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing once for fast-paced battle scenes, but sometimes it's ridiculous. If so, it is good. Along with this, pull the "Projector Room" to re-create the scene from Dragon.
