This movie is like a real life. I almost do not have an existing 2 hours or more, and many game plans or areas are often confirmed by invisible castings (their invisibility is due to "experimental" lighting). provided by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A great hole. Altman is not a big surprise to this work - he is a very variable player (yes, we all love Gosford Park, but everyone is "Pret A Porter" Kansas City, Dr. T. and Aaargh Women). The story is John Grisham's story and you will gather for a long dream. This is really a bad masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
