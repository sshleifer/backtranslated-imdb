If my adult movies were shot, they would probably have made a better figure than that ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are all right. Especially in the areas where the mother is a beautiful actress and the child should be afraid to prove that it is a wonderful thing. But the director knows the meaning of Plot Point, Triller, and Good Script. The scenario is not something that has no development environment. If you follow the trees, you can probably love it, otherwise staying at home and sleeping. oh ... actually there was something funny: the film was in 2001, but the appearance was so bad (like mini-dv) and we could not do this because the car was so old (like 70 and 80).
