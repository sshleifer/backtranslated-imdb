Okay, when you read the title you thought it would be a good movie. Yes, at least I did. It started well, but after half an hour it was so boring. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> Give a story about such a desperate mother to be a crazy person who will go any length to get her desires. The only problem is that her daughter is a girlfriend on the road. He is always winning competitions, so he pushes the mother to "eliminate" her further. After talking to a "stroke", the mother decides that the girl needs to be beaten up a bit. Thus, measures are being taken, but it eventually begins to deteriorate. <br /> <br /> The mill is terrible and the film is dragged when nothing is there. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time following this. <br /> <br />
