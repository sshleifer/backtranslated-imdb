It's been a momentum for me from this local video store. The same mistake did not work. This film has acted with elegant, impartiality and is generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle was particularly poorly written and delivered; I wish I could share it on every stage they shared. Dennis Hopper performs a little bit and does not have the usual difference; his role did not have an extension for him. The film feels much more like the Hollywood movie, though it's supposed to be built in Puerto Rico; all of the main symbols are Caucasian and many tend to speak English with the lies-Irish accents. Odd. Nevertheless, when you see it on the shelf of a local video store, take a picnic.
