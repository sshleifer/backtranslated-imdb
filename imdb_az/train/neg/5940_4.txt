Look, I read these comments and read and I want to say that there is a lot, but I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> First of all, I was thinking how bad this film was ... What a touched I did not show anything, and here I agree with most people when I say "Hollywood", that is, what did you expect a real life story? When will people wake up, and they will never be able to find the true truth about 2pac and Biggie ... All of them are covered and buried deep. <br /> Secondly, what a 2pak or Biggie I love them but 2pac and Lil Kim have been embarrassed in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, for all those who say that the movie is awesome and does not see the truth, it looks very profitable, because she knows something big or you do not know about it, and I like Hollywood's young movies. Use your mind and look at the clouds ... There are many things you can say when it comes to this subject, I say 60% of what I have to say, because I can say that it is a very broad topic, but it can only be a little bit for the movie. <br /> <br /> I love hip hop and live for it, but after seeing everybody seeing a little bit of this movie, intelligence did not seem to think that this one was living. Everyone, like respecting 2Pac and BIG, as well as all other artists, need to turn another page to build a life like that, because it breaks the youth .... Getting an incorrect message to children <br /> <br /> True hip hop love and intelligence suggests being wise and all-encompassing. <br /> <strong> br /> OK I know that many of you will think I'm insane, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something and I'm telling you this is a bad movie, because even though I've been in hip hop at the age of 17 or 18, I do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie, even though I have not read or read many articles. How much do I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you there. For all Biggie and Tupac supporters and family, I would only say that these two men will always be the biggest, even though they have lived their lives, but will come in the future, learn to be better, learn from it, and your ONE THE BEST IS GOOD WITH OURSELVES, NO LUXURY. WITHOUT MUCH MONEY WILL OR DEATH AND a good idea, YET THE FUTURE goal GOOD AND AGE, BODY AND ISSUES MUQAVILƏLƏNDIRMƏSI MƏHDUDLƏSDIRILƏN should be about ... this follow-up, if LIFE AFTER THE COUNTRY WILL BE GOOD! Peace and dear! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT LEFT, JAM MASTER JAY AND THIS CHANGED IN THE WORLD !!!!
