Is this a movie? Are these Indians trying to show? I think this thoughtful filmmaker is a Pakistani soldier and, in fact, an effort to leave the country .... but as our Pakistani people know, we are always ahead of India on every side of our lives ... armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... as it was in early 1997, a bad film was filmed ... the director and writer tried to overcome the shame of defeat by Kargilian armed forces only in Pakistan. such films <br /> <br /> One thing is clear ... When there is a conflict between Pakistan and India .... we will win ....! So, Mr. Dutta is trying to take some good movies instead of Nonsense films like this
