Given the chances of writing, editing, and starring in my own movie, I would probably choose something about robot women with guns. Anthony Hopkins, perhaps, decided to make the most strange movie he has ever seen. Slipstream is so strange that David Lynch will even look at the person coming to him and say, "What happens?" He will say. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a man headed straight to a yellow car, returning to the right and suddenly turned into a pink car that turned to the left. These two characters have an interspersed conversation with images of random people laughing and walls of insects climbing. This man is only a movie that begins to talk about the film "Bodysnatchers' occupation" for the actor of a movie, so he will suddenly show himself (and then not to fine tune). <br /> <br /> This movie requires a coherent plot coming away from the window, and it changes without a reason that has been decided to use fifteen different corrections, as well as black and white color <br /> < br /> Of course, Mr. Hopkins should define this film for selecting actors (some of which reflect multiple characters). They all throw their own roles even if they do not really know what they are doing. My favorite Christian Slater's son was laughing in his hat and effectively frightened when he performed the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins can be the best way to summarize Slipstream, saying it's a joke. A joke to the audience. You are trying to figure out what happened and hope for the answer, but you can watch it from beginning to end to find out if the answer really is. <br /> <br /> I also talked about David Lynch, and I'm a big fan of this director. I guess Anthony Hopkins shares his love of "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, although Slipstream has imitated many techniques, he is not happy with any of the Linch films (although I was surprised to find out that no one was in Slipstream). This is a very chaotic and casual thing, as we have mentioned here, as another reviewer is the film version of Alzheimer's Disease. There is no doubt that there is a small number of people watching and watching. Unfortunately, for others, "Slipstream" will soon become an uncomfortable and mixed experience with Hopkin's presence. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
