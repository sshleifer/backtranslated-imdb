First of all, I liked the novel by Ray Bradbury. It is a type of horror that falls under your skin and will stay with you later. Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine were one of the best books you know. I just hope that this movie will be fine. There was plenty of luck with a great chance like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the essay. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> The dog fell down. Most of the horror in the book disappeared after the accident was forced to keep the violence at least. All the images of the book ... went on. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he owns the player. Like many films Disney has shot in the 80's, children can not move in this movie. And that did not deceive me, nor looked at 13, from 9 to 10. They did not touch their solid friendship. They were as familiar as they were. <br /> <br /> In your opinion, Mr. Halloway and Mr. Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce. But here's just not to care. All you want to do is pay some kind of mortgage or something. This is a bit far from their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was as beautiful as Witch, but Powder Witch did not herself too well. It is very poor and does not exist as in the book. <br /> <br /> Everything else is out of the book. The purple night chase, the sign of Jim's house, the true death of Mr. Dark, the cheerful departure of Mr Coogan, the fate of the lighting rod seller, the real death of the witch and much more. <br /> <br /> And for the 1980s, special effects were bad. The sudden transition to something with extreme horses going around was not really creepy and really strange green fog that had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I can describe how this film breaks the original novel, but it creates a flow of blood. Do not just watch this movie, but read the book. This is Bradbury classic.
