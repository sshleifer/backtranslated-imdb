LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE, is one of Elvis's most strange movies. Party slapstick, part fluff, part surreal and part strange. Elvis faces a very busy girl with a very boring voice. It looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story is not as significant as most of Elvis Presley's films, and there are many single wheels. And this is not a lot of music, but I liked it, though nothing memorable. Strangely resilience. Elvis and Michelle Carey come to the beach at night, but in a few minutes a delivery is coming and this is a great daylight! Yes?? About the essence of the film. Yes?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) shows the show.
