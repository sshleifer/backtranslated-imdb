Georgia Rule should be one of the worst films ever seen in my life. The entire movie turned me into a very distant, "what?" <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > Lohan is a rebellious, sexually explicit, little daughter-in-law, like a daughter-in-law, who sees as a family that grows up like a clich√©, a light, a flower. <br /> <br /> <strong > The Caucasian> once a week has changed its glands or is characterized by the fact that Lindsay Lohan has sexually exploited by the genuine father, Georgia creates its own genre of cinema: the baseless, inactive, incompatible comedy dealing with very serious issues The most unusual, surreal, in a strange way. If Harry Marshall wants this movie to be a drama / comedy, he must follow the Royal Tenenbaum. Side parties. Junebug. And so on. And that's why. <br /> <br /> One of the feelings I can get from a reader to grasp the terrible genres that fall under the Georgian Curse is to create a hypothetical situation. The film, 40-year-old Elderly Sister, is the subject of being celibate for having sex with a child as a child. But instead of turning the film into a dramatic turn, the abdomen laughs and the comedy comes with people who are fake, lifeless, and caring for the reactions of all characters. Dermot Mulroney, like at least non-dimensional character, in the yellow parachet, could have been completely cut off from this vulnerable script, and did not share all religious beliefs and morals with none of the same interests, -real moments, a scene that follows an unnecessary car, as well as the rules of Georgia. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker, screenwriter, actor, editor, and so on. I found out he was insulting those people who were fighting with them. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> If necessary, get drunk enough before you can.
