I was about 7 years old when a movie was released in this DRE MONSTROSITY. In the UK in the summer of 1977, television was advertised for several weeks, as some unusual films. This was, in fact, the first movie I saw in a movie theater and I was released for the next few years. The next week I was invited to go and see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. So far, I have never seen it as a protest against watching Sasquatch! Seriously, at age 7, I can say that I was watching the garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. I have never come to a movie theater. But after all these years, I was forced to read, the director never directed me, as I was concerned. ALL FINANCES AGAIN!
