A friend gave me a box of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies". I was a little careful. But since the item was a gift, I really did not pay much attention to my healthy thinking. After all .... free movies! Well, if they're a little tight. After much attention, Alien Intruder is the first of films. It is almost the best choice, because it is the first choice. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> <br /> The four (I count!) Actors I've met. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield, and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... Billy and Tracy, if you do not sign up for a turkey, have been a good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively). ... but not a lot of actors, not a Jeff .... good ... has done good and bad as far as film and television go. "<br /> <br /> I discovered that Jeff decided to add" ugly "to the repertoire of films. <br /> <br /> The first clue was on the opening scenes, before Jeff killed himself," I'm crazy I'm not. "It's a really fun community performance, unfortunately, this is the highlight of the movie, without too much exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Then we were sent to see what Jeff and his crew were dealing with new shamans There is no such thing as Dirty Dozen - more Unconvincing Fourour, and one of the pocket charges is shown on a computer hacker, a camcorder working on a laptop, like a weapon store in slammer? <br / <br /> <br /> Finally, when the effects are eliminated, it is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian model, separated from Airfix kits <br /> <br /> But horror does not stop there. While on the way to the disappearance of Jeff's ship, the criminal team rewarded them for their fine conduct, which is the virtual reality that takes on their lives. All good and good, and the use of fantasy scenes will serve as an entry to Alien Menace, which will begin to appear there. But did they have to drag for quite sooooo loooooong? A foreigner intruder? <br /> <br /> Finally, they're taking him to the G-Sector, and a remote entity fights against each other just as good old Max. Indeed, the ending of the optimistic debris in the veins of the film is as though it is - as if it were! It is also a character that will give the title "Sweatdroid" by giving it a look in this movie. He was planning to become an Android, but it seems that this makeup crew loses any sweaty features at any opportunity. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins do very little in the film when it comes to the truth. They just do not stay alert, do not move. And as I mentioned earlier, Jeff has been going to the shower before, so his manic is not allowed to clarify most of the film. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> ship naming convention. All of them are named after the musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is mild and clean. <br /> <br /> I thought it was one of the 80 jobs created at first glance in 1992. As you can see, there are still films similar to the 90's. As is apparent, this is the best case. Although it's a beer chip film, this movie is a stinker, but at least you can put it forward.
