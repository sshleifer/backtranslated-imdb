<br /> <br /> This year's film festival in LÃ¼beck, the only film I've seen in Nordische Filmtage, will always be remembered for me at a low level. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mas. plot: it was clear from the first 15 minutes that Jehoah was ill, the neighbors were not real and killed their first daughter. It was something called "sex scene", but it was a disgusting thing (for me, blood flow did not have sex with one another), but unfortunately it was not only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other managers. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize the whole movie and save the time and money of other viewers: the boy loses his daughter, his girlfriend goes home, kills her daughter and then becomes insane, man describes hot, but crazy neighbors, boy there is a very disgusting sex with one of them (or, so think), at the end she understands that she is crazy and her girlfriend and her new lover are always in his apartment. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 1 (in fact 1 point, a bad story, bad actor, pictures ... - at least one of the benefits of the evening - and you can not choose 0 here), you understand that you understand Norway well when you learn Norwegian.
