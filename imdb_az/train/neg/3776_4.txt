Believe me, I want the "Spirit". An old fashioned, handmade animation, like the release of the last pen cartoon twenty years ago, and even more incorrect thinking, how old computers were outdated, and I was left in the blood ... but then in the first ten minutes of the "Spirit" uncompromising, insulting even more, has increased my bloodthirsty likeness. <br /> <br /> Characteristic designs are generally animated (partly productive) simply authorized, their integrity is entirely unmatched; Egypt "and" Road to El Dorado ", Dreamworks's talented artists) and the CGI's sophisticated use is in bad condition at all times. (Why are you worried?) There is nothing worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Horses can not speak, but they are more anthropomorphic and not convincing, and they wear Bambi, and it appears that horses can speak CAN, the soul itself prologue (the whole world is called as an actor from a shopping center in the 21st century) , and then put it down, there is absolutely nothing in the narration of unhorselike, although he once said something we did not know at all, or he could not even express himself twice, even if he was poor. (a) Includes information that the Spirit knows, and then we know, the information that we have discovered; b) The spirit that refuses to express even the ability to speak (c) the new age wastewater, "This story may not be right, but I remember," and (d) stopped the production of six-year-olds, as horses were native to North America (I believe production is produced) it was the common ancestor of the local horses, the zebras were born in North America - but all the horses on the continent were exhausted long before the first humans and lowered the spirits of the Spirit (where "buffalo meadow") from the horses that the Europeans used. <br /> <br /> So, , the prologue disturbed me. <br /> <br /> Frequently, Bryan Adams sings, like the spirits of the Spirit, sounds like a sore throat infection, and does not say it or he hears it, he says: The less contributing to the Spirit's narrative maudlin's ballad balls and I pay my attention (though they did not realize that they did not). Only Bryan Adams and the guy who behaved as a boy could have been allowed to take the actual form of film if it could take a couple of minutes: mediocre and derivative, worse than jaw.
