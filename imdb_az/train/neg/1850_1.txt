Director Ron Atkins is crazy in a certified way. This ultra-low-budget movie has taken a Rubberneck puppet from his broom girlfriend for a few days, Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, also co-authored), served a table. The puppet starts ordering, not buying, raping and killing large quantities of drugs, it is not always the case. Neither does it start as a top-to-wall exploitation film, it remains as good, but it becomes very repetitive. More precisely, I bend toward the insult. Although it is hard to forget what has been done once. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> Yasmin Putnam shows fungus and arm <br /> <br /> Anti-eyed candy
