This is one of the worst B boards I've ever seen in my life. The latter is something you believe. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing, whose mother down the chimney while wearing her father's Santa suit. He puts his gifts under the tree, eats the desserts and milk, and returns to the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry comes down to finding his father, who only puts his mother in a sexually abusive Santa suit. <br /> <br /> Then Harry made the stairs, blown the wind, grabbed a bottle of glass, and cut himself. <br /> You see Harry. She is a man lying in Santa's suit and watching small children through a pair of binoculars. There are two books. A good book for children, and the other for bad guys. It writes everything they do in books. The boy is a reptile. She also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful home. <br /> <br /> When Harry knows that his boss will pay attention only to earnings, all the toys go and bring some children. He travels to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and places gifts under the tree. Children take it, but they lie down. So Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and his leaves. <br /> <br /> While walking home, a group of children finds her and runs away to her. Parents are frustrated and try to get back to prevent their children from harming them. Do you know that Harry is murderous? Of course, I have to doubt, because you do not know who will be. <br /> <br /> Harry gives gifts to children, and the father takes a knife to stand in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry fled, the gate of the city burned and followed her to kill her. They did not know they were killer. When Harry came to his brother's house, there was a little talk with his brother, and Phillip drowned him. Only consciousness loses. Phillip loaded Harry with the truck. <br /> <br /> Dear Harry, from now on, <br /> <br /> Once you have to see it to accuse me. <br /> <br /> Black was something that split me up. True, the man in the Santa suit was a white man. <br /> Why are they bringing a black man? <br /> <br /> Quote the Rally and the Deadly Night of Silent Night and Santa's Slay. Your money is worth watching these two movies. It's better than rubbish! I can give this movie a 10-year-old 1 star. I wanted to give it 0 stars that this movie deserves.
