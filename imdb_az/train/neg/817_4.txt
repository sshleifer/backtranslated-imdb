"You will not go to shoot these small creatures, they will not harm you first, and may be radioactive in the second place." Oh, the joys of exploring the extraordinary 50s? Nevertheless, despite such a single ship, Superman and Mole-Men are up to a 58-minute operating time. Although it is a very striking message of dedication, this is cheap (Superman is incredibly delicate couple of animated shot animation) and is quite boring with it? The magnificent Mole-Men, the great excavations and the tiny actors with the expanded skull and fur caps, which, like Mr Mxyzptlk, who were released by oil drilling from underground world, were just misunderstood, and was headed by George Reeves's "Man of Steel" by Jeff Corey the local small town that killed them to prevent them. An interesting point in the day's paranoia is perhaps less than good intentions.
