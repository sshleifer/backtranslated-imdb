It was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but not because she's holding the body in the night with a swollen body, but she's not going to throw her agent to put it on the crap. Faye Dunaway behaves as if my mother is rebuilt It's dear and the last is completely foolish. As an admirer of Edgar Allen Poe, I can not really recommend this movie (Ravens, Usher-family curse house, and immortal sky), if he knew about this movie, he probably would have returned to his grave.
