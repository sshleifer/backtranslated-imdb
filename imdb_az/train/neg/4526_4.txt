An immoral attempt on Hitchcock-type secret-thriller, undoubtedly based on spying exchanges and Robin Cook's novel; Accidentally, I recently gained another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of late Richard Widmer. Note that director Sheffner was only a BRAZILIAN CHILDREN (1978) - just a dreamy, but more seductive, and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a mistaken step that would not correct her legendary impressive career. <br /> Even though it is difficult and deserves to be worthy, it has proven a critical and commercial flop. Basically, the narrative is not very exciting: in fact, it is terribly (terrible attempts to attack - most of the archaeologist heroin corpses and even bats crash ). Lesley Anne-Down is the most beautiful lady who has stumbled upon a treacherous treasure - actually hiding by a local sect, which has been largely part of the country's heritage (under the cultural excuse) for a long time. <br /> <br /> Sir John Gielgood is primarily a brutal dictator, who put Down Down the Trophy and paid this "betrayal" of his life. <br /> <br /> Typically, some of the characters are contrary to what they claim to be - as clearly the Allies (like Maurice Ronet, for example) are exposed to bad men, but an indefinite number (Frank Langella, 2007 I first saw the performance of West End in London) and decided to retain its wealth, from Down's antagonist, to the treasure of the treasured Meneptaa who came to Egypt again.
