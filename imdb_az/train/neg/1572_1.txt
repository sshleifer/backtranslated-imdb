One of the worst films I've ever seen. Horrible moves, funny "motion" (car is slowly traveling), fierce scripts, unwanted ends, and filming in vain. Judge Reinhold is a good player, but we need to be ashamed of this detritus. There is no big tension inside the car and laughs like some of the "high five" when the characters see the bridge down when they look like moments of hope! <br /> <br /> Also, the chain of events that make people share the same car is also reliable. As you can see, despite the real events? If so, the truth is not artistic, it is probably even more strange! Unfortunately, it has been described in such a surprising way.
