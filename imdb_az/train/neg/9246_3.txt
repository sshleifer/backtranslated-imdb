When I was first broadcast, I refused to follow, I respected the memory of the deceased, I wept with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope in the 1960s, but I can never go against a problem. I must get to know better. Not parody and more parody than the truth, this show did not know exactly how to play, and the child was filled with comedy and cartoon characters and symbols. The three main characters were less than the actor's cartoon and only Emilia Fox could move (Bob Mortimer plays a straight line). The proprietary toy was just comic-acquaintances who wanted to be part of Vic and Bob's joke and knew that the situation was convincing. And while the CGI did not help the development of those 30 years ago, the audience dazzled with light and camera work and did little to disrupt the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All styles and no items. (And in the 1960s, when it's ridiculous that it's a lot of time, this 'update' now raises Matrix'-style fashion, forced 'girl power' scenes and two live creatures.)
