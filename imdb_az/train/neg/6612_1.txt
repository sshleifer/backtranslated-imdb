I downloaded this movie from a website yesterday, the quality was very good! Particularly watching the movie was Amitabh Bachcha's superstar Amitabh Bachchan, who played a role of proving the film, with high expectations (though he was a flop). At least, like me, actors would value their role. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan proved that nobody can compete to re-burn the untested roots of AMJAD KHAN's magic RGV. It is also a stage in the vivid soundtrack, which is a hit with an all-star cast, religious dialogue, stylish cinematography and still existing generations in the old Indian cinema history. Talented by Ajay Devgan, TALENTS is a good actor and performance does not know what Prrakan Raj is doing, a new player. Nisha Kothari proved that RGV team is one of the worst actresses we have ever seen in Urmila & Abhishek's song, which is still the most exciting and passionate Mohanlal, and Susmitha Sen's job is good. I'm working on this movie, the original Sholay's It was massacre
