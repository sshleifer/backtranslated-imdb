Recap: Ron wants to marry Mel. Although they were introduced a couple of months ago, they are deep and loving and perfect for each other. Todd is not happy to be Ron's brother. He threatens his own business in the family business and is afraid that Ron decided to organize a bachelor's party. <br /> <br /> Together with his wife Ron, Ron and Mel leave. Comedy classics were later supposed to be, but not funny. This is basically a childhood excuse to show a puberty show and a small number of women. In fact, somewhere, somewhere there, you can place many there. Unfortunately, this is one of the signs of a film that can not support itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually, actor Josh Cooke is actually some healthy trying to impress thoughts. Sara Foster I know that there are more abilities than movies and Emanuelle Vaugier appears to have more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, there are good jokes. In fact, there are very few jokes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
