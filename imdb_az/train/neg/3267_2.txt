There is nothing incredible about "Amazing Mr. Williams". Part of the film's problem is its leading actor Melvyn Douglas. He was a very bad player and he was lazy with him. For most of his career, he has given him a good look, a flawless way, and a good writing (usually not in this film) to ensure his ability to function. I did not like Douglas as an actor before I knew him as a human; I've learned enough to know if I'm going to make it politic. <br /> <br /> An excellent talented and sexy actress, Illeana Douglas, will give Melvyn Douglas a piece of chromosomes. <br /> <br /> Melvinin's Douglas made this movie after the brilliant 'Ninotchka' ... comedown! 'Amazing Mr Williams' is claimed to be a comedy, but laughed. Douglas plays a prince detector in Kenny Williams' murder squad. I did not hear a police detective called Kenny, but if Kenneth Williams was telling him ... that's a good thing. The whole city is in a panic, because a serial killer goes to kill women. There is no reason to do so; she just loves to kill women. <br /> <br /> The expert (Jonathan Hale, better than usual), calls on the carpet to calculate the failure of Williams' killer. <br /> <br /> REFUSE TO RELIGIOUS. Joan Blondell, the inexperienced, inexplicable and inexpensive, plays a secretary general. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Blondell and Douglas collide like a cat and dog, so they're will give. > At the very bottom of this film, Melvyn Douglas decides to kill as a woman. You do not want to see Melvyn Douglas drag! It is more than six feet and does not even cut it. In a similar way, William Powell was a very similar actor to Melvyn Douglas (but more capable). When Powell hid himself as a "Love Crazy", Powell had the integrity to shave his mustache, just as Powell needed to grow again for her next role. But Melvyn Douglas does not have a role in this movie, and even a razor does nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, 'Amazing Mr. Williams' has some nice players who shoot Hollywood movies. It is so pleasant in the 1930s. Edwards Brofy is a funny and tactful person who can not be punished in life here. Doppytic Donald MacBride is as beautiful as a cop that makes a mistake for the killer and is lynched by about a gang. Ruth Donnelly is beautiful: just like for her, here she has the chance to get her abilities out of her ordinary orbit on the Warner Brothers board. Jimmy Conlin, Luis Alberni and Terry Dave Willock are good at smaller roles. Barbara Pepper (who does not like me) is also good here. Very unpleasant Maude Eburne takes some screen time; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I always enjoy it, and it performs the same performance on every film ... but some audiences, I have long ago admired Eburne's note performance. Hollywood actors of the 1930s and their role-playing role will tell who is the murderer at a glance at the IMDb player list. The problem with the 'Amazing Mr Wiliams' is that everything is very clear. I'm going to give this movie 2 points from 10 points.
