Though I'm not amazed at the very high rated this movie, although it would go with the size of this type, maybe that's all right, but this movie was just a typical thriller, very simple and non-realistic. Although a typical tension was not realistic, it seemed to work for something, and still a gentle woman did not stop her accusations because she did not want to be investigated in court, broke her arm and harassed her life, and also protected the casual people she knew not only her lawyer and family expressing her emotions. If he had some kind of morality to get away from the movie, there were similar problems with the film, but there were some moral questions as to whether Kade was right to kill / kill before doing something illegal. Be sure that Kadi was right to defend himself that Kadi would have been a legitimate thing after waiting for his daughter to rape her, that would be a little absurd. So now, for this stupid movie, I've done more than my life, please, at least you will not be disappointed and this means more than 2 1/2 hours.
