Wow, I'm a great Henry VIII / Tudor era, and it's also interesting. The only thing I was watching was that Aragon was a Catherine. Wow ... just wow. I've seen bad behavior before, but it has reached new heights. Catherine playing actress umm .. when weeping? she waves and shouts and I must admit that I have been coming back many times ... many, many times ... funny, funny stuff. Anne Boleyn's actress was the only person who showed even the smallest talent (although I was a bit drowned with Anne Boleyn, she was actually a facinating woman, reading it, it's worth it!) Also, I read a lot about the Tudor era, I think it is not clearly demonstrated, all of them were very stereotypical. If you're ready to see a very important moment, just look at this movie and laugh at the lives of the participants.
