Part 1 watched 4/29/2007 - Dir-Mick Garris (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King's film 3/4 as Campy Vampire has very bizarre and closed elements that begin to laugh with excessive strangers into the movie, and you are surprised that this film may have the following cult for the King's fans: This is the story of a mother and a boy, sleepwalkers (like a shaped cat, nutrition, life-threatening, destructive sex), moving from city to city looking for a diet to keep alive. They meet as secretly lovers and cats, as well as their home, day and night. Cats are in a deadly position and are trapped in the yard to lower their populations. When they attack, you see one or two neck broken (which is my first experience in filming) --- I hope that no real cats have been damaged in the film's preparation. After a sweet girl, she turns into a "sleepwalker" and then shakes her body just as she does not want it. It's a strange thing to this movie that it would have been better if it had a full satirical comedy in the suburban life, but the director tried to frighten you every few minutes instead. Finally, this happens and the film, typically causing the fall of Stephen King. The film is interesting because the king's humor is more than usual, but his strangeness is also extreme, and his admirers are probably a movie that he likes and wants to be in his collection, but it does not really have a valuable film experience.
