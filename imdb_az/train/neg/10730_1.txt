Three people meet in the bar with each other in the movie. OK. They talk about their imaginary life all the time, without any reason. Still OK. From time to time, they even laugh. It's interesting. The first 30 minutes can actually do it! But then things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, if something happens, you see all, naked old "ladies" touch each other! Not good. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top part of the movie, but it's all there! The film has no meaning, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The most unusual thing is the FEST (film festival) in FEST (Belgrade, Serbia), which is, of course, the most popular for research before watching people! I even say (before watching): "Hay, it may be fascinating, though a Russian movie!" But God, no!
