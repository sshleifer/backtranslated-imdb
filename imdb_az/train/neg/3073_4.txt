In the back of the DVD box, Ellen Satellite plays the role of co-stars in this film. It does not appear until three-thirds of the movie has been played. I do not support it, but rather a "bit". There are also many unexplained elements in the plot. Some examples: Why is the main character rejecting his eldest son? Why does her little boy go to the train? He says, according to a "absorbent" expense, which does not explain anything. Certainly, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a welding bet. This movie is not worth the rent for my opinion. If it is to be seen, protect your money and watch it free from the TV.
