Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Allow me to count paths. 1. You are trying to be funny, but fragile and unenjoyable; Every joke is anticipated and anticipated, and does not inspire laughter when it comes. Instead I want to shoot. 2. You are trying to be dramatic, but unbelievable; the woman was terribly overthrown and "bad man" was like Bill Gates and like Bill Gates. As for Jamie Foxx, it is ridiculous to introduce a dramatic and sincere dialogue, and he wants to throw me in. (Only Bill Gates seems to be trying to drive a gun with an armed gun, does not work, or is a lawyer, but not a gun.) As for Jamie Foxx, 3. You are trying to be full with the operation, but instead it is often dragged and dragged. When the action was on the move, the tripod for the camera was canceled, the scenes were more like the Blair Witch Project, and I made it up and I wanted to shoot again. 4. Trying to be a good movie, but you failed, YOU TARGETED! I would like to go to Barefoot along the Sahara with Meryl Streep just for a package full of breakfast, no water, no sun, and for the company. This hell would be more than a minute long for everyone to expect, with Bill Gates, a bad man, overturned with a story written in a bad man, and even talking about a massive bomb inside a car that characterized Jamie Foxx as a KING OF KING , but it can be saved in some way ... killing me now, or doing something right, and never needing to watch me this bad movie ever again.
