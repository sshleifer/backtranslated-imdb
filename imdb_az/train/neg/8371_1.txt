I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen on a TV watch trailer, and I knew from the first part that it would be a piece of it and it would be good to avoid it, but some of my comrades were dragged to see it, but I did not watch movies, it would be a few cheap laughs to wake me up. In this film, the so-called "jokes" hit the face, in most cases the face and the people who are hitting the ball, the typical racial jokes that we often see and behave as a horny gangster are in today's trash comedies. The film is clear, and the story is impossible to believe, but predictable and unstable. Heroes are very boring and hard stereotypes. I do not want to see this movie again, at least I would like to have a better foot than this piece of wood is exposed. If I say everyone likes it, I'm physically assaulting them
