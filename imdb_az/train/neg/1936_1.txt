Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character sneaks down the stairs, the killing breaks a glass of vodka next to him, which looks like he drinks. But before his death, his brother Teri Garr says he had not had a drink in the phone within 4 days. But the police did not record the results of any toxicological report! And the ladies talk about his drunken when falling down the ladder. Huh? Generally pretty bad in this movie is a really bad mistake. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad considering the great pressure. Some mistakes: the writing is not very good, music is bad for television, and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the first scene in the film.
