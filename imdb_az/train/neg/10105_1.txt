Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> Hey, I was bored too. To find a movie to watch, I looked at the Comcastic small box. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. The film describes one of the following phrases: It does not tell me to watch this movie. I could use this advice. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Nation is completely wrong, like Troll 2. With a bit of zombie (something depends on your point of view) and all across the city. This film revolves around a crooked police who works as badly as possible (he is trying to do so), arresting and then killing women for a hard time. Yup, a serial killer police. Not only does this movie think that it is a zombie crash, but it's also a mistake to kill his killer. Serial killers love to kill, they live for it and fall down with them. This guy screams at women and shoots them poison. He does not engage in sexual intercourse or break the body. Talk about longing! Finally, one of the five murdered women had given him Voodoo protection, and five of them returned because he had no reason, and he led the murder of this man. They are all buried or moved to the ocean, but you will not be able to buy the sharp clean clothes that you are wearing. Women act very badly and take revenge. Oh summer. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar to each category. Crap action, crap writing, crappier sets and crappier makeup effects. Women do not look like zombie, and if you do not really see dark makeup around your eyes, it's a de facto definition of a zombie thing. Everyone can speak, act, think, and make a perfect person. Gore is much weaker than the PG-13 movie, and nudity is short. Looking at your heartbeat at the opening ... Later on in the same chest! Go to the number. Only one actress wanted to go topless for this trite. The police station is so bad that you can see that they are painting the walls of the barn you open. You can see the pipes, bad lights and excessive spin-off, and even if you are not blind, the director is unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> <strong>
