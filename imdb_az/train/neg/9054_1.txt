If you hate Redneck's attempts, you will hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, trying to be a redneck. I really can not stand the redneck accents. I love Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was uncomfortable in this movie. What kind of Lonnie Earl is called? How much hickish to this movie? Storyline was foolish. I'm usually not convicted of such films, but I could not stay in the movie. <br /> <br /> That's why we found $ 5.95 in Wal-Mart, the figures ... ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to me. My grandmother for Christmas. I just can not, I do not usually have the redneck habits or Patrick Swayze. Perhaps there was no Patrick Swayze. She never smiled at the movie. I usually laugh at something stupid. If some of them showed their fingers broken, I laughed. The fingerprints of people who crash by accident always make me laugh.
