Amazing! Wow! Only one movie can inspire this horrible, terrifying "Showgirls". So where do you start? Spectacular strange theme song? Pia Zadora's expressions all over the movie? Despite being set up in Los Angeles, aka "land of cast iron" EVERYONE (and woman!) Destroys themselves to sleep with Pia Zadora through any necessary means? Otherwise, everyone in the movie is absolutely inappropriate, because they are foolish-picnic or pseudo-sleazeball (everyone). And this flicker is a shocking fact of understanding the film industry, because it's written by the actual "scenarios (sorta)" (Hell is a SCREENWRITER admirer and kiss) <br /> <br /> But hell is a single hell of the movie. Only the "crash" scene will giggle and look after the climate, "I can not just climb" "Awards" (all at Pia's level of ordinary guarantees, such as Pia), I sincerely hope that the Pia Gold Globe <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you are a fan of the worst camping party, try another sticky movie.
