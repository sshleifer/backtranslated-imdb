In 2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Pansion and gave us Live Feed in 2006; The decent disassembly of the hostel. The live feed explains with the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, while the silent children are located in Central Asia, not in Asia. Sui pays attention to these dumb children and one of them is dissatisfied with the local people because they are in trouble. The locals decided to lock them in a theater and kill them. Although I had heard less of the good things before seeing this film, director Ryan Nicholson had made 45 minutes of tormenting and revenge film "Torched," which was at least half a decent. but this movie is simply down, because most of them are ridiculous or boring. The film is clear, however, that Grindhouse is trying to return to the good old days of the movie theater (the government's success), but it's not actually released. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even effective, on the contrary, it's better than the game! There is nothing else I can say about this movie ... it's not a bad one. Avoid!
