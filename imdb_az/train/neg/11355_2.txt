"Nat" (by Trevor Gagnon) brainiac-friendly "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with great dreams. They want to be the first flying space in space. <br /> <br /> The first spacecraft on the Apollo 11 is the one that promotes their dreams. <br /> <br /> The first thing you see is the animation of the movie. I did a very good job. The decoration was deep, because the distances were in the center of the scenes. I did not see the 3-D movie because it was released in HBO. But I've seen that it's not really a scene from the 3-D effects, but a fight between the closest heroes. I was not really impressed with the design of the heroes. It did not look like an airplane, especially in painting. <br /> <br /> The changes are not bad, but it was not good. I've been paying more attention to my computer than the story. Writing is, of course, written for a smaller audience, with comedy moments that will make your kids smile. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything for adults. But like jokes, they will try to understand the meaning of adults. <br /> <br /> The film has not been watched in this movie. In fact, the main focus is because of the flies, and I have not seen it completely. I also hated after a well-known astronaut appeared on screen, and the stories about the film's flies were a science fiction and that there was no consciousness on Apollo 11. How thankful I am for men and women who sacrificed me <br /> <br /> If you are older then this is not for you. Not prepared for the whole family. This is, of course, only for children. But, save for this rainy day.
