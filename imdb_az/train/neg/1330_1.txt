There is one reason for Jay Lenon to accept this movie. It is ranked sequentially as one of the worst films of all time. The player is terrific, there is no direction of the script, and the director is not sure how to shoot this movie. "Friendship film", "action / comedy", "mystery". As you can see from the half, she refuses and just goes to my wife. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. They make a mess in a movie, it's a shame that they spend their time and gifts. Jay Leno and Pat Morita had hacked the hands of artisans during the Hollywood era. From the mid-1960s, Mr Morita was a "Happy Days" as a star of such classic television and movie classics, and a sincere, but unpleasant "Mr. T and Tina" star. And in a powerful film, Midway, The Karate Kid and others have won the American heart. Mr Leno appeared on TV shows up to the mid-70's. She was the best performer in America's comedy clubs. It may appear on numerous TV spots and big movies. It is a shame that they have agreed to see this foolishness.
