Recently, I met Wendigo in one of Alvin Shvarts's "Terrible Stories" books: for this story, Wendigo drags you down after calling your name in the wind and then into the sky and pulverizing you. Schwartz's story sounds like a strange idea, though he has turned it into a fairly relevant idea. <br /> <br /> Not Wendigo movie. This is basically a whipping clich√© of every horror: the family moves to a new home and strange things start, everyone who hurt them is asking for it, and everyone has listened to the old Indian boy better. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus> Patricia Clarkson and Eric Per Sullivan (Dewey Malcolm in the Middle) have done this better.
