Nevertheless, I will not end plain-to-video freedom, I should consider this headline blank. Well, animated films, that is, if you're bored. This evening I saw AFI in Dallas and stayed for 20 minutes, just because I did not care about it (it's not hard not to insult the director). When you can run the movie for only 5 minutes (one shot, the windows are knocked out before any shooting ... and then the window breaks with the first shot) things will get worse. Let's just say that this is just an indication of the future ... <br /> <br /> I will forgive you all the details, but this is a disappointment when you expect from Michael Madsen to semi-assed player in every way. The scene of aggression ... Christ! It should never be used in an aggressive situation. <br /> <br /> 3/10
