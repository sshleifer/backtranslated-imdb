I have never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm not crazy to come to this city! I've been to NY for several times and love the town and its surroundings. I have to be touched by this movie, but I'm sorry for the time and money spent with me. People do not have love stories between a man and a city. Many meetings and relationships or people know each other and do not just work well. Perhaps this is a characteristic of thousands of people living in the city itself. Can not you find love in New York?
