Blonde and Blunder unfunny.Basically, it was a dilapidated girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny and they have used very background noise and music. MANY BACK-UP AND YOU MAY HAVE A MUCH! It starts with extremely boring and completely trustworthy. It will not go anywhere soon and I feel more embarrassed for this nonsense. Perhaps the only thing that kept me from giving this movie was the last 30 was a little fun and interesting that I came to the end, but that's just part of it. And Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard could not help. Even if this film was not a laugh, I kept silent. I did not say that I would not be afraid of this movie, but there are thousands of good movies to spend more time and money than Blonde and Blond.
