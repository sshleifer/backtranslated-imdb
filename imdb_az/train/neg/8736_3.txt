<br /> <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify; Yes, the story is wise," Dirty Harry "" M "A child killer began a terrorist attack in a city where lead investigators (Dennis Hopper and Frederick Forest) were not involved in any serial killer before, Mayor and Police Chief, in desperation, to secretly work to accelerate the local temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> < next to the concept I liked the look of the assassin, Norman Bates had his cellar with dirty sewerage, and in some shooting light sheds light and the walls are wavy <br /> <br /> The scenes are often creepy, dreamy. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good, and the Sea Hopper is one of the most advanced actors. <br /> <br /> After the past, he begins to slip more or less. <br /> <br /> Very fast road. The actual investigation process of both teams ran away from being too complicated and attractive. It could have been determined in two ways: either take the film for a longer time or cut off some of the many subfields. Both of them would allow the crew to spend more time on the true mystery. <br /> <br /> One of the important tips that only zero on right-wing suspects for an example of how bad this is is: at one point in life, into a suspicious pet shop ... Right ... I'm totally serious here. <br /> <br /> Therefore, from the point A (from the suspect) to the point of departure from the "A" point and all "steps" were taken. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters. The only ones I liked were two tracks when you talked halfway through the movie. Given that they are of a minor nature, I would say a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mob has a deficit. This is something that I can get the most because I've reserved $ 3 to buy a DVD. That is, what a hook! Serial killer spikes have an absolute nutrient within the last 10-15 years. <br /> <br /> I thought the methods of robbery were cruel, but fun and at the same time thrilling. ; a kind of vigilante movie or something ... maybe even want to throw some heist movie elements. We are all talking about criminals. Instead, we are given the most horrific protagonists for celluloid. Detectives ask witnesses. What should a group do? They ask them and kill them. This is not true of the witnesses really bad. In fact, I found criminals who love less than those who were hunting. <br /> <br /> If the good points I mentioned are sufficient to get an interest, I would like to give it a shot. Perhaps one day they will repeat the same story idea and it is RIGHT. I hope. I hate seeing such a good concept.
