I did not believe that. I had to hunt my eyes several times. Is it true? <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield, and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have some talent, but all here are mostly Cinemax style skin sounds. <br /> <br /> Simply , "Alien Intruder", a computer virus / foreign devil / harpy / its name, Ariel (Scoggins) <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but everything here is just like a good padded episode of the "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams removes everything from the right and left and is doing something else elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Unfortunately, the horror of women is less than you expect. <br /> <br /> HotInnuendo is a true star here and, of course, he takes all the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like, everything is boring and there is no brain, "Alien Intruder". <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; /> Lost in this space then leave.
