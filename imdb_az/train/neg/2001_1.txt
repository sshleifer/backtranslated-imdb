How many people are left to enjoy Roberto Moreira's "Against Them" ("Contra Todos") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a colliding guy," I said, man. "Well ... and Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multi-colored people, tropical weather, light rhythms and hip gangster area? <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to give us some details: this is a very bad film, it's a bad thing to watch, because it's really terribly and poorly prepared. <br /> How Contra Todos, Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many small local festivals and now in San Francisco? As you can see, through the promotion process and the film festival circuit work. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was named the best Brazilian film of the year at the Rio Film Festival. This should be a bad year; there are many better ones. Later in the catalogs and in the form of an imaginary buzz lead to massive audiences, and this is why tours are continued, as the film has not been directed anywhere and has been closely monitored by critics. <br /> <br /> Promotion in the Festival seasons is sometimes a great deal. One Chicago Festival "Contra Todos" hit a "fast cocktail straight from Brazil" and was referred to Claudia's wife as a "dark neighborhood". Soninha "The younger daughter of Theodoro's shadow of sexuality". The film "operates quickly in the hand of the camera" and the director works "a true and perceptible feeling of disappointment from indifference and decay." The effect is "intolerable and honest" and the film "destroys a lifelong end in life." <br /> <br /> A person named "Contra Todos", in fact, is concerned about two cunning men and one wife, daughter and one person. born Christian Christian girl. The Black Orpheus, Pixote and the City of God are not in Rio but this time, not in one of the Brazilian city cities like "favelalar" or a village in a poor suburban suburb, , São Paulo. <br /> <br /> Crafty Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his drug addict partner, Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça), who are family problems, have both Teodoro's dark blonde brother Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and there is a little TV experience like the actress playing Silvia Lorenco playing his pouting, rebel rebel Soninha, who can carry the backgrounds of several telenovelaes who know - maybe even better in a better mode movie.These Teordoro ' there are several young people who are thrown out by thieves when they are engaged in work or business. <br /> <br / > Several observers, one in Berlin and one in London, saw the failure of this film, but unfortunately the Web was buried in the hinterlands. Henry Sehan said in Berlin that the "movie" (his quotes) was "the worst of the videos". Shenan writes: "As the film's director is a cheap alternative, he chose the video and did not use any creativity in his new creativity." Sehan has shown the first big mistake of the movie: "It starts as a local drama for trampling for half an hour when it moves, Moreira shows that one of your father and friends is a professional dog. Thirty minutes waiting for nothing in the movie, it appears to be a perfectly unbiased decision and at least a loss of time for everything, without a sudden, substantial or inexplicable, for her birthday. "<br /> <br /> In 2004, Metin Alsanjak, who wrote about the London Festival, tried to look at the positive side but still "the best feature." Yes, it should be taken into account that everything is very bad. Alsanjak "This budget, which is not lawful in Sao Paulo, is a result of severe and rare accounts of any unpleasant characters and hopes that is not too dark or unkind to have an account of human condition," poor subtitling does not help. "Alsanjak with Kontra Todos He did not help to establish contact between Dogma and Mike Leigh. <br /> <br /> Wait for nothing to stop anything from the first half hour, first of all, to prevent violence When it comes to the "hero, cause, "Moyira is looking at everything in her eyes," says Moreira, trying to recapture her final final appearance after the end of an unusual reaction, even though the director wants to demonstrate the "insincerity of evil" of low-level cunning men in working-class neighborhoods , it is commonly seen characters and the film's structure shows that it can not edit its material. <br /> <br /> (San Francisco International Film Festival, April 28, 2005)
