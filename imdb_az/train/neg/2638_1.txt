There is good. It's bad. And then their Sentinel, a down-barrel political "thriller", is among the worst films I've ever seen. A break from the Secret Service is good, but a movie that has so much potential never flies. Everyone in the film, shot by Clark Johnson, "edginess", works on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas seems to have squeezed in here. I'm honest, I have never experienced it, and I've seen another movie in all my life with many eye-catching areas. This twist is predicted by one of the squares, and the motives of the character are completely laughable, and they laugh at the audience. Avoid all costs. This is the film's disaster that has no value.
