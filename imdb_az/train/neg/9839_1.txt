The beginning of this movie was good. She began to silence after telling people who wanted to kill her. I think I would betray it after seeing this movie if I came from a little city. They said that most of these people were dumb and naked. Indeed, in these days people can do as little as they can watch. Many times these people were telling him that they were trying to kill him and urged him to do so. How many people can be less respectful to other people? And I think that this film could be a better end. There was a good place for this movie. Some people may love it, but I do not recommend it to everyone.
