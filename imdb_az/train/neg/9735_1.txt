I tried hard enough to sit all the way through this annoying mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dourif was totally filtered as lead and all supportive goals were just marginally filthy. <br /> <br /> All this is just ridiculous, from ridiculous movements, from ridiculous FX to stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Complete waste of time; dont disturb. Root canal treatment will be more enjoyable. Bamboo slivers under the nails will be more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would have been a bit worse. Get the Idea?
