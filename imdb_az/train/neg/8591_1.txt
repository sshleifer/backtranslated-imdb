By trying to jump to a tree cutter, I'm trying to decide if this clash would be more enjoyable. The destruction of a few classic films at one time ends. We have Lucas's career with Jedi, Menace, Clowns, and Sith. She wants us to swallow Annac's Vader ridicule? I did not believe that it was the truth. This movie is true. This story has not worked since Phantom Moron and every new movie just bent until it was just a parade of parades. I have to go. I know where some new stones are thrown. Would you like Spoiler? Here they come. Not associated with Luke and Leia. Vader is not their father. Duke Countoo should cross over when it can do it again. Yoda Yogi has fewer verbal knowledge compared to Berra. His advice was not good for anyone. Obi Wan begged Luka for the first two films. Annakin did not build the C3P0. She found her in the wilderness and lied to her mother about uniting her from scratch. Chewbacca is one. All this disorder in Vader and in the Autumn of the Republic may be charged with this stupid b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. Although he had any brain, he said what he wrote for George Lucas, despite being in the light of Annie. What dope!
