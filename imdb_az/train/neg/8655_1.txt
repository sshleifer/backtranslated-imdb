It's a strange movie. It sucked. That was terrible. What I can not say about this movie, but DinoCrap, some of the reviewer, knocked me with a nail. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not Roger Corman, it's a god-terrible movie. Yes, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics? Something else, CGI sounded high; I hate this movie without grief. Surely the worst Roger Corman B-Movie and, most likely, the most delicate B-Movie. It's-it --- DINOCRAP! Sorry, at some point in the moment I have to hurt some nerds. Just a terrific movie ... 0 / 1,000
