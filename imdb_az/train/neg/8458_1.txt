Last weekend, I took this movie on my local movie gallery. It took 2 free and I chose this one as I needed one more time. Terrible mistake. The box is read as if it were a really good movie. Well, it starts as it will be a great movie. About 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman Laila who was killed by trying to save himself from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a refugee frightened by the urban population. He supposed that he had killed Leyla because he was afraid of the bull and went to the pond to find him. It was a good first 5 minutes. Only then will it be 100 times worse. Everyone who wrote the scenario, in my opinion, was supposed to have some sort of tourist trip or something, because nothing else meant anything else. Jack is at work and finds this traveling radio called Mary. I think that Mary should be a virgin Mary-like character. You know, mother of Jesus. But who knows, could not make his head or tails. When they flee ... bad guys, magic images, excitement, acne, and so on. We can see ... And all this is trying to figure out what happens in your brain. Undoubtedly, I took the movie back and exchanged for something else. Terrible, I say terrible. And there is no bull fight in this movie. If you do not count the first minute of the movie. I've helped some people lose their time in this movie.
