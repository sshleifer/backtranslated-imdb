After seeing this film, the filmmakers should consider that the idea is provocative, not as a movie. Yes, the only thought that saddened me was the time to watch the movie. The film's dreams (documentary style, futuristic structure) are destructive as to what should be a deliberate examination of abortion. This film shows the problem when people try to use the film for their political views - it's a very boring movie that usually propagates the chorus.
