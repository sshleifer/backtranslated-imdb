The story has been seen before, but there is nothing that you can understand to make a story right. Obviously, the director did not write his story to the story. At the same time, the cameraman was lying far beyond the inconveniences of the film's message. While watching the movie's website, you can read the funniest, the director's goal is to make the movie the worst camera angles. Because it reminds of the hunt. But I did not hear the fun with the angle of the poor camera ;-) This story will be 1 star because it's good. Unfortunately, Ti West did not spend much time to review his story. The film is more important than filming. Since you're a camera, do not mean to shoot a movie ... come. Everyone can shoot a movie, but not all. So, advise Ti West: stop and label what you want. Use your time to plan and film until everything is written into a story. Certainly, you have the abilities and desires - so do not abuse your talent.
