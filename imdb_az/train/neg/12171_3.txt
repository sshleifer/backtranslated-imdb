When I'm a Slasher movie enthusiast, I usually sit down to watch every hit movie that goes through my retinas, and sometimes it hurts my brain. Sleepaway Camp II traveled with me while watching another night. Of course, I have heard about Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I have never seen anything (I know for poverty) wanted to check it out. I will note that I have not seen the original, my criticisms should not be taken very seriously, perhaps because I think that it is completely delusional with the franchise's own design. <br /> <br /> Now, I assume that the Sleepaway Camp's franchise is a joke for itself. Hell, even the name comes as a deliberate joke. Camp bed? It's fun. I would like to thank the person who just wants to bring the film together for the cost of camping horrors, but I'm going to go. The 13th appearance of Macbeth, which was featured in this film, made it look like the original Friday. Campy requires bad action, but come. Pamela Springsteen, in fact, did nothing better than just killing a murderer in the truth, rather than killing all shots. <br /> <br /> SAC II is pretty boring, and I really wanted to keep the camp away. Deaths are clearly staged and fraudulent, so you can appreciate them. If you're looking for a slasher movie comedy with a good camp, I recommend the Club Dread. If you surf your channel, take it on you, check it, and see what else it is.
