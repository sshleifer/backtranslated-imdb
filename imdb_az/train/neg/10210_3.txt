Once it was difficult to believe that director Barbet Schroeder's prominent and very funny Maitresse (1976) and now it seems only to "excite" Hollywood with numbers. <br /> <br /> This is a lightweight John Grisham material, combined with a television movie. Bullock, Cass Mayweather, is a feisty and independent criminal investigator specializing in serial killings. I'm Chaplin, separated police partner, Sam Kennedy, and they're doing a blessing together. <br /> <br /> Together with Bullock, Bullock and Bullock, two unequal college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) and Chaplin do not spark any of the sparks, and we also have a few boring extras that reflect an important event in the history of Cass melodramatic flashbacks. Of course, the end of the OTT is a frequent shooting of the entrance cabin of a cliff that is not entirely doubtful. Oooh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See CSI any episode instead. It's a point and more exciting.
