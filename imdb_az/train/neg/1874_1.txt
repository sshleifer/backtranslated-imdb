Since I've seen short Surviving Desire in the High School, I'm a sensitive Hal Hartley fan, and she's never been fooled by the awesome brilliant "Henry Fool." <br /> <br /> "Fay Grim" along with others, "Fay Grim" is psycho-intellectualism, plain weakness and ultimately unfounded. unwanted - nihilism. <br /> <br /> The majority of new faces are unusual and weakly developed as a film: a plain character, ending the half hour of the treacherous Henry Fool, himself <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum Agent Fulbright, as we have seen, is just a brilliant character (Hartley is also considered something). How did he leave? ** SPOILER ** Dead with an automobile bombing, it's all incredibly wrong with Hartley's most sophisticated and sophisticated film so far, and tonight, in all the wrong words coming from the word. <br /> <br /> For other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or Grim?), Fay not to mention himself ... well, I will not ruin their fate, as well as the good thing about the movie, Hartley gives a stunning impression of Auteur backward as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible confusion, and is not too enthusiastic to describe it in its evil. Instead, the director's typical hipster practice is called "real world", it's ugly and less ugly than necessary and is almost ugly and enough to be close to something to say. <br /> <br /> Hartley is watching the memories of these people and the wonderful world that he has prepared for them at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I was rarely humble in the film, and I think that, <strong> From Las Vegas <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < we were glad to see at least a new character, immediately before seeing their beloved loved ones before we destroyed them.
