If it were not for bad dialogues and scripts. I would like to say that the direction was related to it. Actors acted well in bringing their characters to life. But in fact, the missing thing is a solid scenario to keep all the pieces together. I will not be afraid to watch this long ago. Whether you are a Al Pacino enthusiast like me and looking at everything you play, the result is very poor. This is the second very bad film for this actor, who knows how to play once after S1m0ne.
