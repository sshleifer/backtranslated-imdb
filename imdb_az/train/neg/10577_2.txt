Some of the film artists who took part in this series made some really great films, but heck was convinced that this series did not show much skill. Especially writing. Okay, the first season was a bit better, but these new episodes only cause sadness. I am a big fan of fears and I think most of these episodes are general garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. The lesser of them is creative. It's just the typical Hollywood crap, uninterested, childhood, ill-considered and, in some cases, ridiculous straight out. The only good thing that Crypt offers from this series, like Tales, is great nudity! Moreover, this series is a great blow. Sometimes I got the impression that they had hired the eighth graders to write episodes. Maybe I did.
