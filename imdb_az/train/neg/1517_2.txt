I wrote the title, the story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Gere and Denmark are doing their job and it's fine, although not the best. The remainder of the rest really does a very bad job. You think, it's not entirely the actors' fault. Problem Gere and Denmark are the ones that have the smallest place in the movie, which really gives depth. <br /> <br /> All the other characters have little or no place in the film to create any depth, or the toughness of character actors is a cliché that does not matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> This is a two-way filetype. First of all, this is a bad movie script. Heroes (except Gere and Danish characters), asylum seekers are clichés and the characters' actions are completely unbelievable. In addition, our writers should have an agenda that they want to bring back our ideas and ethics a hundred years ago. It's a film that some criminals are still offending, regardless of the price they give them. It also says that only movies should be punished without the courts, judges and jury. And, of course, according to the film, everything that is not sexually explicit in a missionary position by a married couple is not a sexual deviation. <br /> So if you go to school and need an example, write a bad script or write yourself a script and want an ego support. Look. I offer another movie for everyone.
