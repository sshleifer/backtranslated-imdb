After five years from the original Creepshow, another low horror was subsequently written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. There are only three stories instead of five of these times. None of the three stories are really original or different. The first story is a formidable story of a terrible stutter that concerns a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of their owners. The impressions are really inconspicuous in this story, but they are well-acquainted enough to be attractive enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the old store owners. The second story, "Raft," is the story of Stephen King. There are about four teenagers who spend the day in a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the children scream for their lives, for any reason, without any cause. However, instead of children's inexperience, children face a bad dialogue and duplicity. There are some unusual humor in this segment. The third and final story "The Hitch-hiker" is really re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, prepared by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as film noir stoppage. Then it was adapted to the episode of Twilight Zone with Inger Stevens. "Hitch-hiker" works best of these three suggestions, but this is problematic. Lois Chiles plays or thinks a cheating spouse who ends running on a ski jogger. But we do not know whether to forgive or condemn it. As in many of the central stories of this type, the characters are simply available to tell stories in twists and turns. The dressing around the story with Bullies looks a bit out of the way. Tom Savini appears in this section as "creepy." Well, there's no more sequels. 1/2 of 4 stars.
