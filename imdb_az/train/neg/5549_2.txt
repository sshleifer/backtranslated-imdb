"This is the end of a white race!" During the "Great War," many domestic zombies wandered around Europe's battlefields. An expedition prevents the city of Kennif-Angor, a long-lost, backyard to clear battlefields for good intelligent people to stop such a thing and kill tens of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> People are a little hard to talk about when it's like zombies in this movie, like a board. Until 1936, the standards in this film were bad. From the previous ten years.
