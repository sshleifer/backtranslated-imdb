I did not expect much from this movie after the terrible "Life is a miracle". Apparently, this film is ten times worse than "Life ...". The author / writer gives an impression of shock to the audience: "How much space can I give?" Dialogs are empty ... The scenario is minimalist. Photographs are really nice in a few minutes. A little sarcastic line is semi-laughable, but it is difficult to really laugh during this "comedy". I laughed at the end to watch the movie. If you can upgrade this director's fiaskos, you will play a good role in the very good performance of several legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Berchek) and Amr's son Stribor Kusturica. <br /> In brief: So bad for a great filmmaker! Emir Kusturica is still young and should give the best movies. Instead, he chooses only this for a less expensive all-inclusive approach to the for-my-private theater movie, the world's trends and old-fashioned admirers.
