There are many ideas about this movie, maybe I can not name a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART's character: 1. His name? Whip McCord (very easy, so I'll leave it, Boy, Humphrey's sound is good.) 2. His long, curly hair and silly burns. 3. Completed with the bats of Black Bartin! <br /> <br /> CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. Her lipstick does not give her any benefit. , or. 2. The man washed the hat all over the movie! Do not they find a suitable hat? Even a LITTLE? !!?! 3. His pants are very tight. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, he's hitting the smoke several times and I think. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bogart or Cagney at random, do not forget about a speed change to see them in the west, a blessing to yourself and this idea. EVERYWHERE BEAUTY GIFTS! <br /> <br /> I admit that the West is at least my favorite genre of movies, but I've seen more, it's better than this. br> <br /> At the level of a comedy, or as a high camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, avoid watching. If so, look up: a) every western view b) if you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie companion, c) any of the comments above will appeal to you. Woah ?? ..
