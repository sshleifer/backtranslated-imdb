Will they not shoot movies without nudity and sex? It arrived on Sunday afternoon at 3 pm and could not believe it. If I had seen God thankfully or mild / moderate porn because of my son, I would be shocked! The filmmakers did not know who they were betrayed or discriminated against? Children would watch after the church, and what is this? The actor was good and I enjoyed the tension but GEE! There were violence and bad guys, but this should be expected in the western film. In Randy Travis's role was really good. If writers, directors, and producers were not just put on sex scenes. Why do you have to ask him to go in that direction? Where can I complain?
