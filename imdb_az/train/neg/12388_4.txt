** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> If you can get an extremely unpleasant theme, this movie helps confuse the camp melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and torn several times over the years, although any filmmaker has been inspired by this trashy drama. None of the Hemingway women can operate here (though Mariel HAS has been improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers only a touch of the classroom as court hearing lawyer and Chris Sarandon, a pitiful, funny, piece <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson , this worker can not make a silk slipper from a headphones, it will explode with bad dialogue and ugly occasions. For example, Margaux caught his shotgun and was designed to excite the last row, where the last shock action chases down Sarandon, but instead makes a hearty giggle. Add a bustling and elegant musical account known by Michel Polnareff and you have a real guilty taste, even though you feel bad about it and you need a hot shower after watching it. Do not say you are not alert.
