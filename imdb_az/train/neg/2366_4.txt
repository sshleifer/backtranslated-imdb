I am an admirer of the Nightmare series, but it's horrible. Deaths are very fashionable. This is outdated to follow all the nintendo scenes after 20 years. I liked Flashbacks. I think they should still create a prequel when they are alive. It would be more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. How much spare time do you spend?
