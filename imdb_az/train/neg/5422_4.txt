If we do not get "noise", we're getting it to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays obsessive New Yorker, who can no longer deal with the obtrusive noises of the city, especially the car alarms. It is the only idea for a film that is worthy of a creativity like "Desire to Death". Points are clever; especially when we try to read through our hero Hagel, "I am not too smart to understand it." He reads and reads the paragraph in a mood, reads it, or does not buy it. Only one car alarm is off. Throughout the film, the constant intervention of alarms and city noise continues. Even though all of these things do little to understand our hero, it is fun to have sex with each other, allowing each of them to marry and dragging deeper into his identity. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not forget to see its voice problems, fierce editing, and the obvious boom mix. No, "noise" is not bad. William Hurt is the least colorful. At least the end is not straight. In general, it gives a logical point to the house, and you did not think it was possible. At least I did not. All this, though nineteen minutes, had not ended much sooner. This story was drifted and seemed to be lost from the start. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you can watch at a film festival, but it will probably not be for demolition. If you're really partially in the project, check on the DVD. Otherwise, skip it.
