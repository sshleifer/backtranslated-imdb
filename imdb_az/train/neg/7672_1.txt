Undoubtedly, many talented people behind the scenes have worked in this movie, so you will not only have to look after the credits, but just spend it. There were only 3 theaters in which no one was interested in seeing this movie; Two minutes later, it was 10 minutes and lucky ones. "Monsters" Star Trek 2, unemployed worms from the Khan's wrath and rejected designs for Aliend space creatures. The creator of the film obviously did not want to shadow the movie monsters in the third degree, so they launched the actors who were unable to memorize their lines or learn how to pronounce words before filming. Certain scenes, if anything, are incredibly unbearable to convey what needs to happen. If you're not good enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and if you do not, you'll be happy that you have to be afraid of the movie. The impossibility of a few scenes is surprising, and Stephen Dorff's abduction of the "Queen of Curses" gives a feeling to everyone who pays for it. If you need to see this movie, give yourself a favor and wait until the video store's bargaining room. If there is justice in the movie industry, one of the key actors will lease you.
