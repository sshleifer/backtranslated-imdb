This film, of course, has become one of the best films by Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it, and I was disappointed in the movie. For some reason, they were a movie that they really put in place. In some parts, it was so boring that I had to put forward it. There were no interesting sections like any bluffer or other films.
