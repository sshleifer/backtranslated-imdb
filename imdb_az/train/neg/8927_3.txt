Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) receives a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - Deadly Drunk) and goes like Myra (Raquel Welch). She continues to teach the history of the college movie to be operated by John Huston (do not ask) and decided to destroy men's personality (or something like that) and the young happy couple (young, beautiful, hunter Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes the THE FARHAH Fawcett). <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal produced a great novel and, of course, tried to shoot the movie. They also hired an English boy who was resolutely anti-American, and suspected "talent" (Welch, Reed) and former professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West) and all together .... SURPRISE! !! Absolutely disastrous. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the film is to release an X rating (released to R) because Welch is a really tasty scene with Rusty (Roger Herren) and Welch's work <br /> < They are sexually active with Foxcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very simple ... the scenes are skipped everywhere, and people say and do things that do not mean anything. It was not good, but never boring. <br /> <br /> The price is changing naked ... Reed is terrible ... really sad. Huston burns the scene repeatedly and forces him to repeatedly spread. Welch is not really as bad as Myra, but its lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do with it. Western film (a blessing) is not difficult, and almost 80-year-old women are sick to hear sex jokes. Roger Herren (whatever ...) was too young, beautiful and not as bad as Rusty. <br /> <br /> <strong> Favcett is good. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find what he wants to say about it. Need to see a movie - believe !!!!
