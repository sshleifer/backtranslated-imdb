This iron is one of those films that appear in cafes two in the afternoon to entertain digged housewives. The player is second degree. Poor Mathew Modine, the whole movie slept. And the god Gina Gershon helps. His emphasis is far above. It's not like a real British woman. It sounds like a player, forced and fake. A lesbian and rock band performer who plays a rock & roll band should do the best of his work. Other symbols are better. They are two-dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. How do we care for these people? At one point Christy Scott lost Cashman, in the Central Park. Really? Watching Central Park is not difficult. Just follow any path. Heroes did not pay attention to anything, and I hated them. The only reason I was filming this movie accident was Fisher Stevens. Even his majestic humor could not save this immortal Fish. Each stage is a typical romantic comedy cost and nothing surprises us. Scenario was as terrifying as a player. Take it back if you catch this fish!
