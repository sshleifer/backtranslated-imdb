An invisible killer is a very decisive situation when the early horror movie, like Boogens, appears unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Animal House's Stephen Furst was a clear ingenious product, though his performance was more comedy than horror. <br /> <br /> Three gay women (Bach, Lamm, and Lois Young), who have a very extravagant trick, can not find a hotel for the evening, but they are willing to stay with the curator of a seemingly paradise museum, played by extremely late Sydney Lassik. If you do not see any horror movie, you know that Sydney's cute IL is a psycho, so she knows what will happen to the good ladies. All three women are attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go naked as it watched Sidney bathing.
