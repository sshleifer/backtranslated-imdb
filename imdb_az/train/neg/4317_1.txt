My wife and I found this movie very shocking. It started well, but it was incredible and ridiculous. Most of the players were poor, except Abbie, who was really a terrible little girl. In addition, the dialogue was predicted and naked - especially Angelin Gideon. Also, when a tragedy occurs in a symbol without giving anything, it looks almost unusual. At first we thought it was a shock, but then we realized it was just a terrible script. Almost all of Hallmark's films and heart-warming stories, but this movie will not be one. There are so many great ones - do not waste time with this terrible movie.
