I laugh at people who praise this show as heartbreaking and tearful. <br /> <br /> How can these families protect their new mega houses? What are their poor neighbors? After all, property taxes must be increased. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how can a reality television show be too extreme? Practically recurring weekly weekly weekly. <br /> <br /> Kleenex pulls out the box. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say how much of the update is drilling. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house is, but even this segment is destroyed by false confessions and is constantly destroyed by sobbing. <br /> <br /> Extreme Makeover: Home Edition is hearty but straightforward. Skip somebody. If you want a real TV, the "Survivor" is superb and moving.
