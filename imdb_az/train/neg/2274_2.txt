Yes, I hate Hollywood, but I like cinema, because I have to watch these fragile films in the cinemas. And they hoped Vanilla Sky would be good. I hoped they would keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would do it themselves. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> I love Radiohead. I wish I had more than that. But in the end we listen to Good Vibrations by Beach Boys. Talk about many suck between them. There were one or two good songs in the club, and maybe some others, but why oh giant did not get the GV? Something confusing or obvious was more disturbing. In particular, it does not have to do with the dog. At least give some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = Primary. No matter what. <br /> <br /> He started working on the stage of the club. It was cool. Otherwise, the film was a great arrogant ball. As viewers will get the movie. Those who want to read the subtitles will not be the rest. It's just as simple. All motivations were complicated. Did not understand the diaz motivation (did not make the night before the Chicken Soup?) And others. I also hate Kurt Russell. Stay in the sea. Tom Cruise (especially Eyes Wide Shut) can not move. And lift. I'm getting it. <br /> <br /> Of course, they tried to improve the origin of the original American rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film shots and glossy processing that would help if the butterfly did not bother. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Great disappointment.
