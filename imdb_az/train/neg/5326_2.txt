"Smithereens" is a kind of nervous flick, which hangs between the cable channels that hold a place as a single romantic novel in the public library. Seidelman, a little effortless and medium-sized filmmaker, is a poor filmmaker, a bad actor, a bad actor, a bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the better movies are never in the market, and the unique lines do not go away and are one of the great mysteries of life. (D-)
