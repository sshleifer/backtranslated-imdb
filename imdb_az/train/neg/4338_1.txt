really terrible ... leading actor was ok ... movie, plot and so on. it was a totally crap and inaccurate, and there is a good result ... something has little or nothing to do with Carlitos Way ... and avoid being plagiarized by fans of any Carlito Way ... does not end with another bird, does not remind Klienfelt what he was building, not a word. .. at first they tried to set up the original with a flash back ... but when I was looking for a zero brand in the rankings I was unfortunately unlucky to be honest ... <br /> <br /> For one of the best films of the 90s, a terrible attempt that money could ... total about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action", it was really slow and predictable ... any Carltio Way fans were away from this fiasco. .
