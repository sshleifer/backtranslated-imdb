Above all, I am not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema. Because success in the form of cash is an ordinary example, underneath the waist. This film is not an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos like director and marketing ads. In my opinion, the sole purpose of this film is to earn money by touching sensible spirituality (in fact, it is taboo in the native country). Cheap populism can provide a brief description of what I mean. <br /> <However, the player is perfect. In fact, most of the rash has a theater background and worked hard to compensate for the lack of Altiok; talent! All the members of the cast were perfectly suited to their roles, and even less experienced ones. (Like Janset) At least, Altioks deserve a small assessment because they know how to choose the game. At the same time, he is not a media monkey, who is himself a director of artistic talent. Come on, art is not just a matter of dealing with naked / half naked women. As in the press, no directors will have an event in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and he is a real artifact, I'm looking forward to the next job. Hopefully this time you can get a creative approach. In short; Pros> Well-acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Consumers> Everything except casting
