In this film, I was most impressed by the lack of content. First, people were going to compare it to Rock On! but I was amazed to say that it was really worse than Rock On! Together with Salman Khan and Asin, I had to deceive myself. The music was Okay Khanabadosh's footprint, but the rest were bad! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from King's critically-buried comedy from Singh. Now, Asin was sorry for his admirer, but it was a tough time in this movie, and the dosage of the makeup did not look good! My final decision is to wait for Aladdin with your family, instead of wasting your time.
