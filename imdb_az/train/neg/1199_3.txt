This horror film is really weak ... this is the right movie I have commented on. There is nothing really terrible as a family has taken a sweet little German Shepard pupa. There was a German charm and that's a really good dog. There was no idea of ​​watching one of these films, but rather from the K-9 comedy. However, another story. This film really does not have much fears at the end of the most terrific scene and really looks like cheese. Also, we see that a boy put his hand on a grass mower. That's it. Though his family is incredibly strange, the father is suspicious of something, and when it comes to a place, they can see if they have a mirror. Despite all the television standards, a really scary film of horror ... the television movies that work in "It's Owned by the House" is pretty good and there's a good video about a woman and other weird creatures about these strange creatures. It's really boring.
