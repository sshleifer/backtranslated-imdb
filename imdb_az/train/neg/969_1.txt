For the 1970s I re-created a series of children's television series "Get Out of the Night" for this movie, though it was sometimes chaotic and stilted, but it was strange, interesting and worrying. Wood working in "Paperhouse" is a jealous joke. The clams did not aggravate the fact that I just watched a botch. The terrible dialogue that caused casting, heat, chemistry, or non-conviction was surprising. As with some of the most terrible movies, there are some good supporting acts in which these people are comforted, consoled, and confident that they will not be held responsible. <br /> <br /> "Escape to Night" was written by a person with a life experience and a subtle mind.
