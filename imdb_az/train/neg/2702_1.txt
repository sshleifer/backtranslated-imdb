Singleton has some serious problems she has to cope with. I feel he thinks he's pretty smart; But this movie is almost comic, transparent and self-righteous. In addition, there are some "can-right-right" messages like when our native Nazi crusher is defeated. I do not mean that a group of people in the right wing will turn to the Nazi gravels. However, Singleton describes the "fight" argument as illogical and seems to have meant more than ever to show superior qualities of black heroes. There is another "bad guy" (actually a drunken frat boy) who raises one of the heroes of the film. In this case, Singleton does a wonderful job of describing what a very common situation is when it's really a very extraordinary boy asking if he or she wants to use a condom or not. In any case, she has not joined her demands and, despite her wishes, engages in sexual intercourse. I think that this type of aggression is very common, and in fact, many unmarried people do not even consider harassment. <br /> <br /> How does Singleton deal with this after being harassed? When Frat tried to summon a woman, her guest room refuses to place the victim on the phone, then the frat boy calls the guest room "black table". Damaged guest room with ice cubes and so on. Appeals to his counselor, and then continues to "apologize" to the recurring and prolonged hospitality of the physically humiliating and frat boys racist expressions; However, aggression (or rather Singleton's consideration) does not mean that there is less crime. Again, no one should really apologize for the frat boy; <br /> <br /> Simply, Singleton's racist commentary appears to be sending a bogus message that later filed a criminal offense and in any case would suggest unfairness to violence. <br /> <br /> Finally, what's so frustrating that this movie is undoubtedly a talented director, undoubtedly, does not seem to pay or have the depth to make something of this magnitude, but Singleton has been about something important.
