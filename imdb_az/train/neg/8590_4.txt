Terrible. Angel's 9 year old Annakin blessed Annakin, a 19-year-old, and Amidala, a 5-year-old condolences. Now, 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has some bad emotions and takes her children, his friends and the whole frame of his existence, because a naked old man has been convinced of him: a) b. <br /> <br /> I think I will not attract the attention of those who love this film. The story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was a clever and brave plaque for the entire series, but the Climb, Annakin's leg, burns in the lava and burns it. Nobody thinks it's a little characteristic? <br /> <br /> At least I was expecting a story showing consistent character with logical motivation. There is nothing here. <br /> Yes, CGI is a very nice thing.
