I love comics. Do I have problems fully understood in the stories? The vision style is unique with all dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew why. Surprisingly, I understood the main area? but some pretty bad decisions made for the visual style. <br /> <br /> Do I want to say that the "CG human actors" approach? Why? I have never done anything! Horus and other Egyption gods were very successful in the CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors this movie could be a culprit movie. <br /> What a shame!
