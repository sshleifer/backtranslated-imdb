I bought this movie from the Gamestop discounts and got it for the 99cents of the cover, which made me smile uncontrollably. The film itself is delayed and is used as the ten different monkeys that appear to be different in all films. <br /> <br /> After filming, the chimpanzee murder is likely to commit suicide. the other low-priced Warner Bros. movie, and he earned money for the studio. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie not prepared for any reason?
