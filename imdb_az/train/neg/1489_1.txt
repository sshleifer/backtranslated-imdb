It started badly, got worse and at the end of the girl was attacked by an old lady, we took the DVD to the person we were dealing with and wanted C ** T to drown. Get away from this movie, some nice cinematography and some naked shots, would be acceptable to me at the age of 14 and did not see Jenna James a million times naked. Whenever anyone needs to watch this movie, I'm going to tell you that once you try to get Lego home to the bone, I advise you to spend your time in a more appropriate way so that it would be a good start. I hear that this is not the original version of this movie, and I really want to see the original, because this cut version is out of the field and it seems that most nudity can tell me how someone can ask me, contacted Christian Viel, it's a time of my life he owes it back!
