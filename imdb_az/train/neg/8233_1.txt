It was probably the worst movie, it was serious. I really can do better, even if it's not set up correctly. There was a $ 5 bill in this movie and left with a change. Do not follow. I did not even get all the way in this movie, and I had to extinguish it. The producer of this film, I wanted to be an amber film, but in fact turned into a bad comedy is hilarious how did 1/10. Basically, a group of girls crashed into a car and broke their lantern and the owner of that car left them. I saw a woman with a knife gun, taking all her clothes with a load of girls and what is hell? It should be a sort of cheese porn movie.
