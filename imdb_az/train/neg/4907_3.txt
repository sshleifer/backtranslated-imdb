Perfect filming, especially with Polen and Bellows - I was not impressed with the book. Or let's get back. I started to feel very sad, gradually disappointed, and I was totally disappointed and almost closed. It does not matter with the movie. For this reason. <br /> <br /> There is no "payment" in the book or movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> No, they did not do it) - interesting, exciting, and more amazing, something boring and surprising. Add that Lindsay's love finally dies (after every illness and crying in his grave) .. then cut off to where he thinks suicide .... then suddenly he died with REAL murdered after being arrested. But he turned out , he and his wife were together .... HELLO! All this has now become a "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old fashioned tension. I was deceived and extinguished by the book and watching the movie (I have to admit that it was a good way to watch TV) so she did not follow the book she created. /> <br /> I still think that the film can be watched, and for some reason, the book (or maybe just what's going to happen) does not leave you a bad taste in your mouth, but the story has not been settled.
