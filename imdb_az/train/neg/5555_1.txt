Normally, I like the low budget gonzo movies, but I feel it's a terrible stranger to Darkman III to feel nothing for me. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a television show, too. The sets are sparse, light, the score and the effects are indivisible and the camera park is the 101st movie school. There is no space for talking, the characters are dimensioned, and the actors are sleeping. Most of the rash should work with soft core porn ..... In fact, the only award I received from this mess is Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from "Star Trek: Voyager") without the makeup of his Klingon. The tone of her skin is more lighten than the two wheels from Voyager; or bleached for this role or mixed for the Voyager. Very strange way.
