I remember that Samurai was a bottle for my squirrel. Although I am a "elitist" like the change of the Seven Samurai or the bloody comic book like Lone Wolf and Cub, I have not been more distinguished. I liked the US / Japanese "Crossovers" like Bushido Bladei. And of course everything Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And almost every Samurai was watched at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I watched the first Kabuto video, and even the Samurai movies could be boring. From the very beginning, I was expecting Maye to come to Europe and to confront it, but when I came to Spain, I did not really care about the film. <br /> <br /> Film justice can not be called "bad". Technically a genuine entry. But it's just not calm enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor, and is committed to the character of the above mentioned Japanese actors. While talking about Shane Kousgis son Kane, who appeared in Sho Kosugi films, Sho did not have limited acting skills for his fathers. Connection to the negative points is the lack of blood until all the Samurai films are trademarked. <br /> <br /> This is for the US-European audience. <br /> <br /> It's almost a matter of time for an average story-action-adventure fan, but many times for the admirers of Samurai's cinema. Admirers of the genre "Samurai meet" should go to more red Sun (1971) and show Charles Bronson as a cowboy. Samurai Toshiro Mifume, Alan Delon, who takes the sword of Samurai, the evil man. <br /> <br /> So if the movie is only 100 minutes, it looks like a longer movie. <br /> <br /> That's why I gave 4/10 points instead of 3/10: For the first time I saw this movie and saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version Kosugi can really be understood. I must admit that "Engrish" gets tired after about 30 minutes, though it is sometimes funny.
