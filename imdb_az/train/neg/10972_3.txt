There was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. This was a great confusion. The film wanted to be a decisive, nervous laugh, a city-confirming film, but this camera was more shaky and messy. It's easier than immitating something else than creating a real story with real characters. From the very beginning, I could not take less care of heroes or what I was doing. I always fought, they gave each other light or weeping. They just did not have any substance for what they did. Dialogue between character, hip, is intended to be detected instead of excessive, and something other than a scene is unexpected. I do not know if there is a really loving audience in this movie, so I can be wrong.
