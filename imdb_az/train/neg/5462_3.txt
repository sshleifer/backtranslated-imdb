This application makes me bugs! There is no humor for this, and it's not too serious to call it fun! I have a very distant education because I like it! The heroes are very stereotyped and rich. Fields are unnecessary and morality repeats repeatedly. Where is the entertainment here? I feel like I'm at BBC for a similar time and it is broadcast very often. When a new show comes out of the episode, really need a slot every 2 or 3 months on T.V? I think the BBC came back with some of the great shows like Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons, and Count Duckula, not only to make continuous contracts on these new shows! I thought of the BBC that brought my Danger Mouse back, so what happened? 3/10
