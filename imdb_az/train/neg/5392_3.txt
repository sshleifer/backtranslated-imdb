"Carriers", using the two boys and two roses in the stolen Mercedes, watches the car with the words of the main road warrior down the road to the beach with strainers. Brian ("Star Trek" Chris Pine) driver and Brian's younger brother Danny ("Fanboys" Lou Taylor Pucci) and his friend - his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo "Coyote Ugly") has a girlfriend - Kate (Emily VanCamp "Ring 2") rear seat. Twentysomething characters live in this quartet a nightmare. As you can see, viral pandemic - co-directors and co-writers Alex Pastor and David Pastor have not said anything to us - they have devastated the United States. Naturally, the exposure shortage cuts at least fifteen minutes of signals, which could slow down this cynic melodrama of turning into malpractice and being the worst enemies. <br /> <br /> This deadly virus is chained to you, and then you die with blood and blood. Most of them are working with a thin rubber tape to wear white masks woven from their nose and mouth. At the outset, these four people are faced with their unlucky father, Frank ("Runaway Bride" Christopher Meloni), and his beloved little daughter Jodie ("Land of the Lost"). Brian moves around Frank while trying to get them off, but in this process, Mercedes explodes and they stand up. If you want them behind the SUV behind the Jodie engine, they'll take you to Frank. Nose and mouth are masked and masked with blood. Frank heard and directed the doctors at the hospital. Unfortunately, someone begged Frank. The hospital doctor will be able to get rid of Kool-Aid for the last few children. Treatment did not improve. Everyone in the city died. Kate works hard to get a dial tone on every phone. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Div> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> The sympathetically murdered killing to protect themselves people are. They reach another country and run to a golf course, with the fourth pump-shotgun, suits and masks. In an incredible way, our heroes succeed in escaping, but when Brian immediately falls into a waterfall, he fears. Finally, one of them finds out that he is infected. Later, Brian, Frank, blocked the way to avoid gas. Danny is trying to stop an old Christian woman driving the car. Danny says pregnant wife wants to give birth and needs help. Brian takes care of the wind and extends to the ladies with automatic pistols when he refuses to help them. Brian holds a bone from her passerby, but kills her. No, "Carriers" is not a snack or pizza movie, or humor is virtually non-existent because you can laugh or laugh. At the end of this 84-minute film, our heroes have turned into carers who care for themselves and their situation. Chris Pine, like entertaining Brian, is the only impression, and his energetic performance is the only reason for hanging on this guy, and only the other well-known actress Piper Perabo is an unusual girl friend. Like Bobby, it's a mistake to show compassion to a young girl who is not dead and pay a very bad price. This is an indication that Pine can change its character so it can keep itself in front of others. In fact, Pine has the only role she can give her a jealous man for a lucky guy to go to a happy eighty happy. <br /> <br /> Two directors are Spanish brothers, and they never allow the flag to accelerate. Since there is no comfort in the eyes, "carriers" are immersed in predictability. "Irréversible" cinematographer Benoît Debie is doing a fantastic job with wide screen lensing, and Debie appears as a dynamic movie. Along with a happy ending or closing in any sense of the word, Carriers suffer from this terrible silence. The scene, similar to the German shepherd's most intimidating Danny's attacks, could have been even corrected. Unfortunately, Pastor brothers do not scare too much tension or tension. Fade-out really does not care what happens to anyone.
