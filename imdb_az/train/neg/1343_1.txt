We bought this movie from a store called Poundland. <br /> <br /> We were looking for more inspiration since we bought the movie No Big Deal earlier. <br /> <br /> Since we were able to repeat this movie and put it on the pipe, we were expecting this movie to be a good inspiration. ADDITIONAL, it was shocking. BORING is the key word that comes to mind. Bad effects and scripts are not enough for you to watch it. The body of the mother-woman appears to have been whipped in a miserable moment of interest to her followers. But they are just surprised, do they throw off their budget? If so, I asked for a refund! It looks like a home movie, even though the shooting does not fit even one another, and the camera is an amateur who professionally portrays the very bad movies. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism. There is no word to describe how terrible it is.
