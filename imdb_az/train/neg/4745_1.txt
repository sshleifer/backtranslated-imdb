I can not say that this movie is terrible. Because of the hard purchase of your ancestors, all the Chineseyeness is awakened in your presence. But the audience knows that every Chinese is much more fun than Chinese history. <br /> <br /> This is the story of every American in America without learning the history of the United States or anywhere in the Philippines. It's like telling what you know. <br /> <br /> This story is hearty. Tin talked about a thing from Bejding - a monastery in China. However, the early sequence of the film shows a map of Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to have areas like Mongolia. But a different nation and even the map of Mongolia writes. Disney Studios 5th grade geography failed? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is at the best level and is still bound by it. His teachings are also cheesy. And, let's cut it to the pursuit: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. <br /> <br /> Taekwondo movement has not played and has not been realized in many cases. <br /> <br /> The bad thing was a cheese. However, the latter leftist would be a single thing in this regard. They left their evil eyes closed. But instead of a bad defeat. Yee! <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is not worth the time for the dog. Brenda Song should be related to another studio. "F"
