I bought this movie for $ 5 and I'm very glad I used the CD. I'll begin by saying that I'm a big fan of my darling horrors. They provide a cheerful, delightful, cheap entertainment. This movie was fun in the first half an hour because it could have been very fun in the MST3K style. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying part of the film. Despite the great anticipation, it was ridiculously filthy and honestly provided all the fun. This is the side of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie shows many ways: "What is"% @ $ @ # "? moments. There are many moments in which the mother has a strange adaptation to eating, and then there is no result in the film. Throughout the meal, the responsible person thought that everyone would enjoy eating five minutes without eating a meal every time they ate dinner. During the meals and other unpleasant moments, it stays out of the dark outside of the scene. Then, when it comes back and forth in the darkness, one of the most funny parts of the film is the night, not the night when it does not rain. Speaking of the darkness, a big problem with the movie is something that is so weak that you can not see what's happening in half an hour. This is more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> style = "color: red;"> You do not even have to say something in the light scene, even seeing something so shocking. <br /> <br /> As for climatic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. People say, "Wow, I'm surprised and that's good." We can say that the big picture was surprising, because I did not see it. The reason I did not see him was that he did not give me any meaning. I will not destroy you, but I'm telling you that my friend and I have spent a good twenty minutes in different parts of the movie that will not confirm the truth of anything and everything we found was more than that. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is really good when watching it with entertaining tracks. I love a horror movie like that, but it was a lot.
