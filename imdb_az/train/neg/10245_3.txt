I expected a lot from this movie. It was like a Naustradamous caracter like Lee, but instead of spending my whole time and was a boring movie. I can not explain this movie. From the Bible, he wrote terrible, wood-moving, terrible waves and earthquakes. But that was the end! I have to wait for the rest of this and I hope it would be meaningful, but it did not do it. This film is about a pair of people who are trying to learn about changes in the world like earthquakes somewhere in the world and where there are eight monks and a monastery prepared by a monk. The key to preventing errors. All movies are missliading and boring. One of the worst.
