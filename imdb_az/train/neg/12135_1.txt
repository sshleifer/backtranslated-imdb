Even though it's been 2 years, I remember the full wastes covering the entire film. Unfortunately, after my friends, I came across this movie and chose it while looking through the new releases in Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only thing we saw and sounded like unpleasant sound. Although it has been a long time since watching the movie, I still remember that it did not prove that the movie was being spent (there was no serious, no real space). You are in the video store and get a movie and get a better movie when it's yours. If you have not seen this movie, I understand the pain :)
