Why is this movie so bad? Yes, if it were so stupid and unfounded, that's the film. Corky Romano's character is in the worst case the best and obviously desperate. Gags is predictable, but that's not bad. <br /> <br /> Corky Romano tries to behave properly, but talks about a soft-tempered vet that's so calm. His quiet life is thrown out for a loop when the family, which once accused him, now needs to infiltrate the FBI to destroy his family's traces of crime. However, because Corky is not that easy, the FBI reassures him to be a super agent and carries out spying tasks in your own family. After mishaps and mayhem, but it does not really feel like there is no comic hijixn. <br /> <br /> Scarcely ends with a beautiful FBI affiliate and has to make a record with both the FBI and her family to get back to rest. <br /> <br /> I think the irritant is also a leading actor and supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals the excitement limitations and actor because his note slapstick goes straight to the film for 10 minutes. Not just a full mute, slap stick is okay with a full movie based on humor. Kattan's SNL supporter, Ferrel, Ferreyel, made his full career. The difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrelin knows when he'll pick it up and trust another way of talking to a joke. There is no difference in Kattan's diary. <br /> <br /> The other issue of the film was really original and lack of FUNNY jokes. Gay Mafia Brothers, angry pupils and other forgetful jokes are not as funny as it is for the first time. As scriptwriters did, it was more fun than writing. The jokes start with some comedy-fun toy (Chris Penn, Peter Falk). There is no chemistry. This movie was clear to actors for pocket books. No corpse was concerned about it, and even tried it. It's a sad thing, no corpse to Chris Kattan.
