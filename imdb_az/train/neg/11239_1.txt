Pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who give positive comments about this movie need to get royalty. This is all terrible film. Imagine a video of a space / comedy where middle school children can not create any money or imagination. This will give you a D. The college wanted kids to get a F or to leave school. I believe that this monster should be trained by the "Professionals", or at least a film trial. I liked watching bad movies like "Plan from 9 Outsiders", but this does not fall into a category. Scenario, movement, voice and leadership are very bad, which is virtually inevitable. You enjoy watching the bad movies, Ed Wood, a blaxploitation or a fun stick with the 1970s horror movies. After seeing this, you get a half-life experience.
