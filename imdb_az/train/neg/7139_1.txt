Redline is a fast and strange jerk, with no payout quality. There is no need for a contradictory field with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING! This is the equivalent of a movie, where the story and dialogue occur at the end of 60 seconds and at the same time. Not only is it bad, you will not be able to value your money. Mind-numbingly bored, impossible race arrays, and expensive gorgeous cars, a horrible loss of access to negative points as it appears in this movie. Of course, she is hot, but who is hopeless for a woman on a screen? I feel like he is sitting as a director with a hat and a snail full of snacks, and every time he opens the scenes, he shakes 8 balls. A serious guy who does not know anything about racing or something about watching this movie and taking the racing scenes.
