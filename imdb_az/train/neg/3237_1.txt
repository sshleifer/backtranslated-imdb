Despite the shedding of genuine blood, I'm not upset, but when I put a DVD while waiting for a blood lake and I took it to a bloody scene, a desk chair, "43 minutes of my life has gone forever" . I do not think this or Flesh and Blood Flower "movie" will do a single implementation; See if you are sitting among them. Flesh and Blood flower had some challenging spots. Satan did not have the experience. The best, the stupid and the worst ... well ... it was really stupid. Perhaps, my expectations were high. I've put DVDs on 'man, this will be sick'. <br /> <br /> In this film, two types of people would be interested. <br /> <br /> Therefore, 1) Only F'd people are looking for F'd's really, or 2) The horror is over. I was looking for this and other Guinea pig films for the last reason, but if I fall into the category of the past, this movie would not bother me. In fact, I can imagine this movie by boosting the joy of blood ... "DO NOT KNOW THAT IT IS USED!" Thus, the specific cause of this film is for collection purposes. If you want massacres that do not provide the traditional horror, get traces of death. Of course, it also sucks, but at least you will get blood and the gaps that you expect. <br /> <br /> This shit is a reason I can see for everyone to praise, because they are thinking of themselves. I can not understand artistic morality, no reason, no reason, nothing. An attempt to enter into just a nagging shock.
