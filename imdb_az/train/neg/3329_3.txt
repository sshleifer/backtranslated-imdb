Take your main Frankenstein flask, do not shoot some Reanimatoru (but good parts) and have Dr. Hackenstein. Of course, it was inspired by the above-mentioned films, but never had materialized as something unique. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie is to revive his wife overnight. <br /> <br /> To revive her husband, she decides to cut off the body parts of some trapped women, and it is accidentally decided to stay overnight. <br /> It does not focus. Everything here is very standard. The smaller attempts at the spider actually work (check the scene when Hackenstein keeps his deaf assistant, because he would have been disappointed if he seized a woman and needle), but it's not hard to suggest this movie. The music is good, what is worth the blood, and the castle looks very good. And for half of the half I enjoyed this movie. But I'm never never. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
