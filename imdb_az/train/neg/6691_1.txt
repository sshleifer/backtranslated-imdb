MY HEARTS! THOSE WHO ARE NOT GOOD IN THIS TEMPLE AND THAT THE TIME OF HAMASIN! What's the drug? this can be the best movie! I felt as if I had a badly acidic trip, and I should call a therapist to help deal with this epic disaster. The ropes that end in the beginning are an unusual work of satanic cinema. when we thought of watching this movie with my Jewish best friend and family, "oh hey, it might be laughable! It would probably be bad but still a little laughable". can be a movie. All of my friends got into the lobby for the film after the film was over and during the movie, one of my friends tried to hang himself through their belt, and both tried to cut their wrist with a wooden spoon. If I watched my video, pain and suffering would end in just seven short periods of time. It is ready for everyone who wants to see this movie! you might think that you are a kind of "difficult person" for this hire, but this movie breaks you, pushes you to the ground and lures you.
