When I see this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. As you can see, the stars of the stoats sound, and they really do not take part in the show. First, they were split into two groups - Moe, Shorty, and Larry and Curly, as there are not many full-team jobs. The story of a burning love story is uninterested, two ladies are capable of any movement, and there is another music stooges group without taking into account the attempts to get upset sadly. Music is elegant, carries cars to cars and then looks like horses, dorky western wear is foolish, and there are many films that have no stooges on the camera. By the way, this is clear from Curley's first stroke and its reduced energy level. Vernon Dent plays an indefinite role. I liked all these kids, including Curley's stuff, but this little dog was very enjoyable.
