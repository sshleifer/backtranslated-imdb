I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (after Peter Pan 2 and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and Notre Dame 2 Hunchback). All these films are prepared with the same mind; Because the film has no area, they try to do it by filling with jokes. I was not bad at jokes, but they are the most part of the film. For the first time I saw the movie, I would give it 1/10. But now I think that most kids do not think how good the original film is, they just think the movie is fun. I still think the film is bad, but that's not terrible. Now I think 3/10.
