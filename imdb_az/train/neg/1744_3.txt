In 1985, the Malaysian film was watched by a long-time Boeing Boeing (also inspired by the same English film). Garam's story is the same as the story's mainstream story, but it's a shameless way of explaining that it's funny jokes that replace normal ones in Indian movies (likely the director is tasteful to the Indian audience). <br /> <br /> I have never seen the English original. But on the one hand, the comedy, the Malayalam movie (prepared by Priyadarshan) really enjoyed it. Of course, Mohanlal, Mukesh, and Sukumari's (playing the role of cooking) were natural and spontaneous. I know that I too missed Malayalam movie, remake his Hindi. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John have overcome Ibrahim. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job, but does not reach anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But all this is comparable to the latest Indian animated films.
