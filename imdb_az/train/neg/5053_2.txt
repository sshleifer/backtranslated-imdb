<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I read another investigation that killed a Polish, talked to narcotic substances and that a man who spoke the rubbish was an unexploded marine era. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with this, because the film is actually <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> the best . He really wanted to show that not only the war had resulted in death, but also that it was traumatic on the survivors. Unfortunately, the movie looks like "fame" in this regard and, as I like the big finals, champagne, heroism and Oscar hunting are in the form of a "permanent image". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stone and other filmmakers, who simply can not understand the concept: war is an injustice or immoral war, war is not a GOODNESS and GOOD IMPROVEMENT. At the same time, we came up with Iraq. If you had lost your fault, I would have put it openly: If you see the world war really bleak and you see how devastating it is in the lives of the surviving soldiers, was it an unjust war? If this does not convince you that this is just an unfair war, the images of the horrors in Vietnam will make you happy why it is wrong to go to war in this situation. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to the Vietnam War, but of course, I do not agree with the theory that these people are wrong war, people are dead and suffer. <br /> <br /> It does not say that the last and last big "twist" is a little foolish. However, this Stones is not the first oddball march. Wall Street was a spectacular movie, up until the last 30 minutes or when it was a terrible "wrong turn". <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, the JFK film was very well finished. <br /> <br /> But there was not enough structure to bend to this point of the film. And that's why I gave that low mark. In fact, the story and almost disappointment - until you make a whisper of yours.
