I live in Salt Lake City and are not Mormon, why did I rent this movie? Probably, I live in Utah and it would be nice to see the places I know in the movie. I really did not want to get jokes inside, I was not surprised when I looked at the lanterns. I was surprised by the uncomplicated Mormon moves in this movie. <br /> <br /> I know that there is a Mormon film delivered to members of the LDS Church, but I apologized for that negativity. it is a typical stereotype that does not have their faith. <br /> <br /> Why have I really been forced to do this movie, they kept the Mormons so clean, but all the others were defeated. I think they're just punk psychos because they do not obey the LSL Church books in Utah. <br /> <br /> I can understand that circuits around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City is 100% Mormon, and this is not true. As I said, non-Mormons who were not in the movie were described as drunken bites! <br /> <br /> I think I can not get it because I'm not part of their faith and I will never.
