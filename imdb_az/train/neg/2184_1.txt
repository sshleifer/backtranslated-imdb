<br /> <br /> The story of the film: The director of this movie was a devious man who shot around casual women. After spending time with her husband, she had to write a quick story. He claimed that he was filming a "dead brain." Finally, her husband demanded her to show her "movie." That night, he took several extra scenes with a friend and was born "Brain of the Dead". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Table Synopsis: The main character is killed in a terrible accident (because it does not pay close attention to road signs clearly). He takes his head off the rubble and revives it. She goes after her head and takes a brothel. For the rest of the film, this is pretty much the case. Finally, he fights and is killed by a secret monster. The monster seems less visible without any explanation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <span style = "color: red;"> /> <br /> I hate this movie!
