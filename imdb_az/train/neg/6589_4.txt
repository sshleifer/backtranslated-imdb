I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. A few savings are nothing to write home to without the manuscript. <br /> <br /> J-horror has accelerated for the past five or six years, but multiple copies of films have carbon copies of routine and previous successes. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a supernatural slasher movie. From the very beginning, a dead girl's eyes promise a horrible scene from the morgue where she touches each other, but soon opens them. <br /> <br /> In some countries, one has to respect and respect. Moreover, there are many visual abilities and great for the type of movie. For those who love horror movies, there are several beautiful scenarios of crime (not murder). <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the US Embassy in Azerbaijan reports that the plot is jumping and jumping over time and with an exciting intensity. <br /> <br /> It's not a problem for me, but I've been here several times in places where students are exactly the same, regardless of their age. <br /> <br /> I think the audience is hard to say when you do not know a language, but it looks a bit rigid. And I do not think it's scary enough for a horror movie. For a while, I really missed it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more from the nightmare, the admirer of Giallo movies, but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed.
