To make a good movie, you need an excellent player or a great director. You need at least two. <br /> <br /> My wife does not have this in mind. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the director's name. He did not do much in his career. I love Donald Sutherland, but he plays a major role in the film. It falls short. Sutherland is a very good movie in a movie that is no more than 15 minutes. For example, Sutherland spoke with Oliver Stone at JFK, without hesitation talking to Kevin Costner on the podium of almost a 10-minute park. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan: "Sutherland is not the main actor in the film" He is good for a television series. The DVD is awesome. Terrible colors. Terrible light. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follett story was good, but unfortunately he turned it into an uninteresting movie.
