They set up a fantasy type. Man meets Butch Cassidy and Sundance from the Snowy River, and Ned and Joe play a high-level talent, with the boring young women of the elderly, for a romantic touch. Well, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are many well-documented truths, yet there is room for artistic creativity in a good historical dramatization. I do not mean that this is not Robin Hood's, but Arthur's legends, not Beowulf, but a life of many centuries, not a person who lived in the past, about 99 percent of any vacation and time. It's just a few lifetimes before. My nephew and grandfather were already school-age when Ned hung. <br /> <br /> So, this film was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. As I read Peter Carey's novel "Kelly Gang's True History," I thought it would be like a dam. <br /> <br /> Many works by Mick Jagger in 1970 were really close to the truth and were a better movie. Two dollars to get a DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and this is just some of the beautiful shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
