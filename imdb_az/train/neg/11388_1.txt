This story is about romantic triangles nth. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, this is a French waitress who is a dancer, scary and depressing, mysterious or smoky, an African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a French waitress. There is badly burnt in the winter or where everyone is bathed with a strange blue luminesscence. Yes, I know that white balance has come out. Everyone is faded and down and looks dark, dark and dirty. The corpses are very dense and weak, with a violet. Moles, fatty hair. Load. <br /> <br /> What is the true meaning of life? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. When all three characters return to the Stephanie's home, we see a small group of frustrated green fields and nearly bad weather, and see Stephanie's childhood as a child named Pierre. Mother dies. Well ... and that's true, really. The development of the character is kept at a minimum level, such as denial of the story. <br /> <br /> My wife, I love it. <br /> <br /> My wife gets money for me. <br /> <br /> This movie should wait for me to join the trial and to contaminate my hands. <br /> <br /> This film is, first of all, a desirable ambitious trash meeting. epater les bourgeois (look shock). I can see what's happening for the Berlin Film Festival and I can see why it does not have any place.
