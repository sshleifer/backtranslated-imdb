David Lean's worst movie. Even "We Serve" was so bad. Usually a film with such a good reputation is a good quality that understands at least some classic thinking. However, after watching it, I could not get the love of such a body in 1945! Composion, upper lip English behavior, story, scenario (sometimes quite witty, totally unfnny) and soundtrack can be. The character of Elvira means attractive and attractive, but in reality it was ugly and it was a strange and shocking sound. Another movie I believe to rely on of a film's reputation. Another very overrated "British classic".
