Most episodes in season 1 are terrible. They do not really compare with Twilight Zone or External Restrictions, because they are really worthy story lines. Amazing Stories are very dull ... at least incredible .. get stairs or Twilight Zone series ... better than I've heard of Season 2 in this series ... For some reason, they cut the Ray Walston parts further. It's a cool thing to see actors and actresses when they're younger in 1985 ... Although most of the story lines are much anticipated, the series would be better off with curiosity curling and turns ...
