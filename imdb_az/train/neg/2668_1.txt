do not rent this movie. (English), but has nothing to do with escaping death. I do not think a good thing to say about the movie. Poorly functioning, poorly adjusted, weak focusing on ... ridiculous "ammunition" and sound / music was very uncomfortable, this is a miracle that does not come with a warning label. The only way to sit and enjoy this movie is its historical leakage quality. They do not take these bad movies anymore.
