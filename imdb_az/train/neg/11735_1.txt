This movie really made me crazy, because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've been living in Iowa for 29 years and I know there is no south accent here. This movie is not about a man who meths and I do not know what's supposed to be about a true plot or movie. It's pretty graphic medicine use, and it's really insulting to see people using meth as well as sugar. Metam has lost my brother, and this movie makes me sad, because it is glamorizing the drug. The film uses this drug, but I'm happy when the boy almost passed on to the state line. And I know that women who have been subjected to traumatic aggression do not want to give love to their husbands or husbands the next day. The film is wrong in all directions. If I would offer a movie about drugs, I would suggest the "Basketball Diary".
