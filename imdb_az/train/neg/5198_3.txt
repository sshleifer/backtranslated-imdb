This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can not remember when I see a worse incident. I was thinking about this plane crash investigation. What really was a soap opera and something worse than that. They overstressed the "conflict" card. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler * The "Memorial" scene (with black umbrellas and rainfall), which is about 40 minutes away, was naked to the imaginary victims and I did not think it would never end. <br /> <br /> <strong>
