Before the trilogy of Peter Jackson, I could give a higher rating to this movie, but when I look both, there is simply no comparison. The speed of this movie runs, there are many important scenes in the book, and there is little character development. Animated is a strange blend of painted live action scenes I find in traditional cartoon shooting and excitement. And the most disappointing thing about this film is that it's broken in the middle of the story and it's never finished. There are some good points - exciting to watch battle scenes and focusing quite a lot of dialogue on the book. If you are in a hurry and can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy, follow this. But you have not read a book, you probably will be mistaken, because it's missing a lot of this version. From 10 to 4.
