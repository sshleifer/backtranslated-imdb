In SÃ£o Paulo, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel, upper middle class teenagers, join the university and go to a drug and salt party on the eve of the opening class. The next day, after the morning, Cristiano comes home the night before and raped three girlfriends. The girl dies, gets shocked and decides to get rid of her body, but Cristiano's mother comes and surprises Jabriel and breaks her neck and makes her jewelry. <br /> <br /> The trio decides to throw and burn the corpses into a trash can, but other tragedies occur during the night. Polemic and embarrassing "Cama de Gato" is a very ambitious pretext for the alienation of young people, and is the worst Brazilian movie I have ever seen. The surface, tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy. The scenario begins with foolish lines and dialogues, fun, manipulative, and foolish videos, and ultimately it is not funny to talk with adolescent teenagers. The player, on the contrary, is improper with many improvisations, but with no talent and I'm disappointed with the presence of promising Caio Blat in this garbage. Camera, frame, cinematography and publishing are amateurish and have very low quality. The sound is terrific and it is impossible to understand that actors and actresses are talking in many places (probably after the whisper). Gang bang is used to promote this mediocre film in a very poor marketing of very realistic and charming exploits. <br /> <br /> Headline (Brazil): Cama de Gato (Cats Bed)
