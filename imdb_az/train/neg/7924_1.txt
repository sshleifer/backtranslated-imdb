Ted V. Mikels's film, Corpse Grinders 2, is 103 minutes of exciting filmmaker. The area is a mixture of numerous business contacts between those who want to take some of these cats, dogs, aliens, and foreigners who want to tear their corpses into cat food. <br /> <br /> When I was watching this movie, I started looking for all sorts of fun, and I think I did something else to make sure of myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not want to use very often jumps, and they are afraid that they will be surprised by their audience. I am not sure whether this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "foolishness". We can accept that, except for the elderly men who are the custodians of the plant, I have not cared for any of the unnecessary big symbols. Most of the cast is a group of talented amateurs who are not inclined to learn words before reading the "Camera Songs". <br /> <br /> Perhaps, though, when I looked at the DVD, 80% of the dialogue was heard, even though sin was the poorest sound quality. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie shot ever to be shot. Listen to the comments, and Mr. Mikels appeared surprisingly cute as an old man, what was the hell of making such garbage? I would like to hear the explanations of elderly people who have to lie on a metal conveyor belt waiting on the ground. The movies that I have long hated will look much better. I wish the exciting music of Excalibur and the sequential lighting of the Dawn of the Dead. Something to do, something. Do not watch this movie.
