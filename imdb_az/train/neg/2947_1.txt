There were a large number of films that managed to sit. I did not do it through Battle Field Earth. But this is one of the worst films to be made. I know that Whoopi Goldberg tried to do it. I do not blame him. I was ashamed to have a resume too. In a film, it is rare that almost every eyebrows fall flat on his face. It's good. Look for dino with control cables that do not want to talk about SFX! Half of the film was still looking for a plot. I have never found it. Do not rent yourself and protect yourself from the 90 minutes of your life.
