"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his very bad life was well documented. This film, which aims to describe her life, should use a fictional character because overdramatized events are stronger than facts and chronology. However, some other interesting details, such as the public relations bias and its conversion to neutral NY, are not taken into account. True, he was executed by Luciano, Lansky and the meat. take it but it lasts so long. Lucian's explosion booth, which performs Bo Weinberg's work in his own home, helps his mother. In addition, there is a scene from the Netherlands that the Legs Diamond is about to pay for its protection. This does not just work. The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer is also not working. There is no need for a Greek Jewish mother for this funny relief. Legged Diamond's naked representation was pretty humorous. I am sure that a man turns to his grave. By the way, the Dutch actually killed people, but it's not Rambo or 007. It is absurd to clean the brewery. I dont know. Maybe it was a comedy and I could not get it.
