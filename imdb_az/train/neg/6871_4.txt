A great concept went wrong. Poorly functioning, worse writing .... After watching the first two episodes, I asked why why wondering why the second season of the season? Characters are forgotten, writing is weak, sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - at the same time a much better job has been done - where is the place where the money came from? The first episode is interesting, then goes fast at speed - the whole show is committed. Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of Sci-Fi and "geek", but this show just does not cut it. As I said at the start, I was really amazed at the second season of this season - after a season (like Jake 2.0) it was better canceled. This show was just bad.
