<strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Earlier in the late 80's watch and watch the most awesome thing I've ever done for myself. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography delights. Czech parameters are really striking. Political warranty is attractive but, unlike similar "historically defined" stories (eg, Zhivago_ (qv)), the story of politics, Olin and Binoche are wonderful. But this movie even manages to make plodding and slow "erotic" scenes. I am full of romance, but this movie was very boring, and I was hoping to hit all the Russians and put an end to sorrow. <br /> <br /> I would like to read a book, but I'm sure the story would be a bit more logical. However, life is more time consuming.
