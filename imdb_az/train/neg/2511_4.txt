Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) is a good-natured man to live and enjoy life in the 1950s, but tries to combine his scientific findings (Ryan) with the usual guy Tim Robbins about Albert Einstein (Matthau). Einstein wants Robben to love Robbins and look for Robbins to be a brilliant scientist. The idea is very sweet, but with film lizard situations and horrific dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the awesome supporter, do their best to pull this foolish comedy, but they can not save the movie. His unfortunate being began to create an unfortunate film. I will not advise anybody if they are not a big fan of Meg Ryan.
