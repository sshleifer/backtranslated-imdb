A good movie with a good lady, but a terrible leader. Her husband, Stephan Jenkins, is a really bad player. On the other hand, Joyce Hyser is the grace of the film. <br /> <br /> Note that for the movie you read for the first comment, which reads praise to the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account - is a plant). <br /> <br /> "The Art of Crimes" is a fair film, but it is a great confusion. Although the film has a good shooting, it is a large or other hypobolic illustration that is not relevant to anyone. It offers every sexual situation, but it does not go any farther. <br /> <br /> While watching Skin Flick at Cinemax, but with all the "nasty bits". <br /> <br /> The film is a little bit off the top and ends, and most of the third act is really a great confusion. <br /> <br /> <strong >
