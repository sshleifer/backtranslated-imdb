Today, and the age of incredible special movie effects, this was a disappointment. The actors seemed to be tough and discriminating as the dialogue. Westerners are not something for Hollywood so far, but Silverado's films know exactly how one of them will be. I think everyone will not be able to come to freedom at all, and it creates a similar film. See if you are looking for a good and good western!
