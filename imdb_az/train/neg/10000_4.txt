The airport '77 new luxury 747 aircraft is loaded with precious paintings and is owned by a wealthy businessman Philip Stewart and is open to the public as he prepares for a VIP support. The museum has a daughter, Stevens Julie (Kathleen Quinlan) and his son. The luxury jetliner comes out as planned, but is isolated by the pilot Chambers (Robert Foxworth) and his two assistants, who are hi-jacked by the banker (Monte Markham) and Wilson (Michael Pataki), who beat the passengers of the airplane in mid-air, isolating gas, precious loads and soils they plan to steal an airplane used on an island, but when its true meadows occur, it crashes into an oil rig in the ocean and loses control of the airplane for the lower right bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. Shorter supplies accelerate problems for the firefighting unit during a firefight while escaping with water in the air and over 200 miles away ... <br /> <br /> Also slightly different tile at the airport in 1977, Smash-hit disaster thief The Aerodrome (1970) was directed by Jerry Jameson and still can not say the same as the predecessors. Airport '77 is a forgotten classic type, right reasons. One of the three airports I've ever seen I really liked this one. This is a beautiful mid-air hi-jacking with my favorite airport and then flooded by the famous disaster fires and floods of the Poseidon Adventure (1972), which later dubbed 747 (perhaps the builders trying to move the original airport) to another place it is a bad idea, which can lead to drowning or drowning when the air misses or drowning as a flood, or any door opened and a great deal of disaster frustration, but it's a bad idea to have incomplete characters, peaceful dialogue, lethargic sets, , lack of note or tension is a missed opportunity. Although a very boring plot has 108 minutes of fun, there is not much to do after the plane crash, and it's not as urgent as I think. Though they are engaged in sea fleet, they can not buy much with large ships and several helicopters flying, but there is nothing here. <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The head of the World Trade Organization, George Kennedy's furious anchor, Joe Patroni returns only a few scenes, and only the back says something that prefers to be worried about the plan. <br /> The US television series adds more scenes, including a new opening credit line, with George Kennedy as Patroni, more scenes, character, longer rescue scenes, and discovery, or some other dead bodies. navigator I would like to see these extra images, but I'm not sure if the airport can sit with a close-up of '77 '. As expected, the film has come to the forefront with terrific fashion and interior design options, and nothing else is better than the toy model model. Along with the continuation of the other two airports, the Razzie Awards are held in the Hall of Fame, although I can think of films that are too bad, so it's a little bit tougher. Unfortunately, the action scenes are a bit boring, the pace is slow and there is a lot of excitement or tension, so if it were a good movie, I think it's shame <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actor is not great, Oscar winner Jack Lemmon twice said that once Oscar winner James Stewart was old and elegant, once Oscar winner Lee Grant said Sir Christopher Lee was a drunken-looking mistake. Airport # 77 so far has been directed to three airport movies and even liked the idea behind it. they do not help a little silly, produced and gentle, and a film about a sunken plane should not just be drill or lethargic. Concorde ... The airport was followed by '79 (1979).
