This film deserves credit for the original approach. Combines theater, movie and epic story elements. Unfortunately, all levels fall flat. The biggest weakness of the film is that it wants to do something; There are camping, moral and epic elements without making any contributions. In connection with the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave with this terrifying adaptation. It transforms the lovely, unbearable innocent Percival into the most terrible and rude dude. <br /> <br /> Probably the two types are French or Arthuriophiles. I have found an incredibly old, disrespectful treatment of a film that has been said to be the last one, an unprecedented and beautiful story.
