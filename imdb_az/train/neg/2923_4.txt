The area was quite interesting in the background of the Russian revolution. I saw in Budapest as part of the film. Unfortunately, there were zero chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really tough, almost scorched. Rob Stewart was a very attractive boy and, therefore, like his brother, not his brother. Finally, when they finally realized who they were, when they came to an end, they were pretty weak and had no sense in any sense. If the relationship between the two actors was a bit more convincing, I think that this movie will be better appreciated.
