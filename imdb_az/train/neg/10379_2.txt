The film begins in 1840, when a man commits his wife and lover to death and commits suicide. This is a very cowardly, bloody sequence. Then he jumped to the exact day of 1982. Ted (Edward Albert), his wife Laura (Susan George) and their frustrating little boy are moving to Japan for a Cuban job. They rent a house and - surprise! surprise - it just happens to be the home of the offenses! <br /> <br /> Three people are dead as ghosts (make-up is pretty bad) and they are dying to the family. <br /> <br /> It sounds ok, but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending, and there is nothing in between. I'm attacked by giant teenagers, it's just a shock! They look very fake - I saw the rope pulling from one side of my heart - they say goodbye !!!!! In the first 20 minutes (probably only to show George's body), there was a really foolish exorcism towards the end and about the end of each other (about 40 minutes later). You need to see the battlefield between Albert and Doug McClure. <br /> <br /> As for the players, Albert was husband, and McClure was pretty good as a family friend. But George, as always, is a terrible thing in a bad movie. It gives a very useful lift to the film - but it can not save it. I give it only 2 and the hero open and close it. In addition, this is a very boring movie.
