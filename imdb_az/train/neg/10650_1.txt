This film is undoubtedly the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And says a lot, considering the paradox has seen stinkers like Demon, Lovers Lane and Bloody Crimes (which is the second one). But I love the horror movies and, as you can tell from my username, it really goes out. Sometimes there is nothing more entertaining than a weak slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene where a woman's fried in the chest booth is not related to the film, especially as the film does not say that the movie was happening the other two years ago. Acting does not exist, and most camera shots are areas of women spandy. The police were the monotonous actor who faced most of the stones I saw. But the best / worst part of this film should be a murder weapon. Giant security pin? What did they think? Who is the killer? Unnamed "Huggies" worker? I usually have to give this movie a zero, but I did not have an explosion while watching it
