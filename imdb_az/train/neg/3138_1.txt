People write how big this movie is. It was terrible! The best of the player was good. Leonardo earned a lot of money in the theaters because teenage girls looked at the movie seven times. Where did hell have it? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; Why was it sinking, so was my mind to many people; Maybe a little plot of conspiracy. Does someone understand that certain men do not even sit in the boat? Because there was even a fire in front of the ship? No, everything you do not see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and painting his nakedness (the movie was a stupid, at least ludicrous)? <br /> <br /> I was crying during a scene. The scene they show on the boat. The pool looked at its water! I think that this movie is all about money, and even the water coming from the ocean could not seem real? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh played while the boat sank .. It's just ridiculous. This was the worst film ever produced by Pearl Harbor in the section "Not Affiliated with Reality".
