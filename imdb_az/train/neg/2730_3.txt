<br /> <br /> The Caucasus is good in many forms. But do you want to watch a documentary that everyone is unable to do, despite praise of the artistic "genius"? Perhaps you can catch a camera and find yourself in any local scene (I know everywhere and can not even watch the local scene) or worry about spending money to watch this trip. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " We are made to follow two bands, Brian Jamestown Massacre, Anton and Dandy Warhols led by Courtney. Before watching this movie I heard the Dandy Warhols ... Brian Jamestown Massacre is not. Why? Brian Jamestown Diffusion of the massacre group is really better than this documentary perspective, since it is not really possible to do it in the music industry. However, instead of analyzing the possibility of two separate groups and one success, focus is on Anton and his argument. <br /> Because, look, Anton is "genius". "" Because he plays rock music. He really understands the evolution of music ... because he plays rock music with different musical instruments. His music is considered "post-modern retro but future" because of rock music. He wants to bring a "revolution" through rock music. <br /> <br /> One of the last children to avoid watching a documentary about documentary film shootings. According to Anton's talent, because the two-hour short-term nature of the 2000 hour material is in nature, we have no time to pay attention to the truth. Instead, we are watching Antony, the "genius", the social-maniacal loser, the two-hour jerk, and simply telling them to understand that really great music. I do not know, whether it is or not, because there was not enough time to prove it, not as a documentary. I do not know if we call ourselves a music music and we have a story about some unique twin trumpets that cover the country without anything to support it. Why such a thing? People like Anton deserve a desirable post-defect pash of desire, hope, and the admiration of all these different people, especially the potential. For a reason, this film plays like a two-hour rough cut VH1: it continues on music, but it's all imagery and attention. <br /> <br /> This film is only of interest to you: <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: Joel, and because of the presence of everyone in this documentary, Joel is the only person to have fun, perhaps he is a healer, all the rest are rock stars! They deserve our attention, admiration, interests and intentions! "White Stripes" is for rock and roll It was Anton, and it was "logical not to mention me as an inspiration." What a burden, people like Anton, have forgotten what is best, explains why the main music is so fun Because it's possible to live with people like Anton, who can play music and eventually only one of them is safe and passionless, thank you very much Anton. touches everyone who has come to the music and vice versa, no matter what has been destroyed. <br /> <br /> you about Anton "know" even if people disagree, and indeed, this documentary shows how evil it falling down. <br /> <br /> PololarisDiB
