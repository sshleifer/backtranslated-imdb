Yes? Was Jamie Foxx Laughable? Does he believe he is really funny? Well, he explains his confidence in being funny. Man has no identity ... Almost immediately we can see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence try to imitate them in one of their films. The only problem is that it is bad, uneven and it's just some of the parts that look like Denzel, with the mafia, and then suddenly Martin Lawrence continues to be a funny and hateful-comedian comedy. There is no personal touch on all of this, that is, he can not make any contribution to the person he is trying to sell, and I'm convinced that I can not personally. <br /> <br /> I really hope for Hollywood, but the black society in America, for example, will find a better one to start a super stardom like Don Cheadle. Sadly Jamie represents a generation that's a better old remix.
