It's hard to say the worst thing about this show: bad behavior, poor acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, unsuitable sets of times, poor scripts. It would be nice if they approached the original fairy tale of the script. - Beowulf has quite a lot of tension and good material, and can provide a better storyline than scenario writers. <br /> <br /> And why do you offer a strange new weapon like a burning crucifix with explosive patterns? <br /> <br /> I've seen that this movie is only 21 days old. Shows the lack of quality. <br /> <br /> I'm beginning to think that the Sci-Fi channel (and others) is a general (poor) attitude toward filmmaking in classical tales in the past. <br /> <br />
