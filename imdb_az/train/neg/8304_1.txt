"A Christmas Story" is one of the most popular films of many people at all times. The ACS audience could take a little time and place, as there are very few movies. <br /> <br /> So I was also inviting (and expected) to say "Working in the family". The film was released several times, only last minute. <br /> <br /> As a result, IITF (and I thought) was a total failure. <br /> <br /> Foot sets and cinematography were simply good, but the directive was completely abducted. This movie is nothing but a lazy cast, lazy writing, and cash inflow formula for kidnapped players. <br /> <br /> One of America's greatest humorists and storyteller, Jan Shepard, is a mistaken lack of warmth we use in ACS. He was very happy and knew why he did not know it. <br /> <br /> <strong> Writing and acting in IRITI is wrong and compulsory. Actors may have seen the ACS, but none of the ACS's minds and nuances should be recorded in any way. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but it is to insult later Jean Shepard and ACS fans to call it.
