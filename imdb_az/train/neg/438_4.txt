This is an "anthology" horror film. Robert Bloch (composed by Weird Tales and personal friends with H.P. Lovecraft, but the most famous story is "Psycho") consists of 4 short stories featured. Stories are very inadequate and very creepy or terrible about the movie. It would be better to do this as a comedy like "Terrorist Comedy". Only the last 4 stories were really humorous, and that's the best (with Ingrid Pitt). I've seen some of these Amicus anthology movies, and Freddie Francis, the only one who really appreciated my time. "Tales from Crypt". It works well for antitrust producers because they can hire a group of "big names", hire a weekly hire, and then bring the next big name. So you basically pay a 6-week salary of the movie star, but you'll get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. But the audience is unsuccessful because the audience wants to see some of the scenes that work together with Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. Instead they are stuck by these vignettes themselves. <br /> <br /> The first story is Denholm Elliot, a writer who is truly an admirable act to try to respect his deceptive role as a terrorist according to his character. . Unfortunately, Dominic, the actor who plays Tom Adams, the source of horror, appears to be foolish, which destroys any horror. There are some striking things like the Dominican scene that killed Elliot's psychiatrist, but you still want to laugh. The murderer is a patented scene that creeps behind the victim, but no one is watching, so all the audience is "look into your eyes!" They will say. The second story is with Peter Cushing. God loves that man very much. Films like him are very bad, as it is, pretty sad. In the story he sees that he has to go away from a lost love for a long time and find a similarity in a wax museum. <br /> <br /> Kristofer plays the father of a little boy who is a witch with Lee. It was so much fun if he performed for these laughs. Instead, we were in Lee's crib and when we were surprised to be bad, we were terrified. Actress, Chloe Franks, was very good at this type of "Bad Seed". <br /> <br /> The last story is attractive ... Ingrid Pitt plays an actress and Jon Pertwee gets a vampire title that accidentally turns him into a vampire. There is a proposal about the whole story. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see how incredibly English was in Ingredient Pit, so some of my other films were not dubbed. <br /> <br /> A very memorable movie or one but a horror to everyone.
