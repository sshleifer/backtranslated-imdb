Some people will be able to consider this movie's artistic work - you can imagine a film that creates an illusion of pain and death. I personally think that this movie has never been released. This film is pushing, illogical, and meaningless. Along with losing time, it also causes illness in your days. The horror images shown in the film, along with explaining the air, take into account them and take days to forget them. People are just such a shame that they have been using their imagination of humanity horror. Kill Bill would be another example, but at least Kill Bill meant the meaning, leap and resolve.
