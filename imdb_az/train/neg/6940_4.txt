If you have two towers standing against each other, at least you are the best friend you can expect, and in this film, 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan is the 34-year-old Tabu romance. Wait! In fact, there is everything, so instead of Adam, instead of Adam, the content of Adam was merged with the writer-director R. Balki. <br /> <br /> In this unique unconventional couple, two high-level actors will be able to bring down the house with intelligent creation and bitter sweet moments, and all this will find in the slow, but refreshing first half. Like the rainy seasons, London's locals are attractive. At the end of the first half, the romance was completed and the mission ended. There is nothing to be said. That is why in the second half goes to Satyagra, a strange opposition in the form of a girl's father is really a patience test. As a result, the second half was built without dry, flat energy. A girl dies from cancer, and there is a sub-plot that does not have much impact. Nevertheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performance.
