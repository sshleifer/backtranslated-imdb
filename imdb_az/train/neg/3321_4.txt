I usually know after the first minute of a movie, if I hate or love it ... but now I've made a mistake. <br /> <br /> The start was great; "It's based on a real story" and blah blah blah was funny. Then she thought that cartoons and children's pictures of life would make me the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, they saw Toronton's sweet fake appearance. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first 10 minutes of the movie was then eternal. <br /> Perhaps, this is just something that does not understand English Canadian humor (this is possible, the Canadians in English always do not understand Quebecois humor), but hey ... there was not enough for a short film * there was nothing. Maybe this is a meaning for the title? In any case, almost everything was completed, and in my opinion, very little was funny. <br /> <br /> In fact, "preparation" was better than the movie. At least you understand motivation that puts everything in a bad condition. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I hired a movie, and I was interested in "losing people bored". <br /> <br /> If you are in Canadian Canadian, taking into account the stunning number you can estimate the humor, it seems that the whole universe will disappear, 8 of those who have this movie. In other cases, think twice before losing your precious time ...
