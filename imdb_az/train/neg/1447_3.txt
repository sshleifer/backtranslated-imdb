In 1934, Shirley Temple played three great movies and really started to name itself. Unfortunately, studios should have the experience of seeing the community love the best here. Two of them were songs and dances. It was a short, interesting film that attracted the attention of another person and depressed her thoughts. <br /> <br /> You also know other buttons on successful poetry films. <br /> <br /> Although this movie starred by Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, Henry Hathaway, despite being a very good director, has achieved none of the above. In addition, there are just a few boring stories and Lombard and Cooper have many arguments. To compromise, you did not feel the normal part of the community that you want. I guess what you learned after this movie.
