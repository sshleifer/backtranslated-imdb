When I go to see this movie I have to admit that I did not really have high expectations. But I was totally and absolutely hopeless with my low expectations ... <br /> <br /> Mostly Luke Wilson is a hot shot who wants to go out with some terrible girlfriends. There is a girl listening to her, but it's pretty much for that character. <br /> <br /> Part of this movie invites you to discuss it, as it was before the movie, like the movie, loved by Rainn Wilson (Metro). Uma Thurman is a "hot" girl. <br /> <br /> Rain Willary's performance is far from "hot" because everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. Normally I was all player, but he could not save this movie. His character was crushing, unreal, and very boring. You would not say that the writers did not want to make him a funny gay hidden gay guy, or just hopeless. <br /> <br /> But in any case, when someone goes out of the subway, someone stole his bag and Luke Wilson is able to become a charming savior after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is a super hero, or "G-Girl," as he wants to call him in the film. <br /> <br /> "I think of what" G "is, but we will leave it for discussion on this board. <br /> <br /> I think sex scenes should laugh, but I find myself asking whom sexually exploited? According to Uma Thurman's "passion", they throw the bed out of the bed. <br /> <br /> If Uma, when insulted Anna Faris by saying "prostitute", it does not hurt my head when there is no controversy, but "I'm really hard to understand it". <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: , Did not pay 75 dollars. Characters are typical and no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it does not mean you're moving too much because you're moving the head. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and the story too work, or a game and some lightweight fluid. I really feel embarrassed for actors and their deadly career. In general, if you value your money and do not waste your time with this miserable attempt in a self-respecting movie.
