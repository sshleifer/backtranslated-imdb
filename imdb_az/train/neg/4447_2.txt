Yes there are bad movies there. Many have fun, shoe design, budget, or t.v. Even though it was a movie of the week, it would take more than two stars if it were not a 'movie of the week'. It is a poor film about a serious topic related to an aggressive woman who flees from the protective arm of the poorest king of the sluggish people. (This is an attempt by a man to show that a man should not prefer a movie and at least show it to be a must). There is no decline, a character development and a heroine that can be removed by a rotton onion. (I think he did not leave a single wedding ring in the ocean (where his body should be everywhere), and after finding his husband, he still indicates a moron, and the assumptions that resulted in child mortality almost killed him .) When I see a similar high-level movie, I am always amazed and I'm dying. I understand that Seuss still has a large unused market to protest. I cried after the curse in humanity.
