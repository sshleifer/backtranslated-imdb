When I first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York, I saw that Cana was missing. Maybe it was a few years away, but this film has captured the essence of the city and its people better than anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is probably a good thing for a particular community - the Chinese - because most of the city's spirit is above all the parameters, faces and symbols. <br /> <br /> Tourists are not San Francisco. The settings are modest and routine: taxi boards, Chinese restaurant cuisine, Richmond district circular homes, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, piers, Philippines elder center. This is what the city looks at during the day and people living there - even now, during the urban transformation of Silicon Gull. On the contrary, Dirty Harry (in the film, also in the excellent San Francisco movie), everything is drawn on the street level: From the perspective of surrounding people, we come to understand the character of the characters. shooting. Undoubtedly, Wang has shot a film in B & W because he did not have money to do anything else, but one of the most powerful visual elements of the film is his natural light. The frequent, widespread quality of sunlight is one of the closest associations with San Francisco: exposing everything, buildings, hills, other landscapes on the scale, and funny, closer to you personally and potentially more than anywhere in the streets appears. Wang's photography delivers it perfectly and even helps in the story. <br /> <br /> I think Wang is better than anyone else in China and other San Franciscans' speaking and talking style. If there is something like "accent" in true San Francisco, it's a dinging-in taxi-taxi dealer (think of it) that's talking on the phone at one scene! "). <br /> <br /> This story is very striking and, despite some minor mistakes, the desires of the people living in old immigrant communities, political and ethnic contradictions, and less humorous entertainment that help reduce them. - maybe some respondents think what the movie is here. <br /> <br /> "Chan Missing" started with "Chanatown Travelogue sequence." Talking about San Francisco and all the nudity of the 1930s, an American caricature, yes, but in a way it does not have a mark.
