I believe in removing religions from government and films. I do not want a sermon, I'm going to church, but I do not want a movie. I do not give any idea of ​​some supernatural subjects (so it's supernatural as you can be religious!) But I was really dissatisfied with this movie and had so much preaching work. The host reminded the witches seen in other films. Even the bad guy had horns. <br /> <br /> The hero went to this meeting and shouted all this old man and broke the magic. Only life was simple. When I think films are foolish, they should be distributed with a warning: Danger! NOT FULFILLED ALL!
