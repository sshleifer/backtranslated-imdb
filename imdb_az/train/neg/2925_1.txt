After reading some good readings, after hearing good things about the word of mouth, I decided to hire Undone. I have to say I'm very disappointed. It is difficult to follow the story because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between today's and past past, which is very bad. Heroes, despite the actors, are good and straightforward. Sex and nakedness are more open than they are. I have never seen any movie that would come in the field unnecessarily. The latter is very anti-climate and leaves many unanswered questions into a story that's not well explained. I think it's a waste of time.
