Lucille Ball did not consult with any of his books on his biography, especially when writing his script for this movie. I have never seen a mistake in the biopic at Celoron and Jamestown, with her Desi until the next years. I could write a list of actual errors, but I would continue with the pages. In general, I believe Lucille Ball is one of these unique people who can not be described by anyone else. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr, I would like to point out how many mistakes have been made in this film. Film cameras have worked hard, but the film is very sensitive to me.
