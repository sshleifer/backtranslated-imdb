Anne Bancroft plays estelle, a deceased son (Ron Silver) plays a Jewish mother who wants to find a repeat star star Greta Garbo and want to present two of Estelle's best to check out before. The actress can be called "Bancroft Talks" because it is an attack on the term of an indefinite comedy / dramatic / sentimental material. Hot or cold director Sydney Lumet will not go on a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant gown is never measured by filmmakers - it keeps it on the right: sweet, teary and beautiful. Estelle has a drift in this scenario (a thoroughly thought-out scheme is nothing else). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks are able to do very little, but they support the star and everyone is trampled by his hammock. * From 1/2
