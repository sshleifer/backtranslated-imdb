In the 1970s, it was full of bad Southern stereotypes, which were completed by the "Kabus" background voices called "social commentary" on the persistence of the village and its prison conditions. Not only is it a violation of the sensitivity of the majority of Americans, this case remains only in its delicate "prison" film, particularly in its incomplete original version. Nevertheless, the player is generally on the average, and especially when the late Chuck Connors is somewhat worried about the scene, the viewer does a good job of hating him. There is a very credible sadistic prison guard in the late Robert Reed and Tina Louise (from the beginning to the "Gilligan's Island" gang), which seems to be a necessary guard. My price: D. <br />
