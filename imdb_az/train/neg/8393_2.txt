John Carradine, John Ireland, and Faith Domergue came together for this Fear film, which imitated art in a mysterious mosque, as well as the players who have seen better days in films. <br /> <br /> For Carradine, in the last two decades of his career, it would have been better to work whatever he did, and something that came out of the theory of paychecks emerged. Always fears of Carradine with this spectacular sound and plays the guard of the former Gothic palace, where film director John Ireland hired for the lowest budget budget movie. There is even a cemetery, but with the missing wealthy. Faith Domergue, Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells, is a young tool. <br /> <br /> Most of the winds that have been scattered in the last twenty minutes or more are dead. The scenario is very sensitive, and I'm still trying to figure out the point. I will not spend more gray matter on him.
