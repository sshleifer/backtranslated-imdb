I have come from watching the euro horror, especially the films produced by cult luminary Jess Franco, and I do not expect a very meaningful structure. However, Franco entered the sea with this film; Succubus is, unfortunately, a terrifying movie, despite the surrealistic environment, the film's recognition as the best director. I have to admit that I've seen the American cut version of about 76 minutes; but if this is not the only logic, the longer the European version is boring. The area has a relationship with a woman protesting; S & M experiences and rubbish talk, and all this is really boring. There is no misfortune and sexual weakness, and most of the work time is perceived despite a boring dialogue and a short film; I had trouble making all the way up to the end. I have to say that the places look good, and Franco did a good job using his real atmosphere; but there are positive elements. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has created classic trash films, but it looks like it's ready for the money, and generally I suggest jumping and seeing some of the more fascinating work of some of the directors.
