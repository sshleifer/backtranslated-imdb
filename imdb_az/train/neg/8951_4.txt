I'm a big fan of the book, and from my Animal Care Studio at Orwell GCSE, she's my favorite writer ever since. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I watched a trailer on the DVD, first of all, hearing the mechanical shout of Eurythmics in 1984, causing some terrifying fears about the theme song. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Iran's nuclear program , the latter part can be felt, especially in room 101. But this is the place where the film is being dropped. The film spends a lot of time on the relationship of love between Winston and Julia. This is not exactly what Orwell wrote. The insomnist wrote about a future breaking down as a human being set up his faith and then called them all to love the Big Brother. The film actually jumps to Winstons, the most important part of the book, to fit in the world and its position in the world and to re-educate O'Brien. <br /> <br /> Commenting on the IMDb is a mistake that the movie stuck on the book. While visiting Winston, O'Brien, Julia is no longer committed to Goldstien's fraternity and does not admit their murders. <br /> <br /> If Winston's article is found with Unpersons, but if you do not read the book, you will not be left open until the end is over. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario, some excellent action is not possible to escape. Michael Radford completely missed the point he was trying to do, and the electronic sound trail was terrible.
