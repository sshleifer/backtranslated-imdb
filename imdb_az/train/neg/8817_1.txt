No, I have never seen the Santa Slasher series, namely "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or "Christmas Evil". I've heard all their conversations, or MADS (Mother against Deranged Santas). I thought I would rent it as I heard it opened as a reference to a 'Fat Guys Movies' section. /> <br /> Mothers should be against them, but ooooohhhh "killer" is not for Santa, in fact this film was just plain shit. Go, long? <br /> <br /> The little boy sees Santa's chimneys in 1947, offers gifts, eats some and miraculously burns chimneys. He goes to bed, but his mother and Santa return to the living room to witness the acquisition. As it turned out, Ralphi's father was surprised at the rest of his life as he had a "Foot Lamp" in A Christmas Story. <br /> <br /> <strong> Now, since 1980, a baby factory has broken children's jobs. We are talking about being slightly outsourced and he shouts to both children and parents. Who is naughty, who is good, yes. Finally, is there a good two-thirds of the film to break it off? I suppose it is not familiar to the framework. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> , "fine" anyone, it's graphics like "Trash Can". And I celebrated the end of WTF. I think it's a metaphor, but it's strange as the rest of the movie. (Take his brother's brother killed and kill him, killing). Do not open this blend on Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I did not watch Santa-Slashers, but that's not a bad thing. The film was created a little bit based on the nature and never presented a decent gift.
