<br /> <br /> I would like to believe in this movie that the only form of this country's main comedy is rifles and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a totally different way. the other side has very little indication for that. I bet that a small seed went nuts for it. I knew that SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main heroes has comedy sticks to pull it out. Even Danny K made a better timing. I'm really serious. Every time you bring a little character, "Darn must be the head of this man!" I thought he was. <br /> <br /> Does not mean that the independent camera work should be terrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - in fact, with such a straight dialogue, turning boredom into a sharp relief that would do more harm. The black and white were crisp. The ingredients were terrible. The use of music was terrible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the shortcomings in this film remain in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne has spoken to this movie and not David - you see and understand it. I believe that children who form Oppikoppi are embarrassed. I would think nothing would happen. I felt someone could be pulled back in the backyard. I know regular guys who are talking more funnier, raunchier and wittier than this "comic". <br /> <br /> The Guess SA comedy will remain in stone for a while. Beautiful businessmen.
