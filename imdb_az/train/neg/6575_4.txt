An exciting movie about an incident in Vermont during the Civil War. My focus was on and I did not regret it. I have never read the incident, because the rebels did not pull it out. I am very pleased with the history films from that time. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is Confederacy. They look very good! Acting was sometimes a bit tough. I love the old man eating mashed potatoes because I have no tooth. The wounded soldier playing with a dog was a bit strange. Generally, it was a film of origin.
