It did not mean anything, and it was so terrible ... I think there is such a movie in Hollywood ... there is no watch. people should say what they are cutting or eating ... it made me sick! Oh, my God! The film is about people who we feed and feed people! have teeth bla bla bla ... not familiar? I saw it in another movie. Casting was great, but I think the scenario is really terrible. I had to say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely awesome ... he was very talented ... In fact, I said terrible, but I think of it because of the terrible scenes ... let's explain it. Did you eat your tongue? a man in the movie did it! it was really terrible ... Anyway, I think the movie would be good without this terrifying man eating or cutting scenes ...
