Houseboat Horror is a great name for this movie. This is the only stain of a film that can give 10 out of 10 movies. There are boats in the house, there is horror, there is horror at home. But if there was a line for the film poster, surely they would say, "There is something in this way." Houseboat Horror is the worst Australian movie I've ever seen so far not to worry about one of the worst horrors. It's a tough attempt to shoot movies and movies that I've seen. The good news is that it is a bloody terrible thing, with the watchful enthusiasm of the spectator, towards the wonderful world of sudden compassion. <br /> <br /> For a record producer, film crew and rock band, a mystical named Lake Infinity, somewhere in Victoria (really Lake Eildon), not just something that's happening in the "worst" category, a picturesque village retreat to capture a music video. Someone is not happy to see them there, and maybe even begin to separate the audience with a very sharp knife, in an attempt to bring a blessing. <br /> <br /> On the surface looks like many bog-standard B-film slasher, it's even mystifying. Highly bored young people, vulnerable elders, creepy locals (one, a gas station assistant will easily win a guring competition), and this could be Jason Voorhees, a portrayal of his killer. Ah, but if only actor and production values ​​were as good as a comparable masterwork on Friday, part 13 was VII. Unfortunately, Houseboat Horror is also completely deprived of those things. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's just funny and funny. Tony Martin, a fan of the 'Late Show' and the 'Get This One', is now some of the true dialogue stones ('look at the look ... stay!'), It's too bad to accompany a music video, and I do not even need to believe it - writer / I do not care if Wood really hopes to be a hit. I compare the horror element, I think of the similar genre, and in particular the era, but when I could not imagine a burger being screened and could not see a tomato sauce over the wall <br /> <br /> Indeed, if Tony Martin If you recommend this movie as an imaginary trash, I will disappoint you. Any 'bad-it's-good' horror science will not allow. Perhaps it is another matter, whether it's a finger or not. On the other hand, if you are looking at the genuine excellence in the genre of fear in Australia, get a copy of the unique "Long Weekend" yourself and do not come back.
