I purchased this movie on blu ray because it gave great visuals and music. I'm a great admirer of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very stylish, wide angles and very similar pictures with long-lasting cameras after Baraka. Even some scenes were the same (streets with traffic). While telling a great story in Baraka, this film was shot from shooting with no extensive story, medium music, when it burned nature, humanity, morality and worldly horrors with a similar fashion and great music. ... POOF, it's okay! I thought I should be wrong with some sort! History of the world? Half of the film is in Egypt and the landscape (looks like Arizona, but I did not worry about examining it). Serious people, that's horrible, if you need to rent it, but do not buy it. Filmmakers should be embarrassed to carry out this work.
