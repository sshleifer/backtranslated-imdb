Such an ambitious and elderly attempt to be rude. Diabolical script and dialogue and really shameful action. The worst movie I've ever seen. In my opinion, nothing in this movie survives the general disaster. When I went to a movie theater in Brighton, I saw it. People went out and chatted more and more people in the audience! Finally, one of the main actors saw their relatives very sad and really looked dark. However, the film was not really bad with me like this sympathy. Everyone starts from somewhere, and his son's actor career, "Scouting in the UK," actually started with this terrible attempt. Five years have passed, but sometimes I burn the memory of this sad night in films! This is a movie without any irreplaceable features! 0 I gave it as I gave it. Anyone involved in this sad confusion of a film should invoke a 'shameometer'. I know that some of them were shifted to better things, and none of them was down to a lower level.
