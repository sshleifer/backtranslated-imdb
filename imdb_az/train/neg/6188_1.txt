This is the worst adaptation I've ever seen, Jane Eyre. Whether or not the book writer Bronte is reading a book is unclear. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling like Rochester - just angry, acting plain old. Susannah York had the most fashionable hairstyle in 1970, seen in the Victoria movie. The heroes speak with difficult words, rich poems enjoy the book, which gives them a deep intellectual and eternal love. The last is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please, rent a version of Timothy Dalton instead. That's true for the book, the novel sounds for you. Dalton is superior to Rochester. G. C Scott laughs.
