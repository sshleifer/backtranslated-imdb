After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on the IMDb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! The heroine is trying to steal Mr Fox (or 'Foxy'), an "end" horrible nurses, Bunce and Bean. <br /> <br /> I know very well where to begin with my criticism. Well, my late youth has never been an admirer of Roald Dahlin, but I love his stuff quite a bit, and I read Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, reading a few books as a child. However, this film fights for the audience. Is it oriented to children? Adults? Still not sure! Most of the "jokes" were born by a child, especially Mr Fox, who was a lawyer or complained of poverty. Also, children (I assume) are expected to sympathize with a character who stole and kills a chicken. I'm not for the whole chain of food, but you see that Mr. Fox is down on his neck! Undoubtedly, is it too little? And also, the area ... well, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Fox and his son Ashte were more unhappy to make foolish decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, humor falls flat. I laughed one or two times, even though there were some attempts at jokes. I think that some of the sounding sound is incredibly flat and monotonous. Sound actors do not have the concept of comic timing, but rather target humor with only certain media. Mr Clooney is targeting Mr. Fox as he is charming and cheerful, but he has no voice. Meryl Streep does not make any impression, nor did I even know that Bill Murray played a role until the last loan, and the twelve-year-old Ash in the fox sounds like about 30. <br /> <br /> I love the animation, especially the stopping action, but the visual style really leaked to me a little. Characters are long, light, and the design does not have any heat. They move with very little fluidity and are often animated shaky and strange. The 2D components have a "mixed average" feeling as they are added indefinitely and unsuccessfully. The characters look straight into the camera and talk; was very worried. Kylie looked straight at the camera, did not move, and dropped on her eyes. <br /> <br /> Fox, his wife, had a great potential. Many people still like it - they look. Maybe not just for me.
