Basically it's about a couple who want to adopt this second child. They are faced with a mouse in the adoptive organ (Stuart) and decide to accept it. <br /> <br /> Stuart came to his new home where he was treated as a human being. (Connect with me!) The problems of many families, jealousy from their older brother, and ultimately all the issues are solved - all of them are ordinary clichés like "happy family". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stuart's "brother" because of the family cats love. <br /> <br /> Because of some of the comic concerts that Stuart uses well in his smaller size. <br /> In general, I think the film will be good: a. Stuart was a PET and was a "brother". b. Stewart reserved for funny concerts like those who wanted to take cats, and even dived away from dull clichés that did not fit in with anything else.
