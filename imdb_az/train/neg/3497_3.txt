Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show does not give a definition to itself. The character does not even like it and I do not think it's a thing like "oh something like that", "it's such a ab * tch". It's just half funny because it's just a plain old self-righteous, yes, b * tch.Sarah seems to struggle to hold this show. Spirit, dialogue is so damn hard and boring Sara Silverman's program is incredibly boring, so I thought to watch the old duplication of the channel that there is something with the kids, it's funny that characters are "immoral" and "rude" I am very sorry but I do not find a show full of dry humor and cornice on the wall story line about some angry, painful, missing, angry, bitter life. It's funny with everywhere where it's like a gay sister and gay friend singing Keanu Reeves. In general, I can not stand on this show as I like Sarah Silverman, "I love her love," as the Rock School. I also think of this show. shocking symbols when saying things that are worth the shock. tomorrow is a try for laugh, diarrhea and laughs.The Sarah Silverman program in general is funny or need a laugh track or better writers. One is comparable to South Park but not near. The Sarah Silverman Program will not have to be a meaningless troll that will not see me send me stuff like ab * tch and sucks "Show It" and "This is Not Canceled" .If you like the Sarah Silverman Program.
