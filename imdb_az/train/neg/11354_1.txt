I've been subjected to hundreds of children in the past, and I think it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> 1) I'm old enough to explain today and my children. Russia is not "bad guys". However, Russian names like "Poopchev" are not disappointing. 2) Dada Flyo's birthday party was a sexist joke she had claimed that men were in beer and that women were talking on the phone. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole film was part of the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s that we were proud to have remained as one nation. <br /> <br /> Everything is just raw, bad animation, worse writing, and wasting time to wait.
