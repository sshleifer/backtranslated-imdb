This movie is very distant, very repetitive, with men's nudity and sexuality (which is considered as a gay with their collection of adult titles). <br /> <br /> The majority of the first three parts of the film was cut to ten minutes and could have been effective without testing the patient's patience. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie early in the afternoon with a movie festival audience; the type of crowd who are more interested in being more adventurous or more interested in atypical movies such as unnatural, shorts, foreign movies. Near the theater, near the 275-seat, the film began to collapse in the first half of the film, and the vast majority remained for "repayment" (never actually came), I have never been to 14 years at multiple film festivals, experimental, gay and vice versa, was seen moving away from the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has easily been reduced to more than half and has been so effective. <br /> <br /> As it is still the case, this is not something that can easily be recommended or a desire to revisit any one.
