I was interested in whether there was a movie on the cover during the cheap film shot by Crazy Fat Ethel II at the start of the video. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is also simple. Ethel, a eating manicure with eating disorder, slips through the hospital because of the extreme crowd. He looks at the most quiet place when a man slips to another soup. Ethel resembles a chocolate bar by one of the semi-housekeepers after he feeds the dog's food. Ethel definitely responds to it with a wire embroidery on the stairs, and then you think ..... If it all sounds like fun, this is not it. This film is weak with bad effects and even worse toys. Heroes become wooden when passing lines telling them to stand in front of a cigar shop. To make matters even worse, half of the film consists of the first Ethel movie, Kriminal Insane, and the flashbacks that are even better. Very poor effort.
