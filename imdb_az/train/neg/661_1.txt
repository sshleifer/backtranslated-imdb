Okay So I went back. Before starting the review, I can say one thing: I would like to love this movie. In the past I know I'm negative, but I hope to be surprised and really love the movie. <br /> <br /> This is just about every horrible cliche that you can think of. And just scare a jump (do not walk into a baseball bat left on the ground?) Is not that you do not do anything? It was not just a scary one. <br /> <br /> Some things surprised me: I had more blood, I had more than I thought ... I do not say much. <br /> <br /> The film is home to Donna's Lisa's mother. He comes up ... he climbs up. The camera is dead on the board. Fearful, exuberant. He goes upstairs where the above-mentioned baseball scene is on stage. He finds his brother in his bed, but the dead (how could I say that there is a blood on it). The killer comes, Donna sleeps under her bed, the mother dies. He runs and shouts for help. Behind the Killer: "I did it for us". Therapy session was interrupted. It blended many people - everybody was asking whether their family was really dead or not, and he recalled how the nightmare was back. <br /> <br /> <strong> Languages ​​provides dialogue. The little scenes in the hall go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason he fled 3 days ago, but the police / family was not informed at all). <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk about the events in the film. Because I do not want so much. If you want to know who has died, Horror_Fan sent a post about this. But in matters of death: they were not exciting. The people in the theater really laughed at more than one (a genius film, a never-ending experience in a horror movie). Particularly: The bus gives the boy the most sad 'scary' face I've ever seen. Lisa, the only death associated with any blood, was very few. His throat was cut, his blood (even if you could think it was almost black) resembled a curtain. When she saw her body, another one was Claire. As it turned out, Fenton decided to stab him several times after his death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most cliché I've ever seen. Let's look at it .. obligatory close mirror curtain - BOOM! scene. Check it out. Twice, indeed (you could say that they were fighting). Necessary support-layers. Check it out. There is also a supporting lamp scene, but you've all seen it. Oh, we want you to be scared of birds? Yeah, you got it! (Yes, we could get in here). And, of course, we-var-security-all-speeches-but-still-salvaged scene. Am going <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p style = "color: red;"> "Oh, no matter how massive the alarm is, I'm actually saying I want a BUILDING and my friends 3 people are missing and I am going to go to my place. " These characters are some of the most flawed and stupid heroes. Only gratifying character - Lisa - turned into one of the most stupid acts in the film. "Oh, I just realized that the psychologist was here! I have to leave behind my strongest beloved boy to escape from him! Oh, shoot, the elevator is slow to the construction site!" Ugh. Until the end of the film, all of them deserved to die. <br /> <br /> The only death (which I can not remember his name is) is not Donna's beloved boyfriend, and then the audience was completely dried out of this fearless, clone film. <br /> <There were some positives, for the majority, the player was good and well shot. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it 1/5 and this is generous. <br /> <br /> At the same time, for laughs (and I believe that some of the audience was) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. After the film ended, people drowned and after that the sound was very negative. Wait for the bad legs for this.
