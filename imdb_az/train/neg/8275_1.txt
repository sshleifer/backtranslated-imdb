(First of all, my bad English) Of course, a movie starring Jessica Simpson can cover such serious gates. I'm a Norwegian and shocked the creators of this film and felt it was an American / conducts. <br /> <br /> So, I'm making the adjustments out of my dreams: - Not Norway, but Norway. - "Da" is not Russian, but Norway. Norwegians do not use these white pens in this white paper because the Protestant Church is so dominant - it's really native folklore (we only use it twice a year), but the outfit is more like a German dress. - I did not understand the name "Norway" in this film .. Jessica did not make any sense .. Neighbor "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> What I do not know is the Norwegian flag (and maybe the people who shoot this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am proud of my country and people who live in the United States love less stereotypic and more accurate <br / <br /> <br /> This is when talking about our country. <br /> <br /> All this was .. Lenge leve Norge! p
