Serge Farnel drew the very exact critics of this film on the "Rwandese Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) page. <br /> <br /> Critics of the French state of the United Nations describe how the United Nations has been in a dangerous position, and the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> Ten UN soldiers were killed the day before. <br /> <br /> For this reason, UN soldiers plunged into French trucks and decided to protect their lives. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they are not forgiven Tutsi, of course <br /> <br /> But we must not forget that French soldiers are in this situation.
