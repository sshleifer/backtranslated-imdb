Hooper is funny, not romantic and informative. There is no real drama. You think that a movie about the world's biggest stuntman would be a drama, there was an attempt, but it did not look real. No character work, no lesson learned, players seemed to have no real entertainment, and they tried to act as if they had fun. There is no reason to look at Burt and watch if you do not want to see Sally at random. The Prancer horse was beautiful and what he needed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and Bandit were the ones that Hooper was eager to love. This film was a real disappointment and time loss
