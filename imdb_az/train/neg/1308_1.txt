Indeed, something that really accepts me about this movie (something about a physically ill mind) has actually been paid to do that. There is absolutely no goal for the existence of this film. Not frightening, not thought-provoking, not fun, not good. Cyanide is a sleeping pill. Compared to DVD work, Blair Witch, Evil Dead and several other dignified movies, the filmmakers' hopelessness was noticeable. It's nothing like no other movie; it's too far away. The claims that you will never forget the extremely shocking end are equivalent to a ton of horse-drawn horse racing. Please do not waste your time watching this trash can, because it can be sterile. The person writing this movie must be deleted from the Writers' Guild membership list and should not allow anything to be filmed. Because if he thought that this movie was a worthwhile movie, there was not much to be done in the future. For the stars. Grod might have a sympathy for the soul of one who is not able to see it. Now I'm going to vomit.
