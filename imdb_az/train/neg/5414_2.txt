This movie is a great step beyond Bollywood's typical mice limit. The performances were terrible. Boman, always with brilliant control, enters the OTT as a complete charge. Soundtrack is also not memorable. And despite the intense efforts, women can not be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi, despite the fact that Fardeen Khani has spent so far, is capable of better projects. However, this witchcraft, under the limited capabilities of an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are terrifying in the role of badly written clicks. It is often time to hang up the ghumar's lead hat. Hopefully, it does not look like this one. The future of Indian films is in better hands. Stay away from celluloid to sum it up.
