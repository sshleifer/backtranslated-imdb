Can I get $ 13.00 back? I was watching more "Hydroelectric Power coming to North America". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice from the mouth of every single character, regardless of age and gender. Again, I have to pay at least $ 150 an hour to listen to that sound. And insurance. This was the invitation of Will Ferrell to Morwater Woody. But I do not think creative casting is enough. Before you shoot a movie you have to wait for a story. Only if it does not do it for the money. And if so, why only "What is Tiger Lily?" If you do not repeat the All-Rap version.
