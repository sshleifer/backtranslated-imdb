Maybe I did not read Lincoln biography, perhaps it was a clear description ... <br /> <br /> And maybe I'm accustomed to Lincoln, brilliant, glorious, and amazed with unobtrusive, as a rescuer ...... <br /> <br /> But why would Lincoln make a movie that would represent the buffoon? <br /> <br /> When Henri Fonda created a perfect Lincoln, it looked a bit insulting to her as "great jokes, I'm just a man". <br /> <br /> Of course, Bushie Jr. <br /> <br /> The only thing to think about is a "regular person". So we do not think it's a rich and privileged moron - but that's another story. <br /> <br /> It is clear from Lincoln that Lincoln is a simple (simple-minded) type of person, and Lincoln has just become a law with some kind of accident, and he is not even interested in law - a law of simple simplicity with law and error. <br /> <br /> He is not a very good defender in the film (he sits down with the feet of the table and plays the fun of the witnesses), ultimately determined by chance / chance. <br /> <br /> Besides, because it is funded by the Republicans (by reacting to a Democrat-supported game), and sometimes this time alone, the film is, unfortunately, a religious, racist, and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this movie!
