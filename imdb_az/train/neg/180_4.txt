<br /> <br /> Satanic sociologist Stanley Kaldwell is back in the film production of the novel he wrote for drowning in the garden, taking into account the identity of a second principal who killed him this time. Hollywood keeps track of unpleasant entertainment, and directors with weaker actresses (like looking up the stairs ...) love to challenge everyone to be in the spotlight. Brian Krause, I thought, was in love with the point where he was incredibly obligated to compete, and the second single director and script writer Alison (who did not like being played by Dahlia Salem) appears to have taken over the production. Andrew Moxham is the victim's first film, Paul Parsons. The dark humor of the film takes the idea of ​​a serial killer, who actually acts as a film director and exploits all values. Nelson is still proud, with Stenlin backing her psychological role as intelligent as she always is, using his brain to command film production, killing everyone to control her work, until Alison Stanley really knows who he is. Alison is the kind of writer who wants to capture the essence of his subject. Why did Stanley motivate his murder, why he did something like that, and that such a man could have slipped out of the darkness? Alison's humorous humor is part of the sale of this dark comedy. Of course, you will inevitably report on Alison and Stanley, and you have a really ridiculous, incredible conclusion about the fate of the murder (a very difficult pill to swallow). Author Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques (such as pulling strange angles of different types, moving slowly in sepia, and draws several examples). on the video) and on the contrary, it regrets. This attendance is not just targeted to me, but many humor is more effective and clearer.
