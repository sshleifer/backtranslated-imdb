Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) becomes an overnight starring singer. The star of Esther is dropped by John's drug and alcohol. Two hours later, John does something self-destructive-red-converible-160-MPH-crack-up-a-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but when he is already a star, you can not accept him as a coming and coming star. She appears for the first time, read it in a back alley bar, it looks like a creative star star, who is slumming at night, as a failed uncle who tries to start his career. He is very professional, very professional. <br/> <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson, self-centered, pulled out of the yard, pulled out his house from Apartment Living. The Role of Role-Star Role is like a singer who tries to be a good actor but not very talented. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not an actor, or a bare direction or a slow story. Hair! Kristofferson and Streisand's horrible 70 hours after watching your hair for 2 hours, your eyes were injured.
