The only reason for not doing so is that Sibrel is technically skillful for filming. <br /> <br /> This is a technically good movie. <br /> <br /> As it is said, this is a lie and distortion movie, which is very easily denied. Most of the documentary film uses propaganda techniques to carry out the space program rather than the actual fact. <br /> <br /> If you know something about orbital mechanics in Sibyl's "revolutionary evidence," hopefully it's falsified. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching it, but if you do, go for free on google video. Do not hesitate to interest your interests with Bart Sibre.
