I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this movie in the cinema. I do not believe you wasted my time. The player is deserving of the best and special effects. Probarly the worst script of history is some extremely shameful quotes I have ever heard in my life. I swear I swear to God is better than this. Madonna must win this Oscar and win. I want a half hour of my life back. Honest people do not see this, even toddlers will be able to find insult on their own intelligence. I found this film very strange, it was hard to say who was more wooden, the actual puppet theses here. They do not spend a lot of time in this regrettable film.
