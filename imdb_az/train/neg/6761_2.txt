Let's be honest. It's a passive exciting movie as a project of a movie school, without budget and "real" actors. It's a very weak product, as something that can be broadcast on a DVD for an innocent audience. I am changing the way I look and if I can accidentally capture this movie, it will probably take some time and look. I'm deeply disappointed with the film, which is a person who got this DVD, feeling that I will get my own movie product. This is a camcorder TV game, something along the lines of the old sixties series, but without this charm. Moreover, except for the lead male Mr Redfield (director), other actors appear to be unprepared for the campus (somewhat of a bit older) or as one of the directors at home. not only the running chairs, but also from a makeup artist or hairdresser (a long way from the 1840s on a former long bangs or a hat over top hat on top). Sometimes it was shot outdoors using a root display, using a sturdy camera in a small, bare studio. The romantic karaoke, inspired by the naked "epoch" synthesizer, has unjustly revealed the ears of the audience for multiple reasons. The film is trying to portray it as a "dream", in fact, this is an imaginary collage of the shooting (and I believe that the standards are not too high to start). There are now and then interesting conversations, but in general, it is quite bare and two-dimensional production in multiple ways without the horror of any director or crew member. Artsy tried to look at the 80s. Mr Redfield works even better than the actor.
