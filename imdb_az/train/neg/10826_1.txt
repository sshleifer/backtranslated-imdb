I can not say the worst movie of all time, but there are still some movies I have not seen yet! It should be the most ambitious attempt to film all the time! The director suffers from the same problems as "Blood." Although the film feels like you are watching a person who is more likely to be overwhelmed with his skills. She sits in the seat of a small director and says, "How does a great filmmaker think about managing this scene?" He thinks. There is only one thing in that film. Do not know if this film is saved by a great filmmaker? of course, a great nugget that could be polished, but nothing had grown up. The scene where all the characters read was the worst moment in the film's history. I say, "Please, please do not just have a boy in his donkey to hear the death!" Of course, MASSIVE FAILURE!
