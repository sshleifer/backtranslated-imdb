"Semana Santa" or "Death Angel" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in humans. Mira has Italian accent from time to time falters. Did not speak English alone? All other characters have mandatory Mexican / English accents. Dialogue is very bad and its delivery is on the floor. Cinematography looks amazing, but it's not enough to keep up with it. THIS DISCUSSION WANT TO USE THIS TIME TIME! <br /> <br /> It looks like it's missing during the Hellfire, but the ladder comes down to drop and drop it down suddenly. This scenario indicates that there is no specific thing. INTERESTING!
