Ugh! Also other than the "deceived DVD". I was expecting at least some sort of bear, cats and cap on top. EVERYTHING! <br /> <br /> Because I think the events that have happened so far will not happen. <br /> <br /> Now I'm doing it because of 2 decor; Small children talked to themselves (though they just could not run into any dialogue with defiant music), threatening anemia, transferring them to worms, and hitting a lumpy porcupine. And he would not easily pull out these quills ... they stick like fishhooks. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> This is a bad movie made worse. <br /> <br /> What else can I say that a dramatic bs about a child suffering from divorce, wanted to see a movie right? Yes, maybe the bear should have been a child or something to eat. At least it would be more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time on this.
