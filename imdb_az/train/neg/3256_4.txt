I won it and watched this night. I'm honest, I must be 20 years from the end of my life. I remember this is a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not remember to be so bad! <br /> <br /> I have a project that has so much potential to be so flawlessly concealed. Who am I for that? Written by the scenario (and I use this word freely) 2 children? Casting directors who are so horrifically distracted by at least three main characters in the story? (Only 2 of them are "incredible 5"). The author refused to accept it clearly and left bad stories terrible music and everywhere bad. </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> This is a funny book adaptation I have not passed a week since I read again. The first 15-20 minutes of the movie are fewer or less (actually, LESS) parallel to the first issue of the comedy. As I watched this night, I wondered - why did every detail change? Doc showed the clock control in his hand to unlock the safety and the sniper's bullet lost it 5 inches because the refractive bottle just left the same thing. I would like to say, WHY DOES THE CHANGE IN THE SPIRIT OF ISSUES WHEN I WILL STUDY? <br /> <br /> After leaving Doc's HQ, almost nothing is like the comic. Roy Thomas, probably watching the book). I read somewhere that they really incorporated elements of two different novels into a movie. Again - WHY? I heard they changed because they could not afford the budget they wanted. I look at the movie and think ... MONEY IS EXPLAINING! Explain what I saw on the screen! <br /> <br /> You know, when people are complaining about Joel Schumacher, you really need to take a look at this. The best thing to say is that the 1966 BATMAN feature creates a great dual feature, and it's probably a great triple project and the 1980 FLASH GORDON. All 3 films are "meaningless". Maybe the 1966 movie (and the television series) "blame". Some fans complained that Adam West was destroying the image of comic books in the generations of BATMAN's non-comic fans. I can say the same thing for Hollywood. Especially in the late 1970s and early 80s, as I have seen, I actually really remembered how many of BAD movies were based on "classic" characters: Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, The Lone Ranger - All Hollywood-type "OH, funny books" have been "killed"! They are more "foolish." What is the loss of the potential? <br /> <br /> Some good things can be said ... The scenario and management Ron Ely is great.When I read a DOC SAVAGE story, I do not think of James Bama's paintings, I think Ely, Bill Lucking (later on A-TEAM regularly), Eldon Quick (I've seen somewhere else, but where I can not remember) is horrible. Gleason - BREAKFAST KLUB, with a passionate and revenge completely closed me (no teacher in a game where he is not teaching anywhere it should be forbidden), the film might be "incredible 5" Pamela Hensley - though its part was almost unrecognizable from the original story - terrible. Before I left my hair, I realized that I was looking at many hell like "Ardala Valmar", and I was reading this morning by John Calkins BUCK ROGERS. Then there is a big nose - just not exactly. The Difficulties Ardal The 1936 movie seemed more like Princess Aura or Cher. Or maybe Streisand. Select Location. (Then he really got a plastic surgery from the George Tuska strips - then he was surprised!) <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler, quite funny, I've seen in the SMART episode of GET last week. Is it surprising that he has something like a character to play? I do not know, because this character is the title of the film, not the film.
