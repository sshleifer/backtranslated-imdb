Two nights, on DVD, he watched "jealousy" in his friend's house. The premiere of this film is quite promising - Jack Black and Ben Stiller are in a very comedy, but not completely. I watched him with about five friends, and no one laughed for the entire film. Sugars (little and far ones) are not funny in any way ... the story line is bent and never answers to questions ... What does NEs do? Of course, the answer is no answer. This movie has no comedy value and tells a few other users that it is almost worth seeing, just like Christopher Walken J-man. None of the characters are developed, the surfaces are relatively transparent, and the song should have been funny in the film?
