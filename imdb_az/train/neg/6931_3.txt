A foolish rich man of about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental shelter to see how a renowned physician cares for his patients. Although initially responding to the enemy, it is soon invited sincerely and is bestowed by a good doctor. And the doctor speaks as he does, talks and talks! And while speaking, the loonies run amok here and there is nothing particularly productive. There are some moves (and some are quite disturbing) here and there, but it is surprising to see how boring and cerebral it is - the horror of life and energy. A person who thinks of a chicken and a garment becomes even tiring. Later this tour accepts the visitor, and is worried until he understands that the prisoners have taken the hospital and tortured their keepers. Nevertheless, in spite of this twist, the film is incredibly lifeless in many places - especially when it's a strange ritual, moving slowly or people are just walking around. Only employers found in a prison cell, in the famine, have the real effects of the film. Given this effort, it is difficult to imagine drilling it, but there are people who make this cheap exploitation movie! <br /> <br /> You know that now I think this was one of the episodes. original "Star Trek" television show! You know, Lord Garth is the Master of the Universe, and these terrible and terrible monitors with Kirk and Spok are prisoners. <br /> <br /> One last note: The film is somewhere here and there is nudity and aggression, so be aware - it's not for kids. In fact, considering the worthlessness of the film, it's not for everyone! However, printing with the version of "50 Movie Package - Chilling Classics" is incredibly bad, so it is difficult to see this whole body, which is so dark in its diameter.
