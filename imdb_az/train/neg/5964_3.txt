The version of this movie I saw is titled "The Hero goes out of Tomb". This horror is a bad Middle Age magician starred by the legend of the Spanish horror Paul Nasin. He plays Abanazer in a church hall pantoda. A stupid generation (as I think by Naski) is coming out of the graveyard, the parents return to their home and unite the wizard's head and his wounded witch. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, after the head and body come together, all hell remains empty, and many die. Like all the best wizards, Abanazer is here your favorite assistant. This was another Spanish horror, played by the beautiful Helga Line. Like every woman in the film, it always removes the line. There are many nudity in this film, and it's not just a woman - even to see Naschi's unique body is not a very beautiful sight, I can tell you. The film is sexually littered. <br /> <br /> When Naski and Line discuss their bad plans, they suddenly resemble one another's nubile young blondes. <br /> <br /> This also reminds Herschell Gordon Lewis put his hands on a human trunk to erase his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is very effective zombies returning to the end. You're still scared by a fever and it's not up to you to go back. What is shame? But the scene of the zombies is the most ludicrously inactive moment of the film. All this happens with long shoots, and we really do not find anything until we see figures that go away from some distance. There are many garbage moments, such as poor adjustments. <br /> <br /> When a worker Nashi's head falls under the hypnotic spell, she has a magnificent part of her face, and it goes on forever and has no purpose. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a great fear film, it's fun enough. Of course, the version I've seen was probably an American version of a dubbing that cuts pieces. All I know is the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
