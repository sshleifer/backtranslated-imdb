The tendencies behind the house where the house is being destroyed may be of interest, although the execution is open. I do not even know where to start because I'm having problems with this movie. I think some of them will be: <br /> <br /> 1. Operation? Do you know that when you see Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and teeth) starred in your movie, you worry about it? This is not very important to me, but these are not A-list names. Susan George may have been in a few films but I'm not the biggest actress ever seen. And in this film his player is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Spirits or spirits or any mistaken ride.at they wanted to call them reminded me of a bit of dreams at Disney World. And they are in fear. And why should they be so clear? <br /> <br /> The plot ?? How can a movie be predicted? After seeing three main characters, the result of this film appears painful. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie taking about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies. <br /> 4. Temporary Priest? You just have the chance to have a haunted house on the way down a group of Japanese monkeys on the road? One of them asks you if you know the history of your home and that you have come, knocks on the door, and needs to get rid of the evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else? It is difficult to think of any positive to write to me. I suppose I will give a point for the opening scene and the architecture of the house. Is there a sure sign of victory for the winner? <br /> <br /> As the highlight of any movie, the movie, which records architecture, does not say much about the actual movie. <br /> <br /> I will stop. I need to know what you have said before. And I did not even mention the annoying little girl or the Crabs Invasion or many other problems. Be careful, this is terrible.
