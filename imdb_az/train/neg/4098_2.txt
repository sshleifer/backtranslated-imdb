This is better than the first "Mulva" (though it does not say anything, I paint it) still silences. Give yourself a blessing and avoid anything from those with Low Budget Images. I was forced to buy some DVDs to support some filmmakers, and the boy regretted me. Some have not yet been officially "released" (film buyers have not been bought by them) and I can not even tell how bad it is. Do not shoot anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack because they have made friends with other smaller movies. If you're a kid's friend, you have a chance in their movies and have fun with them. But for those who have to watch them? In no way. Bad video, bad sound, bad mood, bad plot ... and so on. They are not even funny. Debbie Rochon is about this subject, and I just gave it to one. Maybe not even worth 2. To show that the 1/16 star is a bit better than the first one (I would also like to give it to critics). If you do not want any budget movies in your budget, buy something from LBP's "friends" at the Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even increase the Stakes. These are really worthwhile.
