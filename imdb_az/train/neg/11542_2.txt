An unpleasant woman and an unpleasant man is violently attacked by a group of two-dimensional psychopaths in a violent and creepy manner at a nightclub in England's Shropshire city. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, * p (You know, Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been released if they were easily prepared in the 1970s). What happened with Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrible and destructive, but Dan Reed is trying to slap the viewer's nose in the last block of a sort of sexual unwillingness. His camera is vulnerable to Anderson's naked body, both during and after the attack, as well as scrambles all the characters in a flimsy sea of ​​two-dimensional clichés. Scenario symbols come from the speeches of the "center" of the "victim" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> after the suicide, transforming the symbols into faces of more angry situations (attempting to kill Adams Sophie and Alice), Alice's Heffer attack, Dyer is a terrific actor (he celebrates my words in Eastenders), which is not the only defect in light and shadow as the young man's victim of the first attack, but Anderson is unusual. Because the ugly scenario has forced her character to be repulsive and laughable, she is characterized by an unusual compelling and complicated character, such as a cheerful hedonist who is in trouble and needs retaliation. <br /> <br /> Then, a flimsy and meaningless movie, with almost a very impressive central female performance, did not survive.
