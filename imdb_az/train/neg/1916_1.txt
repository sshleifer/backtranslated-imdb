This movie is totally trashy. Some imbecilic intellects that reassure themselves by doing everything they can to claim the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. There is nothing more than a self-confident cataract. <br /> <br /> If such a film is found in the United States, it will make itself a great joke. And because of the "other side", she is a masterpiece of her own, well-known for brainwashing and / or brainwashing westerners (some maybe George W.). <br /> <br /> As you can see in this film, Soviet intellectuals are the ones they think about all these years. Therefore, maybe they deserve all the difficulties they claim to have done. NO NO! Like many others, I have read and watched the real masterpiece of true Soviet intellectuals. For example, something related to the dog, White Bim Black Ear, is a book by Gavriil Troyepolsky, and Stanislav Rostotsky's film is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true sadness, real pride and dignity, one of the best in the Soviet era.
