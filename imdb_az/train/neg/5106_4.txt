ALIEN LOVE (This movie, as it is known in England) is a very strange movie. That means I'm not saying an esoteric art home movie with the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, which means a TVM with blasphemy, sex, some really good T & A, bad script and a very retro sensation. You can imagine someone like John Hughes, who just led ten years ago, of course, would cut off T & A. <br /> <br /> One of the problems when returning to the real script, Amanda is particularly motivated. Why does he take Connie at the bar? So can he be acquainted with a stranger? What would you say about retro? Since the mid-1980s, the majority of films were of this type, and most of them were more defined and convincing than those done here. The storyline continues a non-incoherent, illogical, and illusory path. <br /> <br /> Behold, ALIEN is watching LOVE and it does not just appear on T & A. Like a fantastic comedy, FLESH is better than GORDON and EARTH GIRLS
