It's incredible. Is anything other than this? There is no chance. In this film, the idiotic Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo will also embarrass. If the first part of the array had a mid-level dialogue and, secondly, a bad dialogue, then there is such a dialogue. Amazing. But this time the story has been reduced to a level of dialogue. Despite the player and the dialogue I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will definitely kill the franchisee. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I'm surprised that such soloists realize how anti-democracy and dictatorship are. In this film they clearly target the United States? a democracy. Why do anti-military films come from Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe and others? Not targeted? Of course, most of these places can produce a cube soon, but next to this point. As you can see, garbage writers are amazed at such modes, whether they know it or not. <br /> <br /> Even those who have almost always attacked the US foreign policy will be prone to anti-democratic beliefs. <br /> <br /> When returning to the movie, it is not even funny that there are many clear illusions in the film. For example, two men managing a cube watched for a while and talked about the pain and sadness in the project, but the first one suddenly turned against the system! Anyone who has no idea about human nature will survive this stupidity. Or is this a bad character, a ghostly bad bureaucrut that speaks as it is in the evil Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as this creature has seen, the film loses all the seriousness of the seriousness of it and, consequently, it becomes a comedy.
