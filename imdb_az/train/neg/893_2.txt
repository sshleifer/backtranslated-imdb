Even though I bought this DVD: "It looks like a beautiful comedy about love and relationships in Portuguese standards? I was totally wrong! What a heartwarming movie! First, this is not a comedy, it can be very melodramatic, a cheap drama, Portuguese soap is worse than opera! Secondly, the plot is very boring and does not get anywhere, it does not have a structure, it just runs like wind in one direction or another? Production is also bad! The mix of sound is horrible and sometimes sounds, which makes me 80 years older Portuguese movies have to be reminded that the actor should be very good? In summary, this is not the movies that Portuguese films will develop! Actually, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've ever seen in the past! Bad argument, bad behavior, bad production! , but worse than my imagination! Just do not forget it!
