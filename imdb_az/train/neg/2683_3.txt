Did you wonder what happens when several characters from the Beverly Hills 90210 are put into the Thai Prison? If so, this is your movie. This Midnight Express MTV is for the crowd. It would be good, but the story was poorly executed. Frustrated places, weak dialogue and unresolved issues. This unusual film did not win the right to be confidential after the end. Potential spoiler and incredible continuous line of trick - when a hotel worker finds girls there is no room there and full of tension when it intends to remove them. (Actually, he has played with strike and weight at the moment, but just like when he was in a warehouse). Later, the same hotel employee found a place - and Bangkok is a big city, I think you were there, and I testified against girls, as if some free Mai Tais sentenced to 40 years in prison. C'mon. Instead, rent another day in Paradise.
