Hollywood's Jack London's attempt to turn his life into an "Jack London" adventure film is not a bad idea; Of course, he brought an interesting, sometimes adventurous life. However, this film remains flat and dissatisfied. The most important is the lack of integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has some London conversations; and his bearded jack with the buck dog, in the snowy mountains, it's nice to have a "Wild Call" after just spending a good time. Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very nice. The film draws paralelles of "Yellow Life" in both London and the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
