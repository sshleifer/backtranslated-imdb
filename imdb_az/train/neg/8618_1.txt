Incredibly horrible movie. I recently watched a part of T.V. When I looked at my heart, my jaw fell and listened to the mind-set drivers. It would not be possible to produce something that did not look like a scroll on a single line of ceramic master. It was as bad as it was for me to move Rodney Dangerfield's body, shoot it around and shout: "How can you do it?" I hope that many movies will be making money from an actor or subject. But Hollywood, show some respect to your audience. People are sad and scary to pay for such trips. Outside the desert, even in the afternoon, meets television standards.
