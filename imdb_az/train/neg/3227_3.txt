This is a taxi in the notorious Guinea Pig series. Short-lived Japanese TV show shortly after a show of psychopaths inspired by the murder of a young girl girl by the show. In this series, almost all other films in the series, with almost no story. A group of young people have taken a young woman. They close her and continue to torture her while making her video. They beat her, pour boiling oil on them, use pliers, and eventually hit a needle in the eye of "loving". This is the simplest and first of all Guinea pig films. Probably, this movie was more than any other, pledging to be a chinchilla in Guinea pigs. Without a doubt, Nicolas Cage's inspiration for the film "8 mm". These films are very popular around horror. They are more polished, but have been shifted into equal-length films such as Naked Blood. Perhaps they fill the gap separated from the Mondo films, they have been cleaned up and the reality is TV. It is not recommended, but it will surprise those who see it once and will be surprised to know what I did afterwards.
