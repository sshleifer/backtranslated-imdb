In my opinion, this movie is not worth the worst, but Janine Turner behaved badly, except for fantasy, foolish plot, dumb spell and unjust divorce. Even if you do not even worry before you ever see this movie, that's not worth anything. Janine Turner, a good thing about this subject, had to do a good job. Terri's husband has acquired a clever advocate who, in many cases, won and even lost his killers in most cases. He thinks he's very smart, but he's really a nut. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and betrayed her. Beautiful girl huh. Yes, he is not a true peach. And there is no day at the beach.
