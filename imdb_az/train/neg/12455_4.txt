When I was about seven years old, I was watching the Prime Minister. At that time I was a great comic book reader and expected a lot of super heroes. <br /> <br /> I knew that Diana Prince was aware of "Emma Peel," because they were recently over and Diana returned to the Amazon form. But in most parts of the film, I thought I was very bored. The last suit was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a violet than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my youth. Not too good. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, so it was incredible, but his movement was better. <br /> <br /> <strong> The story is better and the show is more epic turned to the summit. A very funny book was as much like a mild spy movie with a superhero story written by an unprecedented person. Amazon elements were interesting, but there was a need to expand. <br /> <br /> The film forced producers to return to the drawing staff, and a bit more camp and low budget. The budget here was pretty low, and the super heroes were not cheap. <br /> <br /> If the film is a comparison and a historical document, it would be good to have it on the DVD. Even Superman 4 is available and there is nothing in this movie (except for Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). For the sake of the enthusiast and a little inspired and worth the look out for future versions.
