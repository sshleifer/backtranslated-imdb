A film that relies on the soul, the obsolete stereotype of the mad scientist frenzied. The film's longing for life is about a surgeon to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you never heard of it before! Of course, all these films are gradually becoming more and more erratic and creating a bloody, bloody, vibrant life. For a prospective installation, you would think it would be at least a bit stubborn. It's wrong. Like many movies of this era, this idea is beautiful, but the execution and the scenario are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (but Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still cakes) ... but not one of the stones.
