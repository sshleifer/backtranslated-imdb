This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Bran√£ogh was very distressed, emphasizing that he could not imagine his lines. The land is definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name. It has never been published as a book and has not been released in theaters. I did not even look at everything. I decided I did not care for who it was, then realized that there was no "whodunit" to care!
