I felt that I was watching in a hurry and angry, but with different actors and a bit different. I will say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So if you want a fast car, then you'll find this movie absolutely fun. I also liked him for Nadia Bjorlin because I saw him in the days of our lives. She was a really good singer, but she gave her so terrifying songs to read in this very bad movie. I tell songs about the car; It's not exactly what you will do here on the radio. Since you are a Hollywood movie, you have to give the story a little, but I do not think Nadia Bjorlin, a car that drives a racing car in real life, is the engine and lead singer. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, everyone who wants to capture 25 million in a car race is a walnut. But Natasha was cool at the end when Natasha stood on the finish line and screwed Michael over. Expensive. <br /> <br /> RESULTS: This movie is for car freaks. So if you want fast cars, then I recommend it.
