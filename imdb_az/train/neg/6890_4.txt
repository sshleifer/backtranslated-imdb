... except for Jon Heder. <br /> <br /> This guy kept the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The field was fun. A 29-year-old boy (Heder) is still living with my widow, Keaton, who is about to experience a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is anxious and eager to lose his life and is trying to sabotage relationships. She also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I love the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but the ones loaded with Hader would be better than selling hot dogs on the beach. Heders' performance is boring, and it can be a good thing for a bad guy to play, and it's a bad player to make the man lose in the finale and get lost. Finally, you still want to see the person personally and you get angry until the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be the only way for me!
