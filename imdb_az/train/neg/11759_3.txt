This is not the case for those looking for later South African miniature miniatures in the 1980s. This is not a historical drama. On the contrary, history is a fantasy that has nothing to do with jokes, but simply uses an African super hero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela to give Sinclair a strange story. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are a few funny moments as Shaka blew himself up in chains and began to hit some serious dogs. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I do not imagine that it would be twice as good as the body. <br /> <br /> What is Mungo's name?
