Ah yes, in the 1980s, Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and many other action stars are a time when captives are hiding in a remote forest. At that time, RAMBO did not have movies, ACTION, and UNCOMMON VALOR (And ridiculous RED DAWN forgot?), They did not believe they looked like each other. we have a wing agenda and very bad history. TROMA'S WAR is a cheeky tongue in this kind of cinema, but you should ask yourself, first of all, needs spoofing? Of course not. TROMA'S WAR does not have any development - although there is no real difference between right-wing tyrants and left wings - sometimes more sensitive than the one being shot than the film. Maybe that's it?
