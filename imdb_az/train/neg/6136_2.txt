Buck's role as Kahn points out that Bob Barker (of the right price) works in the same way as his own show. But it's more than giggling and snort through the turkey. As a "hero" facing the baby, Kurt Tomas demonstrates a range of acrobatic skills. There are many spooky moments (mainly in the village of Crazies) and some gentle impressive martial arts sequences. However, any "Ninja" movie will be more fun and you will not feel guilty about laughing.
