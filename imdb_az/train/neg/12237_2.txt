Original Claymation Rudolph: Very Good. Original Frosted Cartoon: Need a little work, but it may be bad. But smokey and Rudolph on the fourth day of July? C'mon! Give me some time !!! It was a movie that was not made. That was bad. In particular, he did not go on any strike except July 4. This is particularly bad because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be destroyed by many singing. Often this song has been designed to really look more like that. The film mixes two familiar Chirstmastime characters with the American traditional holiday (which seems to be "limiting" to America), mixed with numerous trivial songs and a bad plotline. The result? A filthy movie that can not really be watched at any time of the year. I'd like to leave this movie even if you're like Frosty and Rudolph.
