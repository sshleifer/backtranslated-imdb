When the movie started, I was shocked to see that I was shot with a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera trembles and looks worse than the average home movie. DVD movies should have even better production values! Heck, a large portion of home video uploads to YouTube, has a better production value! Very often, the film is stuck on a tripod with a serious camera and turn it into a - no camera person visible! There are some scenes in the neighborhood and something similar to camera work, and others have closeups that have a very weak or weak frame. Yecch! <br /> <br /> This film is about two gay people who want to get married. Almost ten years ago, their only choice was to get married in Vermont - it has definitely changed. However, the final adoption of the gay marriage can not be attributed to this film in any way - it does not really help the film as it is wrong, and does not really try to solve this problem seriously. According to the film, religious people bear BIBLICAL EVERYWHERE and shoot men who are narrow-minded when men and women find out that their spouse is lying. I am sure that gives both parties an honest chance in the matter! <br /> <br /> Gold line - Nothing about the film shows any professionalism, and I'm afraid to call this movie. This is not a lot more like a home movie and should not include a list about IMDb or the IMDb's Bottom 100 list of the worst rated movies of all time. The player is strange, the writing is terrible, the direction (if any) is horrible, the camera is terrible and terrible. This is a home movie! I do not rule out that Ed Vud looks like Oscar nominees for films, and I'm sure if everyone who follows such behavior smiles Mr. Wood's excitement, I can not say anything positive about it! <br /> <br /> If you are gay or not, I have no idea - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how DVDs are created. I think one of the actors burns on the home computer at leisure! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> By the way, if a woman is a true attorney in the movie, is she capable of reading a crucial condition? <br /> <br /> Finally, if there was a serious and important subject like homosexual marriage, is there a better movie than a problem solving? This, unfortunately, only invites you to laughter.
