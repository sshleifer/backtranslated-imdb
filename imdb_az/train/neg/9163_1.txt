The Leap Years stars some of the heavier hitters on the local and regional film and television scene. And still, they can not keep this movie. There are so many things to do - acting, very melodramatic, poor scripts, inappropriate direction; and for that very little is good music, good cinematography. This commentary basically focuses on all the movies and is for everyone who says that all local movies are bad and that all local movies are bad. Please do not underestimate the others based on a movie. A television soap opera, masked as a romantic feature film. When I got my ticket, there were many hopes and hopes turned into a five-minute movie.
