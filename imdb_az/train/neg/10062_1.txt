Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How can I do this? I do not believe that this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see the theater with my brother, because my mom forced me to tie it together .... o God ... where do I begin? Area SUCKED. The sound of the steering wheel. Animated SUCKED. The end is really SUCKED. If you like this movie, SUCK TOO. And this is the biggest film, Futuramafan1987 is an TOOL, PURE, and simple. This is not a movie for anyone crack-addled for ten years with Game Boys, who thinks that Pikachu is God. I still cry because of the horrible heart of this movie ... and then Pikachu's Hungarian ... I have not even started the horrible confusion of the film. All in all, it's one of the most boring experiences of all my life. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Go out, find each copy of this movie and turn it on. Turn on all and then give a good rent as Aliens ... or Bowling for Columbine ... or Back to the Future!
