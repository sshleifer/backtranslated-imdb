I really have problems with this film reviews. It's gorgeous, it's obviously a lot of money. Gere and Denmark are tight (although his screen personality can use a little more definite and spicing), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, one of the really sick films can not help, but it is surprising that the director likes and likes to show his own scenes, and yes, he can not help but wondered how much the photo would inspire such a film. /> <br /> Completely artistic, these 9, but I really have to ask myself these people have been giving money to produce such a movie ....
