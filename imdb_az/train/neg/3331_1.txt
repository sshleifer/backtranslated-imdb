I'm talking about three beautiful women in California who are going to join the festival (or something). All the hotels are ordered to spend the night in a creepy old house. Those who do not know are a creepy calm who wants to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. Boredom, meaningless, totally stupid "horror" movie. Bach and his two friends are, of course, beautiful, but the movie itself is dull, dull, DULL! Bach and his friends are no actresses - their faces are empty all the way. Last "downloaded" are laughable predictable and have no blood or gore to keep you excited along the way. Some unequal women have nudity, but this is not enough to save money. Bump, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 whole way.
