It's very simple. <br /> <br /> It's a very moody comedy for friends, youth, and young adults. <br /> <br /> When they were extremely successful, they worked hard until the end of the last 10 seasons, most likely they could say that they defeated Seinfeld's 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Because of Seinfeld's 9th summer season with great writing, Friends (and I'm very generous) were the most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 horrible seasons. <br /> <br /> A soap opera that started with recycled humor and recycled character did not start in a good way, and then saw a 100-fold deterioration. It's so hard to see how much people appreciate it. This is really terrible.
