Sweetheart, darling Without knowing what to expect, I started watching. I could not believe I was seeing. It happened when I thought it was a comedy. The plan to seize the government's terrorist leader is to fall asleep in a man who is unarmed and wait to catch him and escape with a missile pack. Only if this is really easy. Finally we saw a film worse than "Plan 9 out of the Foreign Space."
