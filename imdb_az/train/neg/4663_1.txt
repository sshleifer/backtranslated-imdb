This film was just right. I love war movies and usually get away from most movies and find something I like, but this was not one of them. This film did not have substance and intensity. I get it, the Finns raise a fight for hell and it's great, but the story is weak. There is no contact with any characters and there is no real story line to watch. If you go from one scene to another, nothing will work to create a story that is trying to be delivered. If you want a war movie, which will continue in a strange and strange way without war scenes, I would suggest the "Downfall" (German WWII). Or if you put on a great storyline and a lot of action, I'll offer the "War of Brotherhood" (Korean War / Korean movie). These two movies will not downgrade you as the Winter War.
