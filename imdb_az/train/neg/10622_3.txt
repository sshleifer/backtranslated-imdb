I really have love for Christopher Lee, but it did not come up to his other speeches ... and he was one of the better players. <br /> <br /> Not for the movie premiere. It's not terrible, it's a melodrama and it's climbing. <br /> <br /> Every time I thought, "Oh, HERE is a good part," the good part never came. <br /> <br /> The devils are not convincing. Most other characters do not have depth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I were in the right way, I was pleased with some of the MSTs at the expense of this movie, but .... Naaahhh ... Indeed, effort did not seem worthwhile. It was not really good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
