Even though I'm not particularly fond of the movie, most of the movies I've read are easy. Even though I do not like the genre, I know big movies. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. The hat cat is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is complete (Myers is as good as a cat, only he is really annoying). The silent songs that Cats read were dull and monotonous for the children of the audience. The plot is drifting and the audience should suffer from poor dialogue. "Stylish" parents' words are not negative, but funny (therefore, they are called "xa" in comparison with a garden). Although the movie is really short, FOREVER has been abandoned. Do not waste your time. I know little kids who hate this movie. If the kids can not stop it, I do not know how it can be for adults. I do not want more smoke on this movie, but I do not feel like spending time writing this article about it. BUT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life following it! See a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 star - the lowest review I have ever given a movie.
