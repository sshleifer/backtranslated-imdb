ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not Richard Harris's best hours. Harris, a fisherman like Ahab, enters a game with a whipping killer whale after killing the whale's "spouse" and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling, a whale expert with Harris. She is very shy to tell her how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and ends up in the Arctic, which is fighting against the whaling flame. There is no special effect on the ballet's eyes, except it looks like a round mirror, with Harris's infinite shots on his watch that he knows who the whale is. One of Harris's crew, Bo Derek, has a particularly bad job with Orca, and Robert Carridine, including Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, will not go too far.
