This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's not just a story, but it's bad that the player is shocked. <br /> <br /> This is considered as comedy / drama / romance, this is it! That's a bit of a move. Indeed, there is no comedy and drama. <br /> <br /> I apologize for going to the cinema to see this. I do not recommend it at all. Anything you look at will be better. It's pretty much a motion / crime movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not really care about a good story or good activity, the scenes sucked and the crime story can be predicted too much. You just want to look at a foreign movie just for the exterior. Then this can be for you.
