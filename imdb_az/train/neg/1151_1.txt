This film suffered from extreme pain. <br /> <br /> The heroes were very cold. Mother, the main character, is everything but "mother". Ok, she was happy in her marriage and always put her husband and children. Her husband dies. She then visits her son, and he answers the hunter when he lies with her and sleeps with her. The movie is good until this part. It's not perfect, but it can be watched. The boy is tempting and who can sin? Okay, it's not a lot of sleep to sleep with your girlfriend, but let's talk about the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She is completely cautious with the boy. I think of the part that I did not like the movie. She wants to ask "me an old way" with appetizers when she's working at her son's home (always something to learn). Indeed, the boy is not very interested (in fact, he seems more than he considers sleeping as a charity) and is insulted rather than going to sleep with him and asking him to be beautiful when he is insulted. "I love you," he says, when he insults in a very bad way, makes him desperate. <br /> <br /> What makes me angry in this movie is that the mother does not have respect for her. For the first time she sits together, Craig says something like "I'm not just a figured stick." <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to women. If he had been with me, I would have had the same satisfaction and very little emotional pain that would have taken me a small object ... :)
