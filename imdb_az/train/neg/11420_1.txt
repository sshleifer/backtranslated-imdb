St. The Fire of Elmo did not affect our lives after the university (in any way, for our common people). Why was this debris? Who can really be related to this? Who lives like this character? I'm really sorry for the actors who are dealing with this terrible post. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" that has done a good job elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I found this movie insulting my intelligence. <br /> <br /> <strong> Over 80 It's the same mistake you've been watching because you enjoyed most movies. This is really a genre attack.
