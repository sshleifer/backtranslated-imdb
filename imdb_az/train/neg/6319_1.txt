This movie reminds us how university students used to protest the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> While some guys were working without a cheeseburger at Cow Dung College, the president was going to immediately change all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the concept of a dangerous policy. This is the end of the world if the USSR and the US go to war. <br /> <br /> The US and the USSR have never been in the war. <br /> <br /> We can not just conventional weapons, another war concept, a "victory" war in Europe and Asia. <br /> I have to get rid of this movie. <br /> <br /> A good example of "How to shoot a movie is to be seen by movie pupils." <br /> <br /> This should be 0 stars or perhaps black dots ...
