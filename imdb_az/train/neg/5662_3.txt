When I read most of the other comments, I felt that it was a very bright way to the film. I found absolutely the previous Zatoichi movie detection spark and after just a long absence on the screen, it just proved to be the best of the best things to do. Another review compares the first Star Trek movie to the original series - I'm totally satisfied with Star Trek's similarity - millions of exciting fans are waiting and waiting and the show is back and moderate and sterile. <br /> <br /> The plot is unclear until now, (though the last YANG Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is bloody) and is not the heart of the original. I have not given blood, but some can be extinguished (especially with cut nose and cut heads). In addition, the time is not good for Ichi - it looks like a frustrated and sad man in this movie (much more, more than ordinary) - and this may not want to see some of the lovers really. <br /> This was a very sad turn for Zatoichi. If you do not want to be like me and do not want to see every Zatoichi movie, this is very inevitable. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version.
