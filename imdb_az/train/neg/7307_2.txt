This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. These events are totally random and have little or no meaning. Despite the subsequent occurrence, I can fall into a situation with the cabin fire (I SORRY). I describe it as a mistake spreading to a newspaper because it looks like a different part of the things involved. Kevin, the pancake with his mixed lover, is strangely bizarre, then a little strange and deaf cop, then attacked a casual boy who was drug addict and then clearly helped. then he begins to have sex with his comrades and comrades, since he says something stupid about an inferior plane. After a few good old-time racism, a karate kid watched a rabbit running on Kevin. In this film, they can be used as a joke as a racist fact. Unless he likes Eli Roth, there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie, even though he did not make me like this movie. Hate speech is a powerful word, but you see it as the only one allowed to use it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
