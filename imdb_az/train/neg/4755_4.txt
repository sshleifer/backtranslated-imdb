I thought the parts of the movie were good. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie was good. In the first 30 minutes, the angle of the camera was strange and I did not like the fact that they did not cover actors. <br /> <br /> The last 25 minutes of the movie are really not the best we can expect from such films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The time, its OK movie, but not gr8
