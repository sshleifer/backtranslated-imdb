This movie is awesome. Everything in it is done before. There is nothing original. <br /> <br /> A girl celebrates her 13th birthday and wakes up like an adult. Hmm sounds like a great movie in the 80's. Something else hates is Jennifer Garner's player. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he behaves just like a fool. <br /> <br /> Since then you can predict the whole structure. He is doing a good job, and this is a friend who has 13 working with him. Wow, how awesome! But not .... his friend is bad and is trying to get his job done. But, of course, when he comes up with a "big" idea, he is victorious at the end. <br /> <br /> The film has a dance scene that I've seen for a thousand times. <Br> <br /> I hate this movie.
