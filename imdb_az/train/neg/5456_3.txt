Only one of these ugly movies you find on Live TV shows, showing empathetic behavior of some disgusting women. Along with other bad movies, such as "Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this movie is a disgusting crime and attempts to show why the audience is not such a bad person. Give us a break! I have a question for filmmakers: LeTourneau was a man, and Villi was a 12-year-old girl, would you take a picture of a sympathetic and empathetic person? Answer: I do not have hell. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you have sex in this movie, and then you see myself and others counted as worthless garbage here. When they were sexually transmitted, there would be no attempts to associate with the offender. Instead, we have to imagine a horrible and ugly man who was raping a young girl, her delicacies in prison, and the velvety victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The only reason why LeTourneau does not accept the same treatment in the movie is his sexuality. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Straight and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. He is a prisoner in prison, worthy of our appearance and hatred, but unfortunately it is not a pity or regret.
