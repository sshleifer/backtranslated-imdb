I looked at anime, but I'm not a fan of immortality; I do not read the cork. I say this because most of the poems about this film are owned by those funds. Although I have seen St John Wort and she is transparent with any imagination, it seems to me that everyone loves me because she has been forced to take Shinobi. <br /> Yes, I watched this afternoon and fought hard to watch. Yes, very nice - slow moving water scenes, autumn leaves in the trees, and even the CGI eye flicker - outstanding. <br /> <br /> Someone seemed to have taken Romeo and Juliet, but when it comes to saying something like this, they say: "Hawk, some of the suits, even the battlefields, have passed through the stars, and for a good measure" X-Men "Two of the characters shared Wolverine's authority - a man dressed in a suit had his claws and a gray-haired man could heal himself, and then there was a girl with a poison kiss - Poison Ivy (from Batman) The poison girl shows her feet, then kisses, Man, this is a great power for you, and another girl can create insects from this yellow dust that creeps in her hands, another woman, one of the stars, passed through her lovers and had the power of hypnotic look. <br /> <br /> I'm facing a bit more than expected, delivering her up quickly to the end of the movie Some people are comparing it to the "Flying Trench" and "Hero." Do not make that mistake, but share similarities, but similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - other films are produced by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at the age of 12-18.
