What is hell? I saw Matrix and I was amazed. This is the most spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> They were unable to become Wachowski brothers to shoot this film. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can not argue with it. In fact, this whole movie was a burden of talking, and I did not get the wrong idea, I had no problems with talking movies, but all conversations in Matrix Reloaded were an illogical burden. Then it would continue to be a long struggle, a more slippery sliding, a longer battle scenario, and always the biggest challenge. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves still has the worst performance. I knew it was not a good actor, but it was a joke. If you watch movies watching them in their films, they would gradually become worse. God knows what a performance is, there is something Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: The only throne in the tree will be no actor. <br /> <br /> After the first film look, this was a great dissapointment. If you have not seen the first movie, I'm coming to watch it, but do not waste your time together with it. <br /> <br />
