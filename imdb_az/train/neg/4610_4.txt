I watched this movie because I saw that it was Kari Wuhrer in the movie. For a long time, he had a theory that he was a talented actress, but never seemed to prove it, because he always has such a low budget B movie. He is still beautiful, and he is still trying to move on to the failed material I have ever seen. This is not the case. The film is often ugly and uncomfortable, but this is not good. George Wendt was faced with the type and it was as tough as he could get for his role. Another note about Mrs Wuhrer. Her heart was tightened since I saw her last one. Otherwise, reducing operations or removing implants. This is not a bad thing. It still looks great. I want to see him in a better movie.
