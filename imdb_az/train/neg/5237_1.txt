Not even the worst movie out of the UK in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In turn, provocative, intellectual and controversial attempts to create a depth as it fails. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the powerful cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finner, completely built by such a bare scripts. It is not surprising that this is the only thing Andrea Dunbar has done for the night. Complete and completely debris at each level.
