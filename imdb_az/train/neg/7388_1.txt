drss1942 really took my words out of my mouth. I like the early films of Segal and I feel just as loyal to her. I only saw this movie (ok, I'm over 90%, so I did not see the last one). When I woke up and on the DVD menu, I noticed that I did not obey one of the movies and did not dare to learn what happened in the end. There was something strange about Segal and others' voices. The original Mad Maxi reminded me of the voice, but in the same language (Australian English, right?) Anyway, if I had 10 bars, this would invite Segal to unfairness.
