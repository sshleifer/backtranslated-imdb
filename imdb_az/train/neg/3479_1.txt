I went to see this movie in the movie theater and was shocked when I was in the room. There was only my girlfriend and girlfriend! This screamed me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> The film was strange for me not to be surprised. Ben Affleck plays a boy who purchases a family for Christmas. It is a predictable narrative that is in love with a girl who hates her. His actor is OK, but the film is not very good in terms of comedy. <br /> <br /> The peace line is weak and the comedy is virtually impossible. <br /> <br /> Along with this, there are some good points. <br /> <br /> I hope this study will stop the other people from losing their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room !!!
