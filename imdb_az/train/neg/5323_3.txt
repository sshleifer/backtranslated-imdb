In the previous 34 comments, I do not believe that this movie is a clear break from Yesterday's Birthday. A man is hired to bring a blonde lip that looks like a gangster's requirement. Lovers of cunning weapons and blonde love and then lives happily ever after. The gangster is in a difficult situation. However, yesterday was born an intelligent treatment, although there are so many blooms. The Technicolor DVD is scary. Natalie Kalmus would roll in his grave. Check the pliers. Know her? But it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock's Roll. Ewell is also interested in a new format offered to CinemaScope.
