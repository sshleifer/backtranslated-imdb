Perhaps more people are afraid of the dentist - small monsters or scary guard dolls. <br /> <br /> Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when she and her spouse cheated on entering the pool, , bringing anger and frustration into action. <br /> <br /> I said it was a brilliant idea, but not necessary, but also to be delivered. Particularly ending is a great fall. The last note: Watch for Mark Ruffalo (this is mine for you, Eternal Sun ...). <br /> <br /> 5/10.
