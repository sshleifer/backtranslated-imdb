"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing happening to classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" has a lot of spin-offs, and some have been good, others are not much .But the "Loonatics" is the worst .This concept is fool and "Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans." There was no similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and weak. New designs are ugly and animation is very miserable. This show does not just work .The horrific loss of this animation is a complete failure, and this should be nothing but a ghost. Lame! For the stars
