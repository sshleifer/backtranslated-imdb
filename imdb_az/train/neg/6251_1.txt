The low-budget film was able to hang on for only the first twenty minutes. The most surprising absurdity was that American prisoners in the North Korean Camp camp were seriously deprived of food and medicine, lying in dirty and dirty parks, lying in the dirty and naked ground without bathing. continuous torture - they always focus hair hair perfectly. Harry Morgan, in a view of the military as an army of great, except for the casting and acting is simply frightening. Ronald Regan does not seem to stick to describe a single character, and instead of the past roles are more schizophrenic. A deported North Korean officer may be forgivable, but allegedly Russian officers are commonly known as General Burkhalter from Hogan's heroes, who allegedly wound up around wearing Nazi uniforms, including jodhpurs and Jackboots (revealing suit-division WWII flicks) speaking with accents, well, that's just bullshit six types. Do not waste your time on this.
