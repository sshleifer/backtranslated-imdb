Finally, after watching this movie in full, I'm completely mysterious with the love that critics and online users have. Is This Worst Thing? No, I do not want to say. But when I saw "the last great American West" I applied it a few times? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A film that we're trying to explain is like a convincing dialogue, and a dialogue in this movie is among the hackneyed and clich√©s I've ever seen. The film is measured in feet per minute; How many actresses or actresses forced by the scenario to say something that nobody really would say in real life? There are many things that draw attention to this. Sweet lines come to you in the waves; predictable, indefinite and often. <br /> <br /> If you do not worry about a bad dialogue, then how about bad sound bombs? Some Westerners, while trying to draw you into action seriously, can fight with an incredible weapon. There is a funny edge for such weapons like Silverado, but Tombstanda's very early stage gunplay is very staged and very hard choreography is another reason to leave this movie from the good West list. <br /> <br /> After the movie was over, the filmmaker was saving a bit, but since then, I've been saving the movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from these deficiencies, we can surprise the images. the film's good shooting and settings are very good. The actor is unhelpful, especially given what actors have been given to the job. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that if you're looking for the ultimate hero of the US, give yourself a favor - instead of renting Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> From 3 to 10
