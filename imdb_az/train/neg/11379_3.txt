When I saw a small scene in some announcements, I thought it would be entertaining to watch the show. The little robot guy looks a little cozy. The animation style is familiar to some classic shows. Before I showed the show, I learned from some sources. I regretted there a bit. Three children (Tommy, Gus, and Lola) sounds flat, but Robotboy is no exception. It would be nice if a young boy would describe it. Good example Robot Jones, what happened to Robot Jones? Show is not really bad. But my only criticism is that Robotboy is not properly described. So I do not expect it much.
