* McCabe and Mrs. Miller * are in the Pacific Northwest on the threshold of the century. John McCabe (Hirsut Warren Beatty), an ugly, dirty mining camp, is full of cigar smoke and great ideas about setting up a lounge / doctor for a city to walk around in the film's three most sadistic whores. He also comes with no reputation as an armed force: he is very upset to advertise it, but he is not afraid to use the alpha-male credentials among the local population. <br /> <br /> This hampers the construction of a hall at 15 gepiks per hour. <br /> <br /> Ms. Miller (Julie Christie) looks like a surprising pressure, a half-rail car, half a car (Altman found this thing?). Mrs. Miller enters McCabe as a direct business partner, requires a new mix of whores and a bath before entering all the guests. Noting that McCabe does not know how to add it, he also insists on managing accounts. <br /> <br /> McCabe's function is not open. </ Font> <br /> <br /> McCabe urges them to smoke - fifteen thousand. The company finds it overwhelming, and McCabe is employing a conspiratorial trio just to kill. . . although they think they could go away in killing a broad daytime man in the center of the city, as McCabe's prostitution partner is unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> McCabe and Mrs. Miller, in the words " classic Seventies movie ", should be better. The film tells a very good story; The main characters have the potential to be of interest. There are some tempting scenes, including a 14-year-old stone being a cold killer. But when you hear what a truly challenging person really is, it's hard to use a movie and when you can make it harder to do what everyone else is doing. Once again, this filmmaker sings his own film with flawless criticism and tact. Here, according to the trivia report on IMDb, the film's editor, Altman, said the voice leaked; Altman did not agree; When the film was released, everyone complained that the sound was dirty, the Altman editor charged. (Nice.) Along with the bad voice, the movie also has a strange look. Only Robert Altman can hire a world-class DP, such as Vilmos Zsigmond, and take a film that looks like it's spraying camera lenses with dirty dish. The reviewers who praised the "dark brown glow" of this picture deceive me. The interior looks like something dark. Foreign photography is even worse: Altman has placed 500 fog machines behind many trees. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text- align: justify; /> See - I can not watch a movie under these conditions Come back to me while learning all the subtle Altman-esque dialogs and learning to place boom mikes when you wind up with some Windex or something From 3 to 10 stars.
