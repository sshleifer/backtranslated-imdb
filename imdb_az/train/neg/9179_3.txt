It's cheese. Everything you want is a video game, with the look of flat-of-the-computer cutaway sequences for action, the full movie was really cheap for really special effects. My friend and I, in fact, have never seen it since the main part of the theater is empty and we can do it a bit. <br /> <br /> This movie really needs a merger. <br /> <br /> Land? Was there a plot? Okay, some stupid colleges or the next species were invited to "rave of the year" and one of the islands of San Juan ("If they were only in Seattled, they would stay alive") - to be directly quoted. They went there and everyone went and the site was a bit broken (but hey, the keg is still full!). With the help of a strange old captain and a coast guard, Cynthia Rothrock, a bit less tough and slightly better, struggled with zombies (some siphoned off), listened to freaky legends, and killed more. <br /> <br /> This is not like BAD like Demonicus, but not much, and Severed better (they are my personal alpha and omega type for bad movies - old bad, but fun to entertain, and lots more to watch the latter bad freaking). On the other hand, if you expect a great video game like Resident Evil, flee! <br /> <br /> Ok, some real big questions (with many spoils): How did the 18th century Spanish ships enter the north-east of the Pacific? Why are lean weapons in Northwest of Paschal and Kim - Kim CANADA, loudly crying? Remember why an unnamed rave (oh, apologize to me, this "isla del muerto", straw, right) is in San Juan Island - and in outdoors, it is still the TRACIK NORTHWET. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus> Most of them. Everyone owns them. <br /> <br /> Finally, when the movie started with a bit of "parody" (when I knew what to do with the jaws), he did not have it. <br /> <br /> Okay, finally, the introductory words (one voice "When one of the characters was accidentally mentioned," one of the symbols "led his fiance to his fiancee." By the end of the film you will be with a sword GOOD is not a fence but a few men run with one sword.
