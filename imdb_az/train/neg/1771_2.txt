This should be one of the worst films ever seen without doubt. The only thing that is interesting in this film is the kaino performances of some great genre directors and King himself. The film has a great imagination, but the story is about 15 minutes away. I liked Madchen Amik in this movie and I think he could have a very good career in the movie.
