I saw the movie last night here, but I thought it was too long. Secondly, the things I've seen in the movie were so many in my thoughts that I thought it would be a comedy movie. It's not funny in the movie: the fianc√© is hitting his daughter and supporting him. The movie was too long - talk about sleeping and wonder when it's time to wake up and still play! When it came to somebody was a lot to catch - as a woman's singing - I felt like I was watching a spiritual song show here almost! Perry can come and make it better!
