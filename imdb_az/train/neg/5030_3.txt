What's in the sky? Is an airplane? Superman? Errr, no? This is a mess! Look, it's Cold War! There is nothing but bad news and other issues! Americans have fired a Russian fighter jet over the Artic region and the subsequent explosions are defrosted and literally awakens the old turtle turtle called Gammera. He is not a very friendly person who can destroy everything and everyone's way. The controversial governments finally decided to kill the ugly mess with the new and very sophisticated ice bombs, but is there another surprise at the Gammera store? The fucking turtle flies! This first time results in a rather strange and exciting sequence! Gammera suddenly fell into the back of the beat with the hands of the fire, and slipped into the air. How can you not love this? Then there is a strange subpopulation on a child who is telepathic who can communicate with a monster, but it is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people! However, there is very little to write about this Japanese (and again American edited) Sci-Fi effort, with 20,000 Fathoms having a clear and totally shameless classic classic like Godzilla and The Beast. Effects and monster designs are extremely hockey and unlike any of the above-mentioned movies, there is no success in creating apocalyptic ambiance. Distinguished actors such as Brian Donlevy (The Quatermass Experiment) and Dick O'Neill (Wolfen) do not know which movie to film, and even the original Japanese mix scenes are not very convincing. Although Gammera's very own and individual theme song is pretty cool, it gets an extra point.
