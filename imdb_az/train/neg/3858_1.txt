What a terrible, scary, movie! One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I generally love movies like this one, "A man faces an eccentric woman she loves, but she's already in contact with someone who is not right for her ..." I did not think that you expected anything. Movies always mix the comic and romantic's true amount, but that's not it! Every joke is flat and "romanticism" wants me to vomit. The character of the headline is one of the most "I ask you to kill me" on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more quirky and annoying. "Someone else" is the most reasonable, mature person in this movie, but also annoying. These films are straightforward, there is no way around, you do not waste your time.
