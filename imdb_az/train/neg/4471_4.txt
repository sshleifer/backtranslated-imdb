It was the best I could say about the movie, and sometimes it was gentle fun, and it was a long time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is very annoying that also wanted to collide around the characters. It's a very cute movie, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, when things are breathing in the dialogue, things get tired. When there are no potential coincidence on the screen, this is not really bad, but often afraid of the lover's frequent conversations with each other.
