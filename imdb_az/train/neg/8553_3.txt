This is actually a pretty bad movie. As with these tables, as in subsequent times, ideology is also not wrong. However, my main ideas about the film have been so long that it is inaccessible and quite frankly boring. The whole concept of the previous SAS, which has not joined terrorists for any reason, is not very convincing and can not help wondering whether a group of highly-ranked terrorists (and then a very soft one) will fall for it. The film begins with a very strong scene, but it has grown to a great final for a long time. In general, I think the winners may have an interesting 45-minute episode, but the story does not carry a feature film. Although this film is largely successful, this movie has lost eighty-five percent of Collins's career, mostly cheap and suspicious, of soldier-of-fortune and army films. Since compassion is really a versatile actor, at the end of the day, Martin Shaw chose his role more carefully and still has a successful career.
