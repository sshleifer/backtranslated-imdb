This movie is incredibly bad, and I'm sick of it. At this point, there was at least one good thing about the other portions. The first part was suspenseful and sweet. Part 2 was defeated and fun. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 was great music, good special effects and new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is even more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice returned with a very nice blonde, Dan from the 4th part. In sections, this Elm Street taxis are turned into a soap during daylight hours. The new character looks tough and even has a chip on the sweet Alice's shoulder. Freddy seems completely out of it. He looks tired and does not look terrible. Its a liner looks different from the place and can be quite laughable as in Section 4. The story of Leslie Bohemin will never come out of the way, and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that he looks good to my grandmother! The entire plot of this film is ridiculous and unreal. This is mixed and pretty stupid. Avoid the 5th section in any section!
