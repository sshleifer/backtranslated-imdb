I was not very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it is worse than both names. First of all, I did not like animation, a lot of Saturday morning cartoons, and worse in some areas. I liked some of the characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters, such as Cruella, were moderate. Cruella was really original, but later lost its quality. According to him, it was an ugly type of writing and animation. His cousin Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger did not smoke a night. The voice talents were very good, though, except for Jody Benson, Barry Bostwick, especially Thunderbolt, dropped an accent on me. There were some good moments, but the whole area seemed exaggerated for me, and I thought it was a great TV episode. All this is the end of the 60s Disney movies with the Jungle Book, the most memorable disappointment. Sorry, I can only give this 3/10, I just did not have tea. Bethany Cox
