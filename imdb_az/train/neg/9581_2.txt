This is something I can say about the film. Cleveland is a star, I've been there and I have not seen the city so well. Beautiful river and city pictures. <br /> <br /> This film is moving at such a speed that I hope should not be related to the real world. People are flying around and throwing weapons without any result. For example, there is a shot at the house of Rob Lowe's character - two cars have been stolen, and the police still do not appear until the movie. <br /> <br /> The endless number of street bullets that have been filmed should be ended. Most actors in this movie are better off. The film's history was not just to make sure the writers were not on vacation, but that was not the case. This movie is on the Universal HD channel. - If you do not want to be dissatisfied with Lowe, there's no reason to watch it.
