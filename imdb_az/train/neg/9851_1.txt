Worse than the worst David Lynch "confusathon", "Brain Dead" has no meaning. There is a cartoon called "Tom and Jerry", which has been leaked around the talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton). There is a complete character development. It just begins to rise on "strange scale", without lifting it in total chaos. Do not go to this question for the good players mentioned above. They are not given anything to work, and we'll be wondering what's going on in all of this, unbearable 85 minutes. I advise you to avoid any kind of problem with brain death. - MERK
