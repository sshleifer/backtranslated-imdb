One of my favorite actors, James Spader, was expected to be the least complicated film. It was not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest remotely in my hand and was fast forward. That's how much standard, something that's happening on every stage. You can even predict the word of dialogue. This is a butterfly's head and "How much is this movie made?" He is one of those films. There are some special fun special effects to say something positive. However, in general, if you were seeing 5 Sci / fi movies, or if you were over 9 years old, give yourself a blessing and skip it.
