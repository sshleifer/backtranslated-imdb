Undoubtedly Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and a talented singer. <br /> <br /> In spite of some scenes, very few players can go to the stage so far, and this has long been Sinatra's modus operandi. <br /> <br /> As in the 1960s, films really started to tank. The Tony Rome detective series had nothing but to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series. Perhaps, though, James Bond's competition has never been really done for Frank over these years. In the Shambles, personal life and music are exhausting ... Sinatra appeared as a shooting until the 1950s. The last major Sinatra movie of this era was probably Von Ryan's Expression in 1965.
