Read a horror film about the "thing" in the basement that feeds a nice suburban family and street people who are dealing with the death of their parents. Of course, there's more to this, but to say more <br /> <br /> For me this did not come together, because the film is trying to have two ways, both drama and horror. The film works hard to navigate the advanced route between two genres, but it is undoubtedly something that really is nothing. The latter does not seem to be less afraid of the unit, and then as "oh". <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I had not watched many scary movies recently, it would have been better, or just because I did not compare it with so many things. <br /> <br /> Skip
