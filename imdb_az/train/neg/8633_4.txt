I'm a great fan of Lucio Fulci; Its a lot of Giallo and splatter flicks have been between my favorites all the time, but it's not too low for the TV movie and the great Italian director did not come up with what to expect. The film is not as interesting as the majority of some of Fulci's courageous Giallo's or some of the cult classics; thus depriving both of the key areas and ultimately ensures that the film is not very good. The film works from a previously used plot, but still has the chance to spread an interesting story because it focuses on the subject of the latter's unknown future. This movie works on Giorgio Mainardi; I did not like it and there are not many people who have not seen him after death with a stomach bleeding. <br /> <br /> This means that her life is stuck in a place between life and the next life, and she decides to die and is the daughter of her only ally. <br /> <br /> The video saw this movie proudly proclaimed in the style of "HP Lovecraft", and this is one of the most accurate attempts to sell a movie I've seen. There is nothing in this tale to reminiscent of the great horror writer, and this is due to the likeness of Stuart Gordon / Lovecraft in the title similar to 'Beyond'. The film is different from the Italian style and the score is very good. Unfortunately, Fulci saw a good opportunity to roast in every field - as the subject is often annoying. The land is really boring, and most of the scenes merely try to find ghosts 'hopelessly' or find dubious doubts about their daughter's family members. This film was prepared for Italian TV and it is not surprising that all this is very restrained. There is a bit of confusion with the zombie and a nightmare sequence; but this is not Fulci, we all know and love. Generally, this film is extremely mediocre and is not a good representative of Fulci's talents. Do not worry if you're a Fulci complement.
