Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master of this movie. He was brilliant in producing a movie with actors who could not move. Moreover, he decided to write an incorrectly-guided script based on some sort of bad derivative. Put it somewhere, you'll end up with a movie that's more than a warehouse filled with mermaid and fresh cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain caused by pain is due to the fact that the genitals are carved with a spoon and all wounds are covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
