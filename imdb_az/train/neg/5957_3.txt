The unusual and low-minded (haha!) 80's horror is about thirteen in one correction, but this can be considered fun while watching in the right situation. Special effects appear to be tacky, the toy and the player scenario miss some key paragraphs! Brain tells us that in a quiet city, every young person works on the same pitch, and that cold boys in the middle school are in the toilet. A TV-guru here, Dr. Blake and his beloved cats begin to search for a nation's mind control called a brain. Under the label "Independent Thinkers", a giant chechen brain sends waves through television and forces the innocent audience to be killed! How cool is it? Now, to save the world, to the Meadowvale teen-rebel! The most interesting thing about the field, Dr. What Blake and his terrible brain actually do is explain nothing. There are clear references to life in the world, but that is true. Meh, in need of funding in such a film, really? Unfortunately, there is not a lot of blood left and the "bad" brain looks like a great socks. Less or less interesting element for horrible buffs looks at the castle and crew that shoots this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are "Bloody Birthday" (my guilty pleasure) and "Plague". Both are the best films and smartly decided to resign from the film industry. The person most familiar with the stone is undoubtedly the great David Galet, who will worship the terrible fans for his role in Re-Animator. Is a girl named Kristin Kossak giving a nudity factor and is she a clear skill? In his repertoire, there are 3 films that this film is his "masterpiece." His first debut was considered as a "fugitive model" and "3 men and a baby", whose character is called "one of Jack's daughters." How do I feel about my career as an actress?
