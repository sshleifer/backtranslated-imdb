I love all Tom Tombs books, so I am very excited and interested in seeing a movie after one of his books. I also knew that the film would capture half of Robbins, but after watching the movie, I did not want to read it again. Film Even Buying Cowgirls Blues does not cover the eighth part of the book, and Bonanza focuses more on love than something else between Jellybean and Sissy. Along with the incredibly weak cunning line in the movie, I think that the best players can be chosen to play the heroes. I thought that the only actors of the film had played Robert's roles. Julian's friends had the comments in the book's 5-minute clip at the start of the book. Those who did not read the book will enjoy the movie, but as a great Tom Robbins fan, this film was a disappointment.
