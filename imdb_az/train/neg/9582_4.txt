Together with the many strange scenarios that are thrown together, it adds to the smile of goodness. It is not as hopeless as the basics (generally, as in Dohllow), but it is thrown into the ground in the hands of the writer. <br /> <br /> Lowe is given time for a DUI who killed her lady in prison. Therefore, we see the fact that it is really BAD feeling about it, seeing it is a nightmare. Then his cell partner's neighbor hangs himself. Or if not? Lowe has some doubts, but they fall short of it. His doubts are weak, and bad men will not be troubled. Why did they correct him to kill him? Oh, this is where the story is interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ************************** <br /> <br /> I will not face an infinite calculation, but the end of this outcome. Lowe was stranded on a train by bad guys. He wants his job, because this tape will hit their boss and hit them. So, three police officers on the train have been shot dead and Lowe is ready to rescue. The bad guys kill killing the half-passengers and then continue to pursue Lowe to get the strip. SALAM !!!! the killing of three policemen in the public will turn you into a deep dodo, with tape and hell. However, as they did not exist as witnesses, they went through a shopping mall to fire and finally Lowe was caught and the bad guy still wanted a tape!
