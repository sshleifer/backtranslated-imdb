I understand that there is no need for BSG, and if I'm interested, I can watch slower shows, but with this series I'm not really interested and feeling bored. <br /> <br /> The BSG form looked like this: Action <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> I can only watch it. Actually, my watchlist for this week is below my list. This is a loyal case. The Syfi channel has actually destroyed the night of Thursday night. What happened on SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday nights? There was a good thing there.
