This film is very bad and every imaginably worse. It's not just a poor move and not a scenario, nor is it time to go out and go out to watch it. In fact, this film puts me in the hall in my room, writers and producers do their best to try and make the movie funny. Renowned actor Jan Reno is old and has learned his lesson in the first film, so she added a new girl to get married. In fact, all these additions and sticks bring me back this time, because my eyes want to get out of my nests, because it's a great movie loss. In this film, the torture of permanent camera shooting and shooting at any stage can become severe conventions. This second film takes its successful work and drags it out of the coffin and takes a parade on the square and breaks our exploration, not just the original idea and heritage. This film, in contrast to the mixed gas, had no place in the principles that came back to the necklace. There is no script because it is written to the agenda and added. Do not pay attention to the camera or shooting. Poor lighting and special effects made to do so. This film would not pass into a student film in the main film 101. How could this guy not cross? It was a great loss of investment and it seemed that no one had the power to put an end to this unusual tyranny from our troubles. Part of this movie is good ... its end! This movie is the worst 1 movie of all time, and finally, Howard the Duck is no longer a gas.
