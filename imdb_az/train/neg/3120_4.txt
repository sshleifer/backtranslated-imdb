I did not expect much from the "Night Listener" and did not see the cover on the video, but in fact I did not hear it. However, the film is very effective in increasing suspension and tension. It temporarily drags a bit, but it actually helps you to wonder what's going to happen and, more importantly, the time. As the film progressed, Robin Williams' character was dragged to some kind of "cats and mice" and he had never seen anyone in the past find the truth and existence of an unprecedented 14-year-old boy. The night listener is an exciting movie, plays a major role in establishing the film in a short time and is kept in the darkness of those who are lying and lying. But eventually he did not live up to this kind of frustration and potential. It would be really useful and interesting to give a detailed or complex explanation of the other main character.
