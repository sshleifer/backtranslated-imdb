I can not stand a lot of reality shows, and this is worse than with Paris Hilton, and I'm sure her company. But how many months did you "fired" or "hired"? After watching the show, I did not want to work from myself and everyone, and I think the painting is watching more fun brakes. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear one person get up and say, "Donald make money from me, earn money and get a decent hairstyle." Apparently, he tries to win WWE wrestling. Hopefully, it's a shame, so it's no longer necessary to see his tragic face. We do not want you to be fierce and do not have the capability to buy and buy yourself. I would give a negative mark on this show, but it takes 1 and it's not worth it.
