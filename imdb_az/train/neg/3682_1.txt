I have seen thousands of films and do not write any reviews, but the Red Eye I meet is facing bright shades that I am obliged to offer my two sentiments, and I only vote for the lowest possible score to bring the meanings to reality. <br /> <br /> This is just a dull, boring picture of a memorable film for the apologist portrayal of the target of terrorists (indeed a great man, John Bolton-esquire cunning diplomat, if you do not know). ) and oh-very beautiful and famous Dr. Phil (best-selling book, one learns, read by frequent readers in the world). <br /> <br /> Read and ask the above quotes from the Quotes before earning more than $ 10 for this B movie. you are very pleased with a film where you will find the most intelligent lines. Unfortunately, something else is better in this movie. The main thing is hell; actor is not bland and thirsty, with pro / antagonist chemistry; lagging potential is eliminated in each queue, with the exception of the last five minutes, with a weak router and pre-made editing; is riddled with incongruities such as violin: revealing the hero early as a college lacrosse stars are called as questions when fighting with an antagonist in a field hockey stick later; <br /> <br /> From the first class (because character development is a serious trainer) intermediate holes are wider. <br /> <br /> And then, as the high-level civil servant's daughter does not have a straight start, there are overwhelming moments for airport safety, at the first opportunity, to warn them of a conspiracy against the head of the National Security. Or the same woman, the towel air linoleum, the gun piston and the arches in his neck beering, runs the skin for paradise wraps while wearing 4 inches stiletto heels. Or his follower also tracks the trachea with a suction wound. When terrorists use a fishing pole to bring their weapons under the freaking harbor. <br /> <br /> It's almost a good thing to say about this movie that women portray. The use of the most extreme situations (even in the form of bimbo) is the type of sex images that are not possible in American cinema. In addition, this film will never miss, and the red eye from Boston to NY is no worse than a flight. Remember the last time in this forum or elsewhere by cheating trailers and shimmering trivia? This is one of those times. Wait for the Red Eye video and do not follow it.
