Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So Whoopi Goldberg films can be. But VOOPI AND DINOSURER? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex, I came to a conclusion that this movie is bad. It's bad, bad, bad, and condemned against the audience. This bad thing is not done with an accident; <br /> <br /> Firstly, Whoopi does not have good action movies (if you think I'm lying, see "Fatal Beauty"), but filmmakers don 'I have to repent - it's a difficult police, again. <br /> <br /> Found a million police friends this week? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br> /> Are you one of those who hate you, a confused, irritable dialogue, dull futurist FX and talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) joined a film similar to a tax report? Deleting ALL taxes? <br /> <br /> You are reading this review. Later, DESERVE. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No star, not one. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood's "Theodore Rex" is a continuation, Hollywood deserves to attack all the flock of wise cracking sparkling rubber dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now I'll pay for it.
