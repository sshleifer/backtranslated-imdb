This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for me. <br /> <br /> I say a bit, considering some of the options I've rented for this movie. <br /> <br /> I did it completely on netflix. The Topless scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was as fun as the dragging rods beneath my nails, because Roseanne Big Spender was forced to sing the song. "Skits" The stupid and youngest bathroom has the worst types of humor and dressing room, and this is an open (and poor) crush of Kentucky Fried Movie so you can beg for Big Jim Slade. <br /> <br /> If you are not a masochist, avoid this stupid outside.
