This is really a strange movie ... First of all, we have an American gymnast who wants to turn an actor (or something) for good reason (which I know for sure) does not have anything to do with it. It takes enough good roles to keep some interests, though it's fairly smooth and straightforward. Second, there are the worst sound effects in the movie! I'm not kidding. It only makes the movie extremely funny, but it's annoying. Hehe Third, we generally support a player supporting dignity (including any hot bread), in fact a very bad story and some cool images; dialogue, ghastly fighting scenes (sadly!), and the overall implementation of the scenario is poor. This movie would be as good as a white TV movie (very bad Fox did not exist in 1985). This is just one of the worst movies ever, but you can not even enjoy it, especially when you've been watching it and even once using it on television and cable last night.
