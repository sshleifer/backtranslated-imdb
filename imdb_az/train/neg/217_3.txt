It's just a movie that fits the image of a few controversial incest and lesbianism. These dialogues are awesome, and the lack of "sex scenes" is completely absent. High-school children are more likely to be interested in players and dialogue than for adult adults. It's a staggering and sturdy movie. It would be nice to have a story and more drama. Ah and it's something else: why are internal monologues used too much? It may seem to all the embarrassing movies for digital movies as well as to mature audiences who want to watch it. I know the means are small, but this is not always an excuse for flopping a movie. start using some of the best actors in your movies, and stop repeating them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not move!
