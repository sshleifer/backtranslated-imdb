I have to admit that I was not as bad as I expected in her Dead Body, and my mother wanted to see it, so I hired her. I just wanted to see the horror of my eyes, but in fact it was not bad. I was expecting this horrible movie, but it did not seem to hurt the writers, but the filmmaking of Eva Longoria (Parker, apologize) approached the film a little bit. I think it was a little better with him, it just bothered me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell were a decent chemist who made the film a bit unpleasant. But I have to admit that there was no point in this movie, it was one of the quickest payments for the actor's type. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">. But while her sister is taking her to psychiatry, Henry falls for her, but Kate removes her from the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to act quickly, and she will be sure Ashley will not be tortured by torture day and night, believing Kate's voice, does not believe me. <br /> <br /> His Dead Body is a very good movie, does not know if it's worth the money, but if I want to see or interest it, I'll give it a rent. Eva Longoria does not have enough stars to do just the movie, it's not a crime to those who love it, but only a small screen on a silver screen. In order not to mention Ashley's character, he does not like everything he has just taken, or his "gay" friend, Dan, just something he really does not like. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> With a little writing and attention, this movie it would be better, but instead we will leave the romantic comedy, which can be predicted, with empty emotions. <br /> <br /> 4/10
