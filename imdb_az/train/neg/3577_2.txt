This early Pia Zadora tool followed the formula of Harold Robbins: The pretentious character of the main character is in the collapse of the randomly selected but glamorous world, while in the film industry. But though it's totally predictable, it also manages to make it completely incredible. Zadora (as an actress to enrich her inexperienced as a charitable) is never credible as a screenwriter. You can expect a movie to have a few concepts in the film industry and the creative process. However, writer writers do not have one of the features of the film character: observation, vocabulary, love-hate relationship with their creativity. His character is empty as a donut pitch. And this is a pleasure not shown here. Cinematography is so dark that it is difficult to see what happened. The scenes appear to be the sequence of occasional moments on the Hollywood side, even worse than any other. Avoid it.
