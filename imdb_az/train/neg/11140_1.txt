I thought I would watch a scary movie and laugh all the way through the movie. At the stage where the man turned into a werewolf, I was deceived. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget is a fitting comment. I recommend Wolf (1994) for Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. Maybe they should be changed (for human salvation). If I do not want to laugh, I do not recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
