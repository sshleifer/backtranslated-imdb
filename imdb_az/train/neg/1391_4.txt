Before I prepared for a television movie, I had relatively low expectations. It is because of the release of the episode of the series and after many of the series works have gone. There are no Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, London, Vir, Qark, or Lyta. Remember, in the last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley permanently left B-5. Now for this movie, Zack and Captain and Doctor have brought back Garibaldi, who has no recent B-5 movie, to join the short and inappropriate appearance. <br /> <br /> This movie is a serious obstacle to this film, because old chemistry has been abandoned for a long time. <br /> <br /> Spirits stolen from a hidden pavilion by an archaeologist (Ian McShane) in a searchable Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) in a world full of Babylon 5. There are many fierce mumbo-jumbo things, but in a sincere way all these were ridiculous and meaningless. Yes, yes, the station exploded, but it survived and saved it all, but as if I was "something I've done and made it better in the past"> The secondary area for more than a comic rehabilitation, more It was very interesting, when an entrepreneur set up a holo-brothel and did not know what to do about it, and when he tried to put pressure on them, he jumped up with a claim. <br /> <br /> No, Sheen, in the first place, was doing a good job with the Autosoft - his eyes wild with the wild, and strange delivery. However, throughout the episode, he repeatedly fell off the character. <br /> <br /> Thus, the final decision is only for B-5 whole nut (like myself). Seeing this, others can accept that the array feeds - this is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that does not have time to get out.
