This is the worst movie ever seen. In my time, I've seen some terrible movies, but they take a sack, but wait, I mean, all of it is a curse. When I look at this evil, I believe one word is still bad to describe the way you feel. Please watch this and watch this thirsty purple dinosaur Barney's thirty minutes, then increase thirty times and still get a small portion of the horror just in the store. <br /> <br /> I think it's really a horror film, but you just want to be afraid of the worst actions in the business and a totally illogical story. <br /> Real Price, -10 Disgusting
