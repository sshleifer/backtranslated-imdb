I've been to the premiere of this movie in Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the presentation, the writer / director and some players were asked to answer questions, and nobody was worried about any questions. Rarely, a film has been so badly directed (why are the illustrations depicted on the earth had gone beyond a few stages?), Happiness (David Arquette, for paraphrasing Dorothy Parker, does not control emotional gamut from A to B). bringing a lunch) and is completely meaningless. Characters are absolutely characteristic of any reason, or they have to move in a certain direction. After a long time, the movie comes to an end with a completely random and meaningless end, which "really thinks of you." Unfortunately, you think, "I'll be back in 90 minutes of my life."
