The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte", directed by Iconoclast filmmaker Philippe Harel, is written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq. She also worked for the film's scenario. The British movie magazine Sight and Sound are known as "no matter what." This film welcomed a fresh air breath for French cinema due to the general theme of sex politics and its impact on two foolish IT workers. a very clear voice that brings us to life. This makes us feel as though we were watching a book that brought us the reader. Due to chronic sexual droughts, the basic structure of solitude problems is beautiful, but the hero goes through the hero explaining the difficulties he faces with himself and his friend. Rather than focus on the main topic, pay attention to its fall. Caution: some women can only find the film, even the two heroes as moronic misogynists.
