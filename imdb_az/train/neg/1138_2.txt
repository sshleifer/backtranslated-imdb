It was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt it was necessary to stop it, but it was upset that I made it and I was a little ashamed of the poor film. Everything is OK. If not, we will not watch a movie that does not make bad mistakes and Whitman's mistakes. If you want a cheese heroic story go for it.
