Marquis De Sade, Egypt, Ancient Gnostic Cults, Robert Englund in dual role, inefficient sex and nudity, murder and confusion ... Tobe Hopper Night Terrors on the paper, at least fun,. It is not. A small, fun-filled, twist-like twist. In fact, there is nothing more than some uncertain things about a cult followed by the De Sade, who deceives the daughter of a local Christian archeologist for a certain reason and who thinks it is necessary to kill her. This is quite a lot - so there is something with Gnostics, but who knows the writers' thoughts. Most of the film resembles the scenes of Englund, like De Sade, in the 19th century, when the hero was exposed to various strangers, sleep sequences and erotic encounters. The developers tried to do something serious, but despite their claims, they were buried with cheese, bad mood, sleaze, and fraudulent heads. <br /> <br /> There is not a very good point. Robert Englund, as always, is a leading actress, Zoe Trilling, is also entertaining, seductive, and filmmaking at various stages of filmmaking, though watching Night Terrors, even though she is not very talented. At least 90s, I've seen the movie "When you are a criminal like me" from the Australian movie certification rating book in front of a large number of VHS tapes.
