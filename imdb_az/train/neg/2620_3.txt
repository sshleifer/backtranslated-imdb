After seeing remake in 1996, Cruella De Vilun is the most exciting way to see the punishment for sexual torture only for the skin. The entire movie was pretty funny and in my opinion it was better than a cartoon. But in fact there is no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela returns, do not try to treat it and repeat it. Just keep him away from prison and make a rap. I thought it was not funny. Only one original puppy should be returning. I thought it would be digital, because it was the most attractive, and there was Roger and Anita. However, they decided to add a parrot who was thinking that it was completely rebuilt and that it was really a hundred, not even two hundred, but only three sharks and a dog. Part of Gerard Depardieu was meaningless. In the end, Cruella takes a lot of traffic, in a very humiliating way and the road is too exaggerated. Cook in a giant cake. This is a hopeless attempt of physical humor, primarily to imitate the same effect. It just did not work. She was too loud and did not laugh. I really like apologies about Cruella.
