I do not believe I spent 80 minutes of my life so hoping it will achieve a very good result, but the guy was wrong. The field was terrible, the player was very flawed and the special effects were terrible. Even 2 beautiful girls could not have a negative impact on this dull and bloody confusion. But I can not lie, some of the lines in this movie were so memorable as the Asian guy lost his unique "virginity", so you do not waste your time doing this unless you prepare stereotypes or want a good laugh. maybe so you can watch this movie to rip some of your friends
