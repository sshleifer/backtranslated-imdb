The film is Michael, who cares about elderly people. One day, he decided to kill some of his clients. Meanwhile, he decides to kill the Zodiac Killer in the 1960s. Zodiac Killer is in contact with the author of the book and creates friendship. Michael has a weapon (a single weapon, because he is not described as the same weapon as some of the other players) and one-off crime. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you love B films. I thought the idea was good, but the editing and the player actually drowned the plot. I thought the 'blood' was too fake, the lighting was terrible in some places, and the dialogue was just too standard. The film was shot in the film, but the film was just for some strange 'Plan 9' scenes. It's not a bad movie for the B-movie admirer, but if you want something a little more polished, go to something else.
