Amazing! Wow. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is that a girl's parents neglect her, so this patient claims that PokeMon is his father. Am I anxious about this? Then this strange PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to act as she does. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> I do not want the girl living in the Caucasus to be happy. The girl was just a bit of a problem. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Played with Unowns, was Entei's "daughter" and as it seems to grow up and "father" you think you can get it as a hint. <br /> <br /> Seriously. (Or do you see it, do not expect too much.) From 1 to 10. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon", "First Movie".
