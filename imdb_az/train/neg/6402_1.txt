When I saw this movie, in 1979, I was the first film ever to go out in the middle. There is nothing worse than just comedy missed, and it does not lose itself every time (although I can not speak the last 25 minutes of the movie). No sketches are available. Where I liked the charming gardens where needed, these sketches were unnecessary. More disturbing, this movie was advertised as "Robin Williams' first film" with a new name in the television series Mork and Mindy. But his role was so small that you can not even distinguish it on the screen.
