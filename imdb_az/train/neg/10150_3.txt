Humphrey Bogart did not really want to be in this movie and was forced to play a part of Mexico or stopped. Believe me, the wrong choice! Following the success of Dodge City, Warners followed Errol Flynn and Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and John Litel, now present. Miriam Hopkins to Flynn v. Randolph made a great mistake to present Scott as his love for Scott, and as a singer to make things really bad as he proves something so that he can not read it. The story was not bad, but Bogie clearly became worse that it was a non-Western West, and it was a very low budget, but justice would not help.
