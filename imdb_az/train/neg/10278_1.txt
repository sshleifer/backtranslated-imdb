The worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this movie in austin film festival in 2004 and thought that this movie was accepted at the festival. it was an interesting place and seemed to be able to go somewhere, but every time she tried to do something, she left one another. First of all, if you go to a musical art, find someone with musical talent. The music consisted of a piano piano with which they sounded like playing a stereo in their room. the words were quite written and they did not have a clear indication of the extent to which they were trying to attract this film when there were no clear motifs. and can you find people who want to sing a song during a musical period? this is not the case. Fortunately, half a dozen or so others were reading in the grave, but when they read, they begged me. especially when they try to read in harmony. and only music sounds. Some of the players were pretty good, but many of the dialogues were terrible and most of the scenes. No doubt, there was not enough coverage on the stage, or just a bad editor because they jumped the line and made terrific choices when cutting the film. at least the director was ready to admit that he did not want scenario until anyone wanted to have music. Hopefully again, I'm sure someone can write before I make the same mistake.
