The release of our "Gang" album in 1929-30 consists of two stories called "Hard Winter". First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, decided to make some taffy, a single home on a winter day. Relay relays for Mary Ann, a Little Wheezer radio show show. Problem: Wheezer transmits information from different shows and Mary Ann finishes putting soap in the mixture! <br /> <br /> The rest of the Gang, the magnificent moments that emerge after the emergence of the taffe, will occur. <br /> <br /> The second story deals with Stephen Fetchit, a neighbor / employee of Cetin. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "a difficult winter" has not been shown on television, although it is available on home videos. The reason for this is Stephen Fetchit's characteristic of silent, harsh and slow moving character. "Our Gang" producer, Hal Roach, called Fetchit "skillful funny" and used the "Our Gang" as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of the day. The characteristic of Fetchit is insulting to many people today, and why did he shoot the movie? <br /> <br /> Although a few funny moments along with Fetchit and Taffy, "A Tough Winter" is a plodding and effortless effort. After a positive outcome of this film, Hal Roach Studios grew up confident and skillfully engaged in discussions. The sound in the movie is good and some sound effects are very funny. For this reason, this film has opened the way to the 1930-31 spectacular "Our Gang". <br /> <br /> From 3 to 10.
