Maybe we can say "watchful" about this movie. Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes, which is harmful to my eyes and ears. I rarely disagree with the horror of this "b", but this film was a little bit frightened by the age of five. In a film, thirst for blood is a ruthless foolishness that should look almost like a god, as nothing can stop their maniacal anger, but the resident psychopath itself is surprised by the subsequent sacrifice of a chimney and, of course, with the entire legend of claus a strange attempt to pursue is a warning to the observer that it is not dangerous to be dangerous to a human being because it is very foolish. All of this is the overall film's efficiency.
