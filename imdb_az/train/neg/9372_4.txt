It's a typical late Universal Hero flick: its technically computer, if it's a cookie cutter, and some overacting, according to the numbers. The most exciting part of the film is the dubbing of Rondo Hatton, a man with bone disease, such as the film's "monster". He did not see the grief of the man, but he used the money bestowed on him instead. Hatton was less afraid of the studio than I felt as a result of more fear or longing. Martin Koslack entered the boat as a madman of the film and was very entertaining in this section. I'm happy to see Koslack in just one thing; Why is he insulting me? Only a fraction of the film I am presenting to me is that the movie is absurd to the world of art. Here are the bad art critics who are capable of breaking craftsmen; It comes with dyes, which are the "masterpiece" of the film's "hero". Sometimes our hero's work is examined side by side with the villa's absurd sculpture. The main critique of the film, on the one hand, also claims to have denied the hero's art at one point because "there are no such women" because our hero responds with conviction that the critic is not enough. . Finally, there is a part of the bride's marriage to a protagonist (a critic of the artist) .... it's absolutely anti-feminist and funny to be a witness. Generally speaking, this movie is very average, with some fun elements.
