First, what's good in the movie? Some pretty actresses? Exotic Background? the fact that actors will not laugh when they work (if I were in their situation)? I dont know. The story is simple: a catholic priest who draws abstract painting (another abstract artist) tries to find his younger brother and a male prostitute (when he was raped by another priest). I'm afraid that there's nothing to learn here, or a little bit of serial killing, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. With substitute actors and incredible coincidences (professor), the worst episodes of the worst season (a cousin, a girl living in a victim's home, a baby with a priest, etc.).
