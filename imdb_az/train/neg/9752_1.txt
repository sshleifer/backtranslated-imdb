Now I do not believe what we've been doing for fun. Stereotypical jokes about children and children, about death (and death training), violence, sex, children threatening, unusual, alcohol abuse, drug theft, non-active parents, helper carers, African Americans, police and greedy people In the middle of the night the house - yup sounds like a child's movie - NOT !!! Add dark and scary elements - add a dying woman who owns a house and who is entering a home and loving her husband for more than 20 years, and who is so sweet to all of her neighbors - children. Families - this is what your children want to watch - what are you trying to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie is very scary for young children, and I'm still afraid of teenagers. Someone is in this movie scenario today - so why should you rub your faces? As for the adult audience, you can not find it scary and fun - just boring, biased and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and bored friends, bad and manipulative babysitters and beer drinkers / lady boyfriends. What a great material for children - is it really a baby movie for everyone? Even computer animation and good sound is not enough to pay for this terrible whistle. Get rid of your money, get rid of your time and get rid of your children - Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Incredibles, Shrek, Bug's Life - better than any of these strange movies. Spielberg and Zemeckis - both of you regret for such a disaster, and then send it as a child / family movie!
