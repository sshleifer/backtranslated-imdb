I find embarrassing to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> alcohol, I really do not know about alcoholism I did not feel it was a movie. Alcohol, the real alcohol, of course, are very far from people. They say that the difficulty of the conversation is that the main character is not really a problem or that you are facing another problem, or that you love one part. It was a weak effort to create his cold character. Always surrounded by people! <br /> <br /> I was emotionally embarrassed by the fact that at any point in our life we ​​really have the character of intolerance and confusion. I could not get in touch with my character and did not consider my dad. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a very good player, not a tough guy featured! The clockwork was as subtle as a brick. <br /> <br /> McKidd was too old for teens, they had three different characters, or had to escape the teenage scene and concentrate more on adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> In a good note, I felt the little boy actor really good at the beginning of the movie!
