I'm sorry that you can not choose a zero star in the IMDb because I would not hesitate! Actually, I'm going to tell you that this movie is in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many, think this movie is Michael Madsen, and I think it would be okay to have this movie ... No luck! This movie was shocked! Imagine the length of a film, 'The Bold and The Beautiful', and Primal Instgin did not come close to this good, and I thought it would not be anything worse than the length of the movie 'Bold and The Beautiful'. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do it? The worst part I did not move forward was that in the end they were all shocked that some of us would have to watch such a bad movie <br /> <br /> Where is the starting point? Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zerrer - Zero Stars, Scenario - Zero Stars, Actress - Zero Stars, <br /> <br /> But I think it's very important to see bad movies It is very important to know what really is a bad movie. so I'm happy to see this movie, just a bad movie to put it under my blacklist.
