This is not the ultimate proof that Danny Boyle and his post-Trainspotting movies can forget about a totally dull, meaningless, meaningless, soulless and mute movie: "The Beach" has already been interested in it. This low-stratified strangeness is a good place to begin with, but it's where they are completely lost in medicine, resources, ego, self-deception, bad management or everything that causes the director's death fast. . <br /> Sometimes it's absurd: Two pests (Ecclestone and a bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, undoubtedly) coincidentally welcome and begin to read more intelligent asylum seekers than potential hits. A friend - a big loser - loses a store window and stealing a video camera in the form of "action" and becomes a manager of some music that shows interest in the film later. Now I know that in the UK in recent years there was no incredible garbage, but it's ridiculous; The music looks like the Oasis The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - translates lyrics in every song, and Ecclestone is quite arrogantly calling us to take or abandon children and do it pretty absurdly. Music is not just a garbage, but its "performers" are anti-social; these newcomers should call for shooting. It was so dumb. <br /> <br /> The purpose of the conversation is a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> This dialogue is unfounded and does not go anywhere. Frequently caused emotions - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete dragon. This small piece of garbage is very embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone's I.Q. it must also be questioned to agree to be part of this nonsense. Anyone who finances this Â£ 1000 joke should leave the movie business before selling their clothes on the street corners.
