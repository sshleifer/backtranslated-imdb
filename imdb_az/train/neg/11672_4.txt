Three writers have made a courageous attempt to adjust the novel by Jane Stanton Hitchcock, but still has been injected with a very melodrama and can not just get out of time. The composer Meg Tilly is used by rich, mysterious Ellen Burstyn who wants a wall painted on the wall of a ballet used by him suddenly. After receiving information about the last meeting here - Ellen's daughter came to the party - Tilly decides her artistic theme, her daughter died mysteriously before the start of any business, and the dead and the same are alike! Two perfect actresses pay their services with incredible yarn, which does not fit well, or does not fit any emotional intensity. Burstyn, Tilly, who plays a role in Burland's camp, adheres to the dream-eyed-waif routine. In the film, only one line at night (in the morning after horror) is accused of an honest, anger and betrayal. The rest are fragile.
