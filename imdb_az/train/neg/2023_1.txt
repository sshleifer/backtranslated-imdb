In a nutshell, you say that the most ridiculous comment I have ever heard in the RPG. Did you think you were sexually gay? Did you delay? If you go to get rid of your best friend, and if someone decides to help you with the kindness of your heart, you owe it to a man. Lavitz was a good man, and each time they helped each other, they made them a closer friend. They are not lovers as you accuse them of. Let the game be identified in the Middle Ages. At that time, women were only cooking while fighting. Do you even know your history? Do you know how long it takes to get women into the army today? Although this game is slow to capture it slowly, it's a lot of realism, and you really need to shed some serious evidence to comment on the story rather than ignorant assumptions based on your actions.
