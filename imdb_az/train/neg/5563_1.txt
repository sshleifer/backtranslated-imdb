Dolph Lundgren opens and walks through this unusual mystery / tension, which is not cool, as you do not believe in this box. It's really pretty good here, but the story is a mix of B-movie clich√©s (detectives, revenge, magnet, prostitute, S & M). Although the film is a bit less than the second half, RED SCORPION is rented for a more decent Lundgren flick.
