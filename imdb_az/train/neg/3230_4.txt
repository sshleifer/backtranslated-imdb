I just watched the Guinea pig - Devils experience. I must say that if this film had very good FX, it would have been a good time, not a good movie. Honestly, I can not say that I like this movie very much. Of course, 43 minutes of torture, shocking, true, turned out to be effective, but I found it very boring (not as strange as I expected). I also saw that the torturers always spoke harshly and neglected (and there are a few people who would agree with me). Now I saw the guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and in my opinion one of the best guinea pig 2 - Meat and Blood Flower. I do not say much about the Devils experiment that has been subjected to torture, torture and torture, and I usually give 4 stars thanks to FX because they are wise.
