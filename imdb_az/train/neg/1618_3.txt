I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I have seen Jacquet's previous film (penguins walk) and heard a very positive feedback on the radio. But I was seriously disappointed. And most importantly, this film is very boring. Actually, nothing actually happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we were both laughing. Because I only winter, then spring, then an eagle and a river, and once darkness, and a girl goes to a cave, the fox has another baby once "etc. About half an hour later I cried, yawning, rounded up my eyes, and I hope that it will come to an end sooner, but the film has continued, and when it finally came to an end, I was so deeply touched by Stephen Hawking that the most intriguing part of the movie was: a) it keeps track of the entire movie (one year) and shows the two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness, it's sweet, there's no question about it, but a movie about the nature of such nature would do better without the existence of all humanity. Eating with a moon, drowning in the river or a similar horror (b) By commenting on the girl's adult voice, she tells us nothing, obvious, dull, unnecessary things. (c) Generally, fine music. When the girl jumped around with joy, the music jumped around. Music threatens when threatened with an eagle fox. The first days of the film reminded me and it was very much anticipated to enjoy it. Certainly, most of the children who were watching the movie with me were obviously liking it, at least one breath. Thus, the warning is for adults only: If it's been for more than a decade, pull it out of the movie. In most other places you can get a better (and cheaper) dream.
