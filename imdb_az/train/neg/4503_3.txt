I was admired by Rob Marshall Chicago, but the Geisha memories were another failure to fertilize Western and Asian art. Generally, the scene is beautiful, but after careful not to regret the exotic scenes, some feed themselves. Excessive cherry blossoms, obviously, were often. Perhaps there is a cultural difference in perception here: beauty is not a beautiful appearance, because the really nice geisha is not western pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some comments are about the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt about the actress. An actress / actress can play any role that may seem like this. Gong Li is great, but the power of his feelings in this film has not been translated into the Japanese style. All I saw was a painful and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, I'm one of my beloved lovers, and I've never seen Japanese. Some ideas have pointed to the subtle and feminine characteristics of Japanese women who can not agree more. They are sensitive, even though all modern Japanese actresses are not suitable for Geisha's roles, and even two Chinese and one Malaysian actor who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture very well. <br /> Geisha is a good shot to boost the interests of the American audience. But the film would be an insult to the film itself and art if it won the Oscars for the best costume, best director or best picture.
