Someone should send that Uli Lommel boy back to MOVIE SCHOOL. He said he knew he would not give a movie to anyone. But can ANYBODY shoot a movie these days? Everyone in the past always needs a TALENT if he can shoot a movie. After watching the BTK film and others who do not want to know, it is clear that the poor man is filming films like me. In fact, I think I can make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has nothing to do with the BTK Killer, except for the names of victims and murderers. THIS IS EVERYTHING. Where did this guy get the great idea that the ICTK was killing people with rodents and talking about all the other horrible shit in the film? This is a classic example of one who encourages watching movies based on the term "BTK" for his reputation. Completely miserable. I think WORSE is the only serial killer film that lame "DAHMER" movie. This child made a nasty smell for me. Who said one of them needed to be shot.
