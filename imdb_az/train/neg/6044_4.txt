Unfortunately, he came together in a genre of serial killer, sealed with his own fruit to be truly happy. Willem Dafoe is superior to the NYC Detective who wants to watch something similar to a copywriter using the same Renaissance art-related killing techniques used in a series of crimes that he has solved a few years ago. Scott Speedman is Daffo's little partner and has a very good chemistry (at least for a while). Other symbols are opened to close each other. Clea Duval is a victim friend of the past and Peter Stormare is a number of artisan broker / mentor in the bustle ... Stormare, of course, is a bit difficult though, of course, is not boring. The film's end is particularly disappointing. See Deborah Harry as fast as Dafoy's next to his Harry.
