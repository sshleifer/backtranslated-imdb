It should be admitted that this version of Shakespeare is inhibited! No one can move, except for the nurse my fav! Juliet had good skills as a young man, but could not give emotional depth to his lines, and we really could not contact him. He improves the scene while thinking about drinking his dreams ... God casts his jealousy! I would pour it into your mouth to close it! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Given her other major films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), she is a very shocking one. And I start at Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to see that you are in the hunt to see that no Romeo and Juliet have ever seen the film's history. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, then Leslie Howard's version, and then available in Leo and Clare!
