Young people get bad days, go to a hill and fall where they can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, 2000 years ago, is a "mythological" buddy like his best friend and Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearance-and-sound. The Herculean boy survives the danger and then makes the modern life. So what's a big deal? This is the most terrible idea for a "family" trip! In either case, this was not really a try! Our mighty power and spoon nature are much more than a typical stranger to the rest of the universe. To add to blasphemy, there is nothing new or attractive, and before attempting to do this, there is an attempt to somehow violate the "family" entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains from above, though gaggling. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
