I have never seen Spike Lee's previous films because my trailers have never been interested in me. I've seen and admired Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work, and there are several DVDs. But I'm totally disappointed with this movie. If this movie is any indication of Spike Lee's directorial capacity, my advice should "go to work" and stop losing the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that some of the other IMDb commentators watch the movie I've seen. I just might have reviewed their sappy lovelorn, spying them out of their propagation by Banality of this thread. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How to expect a big budget like Blockbuster (like a nonsense in the media) in a short time? <br /> <br /> "Ron Howard would have directed the first movie ..." - This project can be done fairly, it can give more time. Although writing was fierce, the organization had some advantages. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. Sorry! This movie resembled a sad clich√©, invisible scenes and bad characteristics, and perhaps she could not do much. <br /> <br /> "Jodie Foster has played a role within three weeks." - And showed! It was incredible as a script that a description of a "Fixer" had to describe the people's problems. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> robbed the bank Would you like to go away ... or else? <br /> <br /> When the "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) entered the bank to verify that he was not a corpse, several bank robbers, "police" police officers, fled behind the front door in front of the "police" rather than behind a police officer was it possible? <br /> <br /> Det. Frazier then claimed that he had given the robber "every reason for throwing me." Why did not they try to disclose the face of a robber in their short struggle? He might have been able to get the answer ... a robber would shoot him so that he would not be identified later. And why did he take Steve, Stevie, Steve-O (robber-keeper)? <br /> <br /> I understood that they were not typical bank robbers. There was a different agenda and did not want anyone to suffer. But the police have no reason to do so. It was a desperate situation for them. Why did two bad guys go out to pick up a pizza? They were not taken. (first of all, how many robbers had gone out of bail as a shield? Is this Spike Lee's NY City version or SNL?). Taking them off reduced the number of bad people, shut their plans, and the rest of the robbers refused. If not, at least there are few bad people inside. <br /> <br /> This country's police department, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), will only allow and discuss valsa to access the bank. Will not the issue with the robbers, first of all, disclose them? He had no credibility, no credibility with the government; <br /> <br /> Why did the bank's Chief Executive Officer (Christopher Plummer) destroy only criminal records? long ago Pour on circumcision! <br /> <br /> He emphasized that he was volunteering and writing notes, with the Republic's emphasis. It was "100% Alban" but still could not speak it ..... SIR! WAY TO THE WEEK! Her old companion! He was a "skill"! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> When the suspects are questioned, why is Det? Does Frazier constantly put pressure on people who are not part of the heist? (Ie, speaking to an elderly woman who was able to go, and then could not, then could not, and then did not). <br /> <br /> After the bank robbers saw that they were placing the hostages in the jump suit, who could not get the runout from the bank that looked like some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, there was a fake wall in Clive Owens' section behind a hideout for a week ... from? (dry and gravel). He could also relax because he had cut down the canal. Did the bank employees not smell all over the week? Hi! <br /> <br /> After such a mistake; What was Mrs. White's "references" waiting for the documents to be taken from the chief executive officer of the bank because he had fallen into "robbery" because he was now blackmailed for failures? <br /> * And last, but of course, what is Denzel's "Electric Sliding"? What's up? Had he had to "settle" those issues? In contrast, when he tried to stop the bowel movements, he looked like a man on a shopping cart! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Outside the vehicle area; bad script; bad movement; and generally a weak leadership ...... or, and, yes, either. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, it will give enough insight into the film to help others do it because they do not want to spend money on the movie! <br /> <br />
