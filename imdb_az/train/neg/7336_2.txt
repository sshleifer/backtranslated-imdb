This is a very soft and inert product of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant games. I just suspected that the game was to ensure that the game was as accessible and understandable as possible before a Shakespeare audience. Nevertheless, each line was evident, and by clarifying each intention - the life spared and turned into a flat cartoon. <br /> <br /> It is a very difficult event giving such a nice outfit. <br /> <br /> The best of the game is forgotten - like Don Vallston, Benedick and Don Pedro like Douglas Watson. But others do not do so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a breathtaking, windless air line frequently shining the belts. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Gerri Mayer's Don John is at the Snidely Whiplash level with a silent cartoon character (Snidley pleasant). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Murray Abraham (you know, the man who killed Mozart) is not in this version if he is not in a disguise and withdraws his name from the credits because the manufacturer is Joseph Papp. <br /> <strong> Naturally, instead of the Muck Ado of the Branches - its version is full of vitality and humor, nothing more than beautiful speeches.
