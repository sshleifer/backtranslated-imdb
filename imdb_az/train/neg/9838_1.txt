This movie is heartwarming. The good fight scenes, or not, the actor is really bad, you can read the lines from a card. Delivering a painful line through everyone's difficulty. Watch the game of middle school and think of predatory inaccuracies in the interaction of the actor (with strange strokes occurring between different character lines, along with a rush of hurry from others). Although the whole movie is on the move, it can be forgiven, but most of the movie incorporates the style of the plot and the Family Guy, which is indefatigable (Oh, wow, it's too bad). I think they're trying to be funny, but still many high school / college students are trying to make a funny Youtube clip in the afternoon. <br /> <br /> Now on the battlefield. Given the quality of the film everywhere, we're not too bad. There are, of course, no other place near the same level as other posters (as nothing like Drunken Master). The struggles faced with a large number of scenic feelings, and many cuts had different positions with different positions. <br /> <br /> Generally, the only reason to watch this movie is to be one of the friends of a man who deals with cheap production. What kind of guy can you ask for? Oh, this is the man who wrote, directed, produced, and read this Middle School masterpiece.
