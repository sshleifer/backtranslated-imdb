PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst films I've ever seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a predatory boy taken by two parents, but then it is a concern. That can drive the Junior Dede. He scares people on the moon. He can put a room in that room! A bad movie like BATTLEFIELD EARTH. Finally, it's a worse fate. Give CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> Give me a ***** of 1/2.
