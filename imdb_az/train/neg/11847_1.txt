I am happy to see how bad this film is. At the beginning of the 20th century, as a pastry shopper in Hollywood, it's a new past or past. Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock and I see a film worse than 2. I thought it was time. Nevertheless, the intentions and conclusions were much closer. <br /> <br /> First of all there is a terrible cast: like Eddie Izzard CHAPLIN? Sorry? Peter, do you owe this guy anything? Like Jennifer Tilly Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marston Davies ??? Holy fog, these people do not even start to look or feel the visible period. <br /> <br /> Well, the Last Picture Show was a decent film, but it was a disaster. The rest of Bogdanovich's pictures were not the best. Welles & Hitch & Ford spent long before rubbing against it. It's still good to accept TCM.
