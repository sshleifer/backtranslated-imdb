How Good Is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is a good movie for him ... very bad, plays a role. I have not read a book by Jane Austen, but I do not believe that the surface and the characters are not much more than cartoons. The nearly 600-page demonstration of the book was about two hours shorter, but I did not expect much to see old furniture and tea cups. Every time I saw an actor who did not go beyond the anti-bull sign several times.
