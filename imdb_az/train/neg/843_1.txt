A BDSM "sub-culture" in Los Angeles serves as a background for this low budget and is cheerful, something open to rival player Celia Xavier, both of whom are Vanessa and Celia. Soon the question arises that cameras, illumination and editing pyrotechnical devices are weak and frequently interconnected, which will not be taken seriously by any sensible viewer, which will reach a point of contact. When Celia was used as a high-level trial director for Los Angeles County, the malevolent twins became an iconic figure in her fetishist world due to erotic performances on CD-ROMs, and the disaster was "Mistress Vanessa" Celia, to uncover her sister's attacker a new job as a "slave-slave" at the Private Castle Club, a decent, home-based "dungeon party." In addition to the officer who was killed by the Los Angeles Police Department, two FBI agent agents (Vanessa's claim that they are linked to BDSM sites on the Internet) are trying to ensure Celia's safety is investigated. In his new job, his enthusiastic performance is reasonably prudent because his customers create a personal threat to her. LPP's Operation-Southern Bureau is flawed logic and persistence as it is delivered to a region of the metropolis, away from the film's construction. Inactive and post-production adjustments and duplication of sound are incorrect. The photography gymnastics results in a batting installation near the last film shot, but it is very transparent to the scenario. Among these slippers there is a strong movement: Stan Abe, like a selfless FBI agent.
