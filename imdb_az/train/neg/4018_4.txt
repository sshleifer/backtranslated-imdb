This movie is very skeleton. This is a fairly low budget movie (hopefully!) That gives you some excuse, but the lack of a decent toy and lack of space is a lot of trouble. Phillips is quite convincing in his role as a predatory son of a self-seeking family (though his family is ... well, a little white ...), but the rest are working on iron sticks. Any potential potentially destroys by extreme melodrama at any moment, and there are many ways to go (this is a clear sign of plot deficiency). I do not recommend this movie to anybody is not a challenging Phillips fan, nor is it absolutely nothing. 4/10.
