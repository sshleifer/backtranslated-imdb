Bonjour Tristesse is like a member of the Wedding. a fragrant daughter tries to keep in touch with a lovely family member. If critics like "a wedding member", I find that Julie Harris is a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, decorative apple in everything. It's irritating, rich idiots, as it was last year in Marienbadda, but this time it's a travelogue. <br /> <br /> This is the development of the Preminger movie sequences, but there is no character. During the first 30 minutes, Seberg and Niven had to compromise the relationship between their parents and the possibility of sexually charged readings. After the conflict is over, Seberg can not deepen the required part. Kerr takes the rank and makes the movie 'Endless Love'. Seberg's important story is something like a strange Interlude - not good. I really wish NiVen to be in the role of another. <br /> <br /> In the most unforgettable sequence, the evening becomes a free port at a dance in a dance, spending lots of time to normalize Orthodox English behavior in all films. . Bertolucci calls the whole scene "My son" for free training. Kherr is a terrific actress who has a great deal of pain (Black Narcissus, Iguana's Night, King and I, Jennifer Allyson, Tea, and sympathy etc). <br /> <br /> Every film is a horrible actress car accident. <br /> <br /> People who are concerned about the uncertainty in life should avoid it.
