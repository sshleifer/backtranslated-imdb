I'm a big Stooges fan, but it's one and only recurring quality of this movie in Curley. She has been over-consumed since she has been drinking too much - it's her classic self (and Larry is not bad either). Moe's character is a straight line (mostly) and this movie will be better named "The Curley and Larry Movie". None of the Stooges films was very good (in my opinion), but as a commentator here, how thrilling it was to have that movie's real potential. Casting was good, well directed, filmed and edited, but the story line tried to think seriously about just some of the Stooges antics and musical numbers. you should think that this movie should be better than mowing and removing garbage (subject of discussion) in the Curley / Larry scene and wait for something to eat or eat in the rest of the kitchen.
