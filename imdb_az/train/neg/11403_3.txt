I love horror movies, low budget, 50, 60, 70, 80 ... but how can I tell you a good movie movie? Let's compare with the headlines in a thrilling home film. angry, changing, shining. or a Demon Seed for a horrific film based on a technology that is better than FAAAR (although FAR). Okay, I'll be fair .. let's compare it to movies prepared for television! Do not fall asleep. a lot of salem, night stalker, night gallery, even in the basement, or better on a dark farm. * SPOILERS * For a good scene, first of all, bloody shower scene, there's a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! The garden hose comes right down to some hips of some puffy teens! PEOPLE. And what we understand about the house ... as it is seen, should use its cameras to see what's happening and this is a very emotional home. is not a spirit, a devil, or an entity but a "possessor", but what is it? Is there a reason to believe in a lifeless object we learned to love suzie / margaret, the protagonist? Now I've been in a suicide ... another scene that totally disturbs me, this poor old naked lady comes from, she says she is your nurse, pours her heart, falls into a hot pool, fights in a 45-second torment, what does Margaret do? Is there any risk of being burned to get rid of this poor old woman who came to warn her of her life? no, it stops and waits for hours! For the majority, it was better than the average for a film of fear, but where the positives were. at least a more interesting and entertaining film about a dead object that follows the mortal bed that kills people: eating beds. People who have so appreciated it have not been watching since the original or they have been scared of as a child. this movie was quite worthy.
