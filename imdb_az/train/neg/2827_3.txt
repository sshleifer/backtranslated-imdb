The story of the beginning is interesting: 20th Century slavery from West Africa to Arab Middle East. The problem is that the film is denied by Richard Phillips' favorite enemies - Arabs and Germans. It is as convincing as White to hunt the "roots" of slaves to believe that we will be able to walk freely around men who look at many Arab men and easily be able to capture Blacks in West Africa. Undoubtedly, both trades are managed by the local population and (d) include more advanced networks. Israel is one of the worst offenders in the International Amnesty International, if Arab countries are involved in child and sex slavery today. So why just point to the Arabs and then choose Europe, the only recipient? This is the obvious mistake and hatred of these people by the Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The player is above average by Peter Ustinov (Suleyman) and Kabir Badi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is always as good as it is.
