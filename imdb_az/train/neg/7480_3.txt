When we get a bad day at the office, we all know what it is, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks just like what's worse the whole day trying to go to the office. Sometimes, it just does not value, what do I know? <br /> <br /> This was earlier in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that Steve Martini is not a very bad thing. comedian or harried and incorrect for the role as highlighted advertising exec; on the contrary, it also counts. And Goldie Hawn is equally inept; <br /> <br /> His job is consistently good since I first saw Rowan and Martini's Laugh-In TV sets in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is about New York and why everyone should come to live and love their lives to marry New York? species in the world's largest city. If you're a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look at what's happening in the 1970s, when the movie is a great comedy and everything that can happen in a most strange environment, the situations you can imagine and the eyes. This version of 1999, unfortunately, enters special tangents for a viewer who is expecting or want to see most of these days. For example, we do not agree with star players of key players, as we all know, Rudy Giuliani, then a community of New York (relatively long). Yes ?? Then Giuliani bucking up for the president? Worse? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ strong> <br /> But this time, as a brilliant Christian? awaits the hotel staff, who once fed up with the richer customers and who generally seemed to be the idiot of this role. And in this process, the best British comedy series, no bar, giving great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 movie? In the 1970s, New York was a city that died in many ways. It almost went bankrupt. So I saw the city you saw in 1970: terrible, dark, moody, uncomfortable, and finally Big Smoke (as well as contaminated and all). Things have improved since 1999: Glitz is back, New York grew up, if it was a moxie, it was Big Apple, ready to bite ... <br /> So, of course, the pair in this second income finds moxie inside and finally , joins the magnificent insult to pursue America's pursuit of life, freedom and happiness. So this movie is really funny, but the producers are not the reasons they may have. As I love Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy movie, this movie is a great deal of a travesty with great Jack Lemmon. If you see the latter, do not worry about it.
