Cracker is a brilliant English TV show about the overweight, chain-smoker, foulmouthed psychologist Cracker, who helped the Manchester Police Department to help the chiefs of violence to those who have never heard of anything (or have never seen A & E criminals). It is considered one of the best indicators to get out of England (and says something) and has achieved a great success in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now the original stars are reunited with the original writer to beat another 2-hour episode. I did not like this show since I saw it ten years ago. The DVD box set occupies a glorious place in my collection, and I can best describe Fitzin's interrogation scenes. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Original Cracker many of the things that affect me about the series were how quickly Fitz was identified as a character. Five minutes of the first episode? with his lecture (to put books in the air), his drink and gambling machine on his son's charge on the queue? and you knew, they just knew who that character was. Coltrane, of course, remained great during the show, when the great actor played a major role in writing by a great writer, but I always said later that part of the episodes I felt? Written by McGovern? <br /> <br /> So, good news is this: Fitz returns. Do you see him in this show? daughter makes pretty inappropriate comments at wedding? you will feel again "click". This is a petulant at one point and, despite really regret, always deep, always deep, sincere, but in this process laughs brilliantly. If you love this character as much as I love, you will be delighted with the way it is described in the movie. <br /> <br /> In some cases, everything connected with the Fitzger is perfectly processed. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is trying to solve Fitz. In the standard Cracker fashion, we know exactly who the offender was in the first five minutes? Fizzin sees this as a gap. In this case, there is a serial killer for American blood. The reason is, unfortunately, the absence of any convincing psychological trauma? On the contrary, the offenses are simply here to demonstrate their own political beliefs to the writer. </ strong> <br /> <br /> I really believe Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world because it's hard for me to write. And I'm an issue related to films that have a political theme. But in the universe of Cracker, we look forward to seeing human characters rather than caricatures. Instead, in this film, Americans are completely stereotypical. They did not know anything about loudmouths, who behave like locals and deceived their wives? One of them can even do all of the above for less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have not commented on this issue. Are we constantly reminded of the worsening war in Iraq? reminders that are not associated with the story and practically no longer appear in the story. The killer thinks it is worse than he thinks of Hitler's killing. but when it comes to more points, that writer is such an obsession for his political views that he does not forget to act as a convincing man, and why? like an audience? <br /> <br /> <strong> It is impossible to prevent the killing of a Caucasian resident. was still a good television, something better (basically, again, due to Coltrane). But is his constant politicization impossible to be better than the real Cracker classics like "Being One"? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "> The whole police department is full of such big symbols for a long time now - it's now vanilla. <br /> <br /> Of course, the absolutely indispensable cops, both of whom are unobtrusive and unmanaged, both of them (" Coupling's Richard Coyle "For me, this kind of example is forced to collapse the whole population of Fitz from just over 1 million to some strange criteria (how do the French windows succeed only in less than an hour, and I do not think so. /> <br /> So, generally, I'm a little disappointed .. It is recommended to review, but do not forget to leave at least the expectations of the door, probably if there are further future series, I'm sure McGovern can still write great things and maybe now writing for his policy out of his system About people who can come back.
