This film goes away from many films that have been dealing with the same topic in the past. Let the future audience notify you that nothing will add to the Art Heist genre. The film's director, Bryan Goeres, has no idea what the film is about. William Baldwin re-emerges in films and undoubtedly he has a great agent, or it gives complimentary images to the director's and producers' make-up with this strange hairstyle that most of the movies featured. He is the only one best film, The Squid and the Whale, only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, does not work better; <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie that will be watched by the viewer at his own risk.
