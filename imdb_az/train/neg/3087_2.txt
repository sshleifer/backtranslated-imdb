<br /> <br /> Many extremely difficult A-holes are suffering by naked puppets that have been locked in a movie box for twenty years without any cause, the old shower watch bag. <br /> <br /> simply MST3K's dislocation ribbing. But I've seen a real movie and can safely say yes, it's really bad, really bad. Still a conscious move, one of the most horrific "battlefields" I had ever witnessed to 'aliens' (I was a scary pet dog) was Rick Sloan's "Academy Academy" and relied on how it was in my place, even worse. This is not a movie, because this is not something that is not a movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Submitted by Jim Wynorski; Styles gallery; and Trailer for this movie
