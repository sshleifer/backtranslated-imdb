This film is pure guano. My mother always said that she could not say anything good ... My mother would say that I had a part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, Geoffrey Rush's wishes just go away. I hope Greg Kinnear launches his agent. After that, Ben Stiller occasionally prayed to someone saying, "There is something about Mary." I have always been an admirer of Wes Studi, thank you for everything that you have been fond of, that she is wearing a mask through the film, and maybe people will not identify the movie with her. <br /> <br /> This style begins with the students <br /> <br /> Students are telegramed an hour before the punchline arrives, and then straight afterwards, and then decodes the kinematography of Batman films and then loses something. . <br /> <br /> If you want to see the effective parody of the world of comic book, "Shake Amy". <br /> <br /> WORKING! DO NOT COME FROM "CLEARLY MEN"!
