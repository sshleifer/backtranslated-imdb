I enjoy the fun. Although many people have found them unbearable, I enjoyed a lot of Hot Shots and The Naked Gun tracks. I love even more of Pauly Shore movies. There is a movie I see, honestly, I say bad ... and it was. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking: "This silence is a movie, why did not I see it?" It's just the only movie I can not recommend.
