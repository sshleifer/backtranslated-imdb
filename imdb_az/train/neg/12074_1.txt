A strange horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) is about to die and leave everything to his four children and the equal distribution of his servants. One condition - you have to spend one week on your property to get the money. If any of them die, the others will be more. Estimate what will happen in the future. <br /> <br /> I saw a new edition of this movie on the cables. The colors were bright and lively, and the house itself was beautiful. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the problems of this movie: the killer appears clearly in shouting; servants called Igor and Elga - come! Some of the sound recording was very bad, could not get into the dialogue (I had no great harm); the abdomen was very small and very bad; Other murders were simply dull, stupid or impossible, and there is a really disgusting act in this movie - very bad, just in an incredible way. Even Jeff Morrow was terrifying! It was just a good enough player (which was well worth it) or (here's a painful old and frenetic John Carradine) trouper Faith Domergue. <br /> <br /> Why is the Blood Act, which is renamed this name, not on my side - another fear movie of 1978! <br /> Whatever your name, a bad movie. Avoid all costs.
