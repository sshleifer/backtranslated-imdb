* Spoiler can contain * <br /> I'm bent back to this movie to be fair. I knew Madonna's role. I knew it was a week in theaters. I knew they received very bad comments. I did not expect a deep, thoughtful exam of class, culture and sexuality, as was the case with Italian original. The suspicion lasted about ten minutes. Madonna plays awesome, ambitious, elegantly clever Gorgo, breaks out with her elderly and her friends (Kurdish is bad as Madonna), some really laughing facial expression). Adriano Giannini plays Madonna's first companion on the shore, which cleanses humiliation and dirt on every stage of life. Why does he have such a bitch? Simply, after the plot is requested, the two will return to tables and teach them when the second is on an empty Mediterranean island. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Open Output is a silly, simple, last Madonna typically gives wooden performance. Madonna, at the request of Giannini, has launched a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes she has shed, and she has started. Guy Ritchie here is "funny" editing. The film is the worst dialogue I've heard in a big movie in a few years. The last is blessed and incredible. The correspondent can be contacted at trend@trend.az Do you have any feedback?

However, it's not the worst movie ever. This difference is from the "Shanghai surprise". He did not do anything worse than that.
