This film is less generous than others. The images of miserable people in this age are always made totally unusual for a different species. Their antiques are so strange that they are completely fictional. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or chickens. They beat or beat each other. As the screenwriter says, what can I do to do this, nor is madness or mental illness. Look at the beautiful man's explanation "A Flew on a Nestle's Nest" in a place where the illnesses are convincing and realistic. One time I worked in a State Mental Hospital. I have not seen any of these children. These are very clever and are calculated to make them live.
