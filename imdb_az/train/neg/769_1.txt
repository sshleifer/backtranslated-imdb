The biggest mistake in the film is that it can not be believed that any of these people can carry on Macbeth's professional production. David Lansburan's gentle voice, struggling with the famous phrase "Tomorrow morning and tomorrow," did not allow anyone to believe that he would never consider this role to be. That is why I do not believe he was part of a low-income actor; not because there is a larger name. Later, when he saw a part of the training, it was difficult for the director not to parody a hopelessly devastating thing, to believe in the misleading of the actors who can not understand the play or the verses that he or she can not understand or even understand. Sometimes, film directors are very concerned about making their own films (writers think they are directing their works) and fall less. It looks like this.
