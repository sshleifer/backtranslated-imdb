To watch the land watching Eric Rohmer a few times - at least they told me; Monsieur Rohmer hates this (he does not deny, but he can do it, he is simply surprised), and the new film, which he could last God, is still back. when watching dry as dry. These beautiful people, who introduced Nouvelle Vague, the Cahiers du Cinema, have already called it one of the best films in 2007 to give you an idea. The reality of the Rohmer agenda is that the fifth century France is in an extreme tent that we will not go beyond the Loire valley, and the only settlement we look at is a rough wooden hut. The story involves nymphs and shepherds, and, as often, Rohmer shows an incident to an unknown person, and shows that the effect is accidentally filmed for a special pronoun in the film at the school yearly class. Someone says, "Let's go back to God, all for forgiveness," but this extreme production can not tell me that.
