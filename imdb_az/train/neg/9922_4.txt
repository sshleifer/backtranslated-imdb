Joe Strummer grew up and was my hero, but this movie was cold. The future is not written to be better and worse. "Behind the Music" style is not a documentary. On the contrary, a biological art movie, interviews, performance footage, home cinema, and essentially delusional animated sketches are all packed up from the Animal Farm. <br /> <br /> Camping is a very annoying thing to do when touched upon. First, it is difficult for anyone to know who is half of those interviewed. Secondly, is the hosannas on the mouth of a liar that really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack? Strummer did not relate to his life, and their thoughts did not add anything to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture comes from Strummer, with instructions and conversations, about many parts of his life: About: Her brother's suicide, parent's death, and father's joy. <br /> <br /> For me, this was the most moving thing, because Joe Strummer is better than Strummer and Clash, just like a regular person, who is not like a punk symbol we know and love, but with the happiness and care of life , there are more simple documents. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder have contradicted MTV Documentary in the early 1990s). Joe Strummer: The future is just for diehards.
