Revolutions always offer opportunities for dramatic films, in fact, most revolutions themselves are dramatic. Unfortunately, the fact that this film is not in drama is compensated by how boring it is. Someone earns, loses, dies, or does not live - just as soon as possible. This is as great as it seems to me to use the surface technology of the background technology. The scenes of Paris and French villages have cardboard quality on them. They can be made better in a bare stage and left in this way. It is not possible to expect the wonderful effects of the "Flying Daggers" or "Golden Compass", but this is digital production in 2002. Characters resemble a scene to appear on stage, so one number loses its count and goes out of the room. In my opinion, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into a papier-mache revolution of the papier-college world.
