I remember "Lost Missile" (actually, my brother and several nights in the house agreed to follow me with a few cousins ​​- sometimes from Eric Cartman of the 1960s - apologies, children) and a million degrees heat-resistant wave they were a bit embarrassed when it came to being a structure - even as a second-grader, I just knew that a rocket would only carry energy for more heat or ruin The duration and limited radius of the nuclear explosion. <br /> <br /> It was a criminal offense for me to love the Turkmen-loving brothers. <br /> <br /> The film's production values ​​were very good. However, the purpose of the rocket is to cook the surface of the earth easily, for it is not bad (except for the actor who plays another deputy governor). <br /> <br /> How Mystery Science Theater 3000 missed "The Lost Missile"? <br /> <br /> The unwanted comedy has a great classicism - if you want something to drink beer within a week, look.
