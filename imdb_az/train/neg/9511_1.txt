I wanted to see this movie because it was advertised on television for the first time. I went to Tinsel to see last night at 7:40. When I saw something better, I regretted that I spent my ticket in this trash. From the beginning, a bunch of garbage and clicks made. In fact, they were overcome by the way they worked their love. All girls were stereo. The age-old friend was very stupid for his age. The late gases that the pregnant girl has captured have any laughter. Bank robbery was totally boring with gags used in other films. Their running car turned the Chevy van into an old one and claimed it was no interruption. Why did not they get a good tool for robbery instead? The audience could have had the idea of ​​the movie. This movie was very low down and down, because nothing was damaged and disappeared. There were many things that governed the nuances of Christian people in this film. Hey, I even waited for a car in the car, because all bank robbery films were followed by cars, but never. I appreciate this movie, which is one of the low budget and one of the ten stars.
