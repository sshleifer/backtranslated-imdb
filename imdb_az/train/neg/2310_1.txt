It was a really strange movie. The performances are the third degree, and the dialogue is so stylized that sometimes this event has occurred and is dead. Renting this was simple: find a movie with screenwriter writing. Needed a visual aid for my presentation so I thought I did not use a clip? Boy wrong. After searching for my local video store, I came to the place where I was called "Starstruck" with this suspicion. I thought "hey what", and decided to give it a try. Yes, I was very disappointed with my results. Perhaps I had a scene I could use, and in the meanwhile, I practically slept because of the transparency of the flick. So ..... I took it back and took Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Later, something relative to the "Starfucker" drive could be offered.
