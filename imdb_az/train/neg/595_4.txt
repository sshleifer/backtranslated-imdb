Creep - "Your trip is here." There are some graphic scenes and ... yes, that's all about this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no story, no story. There is no unpleasant character, well, it's best not to take into account that the 'symbols' are not really a true clue. That is, they are being persecuted by some strange-looking "thing" in the sewer system (which one, why?), Which is frightening for me, but is it really my focus? No, I'm not. Why am I not? Because I know who these people are and I do not know whether I want to live or die. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have any meaning and purpose. It feels like I'm falling asleep and missing 45m of the set. Jump to the move. <br /> <br /> Generally, some women and their friends are locked in the London Metro and follow a strange creature and then fled. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Kate is a consistently foolish " <br /> <br /> If you do not do this, it can be drill and predictable. <br /> <br /> It's not just a shooting line, but your creeps are only a few moments. If you have a few friends back, then be sure to look at everything, but if you want something real and clever, avoid it.
