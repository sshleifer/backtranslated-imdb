There were all such films and all the stereo of the article. The plot has gone anywhere, and at the end of the movie I felt like an absorbent to watch. Production was good; But the script and the player were B-movie quality. Casting was weak because good actors had a mix of small actors. Good actors did not keep themselves and did not raise others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth mentioning, but I will say more to fulfill the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr play cartoons in other films. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for foolish entertainment, I still do not recommend this movie.
