The script for Scary Movie 2 was not just ready to go. This is a problem with the movie, which is known to actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are funny; and the film is not completely humorous. According to the loan, there are some fun moments in the film. But all this is not as close as smart and entertaining as Scary Movie 2. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a one-minute laugh. The slimmer subtleties of the Slasher genre have become a comedy gold. In Scary Movie 2, humor is severely presented because it is un-original. They even missed open opportunities for parody. Two of the film stars are former players of Beverly Hills 90210 and this was a show that would make a parody! In the final analysis, "Scary Movie 2" resembles a beautiful bottle of wine very soon. The screenwriter's age required more time. 5 to 2 stars.
