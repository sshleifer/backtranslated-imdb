This film solves child abduction in terms of Mother (Lisa Hartman Black) acting as an exciting workman acting as a boy. Unlike other films in the center of attention of the police, her mother is watching her old husband, who was abducted. <br /> <br /> After all, when you can not get your son, there are many striking things. My mother is trying to take a boy to a child who resembles a local Kids Games at a local theater. He was captured and understood that he did not have a child. Only a few people would have been in prison for a few months waiting for Psychological Hospitalization or Judgment. However, in this film, the mother was released after a few hours, since her victim's parents apologized for her. After a while his mother entered the father's home, and then the police came and targeted his guns, but they knew him (and they were saddened by him). <br /> At another point of life, they found a child, but when the police arrived to look for a house, they left the back door and entered the river on the river and it seemed that the Dad was just around the corner! My mother takes someone to give her a sack, and for a while (in the real world), she and her lawyer-lover, and the police take it to the other saloon quite quickly, and this is the bottom of the water with the collapse of the water. Instead of going out to search the land, the father thinks the boy is drowning and jumps to the water when he sees the body. Of course, he can not swim and float like a rock. The lawyer keeps him, but they lose the chance to escape after the father. At one point, she was told that her son died in a clinic in Mexico. He goes in and out and no one knows where he stands! In some cases, this film really exploits kidnapping and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman was funny (or funny) for all the naked things in such films?
