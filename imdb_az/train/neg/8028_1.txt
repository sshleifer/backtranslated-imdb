Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. This is really nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch, made by some middle school children. I have not been able to watch it and I usually want to watch all the B movies. How could he find a distributor on earth? !!! Funny but: Check Wikipedia for "dark area". The person who entered the entry should be completely aware of it. Maybe it was money from producers. Money spent on actors, cameras and editors. It will not help, even if there is no interesting idea behind the film. Unfortunately, the "dark land" has become very noticeable. Please, direct the film, producer and author of this movie, STOP ... do not give yourself a blessing. Without this film, the world would be a better place.
