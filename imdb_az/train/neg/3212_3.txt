I'm a fan of a comic book series, but this movie has dropped from my expectations. Heavy Metal 2000 kinda felt it ..... slow motion, bad dialogue, too much blood ..... but this was worse than anything I could imagine. <br /> <br /> The tough line is almost the same as comedy, but the good points are pretty much there. Heroes do not have the energy and the soul that attracts my attention to the comic series. The film covers only a small part of the comic, and the portion used is slower and more boring than the next. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been fine. Unfortunately, such a thing has not happened, so there is another movie, which now thinks it will love less. My image will surely accumulate dust for years, until finally throw.
