This movie was awesome! (Leif Garrett's kingdom is not as good as Longshot) but still awesome! Ashley seemed very strange compared to Mary Kate in this movie. Why am I surprised? Whoever swath to places like this and almost thought it could go with it. Dad was a minor thing, but my mother was a bit ugly with the head of Helmit. I give it to you. 4. Everyone who loves this movie checks Longshot.
