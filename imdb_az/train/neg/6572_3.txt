In my opinion, the name of this movie should be changed from "Only brave" to "All About Lane". A few months ago I went to the show and I was completely disappointed with the result. The film is about a film about men 442 - a very successful theme in the film industry - some of those who worked in the movie are outdated. Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee's performances were very nice. But the filmmaker never left himself as the main character in the film. Sorry Lane, you're not a movie actor. Because you're good - play theater. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in the film was terrifying. No role was given, and his appearance did not suit the part of Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the movie, which were naturally beautiful and exquisite. Why did not they miss this role? Another problem with the film was its sequence. Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to fight with German soldiers. This is a budgetary feature, but it is not important to show some real struggle because it is a war-based movie. This film was a decent attempt, but not necessarily a great distribution.
