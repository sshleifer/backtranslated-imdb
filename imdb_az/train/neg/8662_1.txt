Horrible film. I love the beast, but I can not watch the terrible actor, half of cartoon heroes and terrifying special effects. Nothing about this movie. These symbols come from infinite sources of suicidal ball dishes, or they are vacuous, thirsty puppets. Land-shaped, cut and pasted, standard-discovery-amok drivel. Even CGI is terrible. You will even know that it's bad, regardless of the movie, to provide some good eye sweets. There is no surprise here, just the same old. This is really one of the worst films ever. Director Roger Corman should be hung with a light bulb to use it as a pin.
