I would like to love this movie, yes, it's one of them, I love it, but I like these movies. Well, if it were good, not bright, but had all the stuff to be a good movie ... unfortunately, these items came out! The operation was terrible and it was seen when the prisoners were first launched with each other (the heads were put out), words and a liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing .... but it even more badly wrote a bad post . Two of the captives were in touch and did not take the film much deeper ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I was surprised why all the movie I'm concerned about to review it. <br /> <br /> I'll end with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISEASE!
