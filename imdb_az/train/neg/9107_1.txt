Everyone made this movie. I was more angry to sit down to lose the precious moments of my life. I could be a candle job and have more fun. At least Kerri laughs before I hurt me. At first I was a little confused, but later I realized what I was doing. So far half of the film has passed and yes, I am a dragger, but we want to see everything. So I compressed her and watched them all. Not as attractive as the wrong intentions, not all actors are just convincing. I noticed that my brother cried for more rest in this movie than the passionate lust described on the screen. If you like bad movies, watch this movie.
