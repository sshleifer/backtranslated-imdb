There are two misunderstood children here who do not have any mistakes in the poverty eradication: Robin Hoods distinguished some of the police for the persecution because of some strange nudity. Gad! For this shit, Bonnie was one of the most beloved little ones in the Missouri western who was trained to be a psychopathic killer by a fun loving lover who really does not want to hurt anyone .... to get them without just a lot of energy. Poorly drawn, weak, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, more like grape chick than the original. Avoid this information. Leave it. -5 stars.
