The previous part of the movie was quite pleasant, but it was strange after the end. Although Turtourore is an actor like me, his Luzin is often like a bad rain experience and is a semi-autistic man whose genius images are intense. Generally, this movie tries to be difficult, and it looks as if it looks strikingly beautiful, even though it performs well.
