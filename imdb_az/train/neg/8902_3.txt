I often do not have to criticize a film negatively; After all this, I often feel that it would be a good idea to nitpick what we want for a large number of people on the agenda, "if not say good or nothing." Although this film is not the same as the reader, I also note that Christopher Walken is just HORRID, with the exception of Gabriel. This is an admirer of Walken's deadly delivery and style, or I'm telling you to warn you because you love the original "prophecy". If you buy, return it. <br /> What happened to this movie? The full list would be too long to read and tear, but a brief summary would be: The very crystal clearness of the link between the angels and the mortality of the first film was destroyed once. Gabriel has just returned from the right hand of God (and, first of all, funny in this role), less than a thief for paradise. While Walken is playing very hard (remembering Frank White from the King of Frank New York), he is still delighted, but the supporting player is an unobtrusive and impartial mix of schedules for a person and angels who can not get a clue of 50 people. You may think that you are a better person in the field. One gets the feeling that we're on the stage to move the film to the next big line of Walken. <br /> <br /> The last line is, of course, a blow to his neck, and Jericho's walls fall upon people who cause this unnatural disaster. Our exploration of this film was, in the first place, continuing. He told the original story, answered the questions he was supposed to have and then left alone what he thought he was thinking again. There is no serious reason to abide by these symbolic symbols - the deceased priest, the little girl holding the "great secret", the teacher who defends his children - and even Lucifer himself. The first film was subsequently put into one of the other symbols. I do not want to apologize to anyone who sees this movie, because they will not want to watch the original and it is a real tragedy.
