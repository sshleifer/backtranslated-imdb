Are you talking about the same movie? This movie is absolutely funny, the plot is disgusting and totally illogical. A typical flat DVD / TV movie, including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: Most actors, step-by-step steps have been taken, GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts (why god, why?), People do not react to things as they are in real life. Not even worrying about the details, it will take the whole night. Yes, only one: If two people are killed on the way to the witch, one of the victims will be killed in your hand; "He left the world, and the last thing you saw was an angry vine!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
