<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> </ span>> What did I think when I first saw it here? May 28, 2003. ** Please note that this is a spoiler warning, and I'm complaining about how bad the movie is. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie's beginning and the characters are presented, but no character explanation. I knew it was new to school, but I did not see it, it turned out to live by itself ... then she was a ghost child ... she was still an alcoholic with her, and all her friends did not have any parents and they also lived. <br /> <br /> Now we have come to a corner, this terrible man has left the naked shelter and continues fast, and now our main character is dissatisfied with this man and takes care of him for the indifference of the film. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason for this, there is no reason why all the friends who suspect 5 minutes suddenly pursue it. and do what they want. <br /> So the movie goes on, well. they fight against what's happening at school. but wait a moment ... suddenly everybody knows that the main character is here 'show'. wait a moment, did not the man crazy, especially the main character? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < THERE IS A PROBLEM. but I thought I was not the ones that I was aware of ... hm ... <br /> <br /> Now the film is approaching. WOMAN WHAT IS HELL? he did not ask any questions about the last man, as he did not answer any questions regarding the last major character. Are these people in the same condition? Yes, there are many key story lines that do not look like this. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm still thinking about it now. this line is 6 months and I can give it another chance if I can get it for free, but I doubt. I'm very skeptical.
