This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I saw outside of Star Wars. Since then, I've been a great fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not bring myself to forgive this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a great fan of Jane Austen, and Emma has been exposed to different types of classics, one of them. I always considered them irritating, foolish and boring. But after this horrific look, I had to admit that the original Emma was pleasant and attractive. Evan McGregor hacked and split some part of Frank Churchill and then scored one goal in this film. Gweneth Paltrow is now ridiculous in a ridiculous character and the rest of the film is careless and stupid. <br /> <br /> My suggestion to anyone interested in drama in English is ... you see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... I believe that by skipping this movie, we did not miss a five-minute team at a stupid hats and bad hair cuts.
