DECOY is one of the few independent products produced by open-minded people, but there are not all the usual shortcomings that make up such films. There is a certain story, adequate play, photography is very good, the hero and the bad man are immoral men, and background music is not too late. This is a DVD New Release, so people are looking for it as it is worthwhile. I do not know where 10 films come from, because the movie is good - even if you're the mother of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last film we saw in a theater was Warner's J K Rawlings's very loving and perfect book, the release of Phoenix Order. If we compared THE DECOY to PHOENIX, there is no story from PHOENIX (Warners), I think that the director did not allow any player, photography was terrible, and the music noisy noisy music account was just a mess. I voted Phoenix for "1" because the scale does not go down. WASTE is 4 times better - in all relationships. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give the DECOY a chance. Remember, this is "Decoy 3 - Shootout" or any nonsense. This is original. If your expectations are not exceeded by foolish "10" points, you can make the movie on their own terms.
