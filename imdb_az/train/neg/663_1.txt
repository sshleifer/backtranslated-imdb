Because you look at Sara Marshall in such a way, you have to go and deal with your brain. It's for sale. Options? - Banking, Bruges, Leatherheads or Prom Night. You have seen Bank Work (surprisingly decent heist film) and Bruges (still pretty good), so you both fell. Is not it fancy to follow Clooney or running around a beautiful Office 1930 football shirt, so go to Prom Night? It's wrong. Buy $ 8.50 and ask the wizard to go a strange and earn $ 8.50 per pound. <br /> <br /> This is really a comedy-like horror / tension, or whatever, more than that. If I funded this film, they showed me that I do not know how to laugh or cry for the last one. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... my room was laughing most of the movie, but it would have been more realistic, as robots (or perhaps dogs) in the roles of players. The detective must be perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I do not care how much his spell do not hate his player) You release the title (s) <br /> So the summary is not 'good'
