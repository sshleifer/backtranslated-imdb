a very good story, a good excitement ... but the whole movie in the last 10 seconds has destroyed ... what happened? I'm sorry to say that in the last second, a very well prepared and good story was destroyed ... but I voted for a vote ... I thought this was what Chris Shadley would have a better outcome ... but maybe next time :) Does not all this meaningless blood belong to anything? the last story could have been brought to 10, but it did not come to an end ... the last one destroyed the whole story, and I think that most people are not naked and want a good result when filming, even if it's complicated ... but here's the only naked sound ... I'm sorry
