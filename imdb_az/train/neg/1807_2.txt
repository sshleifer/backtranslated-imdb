I've been hippie-dippy at age, I acknowledge that I'm a sucker for such films. I love most of the hippie genre than "normal" people. However, this film is in terrible condition. <br /> <br /> Hippie silliness is presented as the gospel of all tall, the police kill the young hair long when the plane flies in peace. This movie is a terrific thing, even though the hippie pilot's overcrowding is not funny. This is Dragnet's left wing version without professional actors. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red; "> <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is an example of art ... you have an" art "movie ... All this is done in the drill slip of the root canal, it takes time to accelerate every senseless scene. <br /> <br /> The "inactive" star of the film went into the commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of its co-robbers was killed and sent to prison on a suspicious rally "crash" ..... and I think, I must leave it as a legacy .... Vow.
