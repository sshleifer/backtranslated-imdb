If you do not come across a Lacani, "What is Jesus' answer?" If you have been raped by a Christian in the Underworld, maybe I should be grateful. <br /> <br /> Zizak's star currently burns fierce, undoubtedly, because of the fact that we see films, Lacanian's greatest evangelist, Slavoj Zizek, the word "Jesus" as "Lacan / Hegel" and "pop culture" for our consumption. <br /> <br /> What Zizek says in this film is just "truth," she says. For example, Zizek explains that there are three Marx Bros's ego, superego and id (Does God know what Zeppo or Gummo is ?, maybe they have a synthesis ... or have the movies themselves?). These are just what they are. In Zizek's speech, culture should be viewed as an example of its ideology, not merely to investigate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the spouses can object to saying something. But what is different from the Christians who give everything to God's will? <br /> <br /> For example, what is the theory of movies or anywhere? Yes, nothing. Zizek believed he could even serve as an evidence. However, when these examples are isolated from the context, they are not just cant and propaganda. Without kontekst, you can say and prove what you want. Is Lacan's answer to Zizek? he goes and gives an example. Everything that resembles the teachings of a master and a culture is like everything, it serves ideology. For example, when Jimmy Stewart is spying on Kim Novak on a flower shop, for example, a scene from Vizio's Zizek voyeur and fantasy position is taken. But in the context of the film, this is not a fantasy position of any kind. Stewart was deliberately taken there by Novak. <br /> <br /> The presentation of isolated samples from Zizekin's two-hour and one half sine of cinema continues. <br /> <br /> In the Blue Velvet, the analysis of the scene if the baby wants it --- is ridiculous. Zizek says that the character of Isabella Rossilin does not only require its recession, but it is unconscious to control the situation. This is an example of "jouissance". Well ... maybe. But I'm sorry for the process - where's the evidence for that? In the film, Hopper misses his son, so he reduces his fate. Zizek, of course, can confess that Kyle has had a bad sex relationship with MacLachalan. But this can be thanks to any number. Is not this supposed femininity "jouissance" point? According to Laca, the woman's coususance, unlike phallic jouissance, can not be expressed, it's beyond phallic retention and language abnormalities. If this is true, no example can be taken from it. This shows that the whole concept is sensitive and completely mystical. Only Zizek can be appointed by dogmatists: "You have femininity jouissance for you! Why is this feminine jouissance? So I say." <br /> <br /> What kind of example can this film really be? Only Zizec's psychology. When he says he wants Rod Steiger in a boat in Botega Bay, Why does he continue to add himself to his favorite films? Does the dream of one who criticizes his life do not come true? <br /> <br /> According to Zibilov, Freud was expected to spend one day with Pervert Movie Theater. But Zizek has no one but anyone. but these films can not have serious universal examples of psychoanalytic laws. This film shows that Zizek's wishes and only extremely uncertain - it's almost useless - how do the rest of us want? As we know any psychoanalist, what we desire and desire can not be completely separated and can not be easily universally simulated. The love of Zizek for all to love Lacan's answer is: how do we want? Like this, I'm doing it. The problem is the desire of Zizak, everything and everyone's wishes are rational. However, Zizek Leninist and, of course, do not want to "speak for themselves". <br /> <br /> Pervert's Movie Guide is a summary of Zizek's dogma love and is still incredibly politically intimidated (dogma is not it?). <br /> <br /> Zizek failed to question how accurate his intentions were when investigating the conditions of the investigation procedure and, hence, ethical conduct was never questioned. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very productive, but all the books and this movie said the same thing. He is part of Henry Ford's theory of civilization: mass production and any color as long as it is black. It is ideal for today's high consumer society: it claims that people are repeating the same c-duplicates and something different. People choose the answers to their great problems because capitalism is always trying to ensure that it does not investigate any serious issues. It's like brain dead. Zizek is the third suicide capsule matrix pill. <br /> <br /> PS: Zizekin's solemn speech was presented as a revelation on cinematography and humanity. In movies, music has greatly influenced people's love. Did this just come to Zizeke after watching Jaws?
