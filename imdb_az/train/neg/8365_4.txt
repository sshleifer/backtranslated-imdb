This is a simple fairy tale, but very manipulative. <br /> <br /> This animation is good, but I feel it's very loyal. <br /> <br /> More than my spouse, I would have chosen more places in the background and perhaps it would not feel kitsch for me. <br /> <br /> Hollywood soundtrack works well for the movie, but Aardman's many derivatives are films and it bothering me. <br /> <br /> Some movies will test what this manufacturer can do without noise. <br /> <br /> I think the sound is very glib.
