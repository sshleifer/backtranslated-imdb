I gave these two stars for the awesome DV shooting that lends the cold and dark sterility of the character. <br /> <br /> This movie is unsuccessful in all accounts. I can not recommend it because it's neither poetic nor open. Neither dramatically nor suspenseful. It's neither controversial nor ordinary. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of garbage that nobody will be able to advise good-bye from horror and abuse. . <br /> Thank you.
