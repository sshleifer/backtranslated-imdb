Not the best movies to watch in these days. I have read many comments about Shining and expect it to be very good. But this movie has disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but there is no story here. There was no moment of fear. I was expecting to be a fright film, but there was no fear. The only scenario I was afraid was the stage change scene that showed Wednesday. The movie has many tracks. Some things are not explained by anything to coordinate with anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes. It may be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
