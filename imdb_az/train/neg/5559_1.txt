This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers organized this suspicious honor? but no longer. Those who worked on "Jill the Ripper" were very scary and were captured only by the plot. This film is like an intellectual stimulant like Telletubbes. S & M does not know that you do not want to be nudity or a really bad tension. Only under extreme intoxication or when you are in bed and need a skin implant. This script should be turned into porn, it will not make much effort and will have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porn, will not be able to hurt Dolf Lundgren's career.
