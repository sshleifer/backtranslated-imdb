I was expecting this movie to be really terrible. And it was. Indeed, star-studded cast was a wonderful actress for Kathy Bates ... Before preparing this movie, Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti have in some cases been frustrated, but Miranda Richardson is one of my greatest speeches I know and love to love him. <br /> <br /> There was a line with Fred's father, Trevor Peacock (Dickley Vicar, playing among others). <br /> <br /> The plot could not be predicted and it was everywhere and humor ... missing. (But Santa was part of a film that entered a Jewish family home ... that made me laugh when his testimonies were classic). Do not just watch this movie unless it is the head of another alternative to a train collision (in fact, the train would be better ...)
