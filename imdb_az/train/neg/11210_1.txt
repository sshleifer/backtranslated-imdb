Years ago, I read the story of John Everingham in Reader's Digest, and I remember what he thought he would do. Perhaps Michael Landon never did. Because of my anxiety, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, and his art license went off like the massacre of the Little House series. <br /> <br /> This film reflects Everingham's story as "Little", it's strange for a better word, scenarioists are open and approaching Landon's cats. The House "The Prairie at home." It is another tool to show Landons' terrible hair.
