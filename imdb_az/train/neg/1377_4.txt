Most volleyball genres are strangely ignored by scenario writers. Thankfully, high-level filmmaker Nelson McCormick brought us the second best-ever volleyball movie of all time (down and better than Side Out, umm). But do not let this movie cover you. Kill Shot stars and a modern day comes with star Koji like Sherlock Holmes. Using these high-tech gadgets as a computer less power than my Gameboy, Koji can help the FBI agents follow a man who does not commit a crime. Koji carries this movie with him. Other actresses in the film, Denise Richards, have a gentle and flawless ugly and annoying girl's short income. Any fan of movies such as Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
