Once again, a television series, such as Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget, and Thunderbirds, is a full-length movie and is damaging to hundreds of people watching. Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott), who are mainly Duke's cousins, spend a lot of time at General Lee. However, it must be destroyed by Jefferson Davis "Boss" Hogg (Razzie Burt Reynolds), with almost the whole city, to bring together their actions and postpone the family business to lead a large coal mine. They are being followed by the sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Gainey) and police, their sexy uncle Daisy (called Razzie Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) to get help along the way. He also starred as Joe Don Baker, Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick, Cletus Hogg, David Koechner, Cooter Davenport, Michael Enston's lawyer Michael Weston and Pauline's Lynda Carter. The only reason I've given an extra star of the movie, a few of the impressive car stunts, and of course Simpson's beautiful body (his feet are not quite Catherine Bach, but still!) Besides, it's pretty dull. For the worst picture Razzies, the worst director Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst Remake or Sequel, Simpson and his "Daisy Dukes" and the worst screen pair nominees for the worst scenario. Very weak!
