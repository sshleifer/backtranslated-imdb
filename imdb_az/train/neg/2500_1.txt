Van Dien should really be embarrassed in the memory of this rude film, as every individual must attend. I'm afraid to admit that I'm being watched all the way from honest to honest. Production values ​​are among the original "Crossroads" and "Prisoner Cell Block H" series. The five-year-olds will be able to perform more realistic dialogue and more relevant space. As for the outgoing performances, if you imagine the most dirty porno you've ever seen - one of the action's full story, with a few unfinished stories, to describe how the old peroxid blonde heater came to spit - was defeated by a few blocks of defeat - you will have an idea about the standard of functioning. Worse still, it is not possible to move fast to sexual scenes, because there is nothing. Strange horror movie.
