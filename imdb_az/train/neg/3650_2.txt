No laughs. Yes, I watched all of these train crashes, but I do not believe that only Cleese came to feel the last part. <br /> <br /> It may be historically interesting for young people to see, for thirty years ago, included black "jokes" such as "humor" in English. <br /> <br /> I am more amazed at reading the comments that other reviewers have said are not good, but then can turn around and vote loudly. If the vast majority of the comedy you see is worse than that, then I regret your torture. <br /> <br /> This show's humor level seems to be aimed at small children, yet there is no topic. But who is this? Repeated and taken double pleasure are people, wheels, medication jokes (just a short trip to 77) and other "low" humor. The three Stooges were still funny and a kid for me. PEOPLE were trying to make jokes. However, he does not hesitate to enter the shock. I fear that this is the end of civilization, if these things really are valued. In the next period, I will say that the tabloid TV is popular. :(
