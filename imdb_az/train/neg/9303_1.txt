I wrote this review a few months ago .... The trailer looked at it for a movie, just to get the ball out of the box. A complete joke ... and a spit in front of the real classics of horror's early generation, exactly like the Texas Holdings Massager (1974). Brandon's producer should go to flip burgers and serve greasy hamburgers .... hell is not that good either! Lighting, wrong was bad, and sometimes you did not see the actor's face in the big trouble with the film. I really do not care about all the members of the castle, which is really bad, and it's really bad that they will never affect you to make me memorable. This is always the point I will throw away. Please do not stay away from this meeting, even if it costs 25 kopecks, at least you will keep this fun! <br /> <br /> If you had good entertainment in your low-quality budget, it's better ... then watch the Jeff Hayes movie .... because she gets scared and has a child! <br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star only for the art of lid ... the only thing that desires to approach this "so-called" film. -Rick Blalock
