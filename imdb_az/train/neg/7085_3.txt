I actually tried to love this movie. It deals with a major problem in any society: sexual dependency. <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when we are sexually dependent. <br /> <br /> In this case, our main character and the hero endanger marriage, work, or even life in order to have sex with all kinds of women (skinny, kinky, neurotic). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are terrible; mainly acting. <br /> <br /> You will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are prepared with a very tasty taste and you think you are in a home. <br /> Secondly, the area is just inaccessible. How could such a clever and beautiful husband's husband have all the evil things he did? How can you believe it? <br /> <br /> The scene with the Black Theater staged is just meaningless and you think of "wtf"? <br /> <br /> You see many scenes like you. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please take it away. It's not a soft, documentary, but dramatic feature. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's feet are worth the screen. I was captured at HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money. But this 90-minute life will not come back.
