I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay some time ago. We looked at the regions and thought it was too dumb to reconsider. Initially, the excessive amount of aqueous 'blood' is simply out of date - not the words "around the wind". <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of errors in terms of quantity. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; I knew one of the actors - I believe, or he was TEATRI teacher!" <Br /> <br /> The final decision: do not worry about the "horror" flick . <br /> <br /> 3 stars (from 73 possible)
