I think that Jason Lee has great potential, but this is WRONG, a tool that seeks to break as a star. Hell is awful, comedy is awful. I laugh twice, I think for comfort, because when they came back, they were pretty clever jokes. <br /> <br /> I was afraid of Fletcher's future, and I did not think that he was a filmmaker, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair were hot, but still have photos on this website to fulfill this movie. Protect your time. 1 star.
