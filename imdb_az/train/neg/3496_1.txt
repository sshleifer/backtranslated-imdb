When I was 15, I understand that my parents are having a Saturday night. They also did not understand Rock n-Roll and many other things. Now I am close to my age, I still remember and understand some of my children's favorite things. But that's a miserable one. I can not say I have not seen Sarah anywhere, and here and there are several performances. They were reasonable. I do not see him as a special thing. But this show is as low as I expected. Writing IMDb sang it as potential. So, just for this, I started watching the first episode. I spent her half. Something else is better. Recommended jokes at the age of 5 are presented in the program for prospective adults. Well, Sarah, these adults have moved to extinguish you. I do not believe in human fact that this insult is funded by comedy. The only good thing I can say is that many jokes here save the other shows from such embarrassment.
