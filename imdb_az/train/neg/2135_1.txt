Just throw the trash. I'm a great fan of Cusacks, this is the only reason I've watched this movie, but the only reason I can see them is their fullness, and the less accurate the depth of Grosse Point Blanc. In addition, the role of films as a political satire is obvious to even the most terrible situations there to serve any purpose. And the bill as a satirical satire would only be an open insult to chimp. Imitation is probably the highest form of flattery, but let alone leave alone and allow the Spartans to see that there is nothing close to Grosse Point Blanc, and this is a wholly worthless fear.
