12 years ago I was in the second grade. I remember it clearly. We're learning about space. All young children want to go to space? Here, after seeing it, I was afraid of death, that I would suddenly be thrown into space by psychotic robots "suddenly". I did not think this was a movie. I thought there was some news program or something. When I was confused by the "War of the Worlds" radio program, it was my own version. So recently, in order to watch this movie again, my favorite actor Joaquin Phoenix (later known as Leaf Phoenix) is performing. I can tell you that I was laughing dramatically and laughing at the game. That is, when Andy is in space, he moves slowly, did you notice that? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Little Max seeks to pull it out, suddenly shouting slowly at Max's face We're getting closer "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
