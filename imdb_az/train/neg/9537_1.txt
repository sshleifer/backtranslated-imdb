** ALLEGEDS ** I leased "Plant" (or "Quick" English) to director Alejandro Amenabar's "Others" effort. Based on the bright, measured and terribly effective drag on the film, I thought that his previous efforts would have a similar quality and some good frustration. <br /> <br /> The most delicate, pretentious excuse for a bare brain slasher, which I mentioned about her memories from the German "Anatomie" (reminded me of it). <br /> <br /> Potential but thrown within the first 20 minutes. In the film, the innocent-n-beautiful psychology pupil Angela (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper deadringer) is the subject of violence. In some cases, he took a "curse" ribbon, killing and killing a young girl in the camera to enter into much calmness. Angela and her fearsome friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked and shocked by the lane, and they decide to fall under those responsible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not justify what they want to find in the murder of a girl (they refuse to contact the police during the events, even if their lives are in danger) It's strange like Graham Norton in a room full of bird girls. There is only one relevant 'tip' (the type of camera used is detected), and it's a really weak one, and b) the first 20 minutes. The "castle" that loses its name is simply a lace of bumps, ridiculous spaces, and a sleeve of horrible, transparent and thoroughly meaningless red bottles wrapped around the working time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar knows about the stories of excitement, but he has not read a detective book in his life. The key to a good sinner is to have a large group of potential suspects and to gradually discover each other with a clever discount and more evidence before moving on to the last curve. "Potential SPOILER AHEAD" * The identity of the killer is almost instantly understood by amateur detectives and they try to make us flawless, unless they can escape from the writer's thoughts. closes your hands and says, "OK, I got it!" When it comes to any logic or motive behind the murders, there is no such success. <br /> <br /> The only thing drifted by the facility is simply diminutive, as it is a dumb, poorly written tension. some terrifying, confusing 'point' of violence in movies. I have no idea what position he is trying to do, but in a somewhat misguided, mixed psychopabble tone, to sit in a gap between the rest of the nakedness and "look at me!" The point of the film is supposedly recent home images, absolutely absurd and brave, but it does not matter if that is the case. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not believe that something would happen, and I do not believe that within two hours (at least six) The city's legend is a tantalizingly exploitable field of movies ("Videodrom"), although it is a good horror, despite the fact that the city's legend is 'snuff films' (and this, basically, all this is believed to be a kind of crime-making attempt in the world) it would not be easy to be easily accessible as a childhood! (ie, "My Little Eye") ... The facility is always down in the genre of "snuff film." At each level, this is better and embedded. For some nice lights, I'll pay 1 to 10, but that's all.
