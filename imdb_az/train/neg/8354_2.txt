Any film by Brooke Shields, Fonda, will be an anomaly and a horror. The slaughter is really bad, because she is a young, inexperienced and unmanly controlled by her co-star. Peter is bad in the Fonda, because it's good, because it's bad. After a while I liked Uleia's gold, but from above, my Lord is bad here. Not that someone else is not good. No performance (except for Henry Fonda's delightful community) is even passive. I have never seen a movie with a very bad performance. Because of the good work done in the past, in the case of Luka Askewun, the head-hunter, this is because of weak dialogue and direction. But his partner, Ted Markland, is a shameless bath. Writing is just bloody and can not be blame for the terrible things the actors have said. But they say so badly! Making and guiding is worse than on the pedestrian. Shots are stored for a long time without a dramatic cause or cut before the scene effect. This picture was worse than being imagined without a few famous names and being forgotten (and probably never done). A brilliant point: Big Canyon's cinematography is exquisite, and the beauty of this area has not been greatly improved even with large screen imax. And finally: either this is a bad version of the moon, a favorite pair of fathers' genres, or a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a forty-something and a significant icky romantic relationship among 13-year-olds. old It offers more than the past and, therefore, is extremely uncomfortable.
