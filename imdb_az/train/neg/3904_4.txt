I admit, Emma is the biggest novel written in my opinion. There may be any creature that is close to this perfection. <br /> <br /> Comparison of Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable - this version is more. <br /> <br /> <strong> Comparison of Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable. <br /> <br /> There are some good things here - Kate Berkinsale (previously we played at the Cold Impact Farm at Flora Poste, a pretty clever pair of Emma's beautiful) Emma. Raymond Coulthard is a decorative Frank Churchill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But there are a few major problems. First, Mark Strong - first of all, he does not look right for Mr Knightley. Perhaps he plays a role as a censored Viktorian panson. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of the lengths. Simply put, the movie is too short - you need to be twice as long to feel it right. <br /> <br /> Finally, most importantly, there is a quality of adaptation. Austen is an imagination of an adapter - there is already a dialogue. It should only be pruned and properly organized. Andrew Davies thinks otherwise. First, this is a very intimidating film, and Emma's last is scary. More important, Davies was forced to rewrite the end of the Bucolic Holidays. Which planet or Tom Hardy's little thing comes from? It is completely out of style and spirit of the novel. <br /> <br /> Follow the Paltrow version or watch on Kate's Cold Impact Farm.
