It's a savvy - I can not help from this flickering Australian stranger, but I think that everyone who has so far been engaged in Elektra production, praised how generous they are. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not really an admirer of comic-book-and-movie conversions, so I did not go with a lot of expectations, yet I found it hard to complicate Electra. One thing that made me most sad is that there are a lot of things in this movie that are being undefined, "huh, what does this world belong to?" or "How does this aspect of the character come from?" I hope there is no point in Daredevil that maybe some of the things to be explained. <br /> <br /> Moreover, we started with the character of the characters in this movie, the occasional moments in line with the line of story, and even about me completely romantic sub-plot. <br /> <br /> If I can give you this movie in the name of God, it is something I need. There are fantastic places you can fire, but in another way I enjoyed Elektra less. I know we have to stop our cynicism for fantasy / action movies, but almost everything is incredible or confusing in this movie (even with moving movie standards) that surprised me. <br /> Well, Hell, at least, looks good to damn Jennifer Garner.
