<br /> <br /> This film was banned in the UK at the start and was denied last November. <br /> <br /> It belongs to Playboy Playmate of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening, back and forth between Buchfellner and the smoky jungle pictures. I'm not sure what that is. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) has been kidnapped and has been abducted for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find him and his ransom. Of course, one of the theft (Antonio de Cabo) is trying to spend time efficiently, while others (Verner Pochath) jealously. <br /> <br /> The exchange of Fidyah enters Hell and Laura enters the forest. Will Peter be rescued before eating food? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think a video is nasty! Muriel Montosse is found on a boat abducted by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Death Angel). Montoss√© is very cool. Peter abandons them and remains alone to find the captured Laura. They do not see the sexual intercourse time and the danger approaching. Guts, everyone? <br /> <br /> Big fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> If you see the film, Blood, Headache, Gut, Complete Frontal, Hellfire (Aline Mess) Heart, it's fun.
