I have not decided yet that Anaconda will be replaced by the "worst movie I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you do not see frightening attitudes, low production costs, and ugly camera work, this movie is absolutely nothing. Because of this. I went to see just what I was reading, and wanted to see how the complex field works in a 2 hour movie. <br /> <br /> A simple answer - they did not happen. Characters appear without any explanation of who they are, and then they can not play any role in the story. <br /> <br /> Even when the main heroes reach the true point of the film, none of them show any interest in what is happening without being groundless. <br /> <br /> I need to rewrite those books sometimes to show that it is unfair to be aware of the movies and the adapted book. But I had to spend most of the house to explain what had happened after leaving my friends and movies. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> The film is a real blend from the start to the end. <br /> <br /> The film has a real blend from beginning to end.
