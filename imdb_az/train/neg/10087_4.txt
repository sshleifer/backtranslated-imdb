This is probably the first entry in the Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat detective series; <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all well-known actors performed) gather in an old house (rainy place). <br /> <br /> You need to talk to a rich brother in the coma. <br /> <br /> While waiting for his recovery, there are a few criminal offenses, including mysterious things. br /> <br /> A creepy movie; worth seeing!
