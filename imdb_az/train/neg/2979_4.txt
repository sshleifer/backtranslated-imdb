"Going to the Wind" is one of the most stunning films in history. Every five years, the movie is a favorite movie by mothers, grandparents and gatekeepers. As a zombie movie, it's a blow. There is no body that can not be seen and it creates light in this strange part. On the other hand, "Zombie 3" is so great that it is too generous to curl corpses and bloodshed - so it is better to "walk in the wind." This is also very valuable. Most of the reviewers do not delve into the fact that they are no trash. But the trash can not be trash. Once a terrorist stole a virus, he falls into a helicopter, followed by chemicals. A malicious, confused terrorist hides in a room where a slowly-worn zombie is in a room. One of his first victims is a pure lady. When it was over, Lucio Fulci's hell was empty. As a usual Fulci flick is a moving actor, punctuated by storytelling and much more. The film is directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, and therefore explains many schizophrenic nature. Very poorly shot, poorly adjusted and sound design is straightforward. Nevertheless, he survives the prideful loyalty of the murder to the most strange and impatient pace. You need to collect when you have an undead. Or, "The North winds" is undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
