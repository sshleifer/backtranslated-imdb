Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee-pee-pee is perhaps the most esteemed European Marxist director and on the planet as I want to call him (because of his love for showing genitals). How can anyone see "art" in this dirty, "cheap sex-romp" concept? Some "stories" could have been made from a soft-core porn movie here, and I'm not a nudity but a simple and simple, often-meaningless story. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes this relatively unexpected but stubborn stranger must really leave his teeth in the German 70th film, Der Schulmaedchenreport, a soft porn, because "Decameron" looks like me. <br /> <br /> In addition, <br /> <br /> Edit. One example: 1 hour: 15 minutes: There is a scene of discoveries, which is quite open to the wrong place for 45 seconds. A minute later, approximately approximately roughly approximately approximately approximately approximately approximately approximately a week later had to be deployed. But I think that Pasolini should hire angry editors who have little time for the "subtle details" of filmmaking. The fans of Pee-pee-pee, probably saying deliberately, were opposed to it - I am very skeptical. However, even if it is true, it would be even worse, because this story can not do anything without difficulty. (This is not exactly Eraserhead or Tarantino's broken film) <br /> 2. Actor. Vey is flattering. The fans of Triple Pee (8 of them) proudly declare that they are using the 3P-O "actor instead of reality". Other actors have used and succeeded in amateurs (Alan Parker or De Niro), so PPP lovers in their movies are terrifying? The answer once again creates confusion. Pasolini keeps everything up, and he tries to get as far as possible to teeth lovers. If you want it, he's a lazy director, an IMperfectionist. Anti-Kubrick, I think ... Pime-pee-pee should be to find the teeth as many teeth (and young people who love it) as much as casting the main goal. There is a simple formula in the world of Pasolini: no teeth + strange face = realism. It's good to be teeth without them, but at least try to add at least half worthy performances of these novice neo-masters, otherwise you're an amateur artist - an amateur director in the case of Pasolini. 3P-0 is not this feat or just did not care, it does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not see the terrible player?) 3. Audio. Synchronization. When making the film 3P-0, when the microphones were feeling very hard, she had to at least have worked hard on post-production; <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Lack of understanding. We are approaching many stories that have not been substantially coordinated. Some are anti-church (later on later), and some are only sex threads, that is, cheap men (and sometimes gay) designed to make fantasies, titles and nothing else. Stories and characters are at a reasonable level (at least) not fun, at the very basic level. 10-year-old kids laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with this, but then do not call it a high-tech art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of 4 points, there is no logic in the sequence of stories. Of course. The pee-pee-pee order could have been organized in another way, and we would be in the same movie. This means you can begin to eliminate and then feel free to return to the start. "Decameron" is like a spaghetti bowl: when you start eating you can begin with any topic, no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The sense of the stories is meaningless. Most stories end with cheap nudity / jokes, that is, a few dumb punchlines directly from the pornographic comic book, and some do not come to such conclusion: they simply end. Finito. At best, stories are semi-anecdotes that can be explained, unless there is a "deep" meaning of a porn, but there is any deep meaning. Of course, there is nothing, looking for "meaning" and finding it easier. Thus, any heavy porn movie can be endlessly a philosophy / thought. Easy and entertaining. Try it out, oh ye 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> As for the church's confusion, some viewers talk about the attack on Catholics and they do not. In principle, all of these are good and good - after all, I am an atheist myself, but those who do not see these are simple, but true truths that Pasolini is Marxist. It calls the teapot black. Marxist, the Church is criticized for hypocrisy and foolishness? Where does the nerves get? At the same time, Pasolini was not an atheist, so a high and mighty and self-confident position is not justified. For all this Marxists are believers: they replace only one accepted God with the idea of ​​utopia - another supernatural thoughtful fantasy. <br /> <br /> This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with a fairly ambitious way with Pasolini: "I am surprised ... What is a work of art, is it only good for a dream?" She was actually in spite of this hysterical little movie, like art, she was ...? If it were not for the poor man, then I would not be surprised at why I did not dream, and I would not shoot all these bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want to read my changed subtitles Bergman movies?
