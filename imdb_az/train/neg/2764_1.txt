First, I have no idea how this film went to the big screen. Even its low budget SCI-Fi channel is not just a movie, it's scary. My friend who loves me and action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR and so on. This movie is waiting for me in this movie dragons, a funny Transformers. It was sometimes half an hour. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the structure was so awful with the player, it was ready for that. Its actually a Chinese legged dragons returning every 500 years ... Fire Rain sounds like a good remake? No, the plot tends to be deeper than just a small real war between magic and dragons (rather large snakes), not merely, but it is simply ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor in the film that failed. All of me and all of my spouse (with 5 viewers) made every laugh, and we did not believe we were spending money on it. The short romance on television is the crap for the majority of the action. <br /> <br /> For a few hours, I have been acquainted with "B", "Reptilian", "Cave", "Spider" and others. / 10 CG: 5/10 Operation: 3/10 <br /> Drink ... but before watching this movie would be helpful
