You know the story of Hamlet. I am. <br /> Well, the phrase "Whether or not to be" (not the talk itself) has been beaten many times many times, which is not very interesting (in fact, it will start with). In fact, I find Hamlet a good but very valuable game. Shakespeare is not the best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better than "A Night Night" and "Othello". "Macbeth (shoot your desk, pull off your boots, fix the glass, OW!)" Not bad. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <strong >> OK. . . Mike and Bots get a card game, pick up the movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them, remember to remember. . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K's most boring Sci-Fi episode is prepared (no doubt, I have never seen CC). <br /> <br /> The episode of Dr. Z blood is terrible because it is not really a movie, but random, interconnected scenes (reminiscent of Mike's line from the "Future War": "Maybe it's a short , the anthology of insufficient films "), SOL Crew was a very good good cracks. <br /> <br /> Rips are flat, the hosts are the best mediocre, and the movie itself (which is not bad) is really BETTER (ie, not as a movie better than the MST3K version, Prince "), you know that the show should be bad. I laughed (last few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and ENTER to try and VIDEO - but I just can not. Only a line of "Hail Queen Dilbert's boss"! (and when the episode is the most fun line, well, ahem) - and sometimes I say every ten minutes - maybe not giggle me. The second time I watched her, I did not laugh at some jokes that were funny before, and just forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The film was not afraid; Hamlet is the only German version. Actors are good enough and dubbing is not the biggest, though there's no reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for Hamlet; THREE, THREE, for MST3K version. <br /> <br /> WHY WHY, WHY MST3K!
