<br /> <br /> Dean cain is trying to be an actor, but fails. sfx is really bad (recurring scenes and rocks that look like falling paper) and flammable plastic weapons shot on them ... The split screen effect used to show a lot of happening at once is just terrible. <br /> <br /> This film can not be used as one of the night's entertainment,
