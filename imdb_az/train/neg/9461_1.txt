The cat in the hat is a slap in the face movie. Mike Myers is not as funny as the Cat in the Hat, and Mike Myers could not have been worse. It was his worst movie.

Perhaps, Baby Genius has never seen a worse movie than that. But this movie is too bad, and I can not even describe how bad this film is. Bo Welch must be dismissed or be a writer. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (pbuh) said:
