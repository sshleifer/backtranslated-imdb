People who remember this show can even be bare ... But I remembered it as a live act. I do not think I'm seeing a cartoon. is not a movie? can be. I remember it very clearly. The boy was in a building like a showroom. He was even a red jacket. It was dark and turned into a red car and looked at it at the second level. The car's boy was bent around and crossed the street through a large showroom-type window. And then he continued on his way. I remember all this. I really remember that there was someone else. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I'm not hoping.
