In short, the film had some weaknesses and some rarity and pacing, some of which were compulsory, had the fourth and the 3rd act ... There was indeed a 3rd move! <br /> <br /> As for the third actor, the film is about to end. There is no solution and no way from the summit of the 2nd movement, so there is no third movement. The bad guys will die and that's it; end credits. The protagonist and supporting characters and so on. There is nothing to show what will happen with it. The audience was separated from the theater after the movie, and "is that so?" They ask. <br /> <br /> David Bell, who worked hard enough to serve music in most of the time, was, of course, not something remarkable. It is only functional, but it is provided by generic and derivative. Calculated using some synthesized timpani for percussion. About the score, I was very disappointed that some moments of the musical cues of the tension anarchy sounded like the "48 HRS" away from James Horner. and "Commando", especially rice. In general, the main story of the film is good, but the proceedings were interrupted by moderate, weak functioning and slightly hesitant pacing. <br /> <br /> It was almost impossible to finish the story properly and because of the fact that the film did not allow it to end, these mistakes were great and unforgivable. This could either be a scenario, or maybe to cut off the production or editing of the 3rd movie due to the production limitations of the production (but I speculate that there is no Act 3). Whatever happens, the sudden finish film is hurting. <br /> <br /> This is interesting and you can get the movie very cheap, but you need to have 3 moves (start, mid, end) to study the cause. <br /> <br /> If you write a scenario and shoot a movie <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you do not want to spend the time to get the MST3K version at least some of the laughs.
