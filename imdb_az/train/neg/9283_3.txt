I do not know if this movie has received very positive reviews on this site! I'm a great vonnegut fan and I've taken this Showtime original movie, but if it were not for me, poorly moving, Very bad casting (around Sean Astin's bright, athletic and personality), Harrison? This guy is totally common!) And the lower standard writing this tripe can almost be viewed. Someone showed Maculay Culkin's line of passion. When you think of it and you think it's a comic brightness (sadly, it's probably the most funny part of the movie), maybe you like this movie. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or you're completely crazy, do not see it. Please.
