The problem is the role of characters in the film. Man-Man finds that a British anthropologist has been kidnapped and taken to Scotland, and that he is not equal to animals and subhumanship but equals himself. The role of the pigment in the movie is that of two people who are kidnapped, treated as animals, and still have a stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapping (British anthropologist) manages to deal with pygmies ... How the two hostages feel, it's an idea that does not come from the point of shortage ... I see it as a one-sided racist view ... it is never able to move away from the "white man"
