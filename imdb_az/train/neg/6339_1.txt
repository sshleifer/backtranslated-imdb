David Prior's films are all terrible: bad writing, bad behavior, poor cinematography, no budget (director's brother is usually shot as a male belt). But their unwanted desires have incredible entertainment values. Almost every David Prior is a "movie" area (I do not want to address it). Manly to blow up all American commandos team communist baddies. Unlike the other Cold War era, like the Red Dawn, previous films are actually funny because they are superficial and functional. The best part of Jungle Assault is Becker's (or other friend?) Scene called by General Mitchell for a secret mission in South America. The film's most spectacular line is then given, "This is my guest room, I've been teaching him well." YES. Have you taught your living room? And, of course, this will be a solution to avoiding evacuation. <br /> <br /> If you find these stones in a video used anywhere, DO NOT ADD THIS. After a few beers are all funny and even funnier. See a group of friends for the true MST3K-style experience. So far, my friends and I were able to capture the Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But most of all, all of them are the Final Sanction with Robert Z'darla, which looks appealing.
