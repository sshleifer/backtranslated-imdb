Originally it was not a modifier. The Nostril Picker is a poorly prepared fairy tale about a comrade called "young lover" Joe Bukowski (Carl Zschering). She could not enter into sexual contact with girls, she was throwing a tram into a special Vietnamese vocal train. This "song" includes a "London Bridge Falls" whirlwind while jumping around as an epileptic morris dancer. Nevertheless, Ugly Joe tests it and hey presto! She is now a girl. Ideally, a young man should be attracted to attract girls. <br /> <br /> This film should not be released in an ideal world released in 1983 and released in 1993. <br /> <br /> The film's asylum-seeker told the horror owner, "Ham document told the story." Worse than that. The Nostril Picker really accepts biscuits, in fact the whole jar of the god is a jar of jar. The terrible comedy dialogue brought by brain-dead gamers, a ridiculous structure and a predictable twist. Unless the only thing more absurd can get, the story reaches a specific tangibility. For example, Joe decided to kill her daughters. But did I think he wanted to be closer to them? <br /> <br /> The story of this strange movie is related to Joe taking a prostitute (a brothel). Steven Andrews) after taking his "apartment" back. He then turns against a man of faith ... Joe returns to a man and shows that he is a prostitute. How does it behave? Well, in a Benny Hill-esquire fashion, she goes to the "her" pursuit of an explosion around the apartment with a couple of "one" squirty dildo. God knows how to think about Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge. At least this scene has led to a momentous moment. This involved a male footage showing a tired scarf police officer with a two-legged joke shop 'police'. You need to see an entertaining player. <br /> <br /> Along with the above-mentioned incident, this monotonous flick was a full hole. If DVD trailers are more exciting, you know that the movie is bad. Normally, I was moving fast to the good bits, not just here. The main action sequence involved Joe simply stabbing his victims. Forget about fast cuts, Matthews (one on a stab scene) uses fadeouts so there may be any tension there. It's ridiculous for a girl not to fall into her fingers. Normally, I was shocked by the words "untouched", but in that case they were far from good. More torture torture torture. The whole film is part of Midsummer Homicides, just a little funny feeling. <br /> <br /> As a result, the Nostril voter is the most unenterious thing I've ever seen since Richard Hammond's 5 O Clock Show. Dangerous speeches worsened with an extremely quiet soundtrack and bad dubbing. Do not be fooled by the box label, this is not a cult classic, but it is not suitable for use in the use of bud-horror-dvd-coffee-cords. I think it. If it is not rebuilt for 30 minutes, this coma remains in fear.
