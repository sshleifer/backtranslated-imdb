I like British humor, and I believe one of the best in the world. I can say that every English sitkomunu love (okay ... maybe a month, not Python, some jokes are great, but I did not understand some of them), but this is a good thing to be just sick of the League of Gentlemen. The show was the best way; watching this piece of garbage I have lost some weight because it helps me to feel I'm not hungry anymore. It's really just disgusting, sick and even a television show is not funny and I laugh at this stuff really anyone. I watched for about 10 minutes and turned it on. It was very clever, the women dressed in yellow teeth and followed the car ... So I would like the people who are watching udmagı, komiksən to do about it? Makes me wanna puke. No humor, disturbing images simply and cheaply, toilet ... more laughing ... I do not know ... if you like ... to watch these things ... but to be honest, people enjoy watching and it must have some emotional problems . Rubbish.
