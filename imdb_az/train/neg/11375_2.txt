Are you talking to me? (1987) is a very bad movie starring some of my friends who have played in the neighborhood as a guy from the beginning or as an actor. There's something heavy for a taxi driver. When he learns the hard truths of life, he fulfills everyone's actions and changes his image! At night a friend goes to a friend as much as one surfing. His friend does not believe in change (but earning scores with Faith Ford and getting a perfect payout concert). <br /> <br /> This is a very difficult task to combine many times. It is an interesting idea that is poorly executed. <br /> <br /> You know, maybe someone will collect the ball, and filmmakers will run away by hitting the ball at this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> If the manufacturer did not want to see a young Bubba from Ford and Forest Gump.
