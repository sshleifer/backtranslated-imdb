I chose the film for the last time at Dubai Film Festival because it was selected as a prestigious competition at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers in the film point out that there are no gunshots - but they are accusing specific violence. Imagine being killed by your enemy / opponent in front of your young son ... forcing someone to taste spoil to prove his loyalty. <br /> <br /> In this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, appearing in Copolla's "Big Daddy", some of the contemporaries of Corleone's sons are instructed, but their quality is different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> The film is recommended for violent acts only. At best, it can be considered better than the usual Run Run Shaw for production values.
