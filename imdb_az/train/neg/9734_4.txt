A man realizes that his parents are part of a nuclear test in the 50's and now have power ... flames come! <br /> <br /> I really was directed by Big Toby Hooper, for this movie, and had to see the wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above average individual-strong-powerful movies. Spontaneous Combustion has an interesting structure behind it, unfortunately, it can never live up to its potential and extend its multi-story plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Not a classic, but its the worst kind of thing. <br /> <br /> ****
