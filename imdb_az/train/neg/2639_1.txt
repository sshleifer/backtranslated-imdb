<br /> <br /> This was one of the worst trash pieces I've ever seen since Hulk. <br /> <br /> They have warned that they have been insufficiently signed up to review the review and keep people's money back. The storyline was probably the most expected garbage that could arise. We wait 24, but wait on the big screen so wait for the toilet, along with the money you will use with a ticket at any level. You can enjoy it more. The lifestyle was terrible, the surface was completely unusual (at the end with the word "twist"). It must be said ... The last thing surprised me. I did not know that the credits were rolled up and I did not even finish it at this point until they were so flawed that they had brought together what they thought was a little worthy act in the whole film <br /> <br /> For several reasons, casting it was very terrible: first, they accidentally conducted character assignments, because Michael Douglas played CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland role. When Douglas hiding around agents, tapping the phone lines, entering the system and taking the people behind him, Sutherland was always ab even if it is not the mood. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <strong> Written by mentally handicapped people, despite the recurrence of "Illegal" / "Firefighter"
