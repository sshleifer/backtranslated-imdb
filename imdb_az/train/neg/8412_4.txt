I just saw DreamGirls yesterday and I was really underimpressed. Notwithstanding the Oscars, this is not a special thing. Everyone who is really amazed at this film is concerned about seeing any of the genuine movie classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great music and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a stylish or flawless TV movie. <br /> <br /> The first half hour was good, but Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were cut off and cut off by assemblies. These were easily the best songs and best performances. The film's "upside down" part is the only part of the movie that has a consistent look or momentum. The rest of the clock and 45 minutes were neither interesting nor realistic and how fantastic it was. <br /> <br /> Kondon, I will not make any melody a great show piece, as I expected. Everyone in the 2nd half was just as close to one another as "read" one another. Hudson's great "Love me" was a crime! Condon just stomping her around the scene - no drama! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> All this "I need to hear something Efff-ieeee!" it was necessary to stay on the floor of the editing room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Yet, except for Eddie Murphy's wonderful work, the movie was an unlucky television movie. This film should be megabucks behind the PR work! I'm Free to Prepare How much money have been spent to beat the Oscar Whale? All this movie was an Oscar caliber movie, NOWHERE NEEDED except for Eddie! (Except for Eddie), that is, with Grease 2. Sometimes after a great disappointment, especially after (much spent $ hype)!
