What else can you say about this movie that's a terrible thing. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see it, but this is their talent. Some of Adam's scenes are as missed as he can not see his face. Should we feel as though we were about to be ashamed of being in the Zombie Nightmare? If it had not been for a long time before or after, Zombie Nightmare is still classic (check the first and final version of this Mystery Science Theater 3000). This network is very boring and some of the rip-offs of The Wild One, of course, Marlon Brandon. Tina looks stunning though. I hope her and Adam have a good paycheck! Skip!
