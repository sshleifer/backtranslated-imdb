Though the three Russian aristocrats have fallen into the last francs, Monte Carlo's collapse. To support their generous lifestyle, all three use a fake service and use notes in the casino hoping to replace a counterfeit currency with a bonus. US Representative Andrew Hughes and his wife, Helen, arrived in Monaco, and three of them hoped for financial assistance, and decided to flood the visitors. Serjius Karamzin, a three-year-old, dreamed of his companion, who loved Sergius, plans to move on to Helen continuously. Finally, the conditions are against three aristocrats. Von Stroxem was trying to convey a message, not just a story, but a message that conveyed the film to me as easily as I am (American foolishness and wrong behavior of aristocrats). A good player on the Evs, such as Awakening and Wedding March, is the use of the mill here. The film could make use of improvements at different levels. Rated, 3.
