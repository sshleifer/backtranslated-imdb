When Ritchi was first screened for the first time, his films were fun, witty, well-directed and original. The first one was able to compare the transparency created by the two attempts, and the last two visits could be hateful to say that hate was not generally found - was it a ritchie? Is he really talented? Is there really a genuine idea? Or was an ambitious and selfish director who really wanted to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone into a huge and ugly pile of all? Was everything wrong after watching the Revolver? What happened to her great humor? Where did all this mix and ideas get? Revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and brief, trying to be a clever psychoanalysis, trying to be a complicated and complex tension. Ritchie is a strange effort to accomplish many of these targets, and spends a lot of scandinavian and multiple layouts on a script. But ultimately, all this is a serious discrepancy to the audience, not set up and, ultimately, a film of animosity. His plagiarism is guilty and it is clear that Ritchie should at least be punished to try to lose himself, even as he tries to give his own spin. <br /> <br /> The revolutionary is ultimately an unusual and gentle film that stole countless topics from the masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Shuspects, and Pulp. Do not make up. <br /> <br /> Revolver lambasted dignity, he is a really poor film, masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece of the wannabe auteur, is aimed at high purpose, but inevitable shoot gaps. However, this sadness falls flat and fails in everything he wants to achieve and achieve.
