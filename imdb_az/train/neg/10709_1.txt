I can not say a lot about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can not even say that you decided to see me. <br /> <br /> His wife had some sort of compulsory quality. Throughout the film, my whole body was tense, because I did not expect it to be overwhelmed by the terrible thing. Until the end of the film, I felt a sense of relief. <br /> <br /> Editing was poor, the player was sub-par, and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was raised as a native American, even though he did not resemble any American American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie film was so shaky, at least it should be a funny idiot. It was not. It was just sad.
