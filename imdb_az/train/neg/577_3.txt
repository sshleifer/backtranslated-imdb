Above all, Jon Bon Jovi does not appear in a vampire movie. Together with characters that are not interesting to each other and with a poor story, all movies can be predicted. If you take this into consideration and become a vampire movie, you can have some fun with a few scenes. Do not wait for any Tarantino style chapter and Anne Rice movie line. (I'm waiting for all the movies to be forgotten tomorrow;)
