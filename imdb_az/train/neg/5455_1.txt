I saw this workshop at a movie festival in CA. God, what did the director think? The filmmaker should use this film as an example of how he will not do a short film. First, this project is completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> The film, partly in The Waystation, takes place in some stupid vapid bars in the middle of nowhere. In fact, I think it's a comedy. Digital actress Julia Reading is one of the most amateur pornographic films. There are one or two decent performances, including children playing with Jacob and Fenner, but he does not know how to use or use his work as a director. Something worse than actor was the dialogue with the absurd. <br /> <br /> The value of world production is pretty good, but honestly, the film is a bad thing. it's not easy to look at it. The production design is pretty good, though the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. Costume and makeup are all right, and I understand that production works with a low budget. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is a terrible thing. He watched many fantastic movies like the director / writer and threw all his favorite pieces into a mixer and appeared with it. My only hope is that he used the money of others in this case because he used himself, as if he were generally.
