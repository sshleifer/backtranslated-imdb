<br /> <br /> Marlon Brandon's performance has worsened. The southern shooting was ridiculous. When I spoke as an elderly lady, I was laughing when I spoke. Brando, which was so great in previous films, was left here with a funny stock. In Tyrone Power, "Witness of Prosecution", instead of dealing with racism, Brando is here. The film should be a good actor, soldier engaged in the US government's attempt to marry US and Japanese women. Brando was faced with stones throughout the film. His transition from this mutual relationship to a partner occurs when Asia loves a woman. His emotions and talk made it hard how he could defend new ideas. <br /> <br /> Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki took Oscar to support their performances. Nothing in both performances is equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and nothing was described in his part. Better performance in this film, was made by Miiko Taka in a beautiful way that interest Brando's love. Brando's character, like the anti-American, has shown a great emotion. His face was carved out of misery on that World War 11. He was also losing his father and brother, his dance was realized that he was in his way out of this existence of living. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott went to the first Brando love affair with her mother's "ten commandments" of the bigoted motherland, Hebrew Yochobel. His performance was wasted along with Ricardo Montalban. Brandon's first love, Patricia Owens, showed his depth and confidence in his performance.
