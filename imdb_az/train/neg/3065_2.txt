This movie is the same as the original one. It's really sad, because at a deep level, the title "Vanishing Point" is original, so it's a lot of mockery. I'm sure that this is not the case, but it was originally released in 1970 and released in 1971. REAL 'VANISHING POINT' was the end of a completely era 1970s. <br /> <br /> All reconstruction elements have been abolished in this reconstruction, and most PCs are likely to be accessible to a large audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was glad to watch it, but I was more grateful to the original. An original classic and golden cult. This remake scares.
