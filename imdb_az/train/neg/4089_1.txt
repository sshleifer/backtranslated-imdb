Caution: This view is spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Unfortunately, it is still bad. I said "can say". This is nothing but a very casual scene, with a lull in a story. The heroes (I call them "hero") shoot at innocent people for their food, and for the same reasons they are born. There are also tons of homoerotism, a transformation for me. (SPOILER: It seems that others are not only topless and naked, but others miraculously rescued, but miraculously restored, 70 minutes of torture is added.) Operation has happened many times in kinematic disgust. If you are in MST3K mood, this may be awaited, but most of them can forget it. Instead, hire the original Conan DVD.
