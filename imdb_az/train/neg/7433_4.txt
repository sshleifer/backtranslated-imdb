By saying that I fell asleep in the middle, I must be completely honest, so I can not give a full idea of ​​the movie until I see it exactly. A group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are planning to send contraceptive pills from Finisham's maternity hospital. The staff of the Matron (Hattie Jacques) is working with Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Pregnant woman Ms. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her frustrated taste-to-be Mr Tidey (Kenneth Connor), including patients and their guests. He also starred as Bill Maynard's Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. This plan does not work this way because all the employees are leaving. Again, as far as I can see, almost everything is about the movie. Okay!
