This is my first movie about IMDb. After watching this movie, I had to register. I will not be able to allow this movie to be ignored. <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and me. Christopher Walken, I still hate this movie. There is one thing to do, but there is no need for scripts. The dialogue is in an unrealistic and precisely boring state, the occurrence of events, slow and sometimes arbitrary, the characters are non-sympathetic and uninteresting, and the story is foolish though it is based on a good body. This movie is part of a poo. <br /> <br /> Do not think about making money in this movie, even if it's not worth the time to watch it. Please do not see ... I beg you!
