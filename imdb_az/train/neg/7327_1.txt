Heavy morality. Writers use symbols as mouths to speak for themselves. Predict, plodding plot points (say five times faster). Britney Spears baby imitation. In this film there are all moments of special decline for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought-provoking, emotional film on a difficult subject and their views are not always black and white, and anyone who is identified as a crime is not a bad person, and especially when putting the welfare of a child for the first time can be eliminated. However, their seriousness is focused on dialogue dialogue and hesitant situations designed to trigger the reign. <strong> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Pablo's black-and-white film to join a documentary film then he says not to trust him in the same breath as he does not help them from altruism. Well, duh. And Pablo tipped it by a very tantrum for a man on a run. Christina's prosperity is so important that she runs away from jail, imprisonment, or deportation, but she is ready to pay all the risks to hurt her unless she wants to go to Mexico. Thanks. Talk above-over-permissive parenting. Third, when Pablo gives Charlie his employer telephone to Detective Parlak, he is not quite professional, especially considering his career - is he really convinced? <br /> <br /> CCH Pounder's Detective Wims would erase it with him. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list things I love. Um, I really liked it. And I liked that the stomach was called "Sexy". There is a cross-dressing, always a plus; Cross-dressing among young people, is not enough! Harry is more infinite than Cristina. But my favorite thing in the movie should be when Cristina Detective Starts Not-So-Bright. I also see something interesting, in a very small game (which I value very much), the black character is a racist. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; "> Every time the main character is miserable, as we have seen, his player does not show enough:" If you're not sure, it's upset and we've heard music to prove it. "<br /> <br /> Stylted, clich√©d dialogue is subtext difficult <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Papi, give a detailed explanation "- a shameful, generally open-minded demonstration of dead wife! (He was always the most beautiful woman ever to see the widow, she never knew) Why can not we weep over a woman like Shakespeare - ugly, humble, but his love for him <br /> <br /> The police have always followed a full sequence, many scenes, a feeling of a French The most dull foot draw - Bright and Lightning is so out-of-shape and easily fooled (he's certainly not as fast as lightning, and he's good, I need to write things down). A man who drags a small child above a bicycle police struggles with a maiko biker, but will a child be crushed? According to Margaret Cho, it is very sad. <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and Extremely High-level Business Machines: As an employer, you would actually abandon his green card because he could quote from the writer. <br /> <br /> Moreover, many scenes, including several of the above-mentioned scenes, threaten to be exposed to pornography: "Well, I will do this for you, me ..." I can say that summer-chicka -Bowm-yay may be heard. <br /> <br /> Paradoxes feel the most emotional film of the sad mother when Pablo's regrettable shooting shot, but unfortunately, it is diminished by the trembling appearances of her emotional outburst before the ballistic departure. <br /> <br /> I do everything for the sequence of things I do: I keep visiting a store without a mask, the tomb of the deceased, and why her mother recognizes her when she sees her <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features, Detective Lightning, who is suspicious, knows really little about the secret that the Detective should have a shiny Scorpio. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, after Pablo's death - why wait, why now? His character is contradictory to Soid. What does he say because he has to shoot it because he says, "Stop or throw it"? (He has paid attention to everything he has done so far). He was unarmed. There was no need for death power. Finally, the recognition of Cristina's mother died. Knight's daughter has been forced to win peace since her death. Cristina's new family of children who were killed by the family ... I was surprised that she could be a "substitute" for her little girl. It is not realistic for a white couple to take the girl's daughter in the latino girl. I say that generous, loving people would do it. <br /> <br /> According to some information, it has become one of many countries. <br /> <br /> <strong> Happy scenes. <br /> <br /> The joint writer, co-director, co-star Nebot himself says that she has worn many hats this production. <br /> <br /> As a result, the title of this movie is related to less story and more. regret, feeling of despair, and loss of accompanying promise is something that you do not see again.
