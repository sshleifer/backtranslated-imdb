The eight film I've watched is also the most bizarre; The interesting area (such as this) is very greedy for the start of the height of 84 minutes, but at least a little bit frightened when it comes to walking! The ordinary female vampire is held captive in a remote chateau (underwent slightly covered by the title) and is a 'feast' in the blood of willing victims (probably members of a suicide club). I did not know where it would be, the writer-director finally got into the human soul? the kinky father of a really humble face hero? a ridiculous future emerged as a mutant! The atmosphere such as the fresh velocity and the sleep (cults, wearing hats and mask to hide their features from a coated girl) are, of course, the curtain of the nubile beauty, as in the film-maker (for the reception of the sea area on the opposite peak), as in the Euro-Cult style also shown. Personally, the characteristic actor Bernard Musson (six days later seen in Luis Bunuel's movies) was unhappy with his most charming, but most unpleasant thing about intellectual vacuous work!
