<br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently charged with blaming his spouse and writing a few days ago at L. Lambada's Diamond Phillip's 1990 mark on a satirical serial killer yuppie hell fest. can give time in prison. I hope only one of the guilty tricks of this film is its burglar pad roof with interior design by its police detective, a $ 4500 designer dress, $ 7300 designer silk costume and $ 3500 / month Los Angeles Mies van Der Roeh . 2) Leading Ms. Tracey Phillips has a beautiful pink skin with bright red hair and beautiful lights that appear even simpler when it's mussed In the second half of the film, when preparing to prepare for the Devil, a designer silk pants that are over-wearing. At least in 1970, our genie was devastated before sacrificing their devils, although there was something to be left to imagine. The last 10 minutes of the movie, I think, his hearts are likely to look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional Psychologists living in Los Angeles at a Mullholland Drive, decided that Brad Pitt would make it worse in Los Angeles. In fact, the condominium used in this film seems to be the same as seen by David Lynch at MULLOLOLA DR, at least in a good sense to make condoms a successful movie director. The only professional psychology I encountered outside of this film is those who are currently imprisoned for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forget his name, but the murderer in this movie is beautiful and his "How is it going?" Buddy Boy? line "RIDE, thank you for LADY!" From CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) There is a great source of explosion in a huge firefighter, while Zippo throws a burning in one of the big metropolitan cities, burning inside a huge firepipe. Although the danger of smoking around the water is dangerous, no signs of smoking are squeezed on them. And the Zippo lighters can absorb the clothes that are often leaked and can be stuffed by hand, a $ 7300 Gucci silk suit hits me as a more balanced idea in your pocket. > <br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are effective at least to say the least fun thing about watching, you do not see special computer-assisted effects, but it will endanger your life and life. 7) Film Satanists are always amazed at this: Some Luciferans have to do something useful for power and instead use it as a means of enriching itself and engaging in free sex relationships with fashion models instead of having bags of women and taking them out of their homes. It is a man who can not fly here, to fly and to be inside other people's bodies - and still keeps starring Lou Diamond Phillips with an ordinary fight at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A part of life, <br /> <br /> 4/10. <br /> <br /> 4/10
