Now I am not a film critic, but I really hate September 11. This film was generally bad. Except for Alejandro González Ýñarritu, short films about the subject were the most boring and worst of all. My worst feeling was Youssef Chahine's ambitious segment. He compared suicide bombing to American soldiers and thought that suicide bombers were fighting for a bigger cause. The sector was entirely connected, and as Chahine's lack of merit had shown, I did not lose my time and patience. The idea to get eleven different filmmakers from different countries was good on the paper, but in practice, it was tasteless to shoot a film that reflected their views on disaster.
