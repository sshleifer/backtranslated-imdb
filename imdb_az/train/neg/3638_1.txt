The film (Francophone) reflects unresolved problems with the colonial heritage of Africa through the unfortunate and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman representing France (symbolically represented in this country). This is a difficult portrait of a young woman's desire to meet a traumatic moment in the past and the desire to reach 'another' to master and mold one nation. It is reflected in the way in which the journey (or transit) is entirely centered from concept to the past so far; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> France is a sophisticated French society of modern French society and is intended to be a remarkable impression, as it seems to be seen with a child's naivet√© still remains indifferent to his condition - in fact, looks more like a child. The rest of the Rag-tag ensemble is just unforgettable. The Black Africans say their impressive portraits, which at least stopped the old colonialists. They are a miracle looking for a world they know France never knew as blythe and the hope of a hope that Cameroon will never find is dark and moribund background.
