A beautiful cast of good script. More or more adults are merged into a summer camp, where they participate as minors. Is it a million years a year? It's just a fantasy and it's a bit boring. Do teenagers get back again? Do they play their games, games, good times? They can try, but they are ultimately answered: No. Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How can everyone enjoy this action? I would like to love this movie; I tried to love this movie, but my brain refused.
