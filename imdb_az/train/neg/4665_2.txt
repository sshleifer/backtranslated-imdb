I would like to love the Pillow Book. An exciting story, an interesting character of the character, is absolutely glorious, Evan Macgregor. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway was surprised by the unique presentation of the film, not to the benefit of the film. I will not even go into the terrible moves of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> From the story, with a small $ 4 billion window and a calligrapher, you draw a line covering the words of the music track that plays the role of the screen. As you can see, he did not lose the opportunity to present the true story and develop the field and walked with foo-foo decorative items that had nothing to do with it. "Grandma loves me!" A little bit like introducing a portrait of a John Singer Sargeant within a cliff Hallmark. great sparkly letters. <br /> <br /> This film appears to be the director's auteur's ego victim - it can be awkward and terrible. In the hands of another director (Jeunet Coppola?) Could be a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, the best attractive craft lessons are also very serious.
