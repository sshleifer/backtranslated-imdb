This movie is not as terrifying as Sci-Fi Channel films. I'm used to seeing special effects like black CGI blobs and as a fake blood that proves that blood strawberry syrup or other type of syrup is very different. But I thought I'd see all the possible pounds shot by the Sci-Fi channel. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Think of a hand in a mysterious rubber stocking with syrup? This movie has the main Alien Vampires. You see your fingers in rubber socks puppets. A vampire in the Vampire Hunter team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did foreign vampires learn Transylvanian? Is not Transylvania in Romania? So do not they speak of Romania? Why does a small town have its own language? When you can move the Gag reflex and move the rubber socks to the fingers, you can move inside the head of the foreigners; then you need to deal with other alien vampires. There are "Leatherfaces" who want to wear their faces. Then there are just those straight outrageous ones that appear all over the face scars. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think of all the treacherous, then you can sabotage Defense Systems, who are traitors of human traffickers and cosmic colonizers; the above are comic and laughable; they must deal with the third degree of network television, forming stereotypic furious heroes fighting. What is it that every Sci-Fi Channel is forced to use frustrating, corrosive, raw, or simply non-sympathetic devices? I was hoping for the rubber boots I spoke.
