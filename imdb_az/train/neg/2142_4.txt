If you are under 6 or under 7, you really love this movie. My youngest daughter is tied to the TV while watching her. As an adult, I can not stand it! When I'm a good story to my spouse .... But this is not close to any standard. Why do all the kids forgive them after the movie, but why do you understand children who love their children very much? <br /> <br /> I gave this movie because I'm only 10 of my 10's oldest fun.
