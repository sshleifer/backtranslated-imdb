Everyone who has given this movie must have a clear view of creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. It's a powerful move, the scene will laugh at the general sound, the direction is that everyone is gentle and surprising, and the teacher is not really attractive (more concerned about the pupil's obvious advancements). The minds generated by this garbage must be dispersed and disseminated to prevent the future appearance of these accumulated defects. I am convinced that many hungry children in Africa could use the money involved in this project. Hell, these funds would also have a clearer goal of increasing the deficit; at least one would have some kind of entertainment. For only one reason, I'm not giving a terminal to me, I'll give this movie to each other.
