Unfortunately, ups are more downs. The area was pretty decent. That is, there was a story, unlike ordinary things, unlike any other modern horror. The other good thing was the castle. <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, I think the film will be exciting after the first 40s. minutes and so on. The rest were extremely boring. Another low (or you can think a bit later if you like) is excessive nudity. All four girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the children had told themselves for a long time. <br /> <br /> I'm not against nakedness, even though you're bothered by nakedness when you're not too lenient to take some of the boy's swimsuit. See if a girl gets naked for a few minutes or no reason, or Debbie Rochon is a die-hard fan, this is not your movie. But if you're looking for a good movie movie, stay away.
