It's a murder movie. Two demented young women are deceived and tortured by middle-aged people. There is not much to say about a plot or a "spoiler". I understand that the end is almost the most embarrassing part. Most of the film, Locke and Camp, are obnoxiously bold, while everyone welcomes the psychologist in the camera. Add a repeatable soundtrack to this, including a vowel song about the "old-fashioned grandpa" that shows the subtle quality that the viewer does not really see. Music is primarily nervous, and then exposes the audience to a worse torture than is shown on the screen. The theme here is an amok which is understood as a reaction to the '60s', but less imaginable or stylized. Avoid!
