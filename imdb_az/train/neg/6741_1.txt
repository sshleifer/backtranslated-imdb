Seriously, I'm not all for romantic romantic comedies and I can easily go to Miss Congeniality like Goodfellas ... but what's this movie? This does not make any sense !!!! I do not even speak without regardless of the type of unbelief. Why is his family living in England? Or, at least, why not an English accent? She is confident in her father and is surprisingly forgiving, who has not been around for the last two years. (In this regard, no one will do nothing because it has not gone so long). What's your ups and downs at the Bachelorette party? Even with a better movie structure, he may have fallen in love with him, so I'm not going to escort him. I simply say that characters, structures and ammunition are not sufficiently conquered to make a direct story. Oh, and worst part, in my opinion, is the consistent use of the director's most hateful things in Deborah Messing's Nose - if I were, I would sue the movie! I do not mean, I'm honest, I'm all right to be a woman, but why did not I see how incredibly strange it was for seven years of loyalty and Grace? Oh! Because those producers are good for him! This movie, like my least favorite movie, is the fault of filmmakers, not like actors, like Armageddon. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever had, Messing and McDermott, in this role, can be seen by a better writer, producer, and producer. I'm just glad that I owe my friend's DVDs, so I'm frustrated. There was a way to make this review ZERO stars, I would do it.
