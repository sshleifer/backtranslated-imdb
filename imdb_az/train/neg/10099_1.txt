Thank God! I did not rent my money, but I downloaded it! This is like the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, vision effects, unnecessary eyes and nudity! Unlike other Zombie movies, such as Sleeping Night and others. The film has many loop holes and mistakes. OK, see the director's (Ulli Lommel) profile if you have time after reading this comment. After seeing it, I saw that the film was self-explanatory, and I would like to say that every film directed by Ulli Lommel has a rating of 1 and 2, and I do not want to see what films they manage to do, but all of them end up with a powerful word. Please do not use this movie even if it's fun or time-consuming or overly boring.
