After watching Borat 82 minutes, I went to this movie and was very disappointed. I've been a great fan of Wallace and Gromit, and I went to see regular cartoons. They said that I squeezed myself and went to some point, but I was expecting this movie to be better. It never happened. The visions are stunning and soundwork, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I myself had been bulbous-headed lizard villain Gandalf and Magneto). This movie is one of my animated features for the problem ADD-set. In fact, as a poisonous slapstick rule, he then dropped down with a cucumbering device that produced each stop with an attempt to deliver "an important message". It looks a lot like Oscar Bait for drowning in the animated category, and I think through the way of thinking with critics, the Academy gets the wrong and offers hardware, I'm not astonished. But if you are looking for a nice animated characteristic of rats, get advice and wait for Ratatouille.
