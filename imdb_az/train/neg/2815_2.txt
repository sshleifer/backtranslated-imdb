The weak Robert Englund is on another account of a flop and is usually accounted for by Tobe Hooper, who is a pretty good horror movie, but it's also pretty bad. Englund plays well-known Marque De Sade, who suffered in the 17th century and punished others for their pain and taste, so that they could be in pain. The story is so confusing with a flip flop other than a century, and I'm wondering what the purpose of this film is and what happened. I saw that a young lady who was captivated by a strange lesbian who was surprised and killed by the Arabs and then found the steps out of Englund to earn money. from one century to another, and claimed to be a Sade-generation, because he was reminded of Madam Momoselle (mistakenly written) or anyone at the top of the De Sades wall. The film was terrible, and I was surprised at Hooper for Englund's recruitment, and the special effects were very fake and ridiculous, especially about the eyes. Englund once tries to get back from the Stroke movement from "Science St. Nightmare". using these boots and shoulders to extinguish the eyes of people. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
