This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The operation is poor and the story is almost unclear. Do not you want light or any ship do not want it to be? As for special effects, there is no movie. The whole movie group was probably not in a studio, but on a boat on the rough seas, and when some of them were "stabbed" (even you can say), their reactions are completely unreal. The guns are quieter than silence. There are two prizes in this film, which puts serious questions into the state of human mind. Well, that's about it. This review is more fun than reading a movie. If someone is considering watching or buying it, then I will give you serious counsel for obvious reasons. I said that included a spoiler. It is an event where some people are stabbed and fired. I guess they're just the best part of the movie.
