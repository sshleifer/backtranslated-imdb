This movie is very bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! - It is difficult to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or the next. "Love's Brother" (Italian among immigrants in Australia) has nothing to do with Italian culture, and Italians and Italian films also speak ENGLISH. The film's message - ugly people should marry ugly people, beautiful people should marry nice people - really worried. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in films such as "Suburbia" or "Missing in Translation", but it is difficult to emphasize his lying Italy here. Watch this movie at your own risk. You can trash as rubbish!
