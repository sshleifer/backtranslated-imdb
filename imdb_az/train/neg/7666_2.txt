I usually begin by relying on the premiere of the movie, but before making any hasty decision I've ever considered, say that I'm the one who loves most movies (check my other reviews first). In the dark, only one film, directed by Uwe Boll, was filmed at the beginning of this film, The House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was a movie adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated him. Yes, I liked it. I even gave him 10! <br /> <br /> This will close several readers immediately. This is my idea, even if I'm afraid of Him, should be wrong with it. <br /> Trying to make a space for this movie is as simple as trying to balance the budget of the United States, but everything is going on here. Some archaeologists have found some of the defeated US Indian tribes. The Indian tribe had found a means to appeal to the "second world", which is evil in nature. The bad things have cleansed them, but not before the evil world shut the door and throws the key. Later, some paranormal and especially some of these genius / government researchers decided to experiment with some children and sought to produce a hybrid of the second world. (Believe it or not - everything up to this point and then a movie prologue written to us - just read a single white-over between a black-and-white screen). There was something in the orphanage, but the government took them back, and then many people are looking for archeological traces and there are super people around and many military men are called. <br /> <br /> In fact, the exposition never stops. It is a work from Hell. There are enough ideas to fill at least 10 movies, possibly 25. But none of them are presented in a consistent way to create a good movie. Along with the Mystic captive Indian tribe and superhumanism, we can also get monsters like Alien and a werewolf, worms like worms, transforming your body into a worm like foreigners, tunnels worms, zombies, and Starship Trooper. sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing areas, a very unusual romance, cars followers, home invasions, military operations, kitchen utensils. . . Wait, I do not remember the latter being in the movie. At Fangoria # 240, the more bizarre? "Producer Shaw Williamson said," We spend a lot of time on this subject very careful. " Tara Reid called Karan "Alone" as "smart film". <br /> <br /> Do not cheat me. Moreover, many things can be yummy for a potential audience for this movie, but the problem is not the smallest deal. I usually did not know what any setting is about another structure, why we are there, or what everyone is doing (at least every stage begins). The regulation Uwe Boll had ideas of 250 in a hat and pulled them out as lottery numbers, and there is only one random error in the settings and clich√©s. At that time, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film using the dice, and then he threw it back and drew it back. Sometimes the film is played as a long filmmaker (a combination of short, varied, incompatible scenes), but maybe it is very generous. I do not know if Boll had her job, she would come to work. <br /> <br /> I love most actors and most speeches as I have at least the least of the movies. It's rare to say that your performance is bad. Tara Reid was bad here - I'm also usually a fan of Reid. I do not know what happened. For a large part of the film, just move it around the set as a bunch. They can only have an explosive puppet. They can use them for fortresses and cemeteries for some cgi ghosts and vampires that would save money. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this dialogue, perhaps, after seeing the torn agenda of his talk, they chose to act as a creeping tree around him. <br /> <br /> Many people, Dark, play Godzilla without Allahzilla. With it, that is, many lies-scientific chestnuts. At least in Godzilla films, there is an initiative for knowing how ridiculous it is and we have a great deal of money to see a gigantic stick with radioactive death signs that killed Godzilla and fired from his eyes or something. <br /> <br /> Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, and it's hard to say anything other than just filing and filing allegations against agents. Although Slater sees at least the cigar, I can not say that everyone in the movie thought it was a decent performance. <br /> <br /> I think it's too unpopular for me. <br /> Yet, I did not give this movie. 1. Although Boll and Schwadel were dismissed, there were some authorized cinematography. The last credit was good. Heck, even the novelette prologue is not so bad. Actually, I thought that the movie was promising at that point. But this can be the worst movie I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.
