Finally, I was waiting for INCUBUS after waiting for something for 20 years, and this time it was not worth it to look good. INCUBUS is definitely a terrifying movie: the invisible killer / wolf catches and kills women in a small city. <br /> <br /> The film is as follows: film opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; more bala blah blah; proceed with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah etc .. The film can be completely predicted from beginning to end. The cunning "big" red siren used throughout the film was also unthinkable when it was five years old. And when I looked at the character of the incubus, I understood the character, so when the "shocking" surprise came to an end, I was shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny when I saw the movie in the jump days. It's so ridiculous! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is one of the few moments in which the "rock band" is one of the few in this little gesture. It's good, but it's not because it's so unpleasant because it's ridiculous and meaningless - a big screen movie, a man with red leather trousers, a fake long hair cut, a girl who was attacked by the incubus in the toilet edited by scenes. The best thing I can say about this movie is really kinematography. However, there is almost nothing for INCUBUS to celebrate, whether it is funny or not.
