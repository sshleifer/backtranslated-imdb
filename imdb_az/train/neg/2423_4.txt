I bought this movie from a special collector and I was very interested in it. IMDb had 7.8 (only 9 votes) and some foreign comments were pleasant. But I have to say that this is a very common and unobtrusive gilo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but I was never disappointed. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <strong>. And you can see some smaller cats. <br /> <br /> I will not love this movie (or strange, surreal, malevolent, gory, atmospheric, brutal). good directorship and adjustments, latest releases that make the movie fun. But it could be better.
