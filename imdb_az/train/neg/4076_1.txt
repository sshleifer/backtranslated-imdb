This theme deserves a better script and the final result is for this movie. The scenario is not a story, but rather a symbol of one another's confusing scenarios. There are many holes and gaps in the story line. It is odd that when the kidnapped victim's parents were not dead and that he was looking for them since the day he was pulled off. Written as a cathartic therapy memoir with the head of a refugee refugee who was "missing poster" from the age of eight. In the real world, the head of a shelter for escape would be a call from the police immediately after finding that there was a kidnapping of a man under the roof. This is not a 12-minute segment for Oprah, but a law enforcement issue. Everything from here to the end is so short that only the first 90 minutes are pure pure use. Funny, this is the film's condemnation. The result is like a merger.
