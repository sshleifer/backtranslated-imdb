When you get your hands on an English movie, we look forward to some sort of quality. And while operating, camera work, lighting, and so on. This is a movie business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. Only a single half hour can bring you comfort. However, when you look at the professional level, you will not really find anything. Apart from the fact that you feel good and keeps medication freedom, there is really nothing there. The scenario is mediocre, the plot is predictable and must be one of the worst eastern ends of Hollywood. All this is English intolerance, a shameful and brutal attempt to make only one "Full Monty". Why did they shoot this movie? Of course, I do not have the money to earn money.
