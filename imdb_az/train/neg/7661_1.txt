The name of the worst movie of all time is quickly and often given. Often, the truth is exaggerated, but I'd like to send Alone in the universe to a short list of real candidates: Plan 9, Adventures of Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> While watching the 90-minute lathe, it was hard to laugh at the movie, even though I found it hard to stay awake. But I felt alone in the dark (I try to avoid it, but I could not resist it). Mike looked around at Nelson and his two robot friends looking to see them. Unfortunately, my friends and I have to give a comedy throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So, about the film itself. It's the only positive part of the movie that lets you talk about activities and impacts. In the film, there are bad creatures that cross between Xenos and the Aliens (even the Xenos) and the creatures living on Pitch Black. It can be accidentally invisible (and I'm sure it is accidental) and can damage the light. There are also small cantible creatures that are used to control people who have turned them into something similar to a zombie. All of these events took place in 1997, with outdated special effects. Event scenes are chaotic and impossible to watch. People are an empty bunch of monsters by accidentally firing in the blue screen stage or inserted into the post. <br /> <br /> And these were high points. The Tshirt is a dark-haired beater, wrapping around a paranormal investigator (Slater) with a strange look in the story, with a ditch coat and does not shave for 2 days. Archeologist (Reid) is very weak. And the lines are a state agent that covers the command of wrap (Dorff). Three of them should be embarrassed in their speeches (they have not really done a good job) and casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should have been lovers in the movie I thought. <br /> <br /> This movie has the most inadequate love scenes I've seen between the two films. Undoubtedly, logical parts are not silent, not interesting. The rest are the best. Land holes can contain collective aggregates of three stars. The film begins with a voice that tells the story and the story. This boot lasts for over a minute and now the watcher knows that something terrible is something. This opening story is repeated in the fashion dialogue with adnausem, with the rest of the film, in a very difficult and difficult way. And the last one did not mean unison. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the direction of Uwe Boll. Bribe, he said all this. Uses camera shake to simulate usage. Lack of focus with actors. Just watch Reid on scenes that are not at the center of the shooting center. Special effects for bullet time effects full wastage of money. Finally, he decided to use the voice to explain something painful to the audience. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this exhibition at the second run theater. And laughs to me and my friends every quarter, I advise people not to pay more for this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> You are ashamed of Tara Reid. Christian Slater, who betrayed you. You are ashamed of Stephen Dorff. Embarrass anyone with this movie.
