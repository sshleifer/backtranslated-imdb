To be honest I am surprised by the positive sound of this movie. The film is only dragged through its life of 81 minutes, and the audience must suffer all the way. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. He is given a very miserable dialogue and he works very well. On the other hand, Scott Valentine (Connection with Merridet's Wife's Family) is a pretty rough hour. I believe the person who puts the tummy chummies on the beach at the peak of his performance will be witness to the beach .... give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a thrilling and terrible description of a painful vampire that escapes our day (see Denice Duff in Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4 to see a more convincing definition of tuberculosis vampire). The film is moving too slowly and is only positively damaged and it's Charlie Spradling's dance scenes to be honest. This movie can be honestly recommended only to Charlie Spradling's heroes lovers (this is a strange time I and I have yet to follow!).
