<br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you will probably be dissatisfied with the finish. <br /> <br /> I did not know who the root was in the movie, Taye Diggs was revived as a detective, but the rest of the characters seemed dim and unpleasant. <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was a beautiful girl, we really did not see the opening of the evidence and the bringing to justice. The point is that she was as strange as the other girls, and she chose a sweet girl from the opportunistic coconut cube. I do not understand the moral message of this film, it does not work as a detective story and thriller.
