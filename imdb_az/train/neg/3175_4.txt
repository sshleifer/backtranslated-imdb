"So this bride, you see, and this sculpture falling on her wedding day dies, and then a year later her fianc√© fell in love with a beautiful psyche, she gets horny by the angry dead bride and ghost who wants to keep her boyfriend kidnapping in a beautiful psychic? , it will be cheerful! "Polite giggle. <br /> <br /> This is what Jeff Lowell, who slept in my "Body of the Dead," as he presented his concept to the stage studio at New Line Cinema. <br /> <br /> It is a great mystery that allows a small movie to shoot, shoot, and script the film. <br /> <br /> If any of the films may sound as bad as this original premise, then you have another idea. The writer is simply turning into a madman and turning it into a satirical satirical Persian. Instead, Lowell, who wants to ensure that she is a sincere, harmless and sincere romantic comedy, takes every step of the way to dull half-measures, but as if it were absurd by the superiority of the concept of tranquility. Indeed, "His Dead Body" is so discreet and delicate that it is difficult to know that Lowell thinks of going with him. In the film, virtually every set-up, joke, and eyelid are straightforward and poorly executed, and even actors are aware of the difficulty. How can one explain the semi-lifeless and improbable performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell, and Jason Biggs in different roles? <br /> <br /> I do not want to blame the actors, some of them have proved their abilities in the past in better transport (especially with Rudd). But Lowell and his studio perform several "splays".
