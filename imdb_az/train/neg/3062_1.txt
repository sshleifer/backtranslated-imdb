Someone can say something like "Baby Geniuses" with giant robot babies or with the psychedelic drug addled nightmare sequel, "Dumbo" would get the award for the worst movie for kids. You can say that, but you would be wrong. Here's what I brought to you: Santa Claus, the worst family movie ever since. <br /> <br /> Merlin excites her children from different parts of the globe, showing insipid theme songs (seriously, this is about 20 freakin 'minutes and has nothing to do with the plot), and does not get out of it (do not be afraid, Barcelona), which is the best childhood trauma. And no matter how hard it is, no matter how many different therapists, I just can not ... I can not ... then ... wheat ... laughter ... came out .... my head! <br /> <br /> Pull this mentally bending garbage as you want to prevent a hot hot whale during the hearing season. Still, if you are a gay gay who has a serious problem with extreme flu, it's something for you, so you have to give it a try. But actually, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
