The problem of the film is shot on the worst camera and the film is fuzzy and mouthful. Perhaps anyone holding the camera still could not hold it because of something to hold or something. There are too many odors and vomiting in this film. Every 20 minutes there is vomiting and therefore some bulimic or something has been given to me. It was disgusting. Then there is an annoying high pitched screaming that goes and does not stop up to ten and ten rolls. When I hit all my friends (or I do not know), I did not like it, and he goes to the van and puts bandballs. It really was a reality in a movie. How much gas can a person have to zero to win a van? They do not run out of gas for the rest of the film, because there must be many things. It was a terrible movie, and I suggest that you do not often see it all in your life.
