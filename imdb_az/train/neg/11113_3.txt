I often feel like Scrooge, I shake off the shameful films on others - or write down the picture to write off the unreasonable raves. I found this film to be nearly unwatchable, and for me it was a fast transition with just an elegant, clich√© dialogue, and even elegant, klichel musical pieces. What is unique in this film is that it is more than a substitute for a script, with no music, unusual home conditions, fantasy, some animation - a mind or an ocean of development. Individuals, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be wonderful people but carry a movie as a movie. What's really charismatic or too sexually appealing. Both are soft. I love Billy Gray, but his character is quite a celebration. The best part of the film is the beautiful suits and great body of June Haver.
