I did not expect this TV movie anymore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any TBS movie, like Antonio Sabato Jr, If it were not a good movie yet, it was disappointing. <br /> <br /> Every scene is as if one of the many movie and television shows cut off scenes from the scripts of big business confusion and said, "My job is over." <br /> <br /> Make yourself a blessing. This is the whole clich√©, all predictable, and even worse, the players are forced to appear as seriously. If you're in paranoid mood, look at the "X-Files". They manage better. Additionally, let everyone know that you're sitting alone with "Fatal Error".
