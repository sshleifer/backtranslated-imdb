It's a unique, highly predictable, and just a hundred times before, with a fun formula, with a fun way down in a fun way - a group of scientists isolated from some well-known external objects and all over the place (surprise, surprise) Antarctica! <br /> <br /> In the film, James Spader plays an almost unrecognizable supporting role (not bad for Carl Lewis, except for the non-actor), to lessen the unusual scenario. The film's speed is slow to worsen everything, there is almost no subplot, and several action series are stereotypic and not interesting. This thing went directly to DVD. Spader - This is a tremendous player when it comes to Cannes's Best Actor Award for "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and doing a great job at Stargate's innovative flicker "Stargate". <br /> <br /> What is the most remarkable thing about "Alien Hunter"? There are many elements from very great science fiction films, and there is still so much trouble and flawlessness. "The Thing" (both Howard Hawks original and John Carpenter's excellent 1982), "Contact" and "Outbreak"; 'The Andromeda Strain', 'Kubrick has a few instruction in 2001 (ie' strange black box ') and' Mission To Mars' (ie the secret message); and even "Sport" and "Aqsirli Mind" (although it does not have a crystal film, it shares a cryptology link). There are hell, even corn fields and Antarctica, and this is the latest "X Files". <br /> <br /> As a result, the bright semiconductor spaceship looks like something completely fragmented by the release of The Abyss. <br /> <br /> All this has been done before and a better job has been done. A few moderate surprises toward the end. I can say a little bit about the field, but there is no need. You can see more than half of this movie without seeing it. (10 out of 5)
