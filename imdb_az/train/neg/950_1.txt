I took this movie in manats cables. A good movie sounded like the Japanese "Green Card". I have not liked the Asian movie, but vice versa. Some of the most incredible horror movies of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a great fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. Like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two favorites), it does not have a negative impact on light hearted movies, so I would like. <br /> <br /> I think that director Steven Okazaki should be in water with Quaalude, because nobody had a personality in this movie. And, as opposed to any line or two murmurings, when you try to move one character, their performance has come as a compulsory and incredibly counterfeit. Honestly, everyone did not think that he was acting in advance ... Aoki was the only person who actually talked about. I believe that once I was promoted as a comedy, because I did not laugh at once. More surprisingly, CBS morning news has called this "comedy fresh breath". It was neither a refresh nor a comedy breath. And the latter was much predictable, the previous reviewer had to be the one to think about such things. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie until you see a horrible predictable plot line and wooden player. I really think it's a better movie than Bensonhurst Spike ... and I'm half way out of this movie!
