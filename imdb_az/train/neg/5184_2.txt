It is expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but it was disappointing at many levels. Above all, the story is so bad that it is almost unbearable. Second, the setting, action, and story are not very reliable or convincing. Third, there are better black actors to choose than these standard options. What can you say about some peculiarities? Third, the hip-hop song was played - if available. It really did not look central. In general, the film was a big disappointment, but the style of editing was very interesting and appreciated the film.
