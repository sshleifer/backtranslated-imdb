How could any journalist or critic be reminded that the other Flemish film was unique to "Congo Express (1986)"? Congo Express brings some symbols to one another without really having to do with one another: Jean (de Congolees), worker, two taxi drivers, street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels. There is no reason to pardon defects in the script (if any). The joke on the ice party in the refrigerator (only one!) Is taken from De Witte (1934), a large Flemish film that De Witte puts a lot of salt on potatoes. There are some accidents in the film, but then there is no explanation. Tom Barman offers us a movie that is more like a movie to watch more television than a movie. Flamand missed another chance for the movie.
