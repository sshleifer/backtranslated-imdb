Well ... the movie was an entertaining hour. The main issue with this film is the fact that most vampires are opposed to everything they have to do. Like vampires in the sunlight. There are only parts that make society a movie. A scene where a vampire stabbed and shouted: "It hurts ... It's really squeezed." Then, as you can see, there may be missing scenes, but after a while. And there are occasional sleep sequenes' that really does not help with the plot. I came to think of it, nothing is really logical, but I have a bunch of friends and I have watched twice to get the full effect. Let's face it, the battle scenes were magnificent, and the zombies just enjoyed watching. As I'm writing more, I love this movie slowly. But you know, all of this is not to wait for the Schindlers List, but an entertaining hour.
