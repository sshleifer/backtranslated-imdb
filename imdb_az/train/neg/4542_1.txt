I went to look at a book of "New Age", which is essentially different from the film, although it has much to do with those who know this book (though there is more than this nonsense), the film is not very good. So, if you consider yourself "morally" you can believe or at least tolerate things such as "aura" and "astral body" and do not worry about the frequent use of the word "energy" outside of the context. or if you use technology, you really love the movie, and it's probably the New Age nonsense that you can easily cope with with blasphemy and surfaces that are based on it, if you have a lower tolerance for cheese light effects, If you expect a non-chat dialogue to be a player, this is the advice for you on this movie: stay tuned. <br /> Do not even think about it. This night, this movie left the Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater (I do not count the films I'm planning to get worse like 9 and so on). At the same time, almost twice (all the D & D second) raised all of my movies. In the film, I can not even go about it, but I have to be seeing a vision for the first time because the New Age BS is thicker and thicker than this point. <br /> <br /> It is a group of people who are involved in some of the old prophecies aiming at the political awareness of spiritual enlightenment and the next step in the evolution of humanity. Or something like that. People are talking about these spiritual things that are at the next stage of evolution, and they do not believe in anyone who thinks that human evolution is awesome. The film is shocking with such a spark. Sometimes people will describe "another dimension", or perhaps "another plane," to become invisible to those around them. Goodness. In the end, the director prepares the audience to prophesy, and the "mind" is slowly preparing for them to be able to remember them and to make the films as better, more clearly employed. <br /> <br /> Do you have good things about the movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can honestly say if this movie is interesting or acceptable, it seriously affects the ability of a person to take seriously. This is indeed the most inexpensive kind of hand-cheapo spiritualism, and if you do not have anything to do, you should do something about your time and money.
