I usually use Loretta Young's early films: her work was later light and airy, and she knew how to dress. But it's less than just saying, except for a funny backing by Glenda Farrell. Young young writer-husband (Paul Lukas) is a carpet-maker who speaks as a bridge-player. <br /> <br /> It is not the most kinematics of these games, and it's a long, talkative middle part away from killing their film. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting bits. When Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk started their climactic game, a number of quick shots were frozen by airplanes, trains, football games, even diving in the middle of the event. The earliest use of an ice cream frame I've seen in an American movie. The rest of it was inventive and funny.
