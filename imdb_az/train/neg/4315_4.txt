<br /> <br /> Although the presentation itself was pretty short, it was still a bit boring. I think that looking for a new director and producer for the show is really a time to come up with something new. This year, allowing Beyoncana to perform, P. Diddy and the Prince have a category, allowing more 'hip' and more appealing to the young audience. It is also an attempt to renew and make the ceremony more attractive, even though Chris Rock is a promoter. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny man, but he was not really a good leader. I really saw it as a man who just talked every now and then in different categories. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the winners of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, it's obviously strange to allow everyone to come on the stage and at the same time giving awards to the theater. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I do not remember the more pleased the prize winners. None of the movies really broke the awards as it has been for the last few years. So, is it a good year for films with many competitors? I do not think so. I think most of the films will be forgotten over the next 20 years, with the exception of the "million dollar baby" and "passion for Christ." Of course, for every award this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel has won for the best cinematography, I do not agree, I do not like Robert Richardson's work, and though he really works with Oliver Stone, I think the Deschanel award really deserves it. I also like Jim Miller and Paul Rubell to see John D. Debney for best music and best music. But oh well, Academy Awards can make everyone happy, and I understand it. <br /> <br /> Most of the awardees are more angry than candidates and winners. Did the prince immediately name one of the candidates? Sean Pann has a humor concept? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed" <br /> <br /> Generally, a very unforgettable show, but nice winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
