Commenting on "Eliz7212-1", this program is called "head-on" for this turkey. But William Shatner is a hoot to watch the "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the "dance word" is important for Bill), this show would be a great sketch on SNL or MAD TV and won a few stars at a glance and or the "camp" has seen Shaterny appearing to move to new locations - like his or her role. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red; ">"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> < The post has gone a quarter a mile or so, thanks to good luck, the second contestant is somewhat elegant, but in Jeopardy It would be lucky to earn $ 1,000, he could not ask for a special question and zonked the card with a zilch. <br /> <br /> This plethora of the game, which is sometimes rewarded, huge amounts of money for everyday people, usually a cheap effort I believe that income will be profitable if the homeowner pays good compensation and gives the average episode six digits, since it does not have a sitcom cast that has several stars six or seven digits <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Many of these have already reached this point. His suggestions, especially with James Spader and others, should be welcomed by Bill S. Shatner's proposals. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is Bill Hoot and maybe once; is enough.
