Although Manmohan Desai made some fun, though some fun, such as AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, he made some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. This movie is one of the worst films made by him Mard Co Dard nahin hota, but the film is very bad. <br /> <br /> The British are preparing cartoons, and the film seems strange. The scene in the English hotel is cursed. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of deception as the base has attacked Amitabh, and then the whole scene and the film became worse. There are more stones like Throw statue, Amitabh haha ​​and more masks. Manmohan Desai is Bad Music is Good <br /> <br /> Amitabh is no different from the roles of COOLIE, LAAWARIS type Amrita Singh okay Satyen Kapuu is completely Prem Chopra as usual, Nirupa Roy is the usual self-esteemed Dara Singh as usual
