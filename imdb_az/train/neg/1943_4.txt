Why not? It started with an interesting mystery and interesting characters. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always a good value, and Suranne Jones had good results. The Muslim sides were very interested. <br /> <br /> But Morrissey's character was killed and all the air balloon left. The last episode was weak, boring, and boring. <br /> <br /> Some things became a very small beer, which was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Do I have 5 hours for this? My advice is to dry out the paint.
