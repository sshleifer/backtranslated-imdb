Let me really have a look at this movie. I'm watching this movie for this movie, watching for gambling scenes. Not that this film is very damned by seeing the Goddess Trace (Mandy Schaffer) and transforming my eyes into a pure disaster for a disaster catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the film has weakened me. You see a woman who asks a pond, asking if she can approach a beautiful girl and draw a picture with her in peace and quiet. When they were finished, each other did their work ... and the woman painted a VINEYARD that creates the fear of the lake. How can this kind of screwdriver make such a mistake? At another stage, Traci begins to kill the teacher's lover by sailing his pole, and then he turns away, and none of the city police doubts. HELLOOOOO mean? WHAT IS A DOWN AND WHERE? HER FINGER PRINTS ALL GOD ON DAMN BOAT! After that, when Mandy is around, it has the "cold" sound effect, which is the worst, sensational cat. This, of course, is, of course, Rosanna Arquette in this film. I feel really sorry to be a star in this super low budget soft-porn in no brainer. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, but also regrets the star in this movie. All this, 2/10.
