The rebellion of the zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but far from the list. When a Cambodian expedition is dispatched to locate the plot to create zombies after the First World War, one member decides to use the information for their evil passions. And he will at least succeed at the beginning. A love triangle complicates several stories. <br /> <br /> This was really awesome movie. The dialogue was even better, and the plot was incredible (not part of the zombie, but part of the romance). <br /> <br /> I'm not a student or specialist in cinematography, and the camera did not help the film much. <br /> <br /> Everyone has seen a few films worse. Bad, it's not a bad thing - it's a good way.
