Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his initial comeback, and this is a movie that is played for these laughs. In a dive trip, Rome finds a blonde beauty body beneath the sea, as you expect it is covered with cement. Immediately after being employed by Waldo Gronsky, the man immediately became a Roman. Rome immediately finds himself. Because he investigates some mafia types and turns tables around him and considers himself a major suspect. Now we have to continue the work and hope to solve the problem alone. Portat Sinatra tries to sell us to naked jokes and assures us that she is a good detective; she is not sexually attractive for oh and foxy Raquel Welch, but this is a failure in a smooth plate project. A glamorous attraction that surrounds each woman is quite striking, and every woman in the film is a boss-loving head, and director Douglas, of course, always makes sure that their donkeys are cracked, bent their posterior muscles. It's a ridiculously repugnant gay character who talks about what he likes, that is a movie that confirms his flagrant sexuality by "real men" for "real men", a shameful betrayal.
