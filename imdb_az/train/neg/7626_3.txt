After listening to stories about this movie for many years, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Allow rental that is free from your local library. This movement was slow, boring, unreal, and the scheme did not make any sense. Two hours later, I was preparing to leave the city of bourgeois Texas and rescued a group of characters from their suffering. I understand that the taste is subjective, but I do not understand all the consciousness I heard about this movie. Dallas, in this film, presented a detail of life in Texas in a good way. Only rent if you want to understand that film studios are paying enough money for reviewers to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
